    .  world war ii had been raging for two years .  france had fallen  the battle of britain had been fought  and the soviet union had just been invaded by nazi germany .  the bombing of pearl harbor was four months in the future .   but on that day  with europe in flames  and the evil shadow of adolf hitler apparently falling over all the world  what was chiefly on my mind was a meeting toward which i was hastening .   i was    years old  a graduate student in chemistry at columbia university  and i had been writing science fiction professionally for three years .  in that time  i had sold five stories to john campbell  editor of astounding  and the fifth story   nightfall   was about to appear in the september      issue of the magazine .  i had an appointment to see mr .  campbell to tell him the plot of a new story i was planning to write  and the catch was that i had no plot in mind  not the trace of one .   i therefore tried a device i sometimes use .  i opened a book at random and set up free association  beginning with whatever i first saw .  the book i had with me was a collection of the gilbert and sullivan plays .  i happened to open it to the picture of the fairy queen of lolanthe throwing herself at the feet of private willis .  i thought of soldiers  of military empires  of the roman empire     of a galactic empire     aha .   why shouldn t i write of the fall of the galactic empire and of the return of feudalism  written from the viewpoint of someone in the secure days of the second galactic empire .  after all  i had read gibbon s decline and fall of the roman empire not once  but twice .   i was bubbling over by the time i got to campbell s  and my enthusiasm must have been catching for campbell blazed up as i had never seen him do .  in the course of an hour we built up the notion of a vast series of connected stories that were to deal in intricate detail with the thousand year period between the first and second galactic empires .  this was to be illuminated by the science of psychohistory  which campbell and i thrashed out between us .   on august           therefore  i began the story of that interregnum and called it  foundation .   in it  i described how the psychohistorian  hari seldon  established a pair of foundations at opposite ends of the universe under such circumstances as to make sure that the forces of history would bring about the second empire after one thousand years instead of the thirty thousand that would be required otherwise .   the story was submitted on september   and  to make sure that campbell really meant what he said about a series  i ended  foundation  on a cliff hanger .  thus  it seemed to me  he would be forced to buy a second story .   however  when i started the second story  on october      i found that i had outsmarted myself .  i quickly wrote myself into an impasse  and the foundation series would have died an ignominious death had i not had a conversation with fred pohl on november    on the brooklyn bridge  as it happened  .  i don t remember what fred actually said  but  whatever it was  it pulled me out of the hole .    foundation  appeared in the may      issue of astounding and the succeeding story   bridle and saddle   in the june      issue .   after that there was only the routine trouble of writing the stories .  through the remainder of the decade  john campbell kept my nose to the grindstone and made sure he got additional foundation stories .    the big and the little  was in the august      astounding   the wedge  in the october      issue  and  dead hand  in the april      issue .   these stories were written while i was working at the navy yard in philadelphia .    on january           i began  the mule   my personal favorite among the foundation stories  and the longest yet  for it was        words .  it was printed as a two part serial  the very first serial i was ever responsible for  in the november and december      issues .  by the time the second part appeared i was in the army .   after i got out of the army  i wrote  now you see it     which appeared in the january      issue .  by this time  though  i had grown tired of the foundation stories so i tried to end them by setting up  and solving  the mystery of the location of the second foundation .  campbell would have none of that  however .  he forced me to change the ending  and made me promise i would do one more foundation story .   well  campbell was the kind of editor who could not be denied  so i wrote one more foundation story  vowing to myself that it would be the last .  i called it     and now you don t   and it appeared as a three part serial in the november       december       and january      issues of astounding .   by then  i was on the biochemistry faculty of boston university school of medicine  my first book had just been published  and i was determined to move on to new things .  i had spent eight years on the foundation  written nine stories with a total of about         words .  my total earnings for the series came to        and that seemed enough .  the foundation was over and done with  as far as i was concerned .   in       however  hardcover science fiction was just coming into existence .  i had no objection to earning a little more money by having the foundation series reprinted in book form .  i offered the series to doubleday  which had already published a science fiction novel by me  and which had contracted for another  and to little brown  but both rejected it .  in that year  though  a small publishing firm  gnome press  was beginning to be active  and it was prepared to do the foundation series as three books .   the publisher of gnome felt  however  that the series began too abruptly .  he persuaded me to write a small foundation story  one that would serve as an introductory section to the first book  so that the first part of the foundation series was the last written  .   in       the gnome press edition of foundation was published  containing the introduction and the first four stories of the series .  in       foundation and empire appeared  with the fifth and sixth stories  and in       second foundation appeared  with the seventh and eighth stories .  the three books together came to be called the foundation trilogy .   the mere fact of the existence of the trilogy pleased me  but gnome press did not have the financial clout or the publishing knowhow to get the books distributed properly  so that few copies were sold and fewer still paid me royalties .   nowadays  copies of first editions of those gnome press books sell at     a copy and up   but i still get no royalties from them .    ace books did put out paperback editions of foundation and of foundation and empire  but they changed the titles  and used cut versions .  any money that was involved was paid to gnome press and i didn t see much of that .  in the first decade of the existence of the foundation trilogy it may have earned something like       total .   and yet there was some foreign interest .  in early       timothy seldes  who was then my editor at doubleday  told me that doubleday had received a request for the portuguese rights for the foundation series and  since they weren t doubleday books  he was passing them on to me .  i sighed and said   the heck with it  tim .  i don t get royalties on those books .    seldes was horrified  and instantly set about getting the books away from gnome press so that doubleday could publish them instead .  he paid no attention to my loudly expressed fears that doubleday  would lose its shirt on them .   in august      an agreement was reached and the foundation books became doubleday property .  what s more  avon books  which had published a paperback version of second foundation  set about obtaining the rights to all three from doubleday  and put out nice editions .   from that moment on  the foundation books took off and began to earn increasing royalties .  they have sold well and steadily  both in hardcover and softcover  for two decades so far .  increasingly  the letters i received from the readers spoke of them in high praise .  they received more attention than all my other books put together .   doubleday also published an omnibus volume  the foundation trilogy  for its science fiction book club .  that omnibus volume has been continuously featured by the book club for over twenty years .   matters reached a climax in      .  the fans organizing the world science fiction convention for that year  to be held in cleveland  decided to award a hugo for the best all time series  where the series  to qualify  had to consist of at least three connected novels .  it was the first time such a category had been set up  nor has it been repeated since .  the foundation series was nominated  and i felt that was going to have to be glory enough for me  since i was sure that tolkien s  lord of the rings  would win .   it didn t .  the foundation series won  and the hugo i received for it has been sitting on my bookcase in the livingroom ever since .   in among all this litany of success  both in money and in fame  there was one annoying side effect .  readers couldn t help but notice that the books of the foundation series covered only three hundred plus years of the thousand year hiatus between empires .  that meant the foundation series  wasn t finished .   i got innumerable letters from readers who asked me to finish it  from others who demanded i finish it  and still others who threatened dire vengeance if i didn t finish it .  worse yet  various editors at doubleday over the years have pointed out that it might be wise to finish it .   it was flattering  of course  but irritating as well .  years had passed  then decades .  back in the     s  i had been in a foundation writing mood .  now i wasn t .  starting in the late     s  i had been in a more and more nonfiction writing mood .   that didn t mean i was writing no fiction at all .  in the     s and     s  in fact  i wrote two science fiction novels and a mystery novel  to say nothing of well over a hundred short stories     but about eighty percent of what i wrote was nonfiction .   one of the most indefatigable nags in the matter of finishing the foundation series was my good friend  the great science fiction writer  lester del rey .  he was constantly telling me i ought to finish the series and was just as constantly suggesting plot devices .  he even told larry ashmead  then my editor at doubleday  that if i refused to write more foundation stories  he  lester  would be willing to take on the task .   when ashmead mentioned this to me in       i began another foundation novel out of sheer desperation .  i called it  lightning rod  and managed to write fourteen pages before other tasks called me away .  the fourteen pages were put away and additional years passed .   in january       cathleen jordan  then my editor at doubleday  suggested i do  an important book     a foundation novel  perhaps .   i said   i d rather do an autobiography   and i did             words of it .   in january       doubleday apparently lost its temper .  at least  hugh o neill  then my editor there  said   betty prashker wants to see you   and marched me into her office .  she was then one of the senior editors  and a sweet and gentle person .   she wasted no time .   isaac   she said   you are going to write a novel for us and you are going to sign a contract to that effect .     betty   i said   i am already working on a big science book for doubleday and i have to revise the biographical encyclopedia for doubleday and        it can all wait   she said .   you are going to sign a contract to do a novel .  what s more  we re going to give you a         advance .    that was a stunner .  i don t like large advances .  they put me under too great an obligation .  my average advance is something like        .  why not .  it s all out of royalties .   i said   that s way too much money  betty .     no  it isn t   she said .    doubleday will lose its shirt   i said .    you keep telling us that all the time .  it won t .    i said  desperately   all right .  have the contract read that i don t get any money until i notify you in writing that i have begun the novel .     are you crazy .   she said .   you ll never start if that clause is in the contract .  you get         on signing the contract  and         on delivering a completed manuscript .     but suppose the novel is no good .     now you re being silly   she said  and she ended the conversation .   that night  pat lobrutto  the science fiction editor at doubleday called to express his pleasure .   and remember   he said   that when we say  novel  we mean  science fiction novel   not anything else .  and when we say  science fiction novel   we mean  foundation novel  and not anything else .    on february          i signed the contract  and within the week  the doubleday accounting system cranked out the check for         .   i moaned that i was not my own master anymore and hugh o neill said  cheerfully   that s right  and from now on  we re going to call every other week and say   where s the manuscript .       but they didn t .  they left me strictly alone  and never even asked for a progress report .    nearly four months passed while i took care of a vast number of things i had to do  but about the end of may  i picked up my own copy of the foundation trilogy and began reading .   i had to .  for one thing  i hadn t read the trilogy in thirty years and while i remembered the general plot  i did not remember the details .  besides  before beginning a new foundation novel i had to immerse myself in the style and atmosphere of the series .   i read it with mounting uneasiness .  i kept waiting for something to happen  and nothing ever did .  all three volumes  all the nearly quarter of a million words  consisted of thoughts and of conversations .  no action .  no physical suspense .   what was all the fuss about  then .  why did everyone want more of that stuff .      to be sure  i couldn t help but notice that i was turning the pages eagerly  and that i was upset when i finished the book  and that i wanted more  but i was the author  for goodness  sake .  you couldn t go by me .   i was on the edge of deciding it was all a terrible mistake and of insisting on giving back the money  when  quite by accident  i swear  i came across some sentences by science fiction writer and critic  james gunn  who  in connection with the foundation series  said   action and romance have little to do with the success of the trilogy     virtually all the action takes place offstage  and the romance is almost invisible     but the stories provide a detective story fascination with the permutations and reversals of ideas .    oh  well  if what was needed were  permutations and reversals of ideas   then that i could supply .  panic receded  and on june           i dug out the fourteen pages i had written more than eight years before and reread them .  they sounded good to me .  i didn t remember where i had been headed back then  but i had worked out what seemed to me to be a good ending now  and  starting page    on that day  i proceeded to work toward the new ending .   i found  to my infinite relief  that i had no trouble getting back into a  foundation mood   and  fresh from my rereading  i had foundation history at my finger tips .   there were differences  to be sure      the original stories were written for a science fiction magazine and were from       to        words long  and no more .  consequently  each book in the trilogy had at least two stories and lacked unity .  i intended to make the new book a single story .      i had a particularly good chance for development since hugh said   let the book find its own length  isaac .  we don t mind a long book .   so i planned on         words  which was nearly three times the length of  the mule   and this gave me plenty of elbow room  and i could add all sorts of little touches .      the foundation series had been written at a time when our knowledge of astronomy was primitive compared with what it is today .  i could take advantage of that and at least mention black holes  for instance .  i could also take advantage of electronic computers  which had not been invented until i was half through with the series .   the novel progressed steadily  and on january           i began final copy .  i brought the manuscript to hugh o neill in batches  and the poor fellow went half crazy since he insisted on reading it in this broken fashion .  on march           i brought in the last bit  and the very next day got the second half of the advance .   i had kept  lightning rod  as my working title all the way through  but hugh finally said   is there any way of putting  foundation  into the title  isaac .   i suggested foundations at bay  therefore  and that may be the title that will actually be used .     you will have noticed that i have said nothing about the plot of the new foundation novel .  well  naturally .  i would rather you buy and read the book .   and yet there is one thing i have to confess to you .  i generally manage to tie up all the loose ends into one neat little bow knot at the end of my stories  no matter how complicated the plot might be .  in this case  however  i noticed that when i was all done  one glaring little item remained unresolved .   i am hoping no one else notices it because it clearly points the way to the continuation of the series .   it is even possible that i inadvertently gave this away for at the end of the novel  i wrote   the end  for now  .    i very much fear that if the novel proves successful  doubleday will be at my throat again  as campbell used to be in the old days .  and yet what can i do but hope that the novel is very successful indeed .  what a quandary .    editor s note  the novel was published in october      as foundation s edge .                prologue  the galactic empire was falling .   it was a colossal empire  stretching across millions of worlds from arm end to arm end of the mighty multi spiral that was the milky way .  its fall was colossal  too     and a long one  for it had a long way to go .   it had been falling for centuries before one man became really aware of that fall .  that man was hari seldon  the man who represented the one spark of creative effort left among the gathering decay .  he developed and brought to its highest pitch the science of psychohistory .   psychohistory dealt not with man  but with man masses .  it was the science of mobs  mobs in their billions .  it could forecast reactions to stimuli with something of the accuracy that a lesser science could bring to the forecast of a rebound of a billiard ball .  the reaction of one man could be forecast by no known mathematics  the reaction of a billion is something else again .   hari seldon plotted the social and economic trends of the time  sighted along the curves and foresaw the continuing and accelerating fall of civilization and the gap of thirty thousand years that must elapse before a struggling new empire could emerge from the ruins .   it was too late to stop that fall  but not too late to narrow the gap of barbarism .  seldon established two foundations at  opposite ends of the galaxy  and their location was so designed that in one short millennium events would knit and mesh so as to force out of them a stronger  more permanent  more benevolent second empire .   foundation   gnome press        has told the story of one of those foundations during the first two centuries of life .  it began as a settlement of physical scientists on terminus  a planet at the extreme end of one of the spiral arms of the galaxy .  separated from the turmoil of the empire  they worked as compilers of a universal compendium of knowledge  the encyclopedia galactica  unaware of the deeper role planned for them by the already dead seldon   as the empire rotted  the outer regions fell into the hands of independent  kings .   the foundation was threatened by them .  however  by playing one petty ruler against another  under the leadership of their first mayor  salvor hardin  they maintained a precarious independence .  as sole possessors  of nuclear power among worlds which were losing their sciences and falling back on coal and oil  they even established an ascendancy .  the foundation became the  religious  center of the neighboring kingdoms .   slowly  the foundation developed a trading economy as the encyclopedia receded into the background .  their traders  dealing in nuclear gadgets which not even the empire in its heyday could have duplicated for compactness  penetrated hundreds of light years through the periphery .   under hober mallow  the first of the foundation s merchant princes  they developed the techniques of economic warfare to the point of defeating the republic of korell  even though that world was receiving support from one of the outer provinces of what was left of the empire .   at the end of two hundred years  the foundation was the most powerful state in the galaxy  except for the remains of the empire  which  concentrated in the inner third of the milky way  still controlled three quarters of the population and wealth of the universe .   it seemed inevitable that the next danger the foundation would have to face was the final lash of the dying empire .   the way must he cleared for the battle of foundation and empire .                part i  the general                   .  search for magicians  bel riose  .  .  .  .  in his relatively short career  riose earned the title of  the last of the imperials  and earned it well .  a study of his campaigns reveals him to be the equal of peurifoy in strategic ability and his superior perhaps in his ability to handle men .  that he was born in the days of the decline of empire made it all but impossible for him to equal peurifoy s record as a conqueror .  yet he had his chance when  the first of the empire s generals to do so  he faced the foundation squarely .  .  .  .   encyclopedia galactica    all quotations from the encyclopedia galactica here reproduced are taken from the    th edition published in      f . e .  by the encyclopedia galactica publishing co .   terminus  with permission of the publishers .   bel riose traveled without escort  which is not what court etiquette prescribes for the head of a fleet stationed in a yet sullen stellar system on the marches of the galactic empire .   but bel riose was young and energetic     energetic enough to be sent as near the end of the universe as possible by an unemotional and calculating court     and curious besides .  strange and improbable tales fancifully repeated by hundreds and murkily known to thousands intrigued the last faculty  the possibility of a military venture engaged the other two .  the combination was overpowering .   he was out of the dowdy ground car he had appropriated and at the door of the fading mansion that was his destination .  he waited .  the photonic eye that spanned the doorway was alive  but when the door opened it was by hand .   bel riose smiled at the old man .   i am riose       i recognize you .   the old man remained stiffly and unsurprised in his place .   your business .    riose withdrew a step in a gesture of submission .   one of peace .  if you are ducem barr  i ask the favor of conversation .    ducem barr stepped aside and in the interior of the house the walls glowed into life  the general entered into daylight .   he touched the wall of the study  then stared at his fingertips .   you have this on siwenna .    barr smiled thinly .   not elsewhere  i believe .  i keep this in repair myself as well as i can .  i must apologize for your wait at the door .  the automatic device registers the presence of a visitor but will no longer open the door .     your repairs fall short .   the general s voice was faintly mocking .    parts are no longer available .  if you will sit  sir .  you drink tea .     on siwenna .  my good sir  it is socially impossible not to drink it here .    the old patrician retreated noiselessly with a slow bow that was part of the ceremonious legacy left by the aristocracy of the last century s better days .   riose looked after his host s departing figure  and his studied urbanity grew a bit uncertain at the edges .  his education had been purely military  his experience likewise .  he had  as the clich      has it  faced death many times  but always death of a very familiar and tangible nature  consequently  there is no inconsistency in the fact that the idolized lion of the twentieth fleet felt chilled in the suddenly musty atmosphere of an ancient room .   the general recognized the small black ivroid boxes that lined the shelves to be books .  their titles were unfamiliar .  he guessed that the large structure at one end of the room was the receiver that transmuted the books into sight and sound on demand .  he had never seen one in operation  but he had heard of them .   once he had been told that long before  during the golden ages when the empire had been co extensive with the entire galaxy  nine houses out of every ten had such receivers     and such rows of books .   but there were borders to watch now  books were for old men .  and half the stories told about the old days were mythical anyway .  more than half .   the tea arrived  and riose seated himself .  ducem barr lifted his cup .   to your honor .     thank you .  to yours .    ducem barr said deliberately   you are said to be young .  thirty five .     near enough .  thirty four .     in that case   said barr  with soft emphasis   i could not begin better than by informing you regretfully that i am not in the possession of love charms  potions  or philtres .  nor am i in the least capable of influencing the favors of any young lady as may appeal to you .     i have no need of artificial aids in that respect  sir .   the complacency undeniably present in the general s voice was stirred with amusement .   do you receive many requests for such commodities .     enough .  unfortunately  an uninformed public tends to confuse scholarship with magicianry  and love life seems to be that factor which requires the largest quantity of magical tinkering .     and so would seem most natural .  but i differ .  i connect scholarship with nothing but the means of answering difficult questions .    the siwennian considered somberly   you may be as wrong as they .     that may turn out or not .   the young general set down his cup in its flaring sheath and it refilled .  he dropped the offered flavor capsule into it with a small splash .   tell me then  patrician  who are the magicians .  the real ones .    barr seemed startled at a title long unused .  he said   there are no magicians .     but people speak of them .  siwenna crawls with the tales of them .  there are cults being built about them .  there is some strange connection between it and those groups among your countrymen who dream and drivel of ancient days and what they call liberty and autonomy .  eventually the matter might become a danger to the state .    the old man shook his head .   why ask me .  do you smell rebellion  with myself at the head .    riose shrugged   never .  never .  oh  it is not a thought completely ridiculous .  your father was an exile in his day  you yourself a patriot and a chauvinist in yours .  it is indelicate in me as a guest to mention it  but my business here requires it .  and yet a conspiracy now .  i doubt it .  siwenna has had the spirit beat out of it these three generations .    the old man replied with difficulty   i shall be as indelicate a host as you a guest .  i shall remind you that once a viceroy thought as you did of the spiritless siwennians .  by the orders of that viceroy my father became a fugitive pauper  my brothers martyrs  and my sister a suicide .  yet that viceroy died a death sufficiently horrible at the hands of these same slavish siwennians .     ah  yes  and there you touch nearly on something i could wish to say .  for three years the mysterious death of that viceroy has been no mystery to me .  there was a young soldier of his personal guard whose actions were of interest .  you were that soldier  but there is no need of details  i think .    barr was quiet .   none .  what do you propose .     that you answer my questions .     not under threats .  i am old enough for life not to mean particularly overmuch .     my good sir  these are hard times   said riose  with meaning   and you have children and friends .  you have a country for which you have mouthed phrases of love and folly in the past .  come  if i should decide to use force  my aim would not be so poor as to strike you .    barr said coldly   what do you want .    riose held the empty cup as he spoke .   patrician  listen to me .  these are days when the most successful soldiers are those whose function is to lead the dress parades that wind through the imperial palace grounds on feast days and to escort the sparkling pleasure ships that carry his imperial splendor to the summer planets .  i  .  .  .  i am a failure .  i am a failure at thirty four  and i shall stay a failure .  because  you see  i like to fight .    that s why they sent me here .  i m too troublesome at court .  i don t fit in with the etiquette .  i offend the dandies and the lord admirals  but i m too good a leader of ships and men to be disposed of shortly be being marooned in space .  so siwenna is the substitute .  it s a frontier world  a rebellious and a barren province .  it is far away  far enough away to satisfy all .    and so i moulder .  there are no rebellions to stamp down  and the border viceroys do not revolt lately  at least  not since his imperial majesty s late father of glorious memory made an example of mountel of paramay .     a strong emperor   muttered barr .    yes  and we need more of them .  he is my master  remember that .  these are his interests i guard .    barr shrugged unconcernedly .   how does all this relate to the subject .     i ll show you in two words .  the magicians i ve mentioned come from beyond out there beyond the frontier guards  where the stars are scattered thinly        where the stars are scattered thinly    quoted barr    and the cold of space seeps in .      is that poetry .   riose frowned .  verse seemed frivolous at the moment .   in any case  they re from the periphery     from the only quarter where i am free to fight for the glory of the emperor .     and thus serve his imperial majesty s interests and satisfy your own love of a good fight .     exactly .  but i must know what i fight  and there you can help .     how do you know .    riose nibbled casually at a cakelet .   because for three years i have traced every rumor  every myth  every breath concerning the magicians     and of all the library of information i have gathered  only two isolated facts are unanimously agreed upon  and are hence certainly true .  the first is that the magicians come from the edge of the galaxy opposite siwenna  the second is that your father once met a magician  alive and actual  and spoke with him .    the aged siwennian stared unblinkingly  and riose continued   you had better tell me what you know      barr said thoughtfully   it would be interesting to tell you certain things .  it would be a psychohistoric experiment of my own .     what kind of experiment .     psychohistoric .   the old man had an unpleasant edge to his smile .  then  crisply   you d better have more tea .  i m going to make a bit of a speech .    he leaned far back into the soft cushions of his chair .  the wall lights had softened to a pink ivory glow  which mellowed even the soldier s hard profile .   ducem barr began   my own knowledge is the result of two accidents  the accidents of being born the son of my father  and of being born the native of my country .  it begins over forty years ago  shortly after the great massacre  when my father was a fugitive in the forests of the south  while i was a gunner in the viceroy s personal fleet .  this same viceroy  by the way  who had ordered the massacre  and who died such a cruel death thereafter .    barr smiled grimly  and continued   my father was a patrician of the empire and a senator of siwenna .  his name was onum barr .    riose interrupted impatiently   i know the circumstances of his exile very well .  you needn t elaborate upon it .    the siwennian ignored him and proceeded without deflection .   during his exile a wanderer came upon him  a merchant from the edge of the galaxy  a young man who spoke a strange accent  knew nothing of recent imperial history  and who was protected by an individual force shield .     an individual force shield .   riose glared .   you speak extravagance .  what generator could be powerful enough to condense a shield to the size of a single man .  by the great galaxy  did he carry five thousand myria tons of nuclear power source about with him on a little wheeled gocart .    barr said quietly   this is the magician of whom you hear whispers  stories and myths .  the name  magician  is not lightly earned .  he carried no generator large enough to be seen  but not the heaviest weapon you can carry in your hand would have as much as creased the shield he bore .     is this all the story there is .  are the magicians born of maunderings of an old man broken by suffering and exile .     the story of the magicians antedated even my father  sir .  and the proof is more concrete .  after leaving my father  this merchant that men call a magician visited a tech man at the city to which my father had guided him  and there he left a shield generator of the type he wore .  that generator was retrieved by my father after his return from exile upon the execution of the bloody viceroy .  it took a long time to find      the generator hangs on the wall behind you  sir .  it does not work .  it never worked but for the first two days  but if you ll look at it  you will see that no one in the empire ever designed it .    bel riose reached for the belt of linked metal that clung to the curved wall .  it came away with a little sucking noise as the tiny adhesion field broke at the touch of his hand .  the ellipsoid at the apex of the belt held his attention .  it was the size of a walnut .    this     he said .    was the generator   nodded barr .   but it was the generator .  the secret of its workings are beyond discovery now .  sub electronic investigations have shown it to be fused into a single lump of metal and not all the most careful study of the diffraction patterns have sufficed to distinguish the discrete parts that had existed before fusion .     then your  proof  still lingers on the frothy border of words backed by no concrete evidence .    barr shrugged .   you have demanded my knowledge of me and threatened its extortion by force .  if you choose to meet it with skepticism  what is that to me .  do you want me to stop .     go on .   said the general  harshly .    i continued my father s researches after he died  and then the second accident i mentioned came to help me  for siwenna was well known to hari seldon .     and who is hari seldon .     hari seldon was a scientist of the reign of the emperor  daluben iv .  he was a psychohistorian  the last and greatest of them all .  he once visited siwenna  when siwenna was a great commercial center  rich in the arts and sciences .     hmph   muttered riose  sourly   where is the stagnant planet that does not claim to have been a land of overflowing wealth in older days .     the days i speak of are the days of two centuries ago  when the emperor yet ruled to the uttermost star  when siwenna was a world of the interior and not a semi barbarian border province .  in those days  hari seldon foresaw the decline of imperial power and the eventual barbarization of the entire galaxy .    riose laughed suddenly .   he foresaw that .  then he foresaw wrong  my good scientist .  i suppose you call yourself that .  why  the empire is more powerful now than it has been in a millennium .  your old eyes are blinded by the cold bleakness of the border .  come to the inner worlds some day  come to the warmth and the wealth of the center .    the old man shook his head somberly .   circulation ceases first at the outer edges .  it will take a while yet for the decay to reach the heart .  that is  the apparent  obvious to all decay  as distinct from the inner decay that is an old story of some fifteen centuries .     and so this hari seldon foresaw a galaxy of uniform barbarism   said riose  good humoredly .   and what then  eh .     so he established two foundations at the extreme opposing ends of the galaxy     foundations of the best  and the youngest  and the strongest  there to breed  grow  and develop .  the worlds on which they were placed were chosen carefully  as were the times and the surroundings .  all was arranged in such a way that the future as foreseen by the unalterable mathematics of psychohistory would involve their early isolation from the main body of imperial civilization and their gradual growth into the germs of the second galactic empire     cutting an inevitable barbarian interregnum from thirty thousand years to scarcely a single thousand .     and where did you find out all this .  you seem to know it in detail .     i don t and never did   said the patrician with composure .   it is the painful result of the piecing together of certain evidence discovered by my father and a little more found by myself .  the basis is flimsy and the superstructure has been romanticized into existence to fill the huge gaps .  but i am convinced that it is essentially true .     you are easily convinced .     am i .  it has taken forty years of research .     hmph .  forty years .  i could settle the question in forty days .  in fact  i believe i ought to .  it would be     different .     and how would you do that .     in the obvious way .  i could become an explorer .  i could find this foundation you speak of and observe with my eyes .  you say there are two .     the records speak of two .  supporting evidence has been found only for one  which is understandable  for the other is at the extreme end of the long axis of the galaxy .     well  we ll visit the near one .   the general was on his feet  adjusting his belt .    you know where to go .   asked barr .    in a way .  in the records of the last viceroy but one  he whom you murdered so effectively  there are suspicious tales of outer barbarians .  in fact  one of his daughters was given in marriage to a barbarian prince .  i ll find my way .    he held out a hand .   i thank you for your hospitality .    ducem barr touched the hand with his fingers and bowed formally .   your visit was a great honor .     as for the information you gave me   continued bel riose   i ll know how to thank you for that when i return .    ducem barr followed his guest submissively to the outer door and said quietly to the disappearing ground car   and if you return .          .  the magicians  foundation  .  .  .  with forty years of expansion behind them  the foundation faced the menace of riose .  the epic days of hardin and mallow had gone and with them were gone a certain hard daring and resolution .  .  .  .   encyclopedia galactica  there were four men in the room  and the room was set apart where none could approach .  the four men looked at each other quickly  then lengthily at the table that separated them .  there were four bottles on the table and as many full glasses  but no one had touched them .   and then the man nearest the door stretched out an arm and drummed a slow  padding rhythm on the table .   he said   are you going to sit and wonder forever .  does it matter who speaks first .     speak you first  then   said the big man directly opposite .   you re the one who should be the most worried .    sennett forell chuckled with noiseless nonhumor .   because you think i m the richest .  well     or is it that you expect me to continue as i have started .  i don t suppose you forget that it was my own trade fleet that captured this scout ship of theirs .     you had the largest fleet   said a third   and the best pilots  which is another way of saying you are the richest .  it was a fearful risk  and would have been greater for one of us .    sennett forell chuckled again .   there is a certain facility in risk taking that i inherit from my father .  after all  the essential point in running a risk is that the returns justify it .  as to which  witness the fact that the enemy ship was isolated and captured without loss to ourselves or warning to the others .    that forell was a distant collateral relative of the late great hober mallow was recognized openly throughout the foundation .  that he was mallow s illegitimate son was accepted quietly to just as wide an extent .   the fourth man blinked his little eyes stealthily .  words crept out from between thin lips .   it is nothing to sleep over in fat triumph  this grasping of little ships .  most likely  it will but anger that young man further .     you think he needs motives .   questioned forell  scornfully .    i do  and this might  or will  save him the vexation of having to manufacture one .   the fourth man spoke slowly   hober mallow worked otherwise .  and salvor hardin .  they let others take the uncertain paths of force  while they maneuvered surely and quietly .    forell shrugged .   this ship has proved its value .  motives are cheap and we have sold this one at a profit .   there was the satisfaction of the born trader in that .  he continued   the young man is of the old empire .     we knew that   said the second man  the big one  with rumbling discontent .    we suspected that   corrected forell  softly .   if a man comes with ships and wealth  with overtures of friendliness  and with offers of trade  it is only sensible to refrain from antagonizing him  until we are certain that the profitable mask is not a face after all .  but now      there was a faint whining edge to the third man s voice as he spoke .   we might have been even more careful .  we might have found out first .  we might have found out before allowing him to leave .  it would have been the truest wisdom .     that has been discussed and disposed of   said forell .  he waved the subject aside with a flatly final gesture .    the government is soft   complained the third man .   the mayor is an idiot .    the fourth man looked at the other three in turn and removed the stub of a cigar from his mouth .  he dropped it casually into the slot at his right where it disappeared with a silent flash of disruption .   he said sarcastically   i trust the gentleman who last spoke is speaking through habit only .  we can afford to remember here that we are the government .    there was a murmur of agreement .   the fourth man s little eyes were on the table .   then let us leave government policy alone .  this young man  .  .  .  this stranger might have been a possible customer .  there have been cases .  all three of you tried to butter him into an advance contract .  we have an agreement     a gentleman s agreement     against it  but you tried .     so did you   growled the second man .   i know it   said the fourth  calmly .    then let s forget what we should have done earlier   interrupted forell impatiently   and continue with what we should do now .  in any case  what if we had imprisoned him  or killed him  what then .  we are not certain of his intentions even yet  and at the worst  we could not destroy an empire by snipping short one man s life .  there might be navies upon navies waiting just the other side of his nonreturn .     exactly   approved the fourth man .   now what did you get out of your captured ship .  i m too old for all this talking .     it can be told in a few enough words   said forell  grimly .   he s an imperial general or whatever rank corresponds to that over there .  he s a young man who has proved his military brilliance     so i am told     and who is the idol of his men .  quite a romantic career .  the stories they tell of him are no doubt half lies  but even so it makes him out to be a type of wonder man .     who are the  they  .   demanded the second man .    the crew of the captured ship .  look  i have all their statements recorded on micro film  which i have in a secure place .  later on  if you wish  you can see them .  you can talk to the men yourselves  if you think it necessary .  i ve told you the essentials .     how did you get it out of them .  how do you know they re telling the truth .    forell frowned .   i wasn t gentle  good sir .  i knocked them about  drugged them crazy  and used the probe unmercifully .  they talked .  you can believe them .     in the old days   said the third man  with sudden irrelevance   they would have used pure psychology .  painless  you know  but very sure .  no chance of deceit .     well  there is a good deal they had in the old days   said forell  dryly .   these are the new days .     but   said the fourth man   what did he want here  this general  this romantic wonder man .   there was a dogged  weary persistence about him .   forell glanced at him sharply .   you think he confides the details of state policy to his crew .  they didn t know .  there was nothing to get out of them in that respect  and i tried  galaxy knows .     which leaves us       to draw our own conclusions  obviously .   forell s fingers were tapping quietly again .   the young man is a military leader of the empire  yet he played the pretense of being a minor princeling of some scattered stars in an odd comer of the periphery .  that alone would assure us that his real motives are such as it would not benefit him to have us know .  combine the nature of his profession with the fact that the empire has already subsidized one attack upon us in my father s time  and the possibilities become ominous .  that first attack failed .  i doubt that the empire owes us love for that .     there is nothing in your findings   questioned the fourth man guardedly   that makes for certainty .  you are withholding nothing .    forell answered levelly   i can t withhold anything .  from here on there can be no question of business rivalry .  unity is forced upon us .     patriotism .   there was a sneer in the third man s thin voice .    patriotism be damned   said forell quietly .   do you think i give two puffs of nuclear emanation for the future second empire .  do you think i d risk a single trade mission to smooth its path .  but     do you suppose imperial conquest will help my business or yours .  if the empire wins  there will be a sufficient number of yearning carrion crows to crave the rewards of battle .     and we re the rewards   added the fourth man  dryly .   the second man broke his silence suddenly  and shifted his bulk angrily  so that the chair creaked under him .   but why talk of that .  the empire can t win  can it .  there is seldon s assurance that we will form the second empire in the end .  this is only another crisis .  there have been three before this .     only another crisis  yes .   forell brooded .   but     in the case of the first two  we had salvor hardin to guide us  in the third  there was hober mallow .  whom have we now .    he looked at the others somberly and continued   seldon s rules of psychohistory on which it is so comforting to rely probably have as one of the contributing variables  a certain normal initiative on the part of the people of the foundation themselves .  seldon s laws help those who help themselves .     the times make the man   said the third man .   there s another proverb for you .     you can t count on that  not with absolute assurance   grunted forell .   now the way it seems to me is this .  if this is the fourth crisis  then seldon has foreseen it .  if he has  then it can be beaten  and there should be a way of doing it .    now the empire is stronger than we  it always has been .  but this is the first time we are in danger of its direct attack  so that strength becomes terribly menacing .  if it can be beaten  it must be once again as in all past crises by a method other than pure force .  we must find the weak side of our enemy and attack it there .     and what is that weak side .   asked the fourth man .   do you intend advancing a theory .     no .  that is the point i m leading up to .  our great leaders of the past always saw the weak points of their enemies and aimed at that .  but now      there was a helplessness in his voice  and for a moment none volunteered a comment .   then the fourth man said   we need spies .    forell turned to him eagerly .   right .  i don t know when the empire will attack .  there may be time .     hober mallow himself entered the imperial dominions   suggested the second man .   but forell shook his head .   nothing so direct .  none of us are precisely youthful  and all of us are rusty with red tape and administrative detail .  we need young men that are in the field now       the independent traders .   asked the fourth man .   and forell nodded his  head and whispered   if there is yet time            .  the dead hand  bel riose interrupted his annoyed stridings to look up hopefully when his aide entered .   any word of the starlet .     none .  the scouting party has quartered space  but the instruments have detected nothing .  commander yume has reported that the fleet is ready for an immediate attack in retaliation .    the general shook his head .   no  not for a patrol ship .  not yet .  tell him to double     wait .  i ll write out the message .  have it coded and transmitted by tight beam .    he wrote as he talked and thrust the paper at the waiting officer .   has the siwennian arrived yet .     not yet .     well  see to it that he is brought in here as soon as he does arrive .    the aide saluted crisply and left .  riose resumed his caged stride .   when the door opened a second time  it was ducem barr that stood on the threshold .  slowly  in the footsteps of the ushering aide  he stepped into the garish room whose ceiling was an ornamented holographic model of the galaxy  and in the center of which bel riose stood in field uniform .    patrician  good day .   the general pushed forward a chair with his foot and gestured the aide away with a  that door is to stay closed till i open it .    he stood before the siwennian  legs apart  hand grasping wrist behind his back  balancing himself slowly  thoughtfully  on the balls of his feet .   then  harshly   patrician  are you a loyal subject of the emperor .    barr  who had maintained an indifferent silence till then  wrinkled a noncommittal brow .   i have no cause to love imperial rule .     which is a long way from saying that you would be a traitor .     true .  but the mere act of not being a traitor is also a long way from agreeing to be an active helper .     ordinarily also true .  but to refuse your help at this point   said riose  deliberately   will be considered treason and treated as such .    barr s eyebrows drew together .   save your verbal cudgels for your subordinates .  a simple statement of your needs and wants will suffice me here .    riose sat down and crossed his legs .   barr  we had an earlier discussion half a year ago .     about your magicians .     yes .  you remember what i said i would do .    barr nodded .  his arms rested limply in his lap .   you were going to visit them in their haunts  and you ve been away these four months .  did you find them .     find them .  that i did   cried riose .  his lips were stiff as he spoke .  it seemed to require effort to refrain from grinding molars .   patrician  they are not magicians  they are devils .  it is as far from belief as the outer galaxies from here .  conceive it .  it is a world the size of a handkerchief  of a fingernail  with resources so petty  power so minute  a population so microscopic as would never suffice the most backward worlds of the dusty prefects of the dark stars .  yet with that  a people so proud and ambitious as to dream quietly and methodically of galactic rule .    why  they are so sure of themselves that they do not even hurry .  they move slowly  phlegmatically  they speak of necessary centuries .  they swallow worlds at leisure  creep through systems with dawdling complacence .    and they succeed .  there is no one to stop them .  they have built up a filthy trading community that curls its tentacles about the systems further than their toy ships dare reach .  for parsecs  their traders     which is what their agents call themselves     penetrate .    ducem barr interrupted the angry flow .   how much of this information is definite  and how much is simply fury .    the soldier caught his breath and grew calmer .   my fury does not blind me .  i tell you i was in worlds nearer to siwenna than to the foundation  where the empire was a myth of the distance  and where traders were living truths .  we ourselves were mistaken for traders .     the foundation itself told you they aimed at galactic dominion .     told me .   riose was violent again .   it was not a matter of telling me .  the officials said nothing .  they spoke business exclusively .  but i spoke to ordinary men .  i absorbed the ideas of the common folk  their  manifest destiny   their calm acceptance of a great future .  it is a thing that can t be hidden  a universal optimism they don t even try to hide .    the siwennian openly displayed a certain quiet satisfaction .   you will notice that so far it would seem to bear out quite accurately my reconstruction of events from the paltry data on the subject that i have gathered .     it is no doubt   replied riose with vexed sarcasm   a tribute to your analytical powers .  it is also a hearty and bumptious commentary on the growing danger to the domains of his imperial majesty .    barr shrugged his unconcern  and riose leaned forward suddenly  to seize the old man s shoulders and stare with curious gentleness into his eyes .   he said   now  patrician  none of that .  i have no desire to be barbaric .  for my part  the legacy of siwennian hostility to the imperium is an odious burden  and one which i would do everything in my power to wipe out .  but my province is the military and interference in civil affairs is impossible .  it would bring about my recall and ruin my usefulness at once .  you see that .  i know you see that .  between yourself and myself then  let the atrocity of forty years ago be repaid by your vengeance upon its author and so forgotten .  i need your help .  i frankly admit it .    there was a world of urgency in the young man s voice  but ducem barr s head shook gently and deliberately in a negative gesture .   riose said pleadingly   you don t understand  patrician  and i doubt my ability to make you .  i can t argue on your ground .  you re the scholar  not i .  but this i can tell you .  whatever you think of the empire  you will admit its great services .  its armed forces have committed isolated crimes  but in the main they have been a force for peace and civilization .  it was the imperial navy that created the pax imperium that ruled over all the galaxy for thousands of years .  contrast the millennia of peace under the sun and spaceship of the empire with the millennia of interstellar anarchy that preceded it .  consider the wars and devastations of those old days and tell me if  with all its faults  the empire is not worth preserving .    consider   he drove on forcefully   to what the outer fringe of the galaxy is reduced in these days of their breakaway and independence  and ask yourself if for the sake of a petty revenge you would reduce siwenna from its position as a province under the protection of a mighty navy to a barbarian world in a barbarian galaxy  all immersed in its fragmentary independence and its common degradation and misery .     is it so bad     so soon .   murmured the siwennian .    no   admitted riose .   we would be safe ourselves no doubt  were our lifetimes quadrupled .  but it is for the empire i fight  that  and a military tradition which is something for myself alone  and which i can not transfer to you .  it is a military tradition built on the imperial institution which i serve .     you are getting mystical  and i always find it difficult to penetrate another person s mysticism .     no matter .  you understand the danger of this foundation .     it was i who pointed out what you call the danger before ever you headed outward from siwenna .     then you realize that it must be stopped in embryo or perhaps not at all .  you have known of this foundation before anyone had heard of it .  you know more about it than anyone else in the empire .  you probably know how it might best be attacked  and you can probably forewarn me of its countermeasures .  come  let us be friends .    ducem barr rose .  he said flatly   such help as i could give you means nothing .  so i will make you free of it in the face of your strenuous demand .     i will be the judge of its meaning .     no  i am serious .  not all the might of the empire could avail to crush this pygmy world .     why not .   bel riose s eyes glistened fiercely .   no  stay where you are .  i ll tell you when you may leave .  why not .  if you think i underestimate this enemy i have discovered  you are wrong .  patrician   he spoke reluctantly   i lost a ship on my return .  i have no proof that it fell into the hands of the foundation  but it has not been located since and were it merely an accident  its dead hulk should  certainly have been found along the route we took .  it is not an important loss     less than the tenth part of a fleabite  but it may mean that the foundation has already opened hostilities .  such eagerness and such disregard for consequences might mean secret forces of which i know nothing .  can you help me then by answering a specific question .  what is their military power .     i haven t any notion .     then explain yourself on your own terms .  why do you say the empire can not defeat this small enemy .    the siwennian seated himself once more and looked away from riose s fixed glare .  he spoke heavily   because i have faith in the principles of psychohistory .  it is a strange science .  it reached mathematical maturity with one man  hari seldon  and died with him  for no man since has been capable of manipulating its intricacies .  but in that short period  it proved itself the most powerful instrument ever invented for the study of humanity .  without pretending to predict the actions of individual humans  it formulated definite laws capable of mathematical analysis and extrapolation to govern and predict the mass action of human groups .     so       it was that psychohistory which seldon and the group he worked with applied in full force to the establishment of the foundation .  the place  time  and conditions all conspire mathematically and so  inevitably  to the development of a second galactic empire .    riose s voice trembled with indignation .   you mean that this art of his predicts that i would attack the foundation and lose such and such a battle for such and such a reason .  you are trying to say that i am a silly robot following a predetermined course into destruction .     no   replied the old patrician  sharply .   i have already said that the science had nothing to do with individual actions .  it is the vaster background that has been foreseen .     then we stand clasped tightly in the forcing hand of the goddess of historical necessity .     of psychohistorical necessity   prompted barr  softly .    and if i exercise my prerogative of freewill .  if i choose to attack next year  or not to attack at all .  how pliable is the goddess .  how resourceful .    barr shrugged .   attack now or never  with a single ship  or all the force in the empire  by military force or economic pressure  by candid declaration of war or by treacherous ambush .  do whatever you wish in your fullest exercise of freewill .  you will still lose .     because of hari seldon s dead hand .     because of the dead hand of the mathematics of human behavior that can neither be stopped  swerved  nor delayed .    the two faced each other in deadlock  until the general stepped back .   he said simply   i ll take that challenge .  it s a dead hand against a living will .          .  the emperor  cleon ii commonly called  the great .   the last strong emperor of the first empire  he is important for the political and artistic renaissance that took place during his long reign .  he is best known to romance  however  for his connection with bel riose  and to the common man  he is simply  riose s emperor .   it is important not to allow events of the last year of his reign to overshadow forty years  of .  .  .  encyclopedia galactica  cleon ii was lord of the universe .  cleon ii also suffered from a painful and undiagnosed ailment .  by the queer twists of human affairs  the two statements are not mutually exclusive  nor even particularly incongruous .  there have been a wearisomely large number of precedents in history .   but cleon ii cared nothing for such precedents .  to meditate upon a long list of similar cases would not ameliorate personal suffering an electron s worth .  it soothed him as little to think that where his great grandfather had been the pirate ruler of a dust speck planet  he himself slept in the pleasure palace of ammenetik the great  as heir of a line of galactic rulers stretching backward into a tenuous past .  it was at present no source of comfort to him that the efforts of his father had cleansed the realm of its leprous patches of rebellion and restored it to the peace and unity it had enjoyed under stanel vi  that  as a consequence  in the twenty five years of his reign  not one cloud of revolt had misted his burnished glory .   the emperor of the galaxy and the lord of all whimpered as he lolled his head backward into the invigorating plane of force about his pillows .  it yielded in a softness that did not touch  and at the pleasant tingle  cleon relaxed a bit .  he sat up with difficulty and stared morosely at the distant walls of the grand chamber .  it was a bad room to be alone in .  it was too big .  all the rooms were too big .   but better to be alone during these crippling bouts than to endure the prinking of the courtiers  their lavish sympathy  their soft  condescending dullness .  better to be alone than to watch those insipid masks behind which spun the tortuous speculations on the chances of death and the fortunes of the succession .   his thoughts hurried him .  there were his three sons  three straight backed youths full of promise and virtue .  where did they disappear on these bad days .  waiting  no doubt .  each watching the other  and all watching him .   he stirred uneasily .  and now brodrig craved audience .  the low born  faithful brodrig  faithful because he was hated with a unanimous and cordial hatred that was the only point of agreement between the dozen cliques that divided his court .   brodrig     the faithful favorite  who had to be faithful  since unless he owned the fastest speed ship in the galaxy and took to it the day of the emperor s death  it would be the radiation chamber the day after .   cleon ii touched the smooth knob on the arm of his great divan  and the huge door at the end of the room dissolved to transparency .   brodrig advanced along the crimson carpet  and knelt to kiss the emperor s limp hand .    your health  sire .   asked the privy secretary in a low tone of becoming anxiety .    i live   snapped the emperor with exasperation   if you can call it life where every scoundrel who can read a book of medicine uses me as a blank and receptive field for his feeble experiments .  if there is a conceivable remedy  chemical  physical  or nuclear  which has not yet been tried  why then  some learned babbler from the far comers of the realm will arrive tomorrow to try it .  and still another newly discovered book  or forgery morelike  will be used as authority .    by my father s memory   he rumbled savagely   it seems there is not a biped extant who can study a disease before his eyes with those same eyes .  there is not one who can count a pulse beat without a book of the ancients before him .  i m sick and they call it  unknown .   the fools .  if in the course of millennia  human bodies learn new methods of falling askew  it remains uncovered by the studies of the ancients and uncurable forevermore .  the ancients should be alive now  or i then .    the emperor ran down to a low breathed curse while brodrig waited dutifully .  cleon ii said peevishly   how many are waiting outside .    he jerked his head in the direction of the door .   brodrig said patiently   the great hall holds the usual number .     well  let them wait .  state matters occupy me .  have the captain of the guard announce it .  or wait  forget the state matters .  just have it announced i hold no audience  and let the captain of the guard look doleful .  the jackals among them may betray themselves .   the emperor sneered nastily .    there is a rumor  sire   said brodrig  smoothly   that it is your heart that troubles you .    the emperor s smile was little removed from the previous sneer .   it will hurt others more than myself if any act prematurely on that rumor .  but what is it you want .  let s have this over .    brodrig rose from his kneeling posture at a gesture of permission and said   it concerns general bel riose  the military governor of siwenna .     riose .   cleon ii frowned heavily .   i don t place him .  wait  is he the one who sent that quixotic message some months back .  yes  i remember .  he panted for permission to enter a career of conquest for the glory of the empire and emperor .     exactly  sire .    the emperor laughed shortly .   did you think i had such generals left me  brodrig .  he seems to be a curious atavism .  what was the answer .  i believe you took care of it .     i did  sire .  he was instructed to forward additional information and to take no steps involving naval action without further orders from the imperium .     hmp .  safe enough .  who is this riose .  was he ever at court .    brodrig nodded and his mouth twisted ever so little .   he began his career as a cadet in the guards ten years back .  he had part in that affair off the lemul cluster .     the lemul cluster .  you know  my memory isn t quite     was that the time a young soldier saved two ships of the line from a head on collision by  .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  something or other .   he waved a hand impatiently .   i don t remember the details .  it was something heroic .     riose was that soldier .  he received a promotion for it   brodrig said dryly   and an appointment to field duty as captain of a ship .     and now military governor of a border system and still young .  capable man  brodrig .     unsafe  sire .  he lives in the past .  he is a dreamer of ancient times  or rather  of the myths of what ancient times used to be .  such men are harmless in themselves  but their queer lack of realism makes them fools for others .   he added   his men  i understand  are completely under his control .  he is one of your popular generals .     is he .   the emperor mused .   well  come  brodrig  i would not wish to be served entirely by incompetents .  they certainly set no enviable standard for faithfulness themselves .     an incompetent traitor is no danger .  it is rather the capable men who must be watched .     you among them  brodrig .   cleon ii laughed and then grimaced with pain .   well  then  you may forget the lecture for the while .  what new development is there in the matter of this young conqueror .  i hope you haven t come merely to reminisce .     another message  sire  has been received from general riose .     oh .  and to what effect .     he has spied out the land of these barbarians and advocates an expedition in force .  his arguments are long and fairly tedious .  it is not worth annoying your imperial majesty with it at present  during your indisposition .  particularly since it will be discussed at length during the session of the council of lords .   he glanced sidewise at the emperor .   cleon ii frowned .   the lords .  is it a question for them  brodrig .  it will mean further demands for a broader interpretation of the charter .  it always comes to that .     it can t be avoided  sire .  it might have been better if your august father could have beaten down the last rebellion without granting the charter .  but since it is here  we must endure it for the while .     you re right  i suppose .  then the lords it must be .  but why all this solemnity  man .  it is  after all  a minor point .  success on a remote border with limited troops is scarcely a state affair .    brodrig smiled narrowly .  he said coolly   it is an affair of a romantic idiot  but even a romantic idiot can be a deadly weapon when an unromantic rebel uses him as a tool .  sire  the man was popular here and is popular there .  he is young .  if he annexes a vagrant barbarian planet or two  he will become a conqueror .  now a young conqueror who has proven his ability to rouse the enthusiasm of pilots  miners  tradesmen and suchlike rabble is dangerous at any time .  even if he lacked the desire to do to you as your august father did to the usurper  ricker  then one of our loyal lords of the domain may decide to use him as his weapon .    cleon ii moved an arm hastily and stiffened with pain .  slowly he relaxed  but his smile was weak  and his voice a whisper .   you are a valuable subject  brodrig .  you always suspect far more than is necessary  and i have but to take half your suggested precautions to be utterly safe .  we ll put it up to the lords .  we shall see what they say and take our measure accordingly .  the young man  i suppose  has made no hostile moves yet .     he report none .  but already he asks for reinforcements .     reinforcements .   the emperor s eyes narrowed with wonder .   what force has he .     ten ships of the line  sire  with a full complement of auxiliary vessels .  two of the ships are equipped with motors salvaged from the old grand fleet  and one has a battery of power artillery from the same source .  the other ships are new ones of the last fifty years  but are serviceable  nevertheless .     ten ships would seem adequate for any reasonable undertaking .  why  with less than ten ships my father won his first victories against the usurper .  who are these barbarians he s fighting .    the privy secretary raised a pair of supercilious eyebrows .   he refers to them as  the foundation .      the foundation .  what is it .     there is no record of it  sire .  i have searched the archives carefully .  the area of the galaxy indicated falls within the ancient province of anacreon  which two centuries since gave itself up to brigandage  barbarism  and anarchy .  there is no planet known as foundation in the province  however .  there was a vague reference to a group of scientists sent to that province just before its separation from our protection .  they were to prepare an encyclopedia .   he smiled thinly .   i believe they called it the encyclopedia foundation .     well   the emperor considered it somberly   that seems a tenuous connection to advance .     i m not advancing it  sire .  no word was ever received from that expedition after the growth of anarchy in that region .  if their descendants still live and retain their name  then they have reverted to barbarism most certainly .     and so he wants reinforcements .   the emperor bent a fierce glance at his secretary .   this is most peculiar  to propose to fight savages with ten ships and to ask for more before a blow is struck .  and yet i begin to remember this riose  he was a handsome boy of loyal family .  brodrig  there are complications in this that i don t penetrate .  there may be more importance in it than would seem .    his fingers played idly with the gleaming sheet that covered his stiffened legs .  he said   i need a man out there  one with eyes  brains and loyalty .  brodrig      the secretary bent a submissive head .   and the ships  sire .     not yet .   the emperor moaned softly as he shifted his position in gentle stages .  he pointed a feeble finger   not till we know more .  convene the council of lords for this day week .  it will be a good opportunity for the new appropriation as well .  i ll put that through or lives will end .    he leaned his aching head into the soothing tingle of the force field pillow   go now  brodrig  and send in the doctor .  he s the worst bumbler of the lot .          .  the war begins  from the radiating point of siwenna  the forces of the empire reached out cautiously into the black unknown of the periphery .  giant ships passed the vast distances that separated the vagrant stars at the galaxy s rim  and felt their way around the outermost edge of foundation influence .   worlds isolated in their new barbarism of two centuries felt the sensation once again of imperial overlords upon their soil .  allegiance was sworn in the face of the massive artillery covering capital cities .   garrisons were left  garrisons of men in imperial uniform with the spaceship and sun insignia upon their shoulders .  the old men took notice and remembered once again the forgotten tales of their grandfathers  fathers of the times when the universe was big  and rich  and peaceful and that same spaceship and sun ruled all .   then the great ships passed on to weave their line of forward bases further around the foundation .  and as each world was knotted into its proper place in the fabric  the report went back to bel riose at the general headquarters he had established on the rocky barrenness of a wandering sunless planet .   now riose relaxed and smiled grimly at ducem barr .   well  what do you think  patrician .     i .  of what value are my thoughts .  i am not a military man .   he took in with one wearily distasteful glance the crowded disorder of the rock bound room which had been carved out of the wall of a cavern of artificial air  light  and heat which marked the single bubble of life in the vastness of a bleak world .    for the help i could give you   he muttered   or would want to give you  you might return me to siwenna .     not yet .  not yet .   the general turned his chair to the comer which held the huge  brilliantly transparent sphere that mapped the old imperial prefect of anacreon and its neighboring sectors .   later  when this is over  you will go back to your books and to more .  i ll see to it that the estates of your family are restored to you and to your children for the rest of time .     thank you   said barr  with faint irony   but i lack your faith in the happy outcome of all this .    riose laughed harshly   don t start your prophetic croakings again .  this map speaks louder than all your woeful theories .   he caressed its curved invisible outline gently .   can you read a map in radial projection .  you can .  well  here  see for yourself .  the stars in gold represent the imperial territories .  the red stars are those in subjection to the foundation and the pink are those which are probably within the economic sphere of influence .  now watch      riose s hand covered a rounded knob  and slowly an area of hard  white pinpoints changed into a deepening blue .  like an inverted cup they folded about the red and the pink .    those blue stars have been taken over by my forces   said riose with quiet satisfaction   and they still advance .  no opposition has appeared anywhere .  the barbarians are quiet .  and particularly  no opposition has come from foundation forces .  they sleep peacefully and well .     you spread your force thinly  don t you .   asked barr .    as a matter of fact   said riose   despite appearances  i don t .  the key points which i garrison and fortify are relatively few  but they are carefully chosen .  the result is that the force expended is small  but the strategic result great .  there are many advantages  more than would ever appear to anyone who hasn t made a careful study of spatial tactics  but it is apparent to anyone  for instance  that i can base an attack from any point in an inclosing sphere  and that when i am finished it will be impossible for the foundation to attack at flank or rear .  i shall have no flank or rear with respect to them .    this strategy of the previous enclosure has been tried before  notably in the campaigns of loris vi  some two thousand years ago  but always imperfectly  always with the knowledge and attempted interference of the enemy .  this is different .     the ideal textbook case .   barr s voice was languid and indifferent .   riose was impatient   you still think my forces will fail .     they must .     you understand that there is no case in military history where an enclosure has been completed that the attacking forces have not eventually won  except where an outside navy exists in sufficient force to break the enclosure .     if you say so .     and you still adhere to your faith .     yes .    riose shrugged .   then do so .    barr allowed the angry silence to continue for a moment  then asked quietly   have you received an answer from the emperor .    riose removed a cigarette from a wall container behind his head  placed a filter tip between his lips and puffed it aflame carefully .  he said   you mean my request for reinforcements .  it came  but that s all .  just the answer .     no ships .     none .  i half expected that .  frankly  patrician  i should never have allowed myself to be stampeded by your theories into requesting them in the first place .  it puts me in a false light .     does it .     definitely .  ships are at a premium .  the civil wars of the last two centuries have smashed up more than half of the grand fleet and what s left is in pretty shaky condition .  you know it isn t as if the ships we build these days are worth anything .  i don t think there s a man in the galaxy today who can build a first rate hypernuclear motor .     i knew that   said the siwennian .  his eyes were thoughtful and introspective .   i didn t know that you knew it .  so his imperial majesty can spare no ships .  psychohistory could have predicted that  in fact  it probably did .  i should say that hari seldon s dead hand wins the opening round .    riose answered sharply   i have enough ships as it is .  your seldon wins nothing .  should the situation turn more serious  then more ships will be available .  as yet  the emperor does not know all the story .     indeed .  what haven t you told him .     obviously     your theories .   riose looked sardonic .   the story is  with all respect to you  inherently improbable .  if developments warrant  if events supply me with proof  then  but only then  would i make out the case of mortal danger .    and in addition   riose drove on  casually   the story  unbolstered by fact  has a flavor of lese majeste that could scarcely be pleasant to his imperial majesty .    the old patrician smiled .   you mean that telling him his august throne is in danger of subversion by a parcel of ragged barbarians from the ends of the universe is not a warning to be believed or appreciated .  then you expect nothing from him .     unless you count a special envoy as something .     and why a special envoy .     it s an old custom .  a direct representative of the crown is present on every military campaign which is under government auspices .     really .  why .     it s a method of preserving the symbol of personal imperial leadership in all campaigns .  it s gained a secondary function of insuring the fidelity of generals .  it doesn t always succeed in that respect .     you ll find that inconvenient  general .  extraneous authority  i mean .     i don t doubt that   riose reddened faintly   but it can t be helped      the receiver at the general s hand glowed warmly  and with an unobtrusive jar  the cylindered communication popped into its slot .  riose unrolled it   good .  this is it .    ducem barr raised a mildly questioning eyebrow .   riose said   you know we ve captured one of these trader people .  alive     and with his ship intact .     i ve heard talk of it .     well  they ve just brought him in  and we ll have him here in a minute .  you keep your seat  patrician .  i want you here when i m questioning him .  it s why i asked you here today in the first place .  you may understand him where i might miss important points .    the door signal sounded and a touch of the general s toe swung the door wide .  the man who stood on the threshold was tall and bearded  wore a short coat of a soft  leathery plastic  with an attached hood shoved back on his neck .  his hands were free  and if he noticed the men about him were armed  he did not trouble to indicate it .   he stepped in casually  and looked about with calculating eyes .  he favored the general with a rudimentary wave of the hand and a half nod .    your name .   demanded riose  crisply .    lathan devers .   the trader hooked his thumbs into his wide and gaudy belt .   are you the boss here .     you are a trader of the foundation .     that s right .  listen  if you re the boss  you d better tell your hired men here to lay off my cargo .    the general raised his head and regarded the prisoner coldly .   answer questions .  do not volunteer orders .     all right .  i m agreeable .  but one of your boys blasted a two foot hole in his chest already  by sticking his fingers where he wasn t supposed to .    riose shifted his gaze to the lieutenant in charge .   is this man telling the truth .  your report  vrank  had it that no lives were lost .     none were  sir   the lieutenant spoke stiffly  apprehensively   at the time .  there was later some disposition to search the ship  there having arisen a rumor that a woman was aboard .  instead  sir  many instruments of unknown nature were located  instruments which the prisoner claims to be his stock in trade .  one of them flashed on handling  and the soldier holding it died .    the general turned back to the trader .   does your ship carry nuclear explosives .     galaxy  no .  what for .  that fool grabbed a nuclear puncher  wrong end forward and set at maximum dispersion .  you re not supposed to do that .  might as well point a neut gun at your head .  i d have stopped him  if five men weren t sitting on my chest .    riose gestured at the waiting guard   you go .  the captured ship is to he sealed against all intrusion .  sit down  devers .    the trader did so  in the spot indicated  and withstood stolidly the hard scrutiny of the imperial general and the curious glance of the siwennian patrician .   riose said   you re a sensible man  devers .     thank you .  are you impressed by my face  or do you want something .  tell you what  though .  i m a good business man .     it s about the same thing .  you surrendered your ship when you might have decided to waste our ammunition and have yourself blown to electron dust .  it could result in good treatment for you  if you continue that sort of outlook on life .     good treatment is what i mostly crave  boss .     good  and co operation is what i mostly crave .   riose smiled  and said in a low aside to ducem barr   i hope the word  crave  means what i think it does .  did you ever hear such a barbarous jargon .    devers said blandly   right .  i check you .  but what kind of co operation are you talking about  boss .  to tell you straight  i don t know where i stand .   he looked about him   where s this place  for instance  and     what s the idea .     ah  i ve neglected the other half of the introductions .  i apologize .   riose was in good humor .   that gentleman is ducem barr  patrician of the empire .  i am bel riose  peer of the empire  and general of the third class in the armed forces of his imperial majesty .    the trader s jaw slackened .  then   the empire .  i mean the old empire they taught us about at school .  huh .  funny .  i always had the sort of notion that it didn t exist any more .     look about you .  it does   said riose grimly .    might have known it though   and lathan devers pointed his beard at the ceiling .   that was a mightily polished looking set of craft that took my tub .  no kingdom of the periphery could have turned them out .   his brow furrowed .   so what s the game  boss .  or do i call you general .     me game is war .     empire versus foundation  that it .     right .     why .     i think you know why .    the trader stared sharply and shook his head .   riose let the other deliberate  then said softly   i m sure you know why .    lathan devers muttered   warm here   and stood up to remove his hooded jacket .  then he sat down again and stretched his legs out before him .    you know   he said  comfortably   i figure you re thinking i ought to jump up with a whoop and lay about me .  i can catch you before you could move if i choose my time  and this old fellow who sits there and doesn t say anything couldn t do much to stop me .     but you won t   said riose  confidently .    i won t   agreed devers  amiably .   first off  killing you wouldn t stop the war  i suppose .  there are more generals where you came from .     very accurately calculated .     besides which  i d probably be slammed down about two seconds after i got you  and killed fast  or maybe slow  depending .  but i d be killed  and i never like to count on that when i m making plans .  it doesn t pay off .     i said you were a sensible man .     but there s one thing i would like  boss .  i d like you to tell me what you mean when you say i know why you re jumping us .  i don t  and guessing games bother me no end .     yes .  ever hear of hari seldon .     no .  i said i don t like guessing games .    riose flicked a side glance at ducem barr who smiled with a narrow gentleness and resumed his inwardly dreaming expression .   riose said with a grimace   don t you play games  devers .  there is a tradition  or a fable  or sober history     i don t care what     upon your foundation  that eventually you will found the second empire .  i know quite a detailed version of hari seldon s psychohistorical claptrap  and your eventual plans of aggression against the empire .     that so .   devers nodded thoughtfully .   and who told you all that .     does that matter .   said riose with dangerous smoothness .   you re here to question nothing .  i want what you know about the seldon fable .     but if it s a fable       don t play with words  devers .     i m not .  in fact  i ll give it to you straight .  you know all i know about it .  it s silly stuff  half baked .  every world has its yams  you can t keep it away from them .  yes  i ve heard that sort of talk  seldon  second empire  and so on .  they put kids to sleep at night with the stuff .  the young squirts curl up in the spare rooms with their pocket projectors and suck up seldon thrillers .  but it s strictly non adult .  nonintelligent adult  anyway .   the trader shook his head .   the imperial general s eyes were dark .   is that really so .  you waste your lies  man .  i ve been on the planet  terminus .  i know your foundation .  i ve looked it in the face .     and you ask me .  me  when i haven t kept foot on it for two months at a piece in ten years .  you are wasting your time .  but go ahead with your war  if it s fables you re after .    and barr spoke for the first time  mildly   you are so confident then that the foundation will win .    the trader turned .  he flushed faintly and an old scar on one temple showed whitely   hm m m  the silent partner .  how d you squeeze that out of what i said  doc .    riose nodded very slightly at barr  and the siwennian continued in a low voice   because the notion would bother you if you thought your world might lose this war  and suffer the bitter reapings of defeat  i know .  my world once did  and still does .    lathan devers fumbled his beard  looked from one of his opponents to the other  then laughed shortly .   does he always talk like that  boss .  listen   he grew serious   what s defeat .  i ve seen wars and i ve seen defeats .  what if the winner does take over .  who s bothered .  me .  guys like me .   he shook his head in derision .    get this   the trader spoke forcefully and earnestly   there are five or six fat slobs who usually run an average planet .  they get the rabbit punch  but i m not losing peace of mind over them .  see .  the people .  the ordinary run of guys .  sure  some get killed  and the rest pay extra taxes for a while .  but it settles itself out  it runs itself down .  and then it s the old situation again with a different five or six .    ducem barr s nostrils flared  and the tendons of his old right hand jerked  but he said nothing .   lathan devers  eyes were on him .  they missed nothing .  he said   look .  i spend my life in space for my five and dime gadgets and my beer and pretzel kickback from the combines .  there s fat fellows back there   his thumb jerked over his shoulder and back   that sit home and collect my year s income every minute     out of skimmings from me and more like me .  suppose you run the foundation .  you ll still need us .  you ll need us more than ever the combines do     because you d not know your way around  and we could bring in the hard cash .  we d make a better deal with the empire .  yes  we would  and i m a man of business .  if it adds up to a plus mark  i m for it .    and he stared at the two with sardonic belligerence .   the silence remained unbroken for minutes  and then a cylinder rattled into its slot .  the general flipped it open  glanced at the neat printing and in circuited the visuals with a sweep .    prepare plan indicating position of each ship in action .  await orders on full armed defensive .    he reached for his cape .  as he fastened it about his shoulders  he whispered in a stiff lipped monotone to barr   i m leaving this man to you .  i ll expect results .  this is war and i can be cruel to failures .  remember .   he left  with a salute to both .   lathan devers looked after him   well  something s hit him where it hurts .  what goes on .     a battle  obviously   said barr  gruffly .   the forces of the foundation are coming out for their first battle .  you d better come along .    there were armed soldiers in the room .  their bearing was respectful and their faces were hard .  devers followed the proud old siwennian patriarch out of the room .   the room to which they were led was smaller  barer .  it contained two beds  a visi screen  and shower and sanitary facilities .  the soldiers marched out  and the thick door boomed hollowly shut .    hmp .   devers stared disapprovingly about .   this looks permanent .     it is   said barr  shortly .  the old siwennian turned his back .   the trader said irritably   what s your game  doc .     i have no game .  you re in my charge  that s all .    the trader rose and advanced .  his bulk towered over the unmoving patrician .   yes .  but you re in this cell with me and when you were marched here the guns were pointed just as hard at you as at me .  listen  you were all boiled up about my notions on the subject of war and peace .    he waited fruitlessly   all fight  let me ask you something .  you said your country was licked once .  by whom .  comet people from the outer nebulae .    barr looked up .   by the empire .     that so .  then what are you doing here .    barr maintained an eloquent silence .   the trader thrust out a lower lip and nodded his head slowly .  he slipped off the flat linked bracelet that hugged his fight wrist and held it out .   what do you think of that .   he wore the mate to it on his left .   the siwennian took the ornament .  he responded slowly to the trader s gesture and put it on .  the odd tingling at the wrist passed away quickly .   devers  voice changed at once .   right  doc  you ve got the action now .  just speak casually .  if this room is wired  they won t get a thing .  that s a field distorter you ve got there  genuine mallow design .  sells for twenty five credits on any world from here to the outer rim .  you get it free .  hold your lips still when you talk and take it easy .  you ve got to get the trick of it .    ducem barr was suddenly weary .  the trader s boring eyes were luminous and urging .  he felt unequal to their demands .   barr said   what do you want .   the words slurred from between unmoving lips .    i ve told you .  you make mouth noises like what we call a patriot .  yet your own world has been mashed up by the empire  and here you are playing ball with the empire s fair haired general .  doesn t make sense  does it .    barr said   i have done my part .  a conquering imperial viceroy is dead because of me .     that so .  recently .     forty years ago .     forty  .  .  .  years  .  .  .  ago .   the words seemed to have meaning to the trader .  he frowned   that s a long time to live on memories .  does that young squirt in the general s uniform know about it .    barr nodded .   devers  eyes were dark with thought .   you want the empire to win .    and the old siwennian patrician broke out in sudden deep anger   may the empire and all its works perish in universal catastrophe .  all siwenna prays that daily .  i had brothers once  a sister  a father .  but i have children now  grandchildren .  the general knows where to find them .    devers waited .   barr continued in a whisper   but that would not stop me if the results in view warranted the risk .  they would know how to die .    the trader said gently   you killed a viceroy once  huh .  you know  i recognize a few things .  we once had a mayor  hober mallow his name was .  he visited siwenna  that s your world  isn t it .  he met a man named barr .    ducem barr stared hard  suspiciously .   what do you know of this .     what every trader on the foundation knows .  you might be a smart old fellow put in here to get on my right side .  sure  they d point guns at you  and you d hate the empire and be all out for its smashing .  then i d fall all over you and pour out my heart to you  and wouldn t the general be pleased .  there s not much chance of that  doc .    but just the same i d like to have you prove that you re the son of onum barr of siwenna     the sixth and youngest who escaped the massacre .    ducem barr s hand shook as he opened the flat metal box in a wall recess .  the metal object he withdrew clanked softly as he thrust it into the trader s hands .   look at that   he said .   devers stared .  he held the swollen central link of the chain close to his eyes and swore softly .   that s mallow s monogram  or i m a space struck rookie  and the design is fifty years old if it s a day .    he looked up and smiled .    shake  doc .  a man sized nuclear shield is all the proof i need   and he held out his large hand .         .  the favorite  the tiny ships had appeared out of the vacant depths and darted into the midst of the armada .  without a shot or a burst of energy  they weaved through the ship swollen area  then blasted on and out  while the imperial wagons turned after them like lumbering beasts .  there were two noiseless flares that pinpointed space as two of the tiny gnats shriveled in atomic disintegration  and the rest were gone .   the great ships searched  then returned to their original task  and world by world  the great web of the enclosure continued .   brodrig s uniform was stately  carefully tailored and as carefully worn .  his walk through the gardens of the obscure planet wanda  now temporary imperial headquarters  was leisurely  his expression was somber .   bel riose walked with him  his field uniform open at the collar  and doleful in its monotonous gray black .   riose indicated the smooth black bench under the fragrant tree fern whose large spatulate leaves lifted flatly against the white sun .   see that  sir .  it is a relic of the imperium .  the ornamented benches  built for lovers  linger on  fresh and useful  while the factories and the palaces collapse into unremembered ruin .    he seated himself  while cleon ii s privy secretary stood erect before him and clipped the leaves above neatly with precise swings of his ivory staff .   riose crossed his legs and offered a cigarette to the other .  he fingered one himself as he spoke   it is what one would expect from the enlightened wisdom of his imperial majesty to send so competent an observer as yourself .  it relieves any anxiety i might have felt that the press of more important and more immediate business might perhaps force into the shadows a small campaign on the periphery .     the eyes of the emperor are everywhere   said brodrig  mechanically .   we do not underestimate the importance of the campaign  yet still it would seem that too great an emphasis is being placed upon its difficulty .  surely their little ships are no such barrier that we must move through the intricate preliminary maneuver of an enclosure .    riose flushed  but he maintained his equilibrium .   i can not risk the lives of my men  who are few enough  or the destruction of my ships which are irreplaceable  by a too rash attack .  the establishment of an enclosure will quarter my casualties in the ultimate attack  howsoever difficult it be .  the military reasons for that i took the liberty to explain yesterday .     well  well  i am not a military man .  in this case  you assure me that what seems patently and obviously right is  in reality  wrong .  we will allow that .  yet your caution shoots far beyond that .  in your second communication  you requested reinforcements .  and these  against an enemy poor  small  and barbarous  with whom you have had not one  skirmish at the time .  to desire more forces under the circumstances would savor almost of incapacity or worse  had not your earlier career given sufficient proof of your boldness and imagination .     i thank you   said the general  coldly   but i would remind you that there is a difference between boldness and blindness .  there is a place for a decisive gamble when you know your enemy and can calculate the risks at least roughly  but to move at all against an unknown enemy is boldness in itself .  you might as well ask why the same man sprints safely across an obstacle course in the day  and falls over the furniture in his room at night .    brodrig swept away the other s words with a neat flirt of the fingers .   dramatic  but not satisfactory .  you have been to this barbarian world yourself .  you have in addition this enemy prisoner you coddle  this trader .  between yourself and the prisoner you are not in a night fog .     no .  i pray you to remember that a world which has developed in isolation for two centuries can not be interpreted to the point of intelligent attack by a month s visit .  i am a soldier  not a cleft chinned  barrel chested hero of a subetheric trimensional thriller .  nor can a single prisoner  and one who is an obscure member of an economic group which has no close connection with the enemy world introduce me to all the inner secrets of enemy strategy .     you have questioned him .     i have .     well .     it has been useful  but not vitally so .  his ship is tiny  of no account .  he sells little toys which are amusing if nothing else .  i have a few of the cleverest which i intend sending to the emperor as curiosities .  naturally  there is a good deal about the ship and its workings which i do not understand  but then i am not a tech man .     but you have among you those who are   pointed out brodrig .    i  too  am aware of that   replied the general in faintly caustic tones .   but the fools have far to go before they could meet my needs .  i have already sent for clever men who can understand the workings of the odd nuclear field circuits the ship contains .  i have received no answer .     men of that type can not be spared  general .  surely  there must be one man of your vast province who understands nucleics .     were there such a one  i would have him heal the limping  invalid motors that power two of my small fleet of ships .  two ships of my meager ten that can not fight a major battle for lack of sufficient power supply .  one fifth of my force condemned to the carrion activity of consolidating positions behind the lines .    the secretary s fingers fluttered impatiently .   your position is not unique in that respect  general .  the emperor has similar troubles .    the general threw away his shredded  never lit cigarette  lit another  and shrugged .   well  it is beside the immediate point  this lack of first class tech men .  except that i might have made more progress with my prisoner were my psychic probe in proper order .    the secretary s eyebrows lifted .   you have a probe .     an old one .  a superannuated one which fails me the one time i needed it .  i set it up during the prisoner s sleep  and received nothing .  so much for the probe .  i have tried it on my own men and the reaction is quite proper  but again there is not one among my staff of tech men who can tell me why it fails upon the prisoner .  ducem barr  who is a theoretician of parts  though no mechanic  says the psychic structure of the prisoner may be unaffected by the probe since from childhood he has been subjected to alien environments and neural stimuli .  i don t know .  but he may yet be useful .  i save him in that hope .    brodrig leaned on his staff .  a shall see if a specialist is available in the capital .  in the meanwhile  what of this other man you just mentioned  this siwennian .  you keep too many enemies in your good graces .     he knows the enemy .  he  too  i keep for future reference and the help he may afford me .     but he is a siwennian and the son of a proscribed rebel .     he is old and powerless  and his family acts as hostage .     i see .  yet i think that i should speak to this trader  myself .     certainly .     alone   the secretary added coldly  making his point .    certainly   repeated riose  blandly .   as a loyal subject of the emperor  i accept his personal representative as my superior .  however  since the trader is at the permanent base  you will have to leave the front areas at an interesting moment .     yes .  interesting in what way .     interesting in that the enclosure is complete today .  interesting in that within the week  the twentieth fleet of the border advances inward towards the core of resistance .   riose smiled and turned away .   in a vague way  brodrig felt punctured .         .  bribery  sergeant mori luk made an ideal soldier of the ranks .  he came from the huge agricultural planets of the pleiades where only army life could break the bond to the soil and the unavailing life of drudgery  and he was typical of that background .  unimaginative enough to face danger without fear  he was strong and agile enough to face it successfully .  he accepted orders instantly  drove the men under him unbendingly and adored his general unswervingly .   and yet with that  he was of a sunny nature .  if he killed a man in the line of duty without a scrap of hesitation  it was also without a scrap of animosity .   that sergeant luk should signal at the door before entering was further a sign of tact  for he would have been perfectly within his rights to enter without signaling .   the two within looked up from their evening meal and one reached out with his foot to cut off the cracked voice which rattled out of the battered pocket transmitter with bright liveliness .    more books .   asked lathan devers .   the sergeant held out the tightly wound cylinder of film and scratched his neck .   it belongs to engineer orre  but he ll have to have it back .  he s going to send it to his kids  you know  like what you might call a souvenir  you know .    ducem barr turned the cylinder in his hands with interest .   and where did the engineer get it .  he hasn t a transmitter also  has he .    the sergeant shook his head emphatically .  he pointed to the knocked about remnant at the foot of the bed .   that s the only one in the place .  this fellow  orre  now  he got that book from one of these pig pen worlds out here we captured .  they had it in a big building by itself and he had to kill a few of the natives that tried to stop him from taking it .    he looked at it appraisingly .   it makes a good souvenir     for kids .    he paused  then said stealthily   there s big news floating about  by the way .  it s only scuttlebutt  but even so  it s too good to keep .  the general did it again .   and he nodded slowly  gravely .    that so .   said devers .   and what did he do .     finished the enclosure  that s all .   the sergeant chuckled with a fatherly pride .   isn t he the corker  though .  didn t he work it fine .  one of the fellows who s strong on fancy talk  says it went as smooth and even as the music of the spheres  whatever they are .     the big offensive starts now .   asked barr  mildly .    hope so   was the boisterous response .   i want to get back on my ship now that my arm is in one piece again .  i m tired of sitting on my scupper out here .     so am i   muttered devers  suddenly and savagely .  there was a bit of underlip caught in his teeth  and he worried it .   the sergeant looked at him doubtfully  and said   i d better go now .  the captain s round is due and i d just as soon he didn t catch me in here .    he paused at the door .   by the way  sir   he said with sudden  awkward shyness to the trader   i heard from my wife .  she says that little freezer you gave me to send her works fine .  it doesn t cost her anything  and she just about keeps a month s supply of food froze up complete .  i appreciate it .     it s all right .  forget it .    the great door moved noiselessly shut behind the grinning sergeant .   ducem barr got out of his chair .   well  he gives us a fair return for the freezer .  let s take a look at this new book .  ahh  the title is gone .    he unrolled a yard or so of the film and looked through at the light .  then he murmured   well  skewer me through the scupper  as the sergeant says .  this is  the garden of summa   devers .     that so .   said the trader  without interest .  he shoved aside what was left of his dinner .   sit down  barr .  listening to this old time literature isn t doing me any good .  you heard what the sergeant said .     yes  i did .  what of it .     the offensive will start .  and we sit here .     where do you want to sit .     you know what i mean .  there s no use just waiting .     isn t there .   barr was carefully removing the old film from the transmitter and installing the new .   you told me a good deal of foundation history in the last month  and it seems that the great leaders of past crises did precious little more than sit     and wait .     ah  barr  but they knew where they were going .     did they .  i suppose they said they did when it was over  and for all i know maybe they did .  but there s no proof that things would not have worked out as well or better if they had not known where they were going .  the deeper economic and sociological forces aren t directed by individual men .    devers sneered .   no way of telling that things wouldn t have worked out worse  either .  you re arguing tail end backwards .   his eyes were brooding .   you know  suppose i blasted him .     whom .  riose .     yes .    barr sighed .  his aging eyes were troubled with a reflection of the long past .   assassination isn t the way out  devers .  i once tried it  under provocation  when i was twenty     but it solved nothing .  i removed a villain from siwenna  but not the imperial yoke  and it was the imperial yoke and not the villain that mattered .     but riose is not just a villain  doc .  he s the whole blamed army .  it would fall apart without him .  they hang on him like babies .  the sergeant out there slobbers every time he mentions him .     even so .  there are other armies and other leaders .  you must go deeper .  there is this brodrig  for instance     no one more than he has the ear of the emperor .  he could demand hundreds of ships where riose must struggle with ten .  i know him by reputation .     that so .  what about him .   the trader s eyes lost in frustration what they gained in sharp interest .    you want a pocket outline .  he s a low born rascal who has by unfailing flattery tickled the whims of the emperor .  he s well hated by the court aristocracy  vermin themselves  because he can lay claim to neither family nor humility .  he is the emperor s adviser in all things  and the emperor s too in the worst things .  he is faithless by choice but loyal by necessity .  there is not a man in the empire as subtle in villainy or as crude in his pleasures .  and they say there is no way to the emperor s favor but through him  and no way to his  but through infamy .     wow .   devers pulled thoughtfully at his neatly trimmed beard .   and he s the old boy the emperor sent out here to keep an eye on riose .  do you know i have an idea .     i do now .     suppose this brodrig takes a dislike to our young army s delight .     he probably has already .  he s not noted for a capacity for liking .     suppose it gets really bad .  the emperor might hear about it  and riose might be in trouble .     uh huh .  quite likely .  but how do you propose to get that to happen .     i don t know .  i suppose he could be bribed .    the patrician laughed gently .   yes  in a way  but not in the manner you bribed the sergeant     not with a pocket freezer .  and even if you reach his scale  it wouldn t be worth it .  there s probably no one so easily bribed  but he lacks even the fundamental honesty of honorable corruption .  he doesn t stay bribed  not for any sum .  think of something else .    devers swung a leg over his knee and his toe nodded quickly and restlessly .   it s the first hint  though      he stopped  the door signal was flashing once again  and the sergeant was on the threshold once more .  he was excited  and his broad face was red and unsmiling .    sir   he began  in an agitated attempt at deference   i am very thankful for the freezer  and you have always spoken to me very fine  although i am only the son of a farmer and you are great lords .    his pleiades accent had grown thick  almost too much so for easy comprehension  and with excitement  his lumpish peasant derivation wiped out completely the soldierly bearing so long and so painfully cultivated .   barr said softly   what is it  sergeant .     lord brodrig is coming to see you .  tomorrow .  i know  because the captain told me to have my men ready for dress review tomorrow for  .  .  .  for him .  i thought     i might warn you .    barr said   thank you  sergeant  we appreciate that .  but it s all right  man  no need for      but the look on sergeant luk s face was now unmistakably one of fear .  he spoke in a rough whisper   you don t hear the stories the men tell about him .  he has sold himself to the space fiend .  no  don t laugh .  there are most terrible tales told about him .  they say he has men with blast guns who follow him everywhere  and when he wants pleasure  he just tells them to blast down anyone they meet .  and they do     and he laughs .  they say even the emperor is in terror of him  and that he forces the emperor to raise taxes and won t let him listen to the complaints of the people .    and he hates the general  that s what they say .  they say he would like to kill the general  because the general is so great and wise .  but he can t because our general is a match for anyone and he knows lord brodrig is a bad  un .    the sergeant blinked  smiled in a sudden incongruous shyness at his own outburst  and backed toward the door .  he nodded his head  jerkily .   you mind my words .  watch him .    he ducked out .   and devers looked up  hard eyed .   this breaks things our way  doesn t it  doc .     it depends   said barr  dryly   on brodrig  doesn t it .    but devers was thinking  not listening .   he was thinking hard .   lord brodrig ducked his head as he stepped into the cramped living quarters of the trading ship  and his two armed guards followed quickly  with bared guns and the professionally hard scowls of the hired bravos .   the privy secretary had little of the look of the lost soul about him just then .  if the space fiend had bought him  he had left no visible mark of possession .  rather might brodrig have been considered a breath of court fashion come to enliven the hard  bare ugliness of an army base .   the stiff  tight lines of his sheened and immaculate costume gave him the illusion of height  from the very top of which his cold  emotionless eyes stared down the declivity of a long nose at the trader .  the mother of pearl ruches at his wrists fluttered filmily as he brought his ivory stick to the ground before him and leaned upon it daintily .    no   he said  with a little gesture   you remain here .  forget your toys  i am not interested in them .    he drew forth a chair  dusted it carefully with the iridescent square of fabric attached to the top of his white stick  and seated himself .  devers glanced towards the mate to the chair  but brodrig said lazily   you will stand in the presence of a peer of the realm .    he smiled .   devers shrugged .   if you re not interested in my stock in trade  what am i here for .    the privy secretary waited coldly  and devers added a slow   sir .     for privacy   said the secretary .   now is it likely that i would come two hundred parsecs through space to inspect trinkets .  it s you i want to see .   he extracted a small pink tablet from an engraved box and placed it delicately between his teeth .  he sucked it slowly and appreciatively .    for instance   he said   who are you .  are you really a citizen of this barbarian world that is creating all this fury of military frenzy .    devers nodded gravely .    and you were really captured by him after the beginning of this squabble he calls a war .  i am referring to our young general .    devers nodded again .    so .  very well  my worthy outlander .  i see your fluency of speech is at a minimum .  i shall smooth the way for you .  it seems that our general here is fighting an apparently meaningless war with frightful transports of energy     and this over a forsaken fleabite of a world at the end of nowhere  which to a logical man would not seem worth a single blast of a single gun .  yet the general is not illogical .  on the contrary  i would say he was extremely intelligent .  do you follow me .     can t say i do  sir .    the secretary inspected his fingernails and said   listen further  then .  the general would not waste his men and ships on a sterile feat of glory .  i know he talks of glory and of imperial honor  but it is quite obvious that the affectation of being one of the insufferable old demigods of the heroic age won t wash .  there is something more than glory hereand he does take queer  unnecessary care of you .  now if you were my prisoner and told me as little of use as you have our general  i would slit open your abdomen and strangle you with your own intestines .    devers remained wooden .  his eyes moved slightly  first to one of the secretary s bully boys  and then to the other .  they were ready  eagerly ready .   the secretary smiled .   well  now  you re a silent devil .  according to the general  even a psychic probe made no impression  and that was a mistake on his part  by the way  for it convinced me that our young military whizz bang was lying .   he seemed in high humor .    my honest tradesman   he said   i have a psychic probe of my own  one that ought to suit you peculiarly well .  you see this      and between thumb and forefinger  held negligently  were intricately designed  pink and yellow rectangles which were most definitely obvious in identity .   devers said so .   it looks like cash   he said .    cash it is     and the best cash of the empire  for it is backed by my estates  which are more extensive than the emperor s own .  a hundred thousand credits .  all here .  between two fingers .  yours .     for what  sir .  i am a good trader  but all trades go in both directions .     for what .  for the truth .  what is the general after .  why is he fighting this war .    lathan devers sighed  and smoothed his beard thoughtfully .    what he s after .   his eyes were following the motions of the secretary s hands as he counted the money slowly  bill by bill .   in a word  the empire .     hmp .  how ordinary .  it always comes to that in the end .  but how .  what is the road that leads from the galaxy s edge to the peak of empire so broadly and invitingly .     the foundation   said devers  bitterly   has secrets .  they have books  old books     so old that the language they are in is only known to a few of the top men .  but the secrets are shrouded in ritual and religion  and none may use them .  i tried and now i am here     and there is a death sentence waiting for me  there .     i see .  and these old secrets .  come  for one hundred thousand i deserve the intimate details .     the transmutation of elements   said devers  shortly .   the secretary s eyes narrowed and lost some of their detachment .   i have been told that practical transmutation is impossible by the laws of nucleics .     so it is  if nuclear forces are used .  but the ancients were smart boys .  there are sources of power greater than the nuclei and more fundamental .  if the foundation used those sources as i suggested      devers felt a soft  creeping sensation in his stomach .  the bait was dangling  the fish was nosing it .   the secretary said suddenly   continue .  the general  i am sure  is aware of a this .  but what does he intend doing once he finishes this opera bouffe affair .    devers kept his voice rock steady .   with transmutation he controls the economy of the whole set up of your empire .  mineral holdings won t be worth a sneeze when riose can make tungsten out of aluminum and iridium out of iron .  an entire production system based on the scarcity of certain elements and the abundance of others is thrown completely out of whack .  there ll be the greatest disjointment the empire has ever seen  and only riose will be able to stop it .  and there is the question of this new power i mentioned  the use of which won t give riose religious heebies .    there s nothing that can stop him now .  he s got the foundation by the back of the neck  and once he s finished with it  he ll be emperor in two years .     so .   brodrig laughed lightly .   iridium out of iron  that s what you said  isn t it .  come  i ll tell you a state secret .  do you know that the foundation has already been in communication with the general .    devers  back stiffened .    you look surprised .  why not .  it seems logical now .  they offered him a hundred tons of iridium a year to make peace .  a hundred tons of iron converted to iridium in violation of their religious principles to save their necks .  fair enough  but no wonder our rigidly incorruptible general refused     when he can have the iridium and the empire as well .  and poor cleon called him his one honest general .  my bewhiskered merchant  you have earned your money .    he tossed it  and devers scrambled after the flying bills .   lord brodrig stopped at the door and turned .   one reminder  trader .  my playmates with the guns here have neither middle ears  tongues  education  nor intelligence .  they can neither hear  speak  write  nor even make sense to a psychic probe .  but they are very expert at interesting executions .  i have bought you  man  at one hundred thousand credits .  you will be good and worthy merchandise .  should you forget that you are bought at any time and attempt to  .  .  .  say  .  .  .  repeat our conversation to riose  you will be executed .  but executed my way .    and in that delicate face there were sudden hard lines of eager cruelty that changed the studied smile into a red lipped snarl .  for one fleeting second  devers saw that space fiend who had bought his buyer  look out of his buyer s eyes .   silently  he preceded the two thrusting blast guns of brodrig s  playmates  to his quarters .   and to ducem barr s question  he said with brooding satisfaction   no  that s the queerest part of it .  he bribed me .   two months of difficult war had left their mark on bel riose .  there was heavy handed gravity about him  and he was short tempered .   it was with impatience that he addressed the worshiping sergeant luk .   wait outside  soldier  and conduct these men back to their quarters when i am through .  no one is to enter until i call .  no one at all  you understand .    the sergeant saluted himself stiffly out of the room  and riose with muttered disgust scooped up the waiting papers on his desk  threw them into the top drawer and slammed it shut .    take seats   he said shortly  to the waiting two .   i haven t much time .  strictly speaking  i shouldn t be here at all  but it is necessary to see you .    he turned to ducem barr  whose long fingers were caressing with interest the crystal cube in which was set the simulacrum of the lined  austere face of his imperial majesty  cleon ii .    in the first place  patrician   said the general   your seldon is losing .  to be sure  he battles well  for these men of the foundation swarm like senseless bees and fight like madmen .  every planet is defended viciously  and once taken  every planet heaves so with rebellion it is as much trouble to hold as to conquer .  but they are taken  and they are held .  your seldon is losing .     but he has not yet lost   murmured barr politely .    the foundation itself retains less optimism .  they offer me millions in order that i may not put this seldon to the final test .     so rumor goes .     ah  is rumor preceding me .  does it prate also of the latest .     what is the latest .     why  that lord brodrig  the darling of the emperor  is now second in command at his own request .    devers spoke for the first time .   at his own request  boss .  how come .  or are you growing to like the fellow .   he chuckled .   riose said  calmly   no  can t say i do .  it s just that he bought the office at what i considered a fair and adequate price .     such as .     such as a request to the emperor for reinforcements .    devers  contemptuous smile broadened .    he has communicated with the emperor  huh .  and i take it  boss  you re just waiting for these reinforcements  but they ll come any day .  right .     wrong .  they have already come .  five ships of the line  smooth and strong  with a personal message of congratulations from the emperor  and more ships on the way .  what s wrong  trader .   he asked  sardonically .   devers spoke through suddenly frozen lips .   nothing .    riose strode out from behind his desk and faced the trader  hand on the butt of his blast gun .    i say  what s wrong  trader .  the news would seem to disturb you .  surely  you have no sudden birth of interest in the foundation .     i haven t .     yes     there are queer points about you .     that so  boss .   devers smiled tightly  and balled the fists in his pockets .   just you line them up and i ll knock them down for you .     here they are .  you were caught easily .  you surrendered at first blow with a burnt out shield .  you re quite ready to desert your world  and that without a price .  interesting  all this  isn t it .     i crave to be on the winning side  boss .  i m a sensible man  you called me that yourself .    riose said with tight throatiness   granted .  yet no trader since has been captured .  no trade ship but has had the speed to escape at choice .  no trade ship but has had a screen that could take all the beating a light cruiser could give it  should it choose to fight .  and no trader but has fought to death when occasion warranted .  traders have been traced as the leaders and instigators of the guerilla warfare on occupied planets and of the flying raids in occupied space .    are you the only sensible man then .  you neither fight nor flee  but turn traitor without urging .  you are unique  amazingly unique     in fact  suspiciously unique .    devers said softly   i take your meaning  but you have nothing on me .  i ve been here now six months  and i ve been a good boy .     so you have  and i have repaid you by good treatment .  i have left your ship undisturbed and treated you with every consideration .  yet you fall short .  freely offered information  for instance  on your gadgets might have been helpful .  the atomic principles on which they are built would seem to be used in some of the foundation s nastiest weapons .  right .     i am only a trader   said devers   and not one of these bigwig technicians .  i sell the stuff  i don t make it .     well  that will be seen shortly .  it is what i came here for .  for instance  your ship will be searched for a personal force shield .  you have never worn one  yet all soldiers of the foundation do .  it will be significant evidence that there is information you do not choose to give me .  right .    there was no answer .  he continued   and there will be more direct evidence .  i have brought with me the psychic probe .  it failed once before  but contact with the enemy is a liberal education .    his voice was smoothly threatening and devers felt the gun thrust hard in his midriff     the general s gun  hitherto in its holster .   the general said quietly   you will remove your wristband and any other metal ornament you wear and give them to me .  slowly .  atomic fields can be distorted  you see  and psychic probes might probe only into static .  that s right .  .  i ll take it .    the receiver on the general s desk was glowing and a message capsule clicked into the slot  near which barr stood and still held the trimensional imperial bust .   riose stepped behind his desk  with his blast gun held ready .  he said to barr   you too  patrician .  your wristband condemns you .  you have been helpful earlier  however  and i am not vindictive  but i shall judge the fate of your behostaged family by the results of the psychic probe .    and as riose leaned over to take out the message capsule  barr lifted the crystal enveloped bust of cleon and quietly and methodically brought it down upon the general s head .   it happened too suddenly for devers to grasp .  it was as if a sudden demon had grown into the old man .    out .   said barr  in a tooth clenched whisper .   quickly .   he seized riose s dropped blaster and buried it in his blouse .   sergeant luk turned as they emerged from the narrowest possible crack of the door .   barr said easily   lead on  sergeant .    devers closed the door behind him .   sergeant luk led in silence to their quarters  and then  with the briefest pause  continued onward  for there was the nudge of a blast gun muzzle in his ribs  and a hard voice in his ears which said   to the trade ship .    devers stepped forward to open the air lock  and barr said   stand where you are  luk .  you ve been a decent man  and we re not going to kill you .    but the sergeant recognized the monogram on the gun .  he cried in choked fury   you ve killed the general .    with a wild  incoherent yell  he charged blindly upon the blasting fury of the gun and collapsed in blasted ruin .   the trade ship was rising above the dead planet before the signal lights began their eerie blink and against the creamy cobweb of the great lens in the sky which was the galaxy  other black forms rose .   devers said grimly   hold tight  barr     and let s see if they ve got a ship that can match my speed .    he knew they hadn t .   and once in open space  the trader s voice seemed lost and dead as he said   the line i fed brodrig was a little too good .  it seems as if he s thrown in with the general .    swiftly they raced into the depths of the star mass that was the galaxy .         .  to trantor  devers bent over the little dead globe  watching for a tiny sign of life .  the directional control was slowly and thoroughly sieving space with its jabbing tight sheaf of signals .   barr watched patiently from his seat on the low cot in the comer  he asked   no more signs of them .     the empire boys .  no .   the trader growled the words with evident impatience .   we lost the scuppers long ago .  space .  with the blind jumps we took through hyperspace  it s lucky we didn t land up in a sun s belly .  they couldn t have followed us even if they outranged us  which they didn t .    he sat back and loosened his collar with a jerk .   i don t know what those empire boys have done here .  i think some of the gaps are out of alignment .     i take it  then  you re trying to get to the foundation .     i m calling the association     or trying to .     the association .  who are they .     association of independent traders .  never heard of it  huh .  well  you re not alone .  we haven t made our splash yet .    for a while there was a silence that centered about the unresponsive reception indicator  and barr said   are you within range .     i don t know .  i haven t but a small notion where we are  going by dead reckoning .  that s why i have to use directional control .  it could take years  you know .     might it .    barr pointed  and devers jumped and adjusted his earphones .  within the little murky sphere there was a tiny glowing whiteness .   for half an hour  devers nursed the fragile  groping thread of communication that reached through hyperspace to connect two points that laggard light would take five hundred years to bind together .   then he sat back  hopelessly .  he looked up  and shoved the earphones back .    let s eat  doc .  there s a needle shower you can use if you want to  but go easy on the hot water .    he squatted before one of the cabinets that lined one wall and felt through the contents .   you re not a vegetarian  i hope .    barr said   i m omnivorous .  but what about the association .  have you lost them .     looks so .  it was extreme range  a little too extreme .  doesn t matter  though .  i got all that counted .    he straightened  and placed the two metal containers upon the table .   just give it five minutes  doc  then slit it open by pushing the contact .  it ll be plate  food  and fork     sort of handy for when you re in a hurry  if you re not interested in such incidentals as napkins .  i suppose you want to know what i got out of the association .     if it isn t a secret .    devers shook his head .   not to you .  what riose said was true .     about the offer of tribute .     uh huh .  they offered it  and had it refused .  things are bad .  there s fighting in the outer suns of loris .     loris is close to the foundation .     huh .  oh  you wouldn t know .  it s one of the original four kingdoms .  you might call it part of the inner line of defense .  that s not the worst .  they ve been fighting large ships previously never encountered .  which means riose wasn t giving us the works .  he has received more ships .  brodrig has switched sides  and i have messed things up .    his eyes were bleak as he joined the food container contact points and watched it fall open neatly .  the stewlike dish steamed its aroma through the room .  ducem barr was already eating .    so much   said barr   for improvisations  then .  we can do nothing here  we can not cut through the imperial lines to return to the foundation  we can do nothing but that which is most sensible     to wait patiently .  however  if riose has reached the inner line i trust the wait will not be too long .    and devers put down his fork .   wait  is it .   he snarled  glowering .   that s all right for you .  you ve got nothing at stake .     haven t i .   barr smiled thinly .    no .  in fact  i ll tell you .   devers  irritation skimmed the surface .   i m tired of looking at this whole business as if it were an interesting something or other on a microscope slide .  i ve got friends somewhere out there  dying  and a whole world out there  my home  dying also .  you re an outsider .  you don t know .     i have seen friends die .   the old man s hands were limp in his lap and his eyes were closed .   are you married .    devers said   traders don t marry .     well  i have two sons and a nephew .  they have been warned  but     for reasons     they could take no action .  our escape means their death .  my daughter and my two grandchildren have  i hope  left the planet safety before this  but even excluding them  i have already risked and lost more than you .    devers was morosely savage .   i know .  but that was a matter of choice .  you might have played ball with riose .  i never asked you to      barr shook his head .   it was not a matter of choice  devers .  make your conscience free  i didn t risk my sons for you .  i co operated with riose as long as i dared .  but there was the psychic probe .    the siwennian patrician opened his eyes and they were sharp with pain .   riose came to me once  it was over a year ago .  he spoke of a cult centering about the magicians  but missed the truth .  it is not quite a cult .  you see  it is forty years now that siwenna has been gripped in the same unbearable vise that threatens your world .  five revolts have been ground out .  then i discovered the ancient records of hari seldon     and now this  cult  waits .    it waits for the coming of the  magicians  and for that day it is ready .  my sons are leaders of those who wait .  it is that secret which is in my mind and which the probe must never touch .  and so they must die as hostages  for the alternative is their death as rebels and half of siwenna with them .  you see  i had no choice .  and i am no outsider .    devers  eyes fell  and barr continued softly   it is on a foundation victory that siwenna s hopes depend .  it is for a foundation victory that my sons are sacrificed .  and hari seldon does not pre calculate the inevitable salvation of siwenna as he does that of the foundation .  i have no certainty for my people     only hope .     but you are still satisfied to wait .  even with the imperial navy at loris .     i would wait  in perfect confidence   said barr  simply   if they had landed on the planet  terminus  itself .    the trader frowned hopelessly .   i don t know .  it can t really work like that  not just like magic .  psychohistory or not  they re terribly strong  and we re weak .  what can setdon do about it .     there s nothing to do .  it s all already done .  it s proceeding now .  because you don t hear the wheels turning and the gongs beating doesn t mean it s any the less certain .     maybe  but i wish you had cracked riose s skull for keeps .  he s more the enemy than all his army .     cracked his skull .  with brodrig his second in command .   barr s face sharpened with hate .   all siwenna would have been my hostage .  brodrig has proven his worth long since .  there exists a world which five years ago lost one male in every ten     and simply for failure to meet outstanding taxes .  this same brodrig was the tax collector .  no  riose may live .  his punishments are mercy in comparison .     but six months  six months  in the enemy base  with nothing to show for it .   devers  strong hands clasped each other tautly  so that his knuckles cracked .   nothing to show for it .     well  now  wait .  you remind me     barr fumbled in his pouch .   you might want to count this .   and he tossed the small sphere of metal on the table .   devers snatched it .   what is it .     the message capsule .  the one that riose received just before i jacked him .  does that count as something .     i don t know .  depends on what s in it .   devers sat down and turned it over carefully in his hand .   when barr stepped from his cold shower and  gratefully  into the mild warm current of the air dryer  he found devers silent and absorbed at the workbench .   the siwennian slapped his body with a sharp rhythm and spoke above the punctuating sounds .   what are you doing .    devers looked up .  droplets of perspiration glittered in his beard .   i m going to open this capsule .     can  you open it without riose s personal characteristic .   there was mild surprise in the siwennian s voice .   if i can t  i ll resign from the association and never skipper a ship for what s left of my life .  i ve got a three way electronic analysis of the interior now  and i ve got little jiggers that the empire never heard of  especially made for jimmying capsules .  i ve been a burglar before this  y know .  a trader has to be something of everything .    he bent low over the little sphere  and a small flat instrument probed delicately and sparked redly at each fleeting contact .   he said   this capsule is a crude job  anyway .  these imperial boys are no shakes at this small work .  i can see that .  ever see a foundation capsule .  it s half the size and impervious to electronic analysis in the first place .    and then he was rigid  the shoulder muscles beneath his tunic tautening visibly .  his tiny probe pressed slowly     it was noiseless when it came  but devers  relaxed and sighed .  in his hand was the shining sphere with its message unrolled like a parchment tongue .    it s from brodrig   he said .  then  with contempt   the message medium is permanent .  in a foundation capsule  the message would be oxidized to gas within the minute .    but ducem barr waved him silent .  he read the message quickly .   from  ammel brodrig  envoy extraordinary of his imperial majesty  privy secretary of the council  and peer of the realm .   to  bel riose  military governor of siwenna .  general of the imperial forces  and peer of the realm .  i greet you .   planet       no longer resists .  the plans of offense as outlined continue smoothly .  the enemy weakens visibly and the ultimate ends in view will surely be gained .   barr raised his head from the almost microscopic print and cried bitterly   the fool .  the forsaken blasted fop .  that a message .     huh .   said devers .  he was vaguely disappointed .    it says nothing   ground out barr .   our lick spittle courtier is playing at general now .  with riose away  he is the field commander and must sooth his paltry spirit by spewing out his pompous reports concerning military affairs he has nothing to do with .   so and so planet no longer resists .    the offensive moves on .    the enemy weakens .   the vacuum headed peacock .     well  now  wait a minute .  hold on       throw it away .   the old man turned away in mortification .   the galaxy knows i never expected it to be world shakingly important  but in wartime it is reasonable to assume that even the most routine order left undelivered might hamper military movements and lead to complications later .  it s why i snatched it .  but this .  better to have left it .  it would have wasted a minute of riose s time that will now be put to more constructive use .    but devers had arisen .   will you hold on and stop throwing your weight around .  for seldon s sake      he held out the sliver of message before barr s nose   now read that again .  what does he mean by  ultimate ends in view  .     the conquest of the foundation .  well .     yes .  and maybe he means the conquest of the empire .  you know he believes that to be the ultimate end .     and if he does .     if he does .   devers  one sided smile was lost in his beard .   why  watch then  and i ll show you .    with one finger the lavishly monogrammed sheet of message parchment was thrust back into its slot .  with a soft twang  it disappeared and the globe was a smooth  unbroken whole again .  somewhere inside was the tiny oiled whir of the controls as they lost their setting by random movements .    now there is no known way of opening this capsule without knowledge of riose s personal characteristic  is there .     to the empire  no   said barr .    then the evidence it contains is unknown to us and absolutely authentic .     to the empire  yes   said barr .    and the emperor can open it  can t he .  personal characteristics of government officials must be on file .  we keep records of our officials at the foundation .     at the imperial capital as well   agreed barr .    then when you  a siwennian patrician and peer of the realm  tell this cleon  this emperor  that his favorite tame parrot and his shiniest general are getting together to knock him over  and hand him the capsule as evidence  what will he think brodrig s  ultimate ends  are .    barr sat down weakly .   wait  i don t follow you .   he stroked one thin cheek  and said   you re not really serious  are you .     i am .   devers was angrily excited .   listen  nine out of the last ten emperors got their throats cut  or their gizzards blasted out by one or another of their generals with bigtime notions in their heads .  you told me that yourself more than once .  old man emperor would believe us so fast it would make riose s head swim .    barr muttered feebly   he is serious  for the galaxy s sake  man  you can t beat a seldon crisis by a far fetched  impractical  storybook scheme like that .  suppose you had never got hold of the capsule .  suppose brodrig hadn t used the word  ultimate .   seldon doesn t depend on wild luck .     if wild luck comes our way  there s no law says seldon can t take advantage of it .     certainly .  but  .  .  .  but   barr stopped  then spoke calmly but with visible restraint .   look  in the first place  how will you get to the planet trantor .  you don t know its location in space  and i certainly don t remember the co ordinates  to say nothing of the ephemerae .  you don t even know your own position in space .     you can t get lost in space   grinned devers .  he was at the controls already .   down we go to the nearest planet  and back we come with complete bearings and the best navigation charts brodrig s hundred thousand smackers can buy .     and  a blaster in our belly .  our descriptions are probably in every planet in this quarter of the empire .    doc   said devers  patiently   don t be a hick tom the sticks .  riose said my ship surrendered too easily and  brother  he wasn t kidding .  this ship has enough fire power and enough juice in its shield to hold off anything we re rely to meet this deep inside the frontier .  and we have personal shields  too .  the empire boys never found them  you know  but they weren t meant to be found .     all fight   said barr   all right .  suppose yourself on trantor .  how do you see the emperor then .  you think he keeps office hours .     suppose we worry about that on trantor   said devers .   and barr muttered helplessly   all right again .  i ve wanted to see trantor before i die for half a century now .  have your way .    the hypernuclear motor was cut in .  the lights flickered and there was the slight internal wrench that marked the shift into hyperspace .         .  on trantor  the stars were as thick as weeds in an unkempt field  and for the first time  lathan devers found the figures to the right of the decimal point of prime importance in calculating the cuts through the hyper regions .  there was a claustrophobic sensation about the necessity for leaps of not more than a light year .  there was a frightening harshness about a sky which glittered unbrokenly in every direction .  it was being lost in a sea of radiation .   and in the center of an open cluster of ten thousand stars  whose light tore to shreds the feebly encircling darkness  there circled the huge imperial planet  trantor .   but it was more than a planet  it was the living pulse beat of an empire of twenty million stellar systems .  it had only one  function  administration  one purpose  government  and one manufactured product  law .   the entire world was one functional distortion .  there was no living object on its surface hut man  his pets  and his parasites .  no blade of grass or fragment of uncovered soil could be found outside the hundred square miles of the imperial palace .  no fresh water outside the palace grounds existed but in the vast underground cisterns that held the water supply of a world .   the lustrous  indestructible  incorruptible metal that was the unbroken surface of the planet was the foundation of the huge  metal structures that mazed the planet .  they were structures connected by causeways  laced by corridors  cubbyholed by offices  basemented by the huge retail centers that covered square miles  penthoused by the glittering amusement world that sparkled into life each night .   one could walk around the world of trantor and never leave that one conglomerate building  nor see the city .   a fleet of ships greater in number than all the war fleets the empire had ever supported landed their cargoes on trantor each day to feed the forty billions of humans who gave nothing in exchange but the fulfillment of the necessity of untangling the myriads of threads that spiraled into the central administration of the most complex government humanity had ever known .   twenty agricultural worlds were the granary of trantor .  a universe was its servant .   tightly held by the huge metal arms on either side  the trade ship was gently lowered down the huge ramp that led to the hangar .  already devers had fumed his way through the manifold complications of a world conceived in paper work and dedicated to the principle of the form in quadruplicate .   there had been the preliminary halt in space  where the first of what had grown into a hundred questionnaires had been filled out .  there were the hundred cross examinations  the routine administration of a simple probe  the photographing of the ship  the characteristic analysis of the two men  and the subsequent recording of the same  the search for contraband  the payment of the entry tax     and finally the question of the identity cards and visitor s visa .   ducem barr was a siwennian and subject of the emperor  but lathan devers was an unknown without the requisite documents .  the official in charge at the moment was devastated with sorrow  but devers could not enter .  in fact  he would have to be held for official investigation .   from somewhere a hundred credits in crisp  new bills backed by the estates of lord brodrig made their appearance  and changed bands quietly .  the official hemmed importantly and the devastation of his sorrow was assuaged .  a new form made its appearance from the appropriate pigeonhole .  it was filled out rapidly and efficiently  with the devers characteristic thereto formally and properly attached .   the two men  trader and patrician  entered siwenna .   in the hangar  the trade ship was another vessel to be cached  photographed  recorded  contents noted  identity cards of passengers facsimiled  and for which a suitable fee was paid  recorded  and receipted .   and then devers was on a huge terrace under the bright white sun  along which women chattered  children shrieked  and men sipped drinks languidly and listened to the huge televisors blaring out the news of the empire .   barr paid a requisite number of iridium coins and appropriated the uppermost member of a pile of newspapers .  it was the trantor imperial news  official organ of the government .  in the back of the news room  there was the soft clicking noise of additional editions being printed in long distance sympathy with the busy machines at the imperial news offices ten thousand miles away by corridor     six thousand by air machine     just as ten million sets of copies were being likewise printed at that moment in ten million other news rooms all over the planet .   barr glanced at the headlines and said softly   what shall we do first .    devers tried to shake himself out of his depression .  he was in a universe far removed from his own  on a world that weighted him down with its intricacy  among people whose doings were incomprehensible and whose language was nearly so .  the gleaming metallic towers that surrounded him and continued onwards in never ending multiplicity to beyond the horizon oppressed him  the whole busy  unheeding life of a world metropolis cast him into the horrible gloom of isolation and pygmyish unimportance .   he said   i better leave it to you  doc .    barr was calm  low voice .   i tried to tell you  but it s hard to believe without seeing for yourself  i know that .  do you know how many people want to see the emperor every day .  about one million .  do you know how many he sees .  about ten .  we ll have to work through the civil service  and that makes it harder .  but we can t afford the aristocracy .     we have almost one hundred thousand .     a single peer of the realm would cost us that  and it would take at least three or four to form an adequate bridge to the emperor .  it may take fifty chief commissioners and senior supervisors to do the same  but they would cost us only a hundred apiece perhaps .  i ll do the talking .  in the first place  they wouldn t understand your accent  and in the second  you don t know the etiquette of imperial bribery .  it s an art  i assure you .  ah .    the third page of the imperial news had what he wanted and he passed the paper to devers .   devers read slowly .  the vocabulary was strange  but he understood .  he looked up  and his eyes were dark with concern .  he slapped the news sheet angrily with the back of his hand .   you think this can be trusted .     within limits   replied barr  calmly .   it s highly improbable that the foundation fleet was wiped out .  they ve probably reported that several times already  if they ve gone by the usual war reporting technique of a world capital far from the actual scene of fighting .  what it means  though  is that riose has won another battle  which would be none too unexpected .  it says he s captured loris .  is that the capital planet of the kingdom of loris .     yes   brooded devers   or of what used to be the kingdom of loris .  and it s not twenty parsecs from the foundation .  doc  we ve got to work fast .    barr shrugged   you can t go fast on trantor .  if you try  you ll end up at the point of an atom blaster  most likely .     how long will it take .     a month  if we re lucky .  a month  and our hundred thousand credits     if even that will suffice .  and that is providing the emperor does not take it into his head in the meantime to travel to the summer planets  where he sees no petitioners at all .     but the foundation          will take care of itself  as heretofore .  come  there s the question of dinner .  i m hungry .  and afterwards  the evening is ours and we may as well use it .  we shall never see trantor or any world like it again  you know .    the home commissioner of the outer provinces spread his pudgy hands helplessly and peered at the petitioners with owlish nearsightedness .   but the emperor is indisposed  gentlemen .  it is really useless to take the matter to my superior .  his imperial majesty has seen no one in a week .     he will see us   said barr  with an affectation of confidence .   it is but a question of seeing a member of the staff of the privy secretary .     impossible   said the commissioner emphatically .   it would be the worth of my job to attempt that .  now if you could but be more explicit concerning the nature of your business .  i m willing to help you  understand  but naturally i want something less vague  something i can present to my superior as reason for taking the matter further .     if my business were such that it could be told to any but the highest   suggested barr  smoothly   it would scarcely be important enough to rate audience with his imperial majesty .  i propose that you take a chance .  i might remind you that if his imperial majesty attaches the importance to our business which we guarantee that he will  you will stand certain to receive the honors you will deserve for helping us now .     yes  but     and the commissioner shrugged  wordlessly .    it s a chance   agreed barr .   naturally  a risk should have its compensation .  it is a rather great favor to ask you  but we have already been greatly obliged with your kindness in offering us this opportunity to explain our problem .  but if you would allow us to express our gratitude just slightly by      devers scowled .  he had heard this speech with its slight variations twenty times in the past month .  it ended  as always  in a quick shift of the half hidden bills .  but the epilogue differed here .  usually the bills vanished immediately  here they remained in plain view  while slowly the commissioner counted them  inspecting them front and back as he did so .   there was a subtle change in his voice .   backed by the privy secretary  hey .  good money .     to get back to the subject     urged barr .    no  but wait   interrupted the commissioner   let us go back by easy stages .  i really do wish to know what your business can be .  this money  it is fresh and new  and you must have a good deal  for it strikes me that you have seen other officials before me .  come  now  what about it .    barr said   i don t see what you are driving at .     why  see here  it might be proven that you are upon the planet illegally  since the identification and entry cards of your silent friend are certainly inadequate .  he is not a subject of the emperor .     i deny that .     it doesn t matter that you do   said the commissioner  with sudden bluntness .   the official who signed his cards for the sum of a hundred credits has confessed     under pressure     and we know more of you than you think .     if you are hinting  sir  that the sum we have asked you to accept is inadequate in view of the risks      the commissioner smiled .   on the contrary  it is more than adequate .   he tossed the bills aside .   to return to what i was saying  it is the emperor himself who has become interested in your case .  is it not true  sirs  that you have recently been guests of general riose .  is it not true that you have escaped from the midst of his army with  to put it mildly  astonishing ease .  is it not true that you possess a small fortune in bills backed by lord brodrig s estates .  in short  is it not true that you are a pair of spies and assassins sent here to     well  you shall tell us yourself who paid you and for what .     do you know   said barr  with silky anger   i deny the right of a petty commissioner to accuse us of crimes .  we will leave .     you will not leave .   the commissioner arose  and his eyes no longer seemed near sighted .   you need answer no question now  that will be reserved for a later     and more forceful     time .  nor am i a commissioner  i am a lieutenant of the imperial police .  you are under arrest .    there was a glitteringly efficient blast gun in his fist as he smiled .   there are greater men than you under arrest this day .  it is a hornet s nest we are cleaning up .    devers snarled and reached slowly for his own gun .  the lieutenant of police smiled more broadly and squeezed the contacts .  the blasting line of force struck devers  chest in an accurate blaze of destruction     that bounced harmlessly off his personal shield in sparkling spicules of light .   devers shot in turn  and the lieutenant s head fell from off an upper torso that had disappeared .  it was still smiling as it lay in the jag of sunshine which entered through the new made hole in the wall .   it was through the back entrance that they left .   devers said huskily   quickly to the ship .  they ll have the alarm out in no time .   he cursed in a ferocious whisper .   it s another plan that s backfired .  i could swear the space fiend himself is against me .    it was in the open that they became aware of the jabbering crowds that surrounded the huge televisors .  they had no time to wait  the disconnected roaring words that reached them  they disregarded .  but barr snatched a copy of the imperial news before diving into the huge barn of the hangar  where the ship lifted hastily through a giant cavity burnt fiercely into the roof .    can you get away from them .   asked barr .   ten ships of the traffic police wildly followed the runaway craft that had burst out of the lawful  radio beamed path of leaving  and then broken every speed law in creation .  further behind still  sleek vessels of the secret service were lifting in pursuit of a carefully described ship manned by two thoroughly identified murderers .    watch me   said devers  and savagely shifted into hyperspace two thousand miles above the surface of trantor .  the shift  so near a planetary mass  meant unconsciousness for barr and a fearful haze of pain for devers  but light years further  space above them was clear .   devers  somber pride in his ship burst to the surface .  he said   there s not an imperial ship that could follow me anywhere .    and then  bitterly   but there is nowhere left to run to for us  and we can t fight their weight .  what s there to do .  what can anyone do .    barr moved feebly on his cot .  the effect of the hypershift had not yet worn off  and each of his muscles ached .  he said   no one has to do anything .  it s all over .  here .    he passed the copy of the imperial news that he still clutched  and the headlines were enough for the trader .    recalled and arrested     riose and brodrig   devers muttered .  he stared blankly at barr .   why .     the story doesn t say  but what does it matter .  the war with the foundation is over  and at this moment  siwenna is revolting .  read the story and see .   his voice was drifting off .   we ll stop in some of the provinces and find out the later details .  if you don t mind  i ll go to sleep now .    and he did .   in grasshopper jumps of increasing magnitude  the trade ship was spanning the galaxy in its return to the foundation .          .  the war ends  lathan devers felt definitely uncomfortable  and vaguely resentful .  he had received his own decoration and withstood with mute stoicism the turgid oratory of the mayor which accompanied the slip of crimson ribbon .  that had ended his share of the ceremonies  but  naturally  formality forced him to remain .  and it was formality  chiefly     the type that couldn t allow him to yawn noisily or to swing a foot comfortably onto a chair seat     that made him long to be in space  where he belonged .   the siwennese delegation  with ducem barr a lionized member  signed the convention  and siwenna became the first province to pass directly from the empire s political rule to the foundation s economic one .   five imperial ships of the line     captured when siwenna rebelled behind the lines of the empire s border fleet     flashed overhead  huge and massive  detonating a roaring salute as they passed over the city .   nothing but drinking  etiquette  and small talk now .   a voice called him .  it was forell  the man who  devers realized coldly  could buy twenty of him with a morning s profits     but a forell who now crooked a finger at him with genial condescension .   he stepped out upon the balcony into the cool night wind  and bowed properly  while scowling into his bristling beard .  barr was there  too  smiling .  he said   devers  you ll have to come to my rescue .  i m being accused of modesty  a horrible and thoroughly unnatural crime .     devers   forell removed the fat cigar from the side of his mouth when he spoke   lord barr claims that your trip to cleon s capital had nothing to do with the recall of riose .     nothing at all  sir .   devers was curt .   we never saw the emperor .  the reports we picked up on our way back concerning the trial  showed it up to be the purest frameup .  there was a mess of rigmarole about the general being tied up with subversive interests at the court .     and he was innocent .     riose .   interposed barr .   yes .  by the galaxy  yes .  brodrig was a traitor on general principles but was never guilty of the specific accusations brought against him .  it was a judicial farce  but a necessary one  a predictable one  an inevitable one .     by psychohistorical necessity  i presume .   forell rolled the phrase sonorously with the humorous ease of long familiarity .    exactly .   barr grew serious .   it never penetrated earlier  but once it was over and i could  .  .  .  well  .  .  .  look at the answers in the back of the book  the problem became simple .  we can see  now  that the social background of the empire makes wars of conquest impossible for it .  under weak emperors  it is tom apart by generals competing for a worthless and surely death bringing throne .  under strong emperors  the empire is frozen into a paralytic rigor in which disintegration apparently ceases for the moment  but only at the sacrifice of all possible growth .    forell growled bluntly through strong puffs   you re not clear  lord barr .    barr smiled slowly .   i suppose so .  it s the difficulty of not being trained in psychohistory .  words are a pretty fuzzy substitute for mathematical equations .  but let s see now      barr considered  while forell relaxed  back to railing  and devers looked into the velvet sky and thought wonderingly of trantor .   then barr said   you see  sir  you     and devers     and everyone no doubt  had the idea that beating the empire meant first prying apart the emperor and his general .  you  and devers  and everyone else were right     right all the time  as far as the principle of internal disunion was concerned .    you were wrong  however  in thinking that this internal split was something to be brought about by individual acts  by inspirations of the moment .  you tried bribery and lies .  you appealed to ambition and to fear .  but you got nothing for all your pains .  in fact  appearances were worse after each attempt .    and through all this wild threshing up of tiny ripples  the seldon tidal wave continued onward  quietly     but quite irresistibly .    ducem barr turned away  and looked over the railing at the lights of a rejoicing city .  he said   there was a dead hand pushing all of us  the mighty general and the great emperor  my world and your world     the dead hand of hari seldon .  he knew that a man like riose would have to fail  since it was his success that brought failure  and the greater the success  the surer the failure .    forell said dryly   i can t say you re getting clearer .     a moment   continued barr earnestly .   look at the situation .  a weak general could never have endangered us  obviously .  a strong general during the time of a weak emperor would never have endangered us  either  for he would have turned his arms towards a much more fruitful target .  events have shown that three fourths of the emperors of the last two centuries were rebel generals and rebel viceroys before they were emperors .    so it is only the combination of strong emperor and strong general that can harm the foundation  for a strong emperor can not be dethroned easily  and a strong general is forced to turn outwards  past the frontiers .    but  what keeps the emperor strong .  what kept cleon strong .  it s obvious .  he is strong  because he permits no strong subjects .  a courtier who becomes too rich  or a general who becomes too popular is dangerous .  all the recent history of the empire proves that to any emperor intelligent enough to be strong .    riose won victories  so the emperor grew suspicious .  all the atmosphere of the times forced him to be suspicious .  did riose refuse a bribe .  very suspicious  ulterior motives .  did his most trusted courtier suddenly favor riose .  very suspicious  ulterior motives .  it wasn t the individual acts that were suspicious .  anything else would have done which is why our individual plots were unnecessary and rather futile .  it was the success of riose that was suspicious .  so he was recalled  and accused  condemned  murdered .  the foundation wins again .    look  there is not a conceivable combination of events that does not result in the foundation winning .  it was inevitable  whatever riose did  whatever we did .    the foundation magnate nodded ponderously .   so .  but what if the emperor and the general had been the same person .  hey .  what then .  that s a case you didn t cover  so you haven t proved your point yet .    barr shrugged .   i can t prove anything  i haven t the mathematics .  but i appeal to your reason .  with an empire in which every aristocrat  every strong man  every pirate can aspire to the throne     and  as history shows  often successfully     what would happen to even a strong emperor who preoccupied himself with foreign wars at the extreme end of the galaxy .  how long would he have to remain away from the capital before somebody raised the standards of civil war and forced him home .  the social environment of the empire would make that time short .    i once told riose that not all the empire s strength could swerve the dead hand of hari seldon .     good .  good .   forell was expansively pleased .   then you imply the empire can never threaten us again .     it seems to me so   agreed barr .   frankly  cleon may not live out the year  and there s going to be a disputed succession almost as a matter of course  which might mean the last civil war for the empire .     then   said forell   there are no more enemies .    barr was thoughtful .   there s a second foundation .     at the other end of the galaxy .  not for centuries .    devers turned suddenly at this  and his face was dark as he faced forell .   there are internal enemies  perhaps .     are there .   asked forell  coolly .   who  for instance .     people  for instance  who might like to spread the wealth a bit  and keep it from concentrating too much out of the hands that work for it .  see what i mean .    slowly  forell s gaze lost its contempt and grew one with the anger of devers  own .     part ii  the mule         .  bride and groom  the mule less is known of  the mule  than of any character of comparable significance to galactic history .  even the period of his greatest renown is known to us chiefly through the eyes of his antagonists and  principally  through those of a young bride .  .  .  .   encyclopedia galactica  bayta s first sight of haven was entirely the contrary of spectacular .  her husband pointed it out     a dull star lost in the emptiness of the galaxy s edge .  it was past the last sparse clusters  to where straggling points of light gleamed lonely .  and even among these it was poor and inconspicuous .   toran was quite aware that as the earliest prelude to married life  the red dwarf lacked impressiveness and his lips curled self consciously .   i know  bay     it isn t exactly a proper change  is it .  i mean from the foundation to this .     a horrible change  toran .  i should never have married you .    and when his face looked momentarily hurt  before he caught himself  she said with her special  cozy  tone   all right  silly .  now let your lower lip droop and give me that special dying duck look     the one just before you re supposed to bury your head on my shoulder  while i stroke your hair full of static electricity .  you were fishing for some drivel  weren t you .  you were expecting me to say  i d be happy anywhere with you  toran .   or  the interstellar depths themselves would be home  my sweet  were you but with me .   now you admit it .    she pointed a finger at him and snatched it away an instant before his teeth closed upon it .   he said   if i surrender  and admit you re right  will you prepare dinner .    she nodded contentedly .  he smiled  and just looked at her .   she wasn t beautiful on the grand scale to others     he admitted that     even if everybody did look twice .  her hair was dark and glossy  though straight  her mouth a bit wide     but her meticulous  close textured eyebrows separated a white  unlined forehead from the warmest mahogany eyes ever filled with smiles .   and behind a very sturdily built and staunchly defended facade of practical  unromantic  hard headedness towards life  there was just that little pool of softness that would never show if you poked for it  but could be reached if you knew just how     and never let on that you were looking for it .   toran adjusted the controls unnecessarily and decided to relax .  he was one interstellar jump  and then several milli microparsecs  on the straight  before manipulation by hand was necessary .  he leaned over backwards to look into the storeroom  where bayta was juggling appropriate containers .   there was quite a bit of smugness about his attitude towards bayta     the satisfied awe that marks the triumph of someone who has been hovering at the edge of an inferiority complex for three years .   after all he was a provincial     and not merely a provincial  but the son of a renegade trader .  and she was of the foundation itself     and not merely that  but she could trace her ancestry back to mallow .   and with all that  a tiny quiver underneath .  to take her back to haven  with its rock world and cave cities was bad enough .  to have her face the traditional hostility of trader for foundation     nomad for city dweller     was worse .   still     after supper  the last jump .   haven was an angry crimson blaze  and the second planet was a ruddy patch of light with atmosphere blurred rim and a half sphere of darkness .  bayta leaned over the large view table with its spidering of crisscross lines that centered haven ii neatly .   she said gravely   i wish i had met your father first .  if he takes a dislike to me       then   said toran matter of factly   you would be the first pretty girl to inspire that in him .  before he lost his arm and stopped roving around the galaxy  he     well  if you ask him about it  he ll talk to you about it till your ears wear down to a nubbin .  after a while i got to thinking that he was embroidering  because he never told the same story twice the same way      haven ii was rushing up at them now .  the landlocked sea wheeled ponderously below them  slate gray in the lowering dimness and lost to sight  here and there  among the wispy clouds .  mountains jutted raggedly along the coast .   the sea became wrinkled with nearness and  as it veered off past the horizon just at the end  there was one vanishing glimpse of shore hugging ice fields .   toran grunted under the fierce deceleration   is your suit locked .    bayta s plump face was round and ruddy in the incasing sponge foam of the internally heated  skin clinging costume .   the ship lowered crunchingly on the open field just short of the lifting of the plateau .   they climbed out awkwardly into the solid darkness of the outer galactic night  and bayta gasped as the sudden cold bit  and the thin wind swirled emptily .  toran seized her elbow and nudged her into an awkward run over the smooth  packed ground towards the sparking of artificial light in the distance .   the advancing guards met them halfway  and after a whispered exchange of words  they were taken onward .  the wind and the cold disappeared when the gate of rock opened and then closed behind them .  the warm interior  white with wall light  was filled with an incongruous humming bustle .  men looked up from their desks  and toran produced documents .   they were waved onward after a short glance and toran whispered to his wife   dad must have fixed up the preliminaries .  the usual lapse here is about five hours .    they burst into the open and bayta said suddenly   oh  my      the cave city was in daylight     the white daylight of a young sun .  not that there was a sun  of course .  what should have been the sky was lost in the unfocused glow of an over all brilliance .  and the warm air was properly thick and fragrant with greenery .   bayta said   why  toran  it s beautiful .    toran grinned with anxious delight .   well  now  bay  it isn t like anything on the foundation  of course  but it s the biggest city on haven ii     twenty thousand people  you know     and you ll get to like it .  no amusement palaces  i m afraid  but no secret police either .     oh  torie  it s just like a toy city .  it s all white and pink     and so clean .     well     toran looked at the city with her .  the houses were two stories high for the most part  and of the smooth vein rock indigenous to the region .  the spires of the foundation were missing  and the colossal community houses of the old kingdoms     but the smallness was there and the individuality  a relic of personal initiative in a galaxy of mass life .   he snapped to sudden attention .   bay     there s dad .  right there     where i m pointing  silly .  don t you see him .    she did .  it was just the impression of a large man  waving frantically  fingers spread wide as though groping wildly in air .  the deep thunder of a drawn out shout reached them .  bayta trailed her husband  rushing downwards over the close cropped lawn .  she caught sight of a smaller man  white haired  almost lost to view behind the robust one arm  who still waved and still shouted .   toran cried over his shoulder   it s my father s half brother .  the one who s been to the foundation .  you know .    they met in the grass  laughing and incoherent  and toran s father let out a final whoop for sheer joy .  he hitched at his short jacket and adjusted the metal chased belt that was his one concession to luxury .   his eyes shifted from one of the youngsters to the other  and then he said  a little out of breath   you picked a rotten day to return home  boy .     what .  oh  it is seldon s birthday  isn t it .     it is .  i had to rent a car to make the trip here  and dragoon randu to drive it .  not a public vehicle to be had at gun s point .    his eyes were on bayta now  and didn t leave .  he spoke to her more softly   i have the crystal of you right here     and it s good  but i can see the fellow who took it was an amateur .    he had the small cube of transparency out of his jacket pocket and in the light the laughing little face within sprang to vivid colored life as a miniature bayta .    that one .   said bayta .   now i wonder why toran should send that caricature .  i m surprised you let me come near you  sir .     are you now .  call me fran .  i ll have none of this fancy mess .  for that  i think you can take my arm  and we ll go on to the car .  till now i never did think my boy knew what he was ever up to .  i think i ll change that opinion .  i think i ll have to change that opinion .    toran said to his half uncle softly   how is the old man these days .  does he still hound the women .    randu puckered up all over his face when he smiled .   when he can  toran  when he can .  there are times when he remembers that his next birthday will be his sixtieth  and that disheartens him .  but he shouts it down  this evil thought  and then he is himself .  he is a trader of the ancient type .  but you  toran .  where did you find such a pretty wife .    the young man chuckled and linked arms .   do you want a three years  history at a gasp  uncle .    it was in the small living room of the home that bayta struggled out of her traveling cloak and hood and shook her hair loose .  she sat down  crossing her knees  and returned the appreciative stare of this large  ruddy man .   she said   i know what you re trying to estimate  and i ll help you  age  twenty four  height  five four  weight  one ten  educational specialty  history .   she noticed that he always crooked his stand so as to hide the missing arm .  but now fran leaned close and said   since you mention it     weight  one twenty .    he laughed loudly at her flush .  then he said to the company in general   you can always tell a woman s weight by her upper arm     with due experience  of course .  do you want a drink  bay .     among other things   she said  and they left together  while toran busied himself at the book shelves to check for new additions .   fran returned alone and said   she ll be down later .    he lowered himself heavily into the large comer chair and placed his stiff jointed left leg on the stool before it .  the laughter had left his red face  and toran turned to face him .   fran said   well  you re home  boy  and i m glad you are .  i like your woman .  she s no whining ninny .     i married her   said toran simply .    well  that s another thing altogether  boy .   his eyes darkened .   it s a foolish way to tie up the future .  in my longer life  and more experienced  i never did such a thing .    randu interrupted from the comer where he stood quietly .   now franssart  what comparisons are you making .  till your crash landing six years ago you were never in one spot long enough to establish residence requirements for marriage  and since then  who would have you .    the one armed man jerked erect in his seat and replied hotly   many  you snowy dotard      toran said with hasty tact   it s largely a legal formality  dad .  the situation has its conveniences .     mostly for the woman   grumbled fran .    and even if so   agreed randu   it s up to the boy to decide .  marriage is an old custom among the foundationers .     the foundationers are not fit models for an honest trader   smoldered fran .   toran broke in again   my wife is a foundationer .   he looked from one to the other  and then said quietly   she s coming .    the conversation took a general turn after the evening meal  which fran had spiced with three tales of reminiscence composed of equal parts of blood  women  profits  and embroidery .  the small televisor was on  and some classic drama was playing itself out in an unregarded whisper .  randu had hitched himself into a more comfortable position on the low couch and gazed past the slow smoke of his long pipe to where bayta had knelt down upon the softness of the white fur mat brought back once long ago from a trade mission and now spread out only upon the most ceremonious occasions .    you have studied history  my girl .   he asked  pleasantly .   bayta nodded .   i was the despair of my teachers  but i learned a bit  eventually .     a citation for scholarship   put in toran  smugly   that s all .     and what did you learn .   proceeded randu  smoothly .    everything .  now .   laughed the girl .   the old man smiled gently .   well then  what do you think of the galactic situation .     i think   said bayta  concisely   that a seldon crisis is pending     and that if it isn t then away with the seldon plan altogether .  it is a failure .      whew     muttered fran  from his comer .   what a way to speak of seldon .   but he said nothing aloud .   randu sucked at his pipe speculatively .   indeed .  why do you say that .  i was to the foundation  you know  in my younger days  and i  too  once thought great dramatic thoughts .  but  now  why do you say that .     well   bayta s eyes misted with thought as she curled her bare toes into the white softness of the rug and nestled her little chin in one plump hand   it seems to me that the whole essence of seldon s plan was to create a world better than the ancient one of the galactic empire .  it was failing apart  that world  three centuries ago  when seldon first established the foundation     and if history speaks truly  it was falling apart of the triple disease of inertia  despotism  and maldistribution of the goods of the universe .    randu nodded slowly  while toran gazed with proud  luminous eyes at his wife  and fran in the comer clucked his tongue and carefully refilled his glass .   bayta said   if the story of seldon is true  he foresaw the complete collapse of the empire through his jaws of psychohistory  and was able to predict the necessary thirty thousand years of barbarism before the establishment of a new second empire to restore civilization and culture to humanity .  it was the whole aim of his life work to set up such conditions as would insure a speedier rejuvenation    the deep voice of fran burst out   and that s why he established the two foundations  honor be to his name .     and that s why he established the two foundations   assented bayta .   our foundation was a gathering of the scientists of the dying empire intended to carry on the science and learning of man to new heights .  and the foundation was so situated in space and the historical environment was such that through the careful calculations of his genius  seldon foresaw that in one thousand years  it would become a newer  greater empire .    there was a reverent silence .   the girl said softly   it s an old story .  you all know it .  for almost three centuries every human being of the foundation has known it .  but i thought it would be appropriate to go through it     just quickly .  today is seldon s birthday  you know  and even if i am of the foundation  and you are of haven  we have that in common      she lit a cigarette slowly  and watched the glowing tip absently .   the laws of history are as absolute as the laws of physics  and if the probabilities of error are greater  it is only because history does not deal with as many humans as physics does atoms  so that individual variations count for more .  seldon predicted a series of crises through the thousand years of growth  each of which would force a new turning of our history into a pre calculated path .  it is those crises which direct us     and therefore a crisis must come now .    now .   she repeated  forcefully .   it s almost a century since the last one  and in that century  every vice of the empire has been repeated in the foundation .  inertia .  our ruling class knows one law  no change .  despotism .  they know one rule  force .  maldistribution .  they know one desire  to hold what is theirs .     while others starve .   roared fran suddenly with a mighty blow of his fist upon the arm of his chair .   girl  your words are pearls .  the fat guts on their moneybags ruin the foundation  while the brave traders hide their poverty on dregs of worlds like haven .  it s a disgrace to seldon  a casting of dirt in his face  a spewing in his beard .   he raised his arm high  and then his face lengthened .   if i had my other arm .  if     once     they had listened to me .     dad   said toran   take it easy .     take it easy .  take it easy   his father mimicked savagely .   we ll live here and die here forever     and you say  take it easy .     that s our modern lathan devers   said randu  gesturing with his pipe   this fran of ours .  devers died in the slave mines eighty years ago with your husband s great grandfather  because he lacked wisdom and didn t lack heart       yes  by the galaxy  i d do the same if i were he   swore fran .   devers was the greatest trader in history     greater than the overblown windbag  mallow  the foundationers worship .  if the cutthroats who lord the foundation killed him because he loved justice  the greater the blood debt owed them .     go on  girl   said randu .   go on  or  surely  he ll talk a the night and rave all the next day .     there s nothing to go on about   she said  with a sudden gloom .   there must be a crisis  but i don t know how to make one .  the progressive forces on the foundation are oppressed fearfully .  you traders may have the will  but you are hunted and disunited .  if all the forces of good will in and out of the foundation could combine      fran s laugh was a raucous jeer .   listen to her  randu  listen to her .  in and out of the foundation  she says .  girl  girl  there s no hope in the flab sides of the foundation .  among them some hold the whip and the rest are whipped dead whipped .  not enough spunk left in the whole rotten world to outface one good trader .    bayta s attempted interruptions broke feebly against the overwhelming wind .   toran leaned over and put a hand over her mouth .   dad   he said  coldly   you ve never been on the foundation .  you know nothing about it .  i tell you that the underground there is brave and daring enough .  i could tell you that bayta was one of them       all right  boy  no offense .  now  where s the cause for anger .   he was genuinely perturbed .   toran drove on fervently   the trouble with you  dad  is that you ve got a provincial outlook .  you think because some hundred thousand traders scurry into holes on an unwanted planet at the end of nowhere  that they re a great people .  of course  any tax collector from the foundation that gets here never leaves again  but that s cheap heroism .  what would you do if the foundation sent a fleet .     we d blast them   said fran  sharply .    and get blasted     with the balance in their favor .  you re outnumbered  outarmed  outorganized     and as soon as the foundation thinks it worth its while  you ll realize that .  so you had better seek your allies     on the foundation itself  if you can .     randu  said fran  looking at his brother like a great  helpless bull .   randu took his pipe away from his lips   the boy s right  fran .  when you listen to the little thoughts deep inside you  you know he is .  but they re uncomfortable thoughts  so you drown them out with that roar of yours .  but they re still there .  toran  i ll tell you why i brought all this up .    he puffed thoughtfully awhile  then dipped his pipe into the neck of the tray  waited for the silent flash  and withdrew it clean .  slowly  he filled it again with precise tamps of his little finger .   he said   your little suggestion of foundation s interest in us  toran  is to the point .  there have been two recent visits lately     for tax purposes .  the disturbing point is that the second visitor was accompanied by a light patrol ship .  they landed in gleiar city     giving us the miss for a change     and they never lifted off again  naturally .  but now they ll surely be back .  your father is aware of all this  toran  he really is .    look at the stubborn rakehell .  he knows haven is in trouble  and he knows we re helpless  but he repeats his formulas .  it warms and protects him .  but once he s had his say  and roared his defiance  and feels he s discharged his duty as a man and a bull trader  why he s as reasonable as any of us .     any of who .   asked bayta .   he smiled at her .   we ve formed a little group  bayta     just in our city .  we haven t done anything  yet .  we haven t even managed to contact the other cities yet  but it s a start .     but towards what .    randu shook his head .   we don t know yet .  we hope for a miracle .  we have decided that  as you say  a seldon crisis must be at hand .   he gestured widely upwards .   the galaxy is full of the chips and splinters of the broken empire .  the generals swarm .  do you suppose the time may come when one will grow bold .    bayta considered  and shook her head decisively  so that the long straight hair with the single inward curl at the end swirled about her ears .   no  not a chance .  there s not one of those generals who doesn t know that an attack on the foundation is suicide .  bel riose of the old empire was a better man than any of them  and he attacked with the resources of a galaxy  and couldn t win against the seldon plan .  is there one general that doesn t know that .     but what if we spur them on .     into where .  into an atomic furnace .  with what could you possibly spur them .     well  there is one     a new one .  in this past year or two  there has come word of a strange man whom they call the mule .     the mule .   she considered .   ever hear of him  torie .     toran shook his head .  she said   what about him .     i don t know .  but he wins victories at  they say  impossible odds .  the rumors may be exaggerated  but it would be interesting  in any case  to become acquainted with him .  not every man with sufficient ability and sufficient ambition would believe in hari seldon and his laws of psychohistory .  we could encourage that disbelief .  he might attack .     and the foundation would win .     yes     but not necessarily easily .  it might be a crisis  and we could take advantage of such a crisis to force a compromise with the despots of the foundation .  at the worst  they would forget us long enough to enable us to plan farther .     what do you think  torie .    toran smiled feebly and pulled at a loose brown curl that fell over one eye .   the way he describes it  it can t hurt  but who is the mule .  what do you know of him  randu .     nothing yet .  for that  we could use you  toran .  and your wife  if she s willing .  we ve talked of this  your father and i .  we ve talked of this thoroughly .     in what way  randu .  what do you want of us .   the young man cast a quick inquisitive look at his wife .    have you had a honeymoon .     well  .  .  .  yes  .  .  .  if you can call the trip from the foundation a honeymoon .     how about a better one on kalgan .  it s semitropical beaches     water sports     bird hunting     quite the vacation spot .  it s about seven thousand parsecs in not too far .     what s on kalgan .     the mule .  his men  at least .  he took it last month  and without a battle  though kalgan s warlord broadcast a threat to blow the planet to ionic dust before giving it up .     where s the warlord now .     he isn t   said randu  with a shrug .   what do you say .     but what are we to do .     i don t know .  fran and i are old  we re provincial .  the traders of haven are all essentially provincial .  even you say so .  our trading is of a very restricted sort  and we re not the galaxy roamers our ancestors were  shut up  fran .  but you two know the galaxy .  bayta  especially  speaks with a nice foundation accent .  we merely wish whatever you can find out .  if you can make contact  .  .  .  but we wouldn t expect that .  suppose you two think it over .  you can meet our entire group if you wish  .  .  .  oh  not before next week .  you ought to have some time to catch your breath .    there was a pause and then fran roared   who wants  another drink .  i mean  besides me .           .  captain and mayor  captain han pritcher was unused to the luxury of his surroundings and by no means impressed .  as a general thing  he discouraged self analysis and all forms of philosophy and metaphysics not directly connected with his work .   it helped .   his work consisted largely of what the war department called  intelligence   the sophisticates   espionage   and the romanticists   spy stuff .   and  unfortunately  despite the frothy shrillness of the televisors   intelligence    espionage   and  spy stuff  are at best a sordid business of routine betrayal and bad faith .  it is excused by society since it is in the  interest of the state   but since philosophy seemed always to lead captain pritcher to the conclusion that even in that holy interest  society is much more easily soothed than one s own conscience     he discouraged philosophy .   and now  in the luxury of the mayor s anteroom  his thoughts turned inward despite himself .   men had been promoted over his head continuously  though of lesser ability     that much was admitted .  he had withstood an eternal rain of black marks and official reprimands  and survived it .  and stubbornly he had held to his own way in the firm belief that insubordination in that same holy  interest of the state  would yet be recognized for the service it was .   so here he was in the anteroom of the mayor with five soldiers as a respectful guard  and probably a court martial awaiting him .   the heavy  marble doors rolled apart smoothly  silently  revealing satiny walls  a red plastic carpeting  and two more marble doors  metal inlaid  within .  two officials in the straight lined costume of three centuries back  stepped out  and called    an audience to captain han pritcher of information .    they stepped back with a ceremonious bow as the captain started forward .  his escort stopped at the outer door  and he entered the inner alone .   on the other side of the doors  in a large room strangely simple  behind a large desk strangely angular  sat a small man  almost lost in the immensity   mayor indbur     successively the third of that name     was the grandson of the first indbur  who had been brutal and capable  and who had exhibited the first quality in spectacular fashion by his manner of seizing power  and the latter by the skill with which he put an end to the last farcical remnants of free election and the even greater skill with which he maintained a relatively peaceful rule .   mayor indbur was also the son of the second indbur  who was the first mayor of the foundation to succeed to his post by right of birth     and who was only half his father  for he was merely brutal .   so mayor indbur was the third of the name and the second to succeed by right of birth  and he was the least of the three  for he was neither brutal nor capable     but merely an excellent bookkeeper born wrong .   indbur the third was a peculiar combination of ersatz characteristics to all but himself .   to him  a stilted geometric love of arrangement was  system   an indefatigable and feverish interest in the pettiest facets of day to day bureaucracy was  industry   indecision when right was  caution   and blind stubbornness when wrong   determination .    and withal he wasted no money  killed no man needlessly  and meant extremely well .   if captain pritcher s gloomy thoughts ran along these lines as he remained respectfully in place before the large desk  the wooden arrangement of his features yielded no insight into the fact .  he neither coughed  shifted weight  nor shuffled his feet until the thin face of the mayor lifted slowly as the busy stylus ceased in its task of marginal notations  and a sheet of close printed paper was lifted from one neat stack and placed upon another neat stack .   mayor indbur clasped his hands carefully before him  deliberately refraining from disturbing the careful arrangement of desk accessories .   he said  in acknowledgment   captain han pritcher of information .    and captain pritcher in strict obedience to protocol bent one knee nearly to the ground and bowed his head until he heard the words of release .    arise  captain pritcher .    the mayor said with an air of warm sympathy   you are here  captain pritcher  because of certain disciplinary action taken against yourself by your superior officer .  the papers concerning such action have come  in the ordinary course of events  to my notice  and since no event in the foundation is of disinterest to me  i took the trouble to ask for further information on your case .  you are not  i hope  surprised .    captain pritcher said unemotionally   excellence  no .  your justice is proverbial .     is it .  is it .   his tone was pleased  and the tinted contact lenses he wore caught the light in a manner that imparted a hard  dry gleam to his eyes .  meticulously  he fanned out a series of metal bound folders before him .  the parchment sheets within crackled sharply as he turned them  his long finger following down the line as he spoke .    i have your record here  captain     complete .  you are forty three and have been an officer of the armed forces for seventeen years .  you were born in loris  of anacreonian parents  no serious childhood diseases  an attack of myo  .  .  .  well  that s of no importance  .  .  .  education  premilitary  at the academy of sciences  major  hyper engines  academic standing  .  .  .  hm m m  very good  you are to be congratulated  .  .  .  entered the army as under officer on the one hundred second day of the    rd year of the foundation era .    he lifted his eyes momentarily as he shifted the first folder  and opened the second .    you see   he said   in my administration  nothing is left to chance .  order .  system .    he lifted a pink  scented jelly globule to his lips .  it was his one vice  and but dolingly indulged in .  witness the fact that the mayor s desk lacked that almost inevitable atom flash for the disposal of dead tobacco .  for the mayor did not smoke .   nor  as a matter of course  did his visitors .   the mayor s voice droned on  methodically  slurringly  mumblingly     now and then interspersed with whispered comments of equally mild and equally ineffectual commendation or reproof .   slowly  he replaced the folders as originally  in a single neat pile .    well  captain   he said  briskly   your record is unusual .  your ability is outstanding  it would seem  and your services valuable beyond question .  i note that you have been wounded in the line of duty twice  and that you have been awarded the order of merit for bravery beyond the call of duty .  those are facts not lightly to be minimized .    captain pritcher s expressionless face did not soften .  he remained stiffly erect .  protocol required that a subject honored by an audience with the mayor may not sit down     a point perhaps needlessly reinforced by the fact that only one chair existed in the room  the one underneath the mayor .  protocol further required no statements other than those needed to answer a direct question .   the mayor s eyes bore down hard upon the soldier and his voice grew pointed and heavy .   however  you have not been promoted in ten years  and your superiors report  over and over again  of the unbending stubbornness of your character .  you are reported to be chronically insubordinate  incapable of maintaining a correct attitude towards superior officers  apparently uninterested in maintaining frictionless relationships with your colleagues  and an incurable troublemaker  besides .  how do you explain that  captain .     excellence  i do what seems right to me .  my deeds on behalf of the state  and my wounds in that cause bear witness that what seems fight to me is also in the interest of the state .     a soldierly statement  captain  but a dangerous doctrine .  more of that  later .  specifically  you are charged with refusing an assignment three times in the face of orders signed by my legal delegates .  what have you to say to that .     excellence  the assignment lacks significance in a critical time  where matters of first importance are being ignored .     ah  and who tells you these matters you speak of are of the first importance at all  and if they are  who tells you further that they are ignored .     excellence  these things are quite evident to me .  my experience and my knowledge of events     the value of neither of which my superiors deny     make it plain .     but  my good captain  are you blind that you do not see that by arrogating to yourself the right to determine intelligence policy  you usurp the duties of your superior .     excellence  my duty is primarily to the state  and not to my superior .     fallacious  for your superior has his superior  and that superior is myself  and i am the state .  but come  you shall have no cause to complain of this justice of mine that you say is proverbial .  state in your own words the nature of the breach in discipline that has brought all this on .     excellence  my duty is primarily to the state  and not to my living the life of a retired merchant mariner upon the world of kalgan .  my instructions were to direct foundation activity upon the planet  perfect an organization to act as check upon the warlord of kalgan  particularly as regards his foreign policy .     this is known to me .  continue .     excellence  my reports have continually stressed the strategic positions of kalgan and the systems it controls .  i have reported on the ambition of the warlord  his resources  his determination to extend his domain and his essential friendliness     or  perhaps  neutrality     towards the foundation .     i have read your reports thoroughly .  continue .     excellence  i returned two months ago .  at that time  there was no sign of impending war  no sign of anything but an almost superfluity of ability to repel any conceivable attack .  one month ago  an unknown soldier of fortune took kalgan without a fight .  the man who was once warlord of kalgan is apparently no longer alive .  men do not speak of treason     they speak only of the power and genius of this strange condottiere     this mule .     this who .   the mayor leaned forward  and looked offended .    excellence  he is known as the mule .  he is spoken of little  in a factual sense  but i have gathered the scraps and fragments of knowledge and winnowed out the most probable of them .  he is apparently a man of neither birth nor standing .  his father  unknown .  his mother  dead in childbirth .  his upbringing  that of a vagabond .  his education  that of the tramp worlds  and the backwash alleys of space .  he has no name other than that of the mule  a name reportedly applied by himself to himself  and signifying  by popular explanation  his immense physical strength  and stubbornness of purpose .     what is his military strength  captain .  never mind his physique .     excellence  men speak of huge fleets  but in this they may be influenced by the strange fall of kalgan .  the territory he controls is not large  though its exact limits are not capable of definite determination .  nevertheless  this man must be investigated .     hm m m .  so .  so .   the mayor fell into a reverie  and slowly with twenty four strokes of his stylus drew six squares in hexagonal arrangements upon the blank top sheet of a pad  which he tore off  folded neatly in three parts and slipped into the wastepaper slot at his right hand .  it slid towards a clean and silent atomic disintegration .    now then  tell me  captain  what is the alternative .  you have told me what  must  be investigated .  what have you been ordered to investigate .     excellence  there is a rat hole in space that  it seems  does not pay its taxes .     ah  and is that all .  you are not aware  and have not been told that these men who do not pay their taxes  are descendants of the wild traders of our early days     anarchists  rebels  social maniacs who claim foundation ancestry and deride foundation culture .  you are not aware  and have not been told  that this rat hole in space  is not one  but many  that these rat holes are in greater number than we know  that these rat holes conspire together  one with the other  and all with the criminal elements that still exist throughout foundation territory .  even here  captain  even here .    the mayor s momentary fire subsided quickly .   you are not aware  captain .     excellence  i have been told all this .  but as servant of the state  i must serve faithfully     and he serves most faithfully who serves truth .  whatever the political implications of these dregs of the ancient traders     the warlords who have inherited the splinters of the old empire have the power .  the traders have neither arms nor resources .  they have not even unity .  i am not a tax collector to be sent on a child s errand .     captain pritcher  you are a soldier  and count guns .  it is a failing to be allowed you up to the point where it involves disobedience to myself .  take care .  my justice is not simply weakness .  captain  it has already been proven that the generals of the imperial age and the warlords of the present age are equally impotent against us .  seldon s science which predicts the course of the foundation is based  not on individual heroism  as you seem to believe  but on the social and economic trends of history .  we have passed successfully through four crises already  have we not .     excellence  we have .  yet seldon s science is known only to seldon .  we ourselves have but faith .  in the first three crises  as i have been carefully taught  the foundation was led by wise leaders who foresaw the nature of the crises and took the proper precautions .  otherwise     who can say .     yes  captain  but you omit the fourth crisis .  come  captain  we had no leadership worthy of the name then  and we faced the cleverest opponent  the heaviest armor  the strongest force of all .  yet we won by the inevitability of history .     excellence  that is true .  but this history you mention became inevitable only after we had fought desperately for over a year .  the inevitable victory we won cost us half a thousand ships and half a million men .  excellence  seldon s plan helps those who help themselves .    mayor indbur frowned and grew suddenly tired of his patient exposition .  it occurred to him that there was a fallacy in condescension  since it was mistaken for permission to argue eternally  to grow contentious  to wallow in dialectic .  he said  stiffly   nevertheless  captain  seldon guarantees victory over the warlords  and i can not  in these busy times  indulge in a dispersal of effort .  these traders you dismiss are foundation derived .  a war with them would be a civil war .  seldon s plan makes no guarantee there for us     since they and we are foundation .  so they must be brought to heel .  you have your orders .     excellence       you have been asked no question  captain .  you have your orders .  you will obey those orders .  further argument of any sort with myself or those representing myself will be considered treason .  you are excused .    captain han pritcher knelt once more  then left with slow  backward steps .   mayor indbur  third of his name  and second mayor of foundation history to be so by fight of birth  recovered his equilibrium  and lifted another sheet of paper from the neat stack at his left .  it was a report on the saving of funds due to the reduction of the quantity of metal foam edging on the uniforms of the police force .  mayor indbur crossed out a superfluous comma  corrected a misspelling  made three marginal notations  and placed it upon the neat stack at his fight .  he lifted another sheet of paper from the neat stack at his left .   captain han pritcher of information found a personal capsule waiting for him when he returned to barracks .  it contained orders  terse and redly underlined with a stamped  urgent   across it  and the whole initialed with a precise  capital  i  .   captain han pritcher was ordered to the  rebel world called haven  in the strongest terms .   captain han pritcher  alone in his light one man speedster  set his course quietly and calmly for kalgan .  he slept that night the sleep of a successfully stubborn man .          .  lieutenant and clown  if  from a distance of seven thousand parsecs  the fall of kalgan to the armies of the mule had produced reverberations that had excited the curiosity of an old trader  the apprehension of a dogged captain  and the annoyance of a meticulous mayor     to those on kalgan itself  it produced nothing and excited no one .  it is the invariable lesson to humanity that distance in time  and in space as well  lends focus .  it is not recorded  incidentally  that the lesson has ever been permanently learned .   kalgan was     kalgan .  it alone of all that quadrant of the galaxy seemed not to know that the empire had fallen  that the stannells no longer ruled  that greatness had departed  and peace had disappeared .   kalgan was the luxury world .  with the edifice of mankind crumbling  it maintained its integrity as a producer of pleasure  a buyer of gold and a seller of leisure .   it escaped the harsher vicissitudes of history  for what conqueror would destroy or even seriously damage a world so full of the ready cash that would buy immunity .   yet even kalgan had finally become the headquarters of a warlord and its softness had been tempered to the exigencies of war .   its tamed jungles  its mildly modeled shores  and its garishly glamorous cities echoed to the march of imported mercenaries and impressed citizens .  the worlds of its province had been armed and its money invested in battleships rather than bribes for the first time in its history .  its ruler proved beyond doubt that he was determined to defend what was his and eager to seize what was others .  he was a great one of the galaxy  a war and peace maker  a builder of empire  an establisher of dynasty .   and an unknown with a ridiculous nickname had taken him     and his arms     and his budding empire     and had not even fought a battle .   so kalgan was as before  and its uniformed citizens hurried back to their older life  while the foreign professionals of war merged easily into the newer bands that descended .   again as always  there were the elaborate luxury hunts for the cultivated animal life of the jungles that never took human life  and the speedster bird chases in the air above  that was fatal only to the great birds .   in the cities  the escapers of the galaxy could take their varieties of pleasure to suit their purse  from the ethereal sky palaces of spectacle and fantasy that opened their doors to the masses at the jingle of half a credit  to the unmarked  unnoted haunts to which only those of great wealth were of the cognoscenti .   to the vast flood  toran and bayta added not even a trickle .  they registered their ship in the huge common hangar on the east peninsula  and gravitated to that compromise of the middle classes  the inland sea where the pleasures were yet legal  and even respectable  and the crowds not yet beyond endurance .   bayta wore dark glasses against the light  and a thin  white robe against the heat .  warm tinted arms  scarcely the goldener for the sun  clasped her knees to her  and she stared with firm  abstracted gaze at the length of her husband s outstretched body     almost shimmering in the brilliance of white sun splendor .    don t overdo it   she had said at first  but toran was of a dying red star  despite three years of the foundation  sunlight was a luxury  and for four days now his skin  treated beforehand for ray resistance  had not felt the harshness of clothing  except for the brief shorts .   bayta huddled close to him on the sand and they spoke in whispers .   toran s voice was gloomy  as it drifted upwards from a relaxed face   no  i admit we re nowhere .  but where is he .  who is he .  this mad world says nothing of him .  perhaps he doesn t exist .     he exists   replied bayta  with lips that didn t move .   he s clever  that s all .  and your uncle is right .  he s a man we could use     if there s time .    a short pause .  toran whispered   know what i ve been doing  bay .  i m just daydreaming myself into a sun stupor .  things figure themselves out so neatly     so sweetly .   his voice nearly trailed off  then returned   remember the way dr .  amann talked back at college  bay .  the foundation can never lose  but that does not mean the rulers of the foundation can t .  didn t the real history of the foundation begin when salvor hardin kicked out the encyclopedists and took over the planet terminus as the first mayor .  and then in the next century  didn t hober mallow gain power by methods almost as drastic .  that s twice the rulers were defeated  so it can be done .  so why not by us .     it s the oldest argument in the books .  torie .  what a waste of good reverie .     is it .  follow it out .  what s haven .  isn t it part of the foundation .  if we become top dog  it s still the foundation winning  and only the current rulers losing .     lots of difference between  we can  and  we will .   you re just jabbering .    toran squirmed .   nuts  bay  you re just in one of your sour  green moods .  what do you want to spoil my fun for .  i ll just go to sleep if you don t mind .    but bayta was craning her head  and suddenly     quite a non sequitur     she giggled  and removed her glasses to look down the beach with only her palm shading her eyes .   toran looked up  then lifted and twisted his shoulders to follow her glance .   apparently  she was watching a spindly figure  feet in air  who teetered on his hands for the amusement of a haphazard crowd .  it was one of the swarming acrobatic beggars of the shore  whose supple joints bent and snapped for the sake of the thrown coins .   a beach guard was motioning him on his way and with a surprising one handed balance  the clown brought a thumb to his nose in an upside down gesture .  the guard advanced threateningly and reeled backward with a foot in his stomach .  the clown righted himself without interrupting the motion of the initial kick and was away  while the frothing guard was held off by a thoroughly unsympathetic crowd .   the clown made his way raggedly down the beach .  he brushed past many  hesitated often  stopped nowhere .  the original crowd had dispersed .  the guard had departed .    he s a queer fellow   said bayta  with amusement  and toran agreed indifferently .  the clown was close enough now to be seen clearly .  his thin face drew together in front into a nose of generous planes and fleshy tip that seemed all but prehensile .  his long  lean limbs and spidery body  accentuated by his costume  moved easily and with grace  but with just a suggestion of having been thrown together at random .   to look was to smile .   the clown seemed suddenly aware of their regard  for he stopped after he had passed  and  with a sharp turn  approached .  his large  brown eyes fastened upon bayta .   she found herself disconcerted .   the clown smiled  but it only saddened his beaked face  and when he spoke it was with the soft  elaborate phrasing of the central sectors .    were i to use the wits the good spirits gave me   he said   then i would say this lady can not exist     for what sane man would hold a dream to be reality .  yet rather would i not be sane and lend belief to charmed  enchanted eyes .    bayta s own eyes opened wide .  she said   wow .    toran laughed   oh  you enchantress .  go ahead  bay  that deserves a five credit piece .  let him have it .    but the clown was forward with a jump .   no  my lady  mistake me not .  i spoke for money not at all  but for bright eyes and sweet face .     well  thanks   then  to toran   golly  you think the sun s in his eyes .     yet not alone for eyes and face   babbled the clown  as his words hurled past each other in heightened frenzy   but also for a mind  clear and sturdy     and kind as well .    toran rose to his feet  reached for the white robe he had crooked his arm about for four days  and slipped into it .    now  bud   he said   suppose you tell me what you want  and stop annoying the lady .    the clown fell back a frightened step  his meager body cringing .   now  sure i meant no harm .  i am a stranger here  and it s been said i am of addled wits  yet there is something in a face that i can read .  behind this lady s fairness  there is a heart that s kind  and that would help me in my trouble for all i speak so boldly .     will five credits cure your trouble .   said toran  dryly  and held out the coin .   but the clown did not move to take it  and bayta said   let me talk to him  torie   she added swiftly  and in an undertone   there s no use being annoyed at his silly way of talking .  that s just his dialect  and our speech is probably as strange to him .    she said   what is your trouble .  you re not worried about the guard  are you .  he won t bother you .     oh  no  not he .  he s but a windlet that blows the dust about my ankles .  there is another that i flee  and he is a storm that sweeps the worlds aside and throws them plunging at each other .  a week ago  i ran away  have slept in city streets  and hid in city crowds .  i ve looked in many faces for help in need .  i find it here .   he repeated the last phrase in softer  anxious tones  and his large eyes were troubled   i find it here .     now   said bayta  reasonably   i would like to help  but really  friend  i m no protection against a world sweeping storm .  to be truthful about it  i could use      there was an uplifted  powerful voice that bore down upon them .    now  then  you mud spawned rascal      it was the beach guard  with a fire red face  and snarling mouth  that approached at a run .  he pointed with his low power stun pistol .    hold him  you two .  don t let him get away .   his heavy hand fell upon the clown s thin shoulder  so that a whimper was squeezed out of him .   toran said   what s he done .     what s he done .  what s he done .  well  now  that s good .   the guard reached inside the dangling pocket attached to his belt  and removed a purple handkerchief  with which he mopped his bare neck .  he said with relish .   i ll tell you what he s done .  he s run away .  the word s all over kalgan and i would have recognized him before this if he had been on his feet instead of on his hawkface top .   and he rattled his prey in a fierce good humor .   bayta said with a smile   now where did he escape from  sir .    the guard raised his voice .  a crowd was gathering  popeyed and jabbering  and with the increase of audience  the guard s sense of importance increased in direct ratio .    where did he escape from .   he declaimed in high sarcasm .   why  i suppose you ve heard of the mule  now .    all jabbering stopped  and bayta felt a sudden iciness trickle down into her stomach .  the clown had eyes only for her he still quivered in the guard s brawny grasp .    and who   continued the guard heavily   would this infernal ragged piece be  but his lordship s own court fool who s run away .   he jarred his captive with a massive shake   do you admit it  fool .    there was only white fear for answer  and the soundless sibilance of bayta s voice close to toran s ear .   toran stepped forward to the guard in friendly fashion   now  my man  suppose you take your hand away for just a while .  this entertainer you hold has been dancing for us and has not yet danced out his fee .     here .   the guard s voice rose in sudden concern .   there s a reward       you ll have it  if you can prove he s the man you want .  suppose you withdraw till then .  you know that you re interfering with a guest  which could be serious for you .     but you re interfering with his lordship and that will be serious for you .   he shook the clown once again .   return the man s fee  carrion .    toran s hand moved quickly and the guard s stun pistol was wrenched away with half a finger nearly following it .  the guard howled his pain and rage .  toran shoved him violently aside  and the clown  unhanded  scuttled behind him .   the crowd  whose fringes were now lost to the eye  paid little attention to the latest development .  there was among them a craning of necks  and a centrifugal motion as if many had decided to increase their distance from the center of activity .   then there was a bustle  and a rough order in the distance .  a corridor formed itself and two men strode through  electric whips in careless readiness .  upon each purple blouse was designed an angular shaft of lightning with a splitting planet underneath .   a dark giant  in lieutenant s uniform  followed them  dark of skin  and hair  and scowl .   the dark man spoke with the dangerous softness that meant he had little need of shouting to enforce his whims .  he said   are you the man who notified us .    the guard was still holding his wrenched hand  and with a pain distorted face mumbled   i claim the reward  your mightiness  and i accuse that man       you ll get your reward   said the lieutenant  without looking at him .  he motioned curtly to his men   take him .    toran felt the clown tearing at his robe with a maddened grip .   he raised his voice and kept it from shaking   i m sorry  lieutenant  this man is mine .    the soldiers took the statement without blinking .  one raised his whip casually  but the lieutenant s snapped order brought it down .   his dark mightiness swung forward and planted his square body before toran   who are you .    and the answer rang out   a citizen of the foundation .    it worked with the crowd  at any rate .  the pent up silence broke into an intense hum .  the mule s name might excite fear  but it was  after all  a new name and scarcely stuck as deeply in the vitals as the old one of the foundation     that had destroyed the empire     and the fear of which ruled a quadrant of the galaxy with ruthless despotism .   the lieutenant kept face .  he said   are you aware of the identity of the man behind you .     i have been told he s a runaway from the court of your leader  but my only sure knowledge is that he is a friend of mine .  you ll need firm proof of his identity to take him .    there were high pitched sighs from the crowd  but the lieutenant let it pass .   have you your papers of foundation citizenship with you .     at my ship .     you realize that your actions are illegal .  i can have you shot .     undoubtedly .  but then you would have shot a foundation citizen and it is quite likely that your body would be sent to the foundation     quartered     as part compensation .  it s been done by other warlords .    the lieutenant wet his lips .  the statement was true .   he said   your name .    toran followed up his advantage   i will answer further questions at my ship .  you can get the cell number at the hangar  it is registered under the name  bayta  .     you won t give up the runaway .     to the mule  perhaps .  send your master .    the conversation had degenerated to a whisper and the lieutenant turned sharply away .    disperse the crowd .   he said to his men  with suppressed ferocity .   the electric whips rose and fell .  there were shrieks and a vast surge of separation and flight .   toran interrupted his reverie only once on their way back to the hangar .  he said  almost to himself   galaxy  bay  what a time i had .  i was so scared       yes   she said  with a voice that still shook  and eyes that still showed something akin to worship   it was quite out of character .     well  i still don t know what happened .  i just got up there with a stun pistol that i wasn t even sure i knew how to use  and talked back to him .  i don t know why i did it .    he looked across the aisle of the short run air vessel that was carrying them out of the beach area  to the seat on which the mule s clown scrunched up in sleep  and added distastefully   it was the hardest thing i ve ever done .    the lieutenant stood respectfully before the colonel of the garrison  and the colonel looked at him and said   well done .  your part s over now .    but the lieutenant did not retire immediately .  he said darkly   the mule has lost face before a mob  sir .  it will be necessary to undertake disciplinary action to restore proper atmosphere of respect .     those measures have already been taken .    the lieutenant half turned  then  almost with resentment   i m willing to agree  sir  that orders are orders  but standing before that man with his stun pistol and swallowing his insolence whole  was the hardest thing i ve ever done .           .  the mutant  the  hangar  on kalgan is an institution peculiar unto itself  born of the need for the disposition of the vast number of ships brought in by the visitors from abroad  and the simultaneous and consequent vast need for living accommodations for the same .  the original bright one who had thought of the obvious solution had quickly become a millionaire .  his heirs     by birth or finance     were easily among the richest on kalgan .   the  hangar  spreads fatly over square miles of territory  and  hangar  does not describe it at all sufficiently .  it is essentially a hotel     for ships .  the traveler pays in advance and his ship is awarded a berth from which it can take off into space at any desired moment .  the visitor then lives in his ship as always .  the ordinary hotel services such as the replacement of food and medical supplies at special rates  simple servicing of the ship itself  special intra kalgan transportation for a nominal sum are to be had  of course .   as a result  the visitor combines hangar space and hotel bill into one  at a saving .  the owners sell temporary use of ground space at ample profits .  the government collects huge taxes .  everyone has fun .  nobody loses .  simple .   the man who made his way down the shadow borders of the wide corridors that connected the multitudinous wings of the  hangar  had in the past speculated on the novelty and usefulness of the system described above  but these were reflections for idle moments     distinctly unsuitable at present .   the ships hulked in their height and breadth down the long lines of carefully aligned cells  and the man discarded line after line .  he was an expert at what he was doing now and if his preliminary study of the hangar registry had failed to give specific information beyond the doubtful indication of a specific wing     one containing hundreds of ships     his specialized knowledge could winnow those hundreds into one .   there was the ghost of a sigh in the silence  as the man stopped and faded down one of the lines  a crawling insect beneath the notice of the arrogant metal monsters that rested there .   here and there the sparkling of light from a porthole would indicate the presence of an early returner from the organized pleasures to simpler     or more private     pleasures of his own .   the man halted  and would have smiled if he ever smiled .  certainly the convolutions of his brain performed the mental equivalent of a smile .   the ship he stopped at was sleek and obviously fast .  the peculiarity of its design was what he wanted .  it was not a usual model     and these days most of the ships of this quadrant of the galaxy either imitated foundation design or were built by foundation technicians .  but this was special .  this was a foundation ship     if only because of the tiny bulges in the skin that were the nodes of the protective screen that only a foundation ship could possess .  there were other indications  too .   the man felt no hesitation .   the electronic barrier strung across the line of the ships as a concession to privacy on the part of the management was not at all important to him .  it parted easily  and without activating the alarm  at the use of the very special neutralizing force he had at his disposal .   so the first knowledge within the ship of the intruder without was the casual and almost friendly signal of the muted buzzer in the ship s living room that was the result of a palm placed over the little photocell just one side of the main air lock .   and while that successful search went on  toran and bayta felt only the most precarious security within the steel walls of the bayta .  the mule s clown who had reported that within his narrow compass of body he held the lordly name of magnifico giganticus  sat hunched over the table and gobbled at the food set before him .   his sad  brown eyes lifted from his meat only to follow bayta s movements in the combined kitchen and larder where he ate .    the thanks of a weak one are of but little value   he muttered   but you have them  for truly  in this past week  little but scraps have come my way     and for all my body is small  yet is my appetite unseemly great .     well  then  eat .   said bayta  with a smile .   don t waste your time on thanks .  isn t there a central galaxy proverb about gratitude that i once heard .     truly there is  my lady .  for a wise man  i have been told  once said   gratitude is best and most effective when it does not evaporate itself in empty phrases .   but alas  my lady  i am but a mass of empty phrases  it would seem .  when my empty phrases pleased the mule  it brought me a court dress  and a grand name     for  see you  it was originally simply bobo  one that pleases him not     and then when my empty phrases pleased him not  it would bring upon my poor bones beatings and whippings .    toran entered from the pilot room   nothing to do now but wait  bay .  i hope the mule is capable of understanding that a foundation ship is foundation territory .    magnifico giganticus  once bobo  opened his eyes wide and exclaimed   how great is the foundation before which even the cruel servants of the mule tremble .     have you heard of the foundation  too .   asked bayta  with a little smile .    and who has not .   magnifico s voice was a mysterious whisper .   there are those who say it is a world of great magic  of fires that can consume planets  and secrets of mighty strength .  they say that not the highest nobility of the galaxy could achieve the honor and deference considered only the natural due of a simple man who could say  i am a citizen of the foundation       were he only a salvage miner of space  or a nothing like myself .    bayta said   now  magnifico  you ll never finish if you make speeches .  here  i ll get you a little flavored milk .  it s good .    she placed a pitcher of it upon the table and motioned toran out of the room .    torie  what are we going to do now     about him .   and she motioned towards the kitchen .    how do you mean .     if the mule comes  are we going to give him up .     well  what else  bay .   he sounded harassed  and the gesture with which he shoved back the moist curl upon his forehead testified to that .   he continued impatiently   before i came here i had a sort of vague idea that all we had to do was to ask for the mule  and then get down to business     just business  you know  nothing definite .     i know what you mean  torie .  i wasn t much hoping to see the mule myself  but i did think we could pick up some firsthand knowledge of the mess  and then pass it over to people who know a little more about this interstellar intrigue .  i m no storybook spy .     you re not behind me  bay .   he folded his arms and frowned .   what a situation .  you d never know there was a person like the mule  except for this last queer break .  do you suppose he ll come for his clown .    bayta looked up at him .   i don t know that i want him to .  i don t know what to say or do .  do you .    the inner buzzer sounded with its intermittent burring noise .  bayta s lips moved wordlessly   the mule .    magnifico was in the doorway  eyes wide  his voice a whimper   the mule .    toran murmured   i ve got to let them in .    a contact opened the air lock and the outer door closed behind the newcomer .  the scanner showed only a single shadowed figure .    it s only one person   said toran  with open relief  and his voice was almost shaky as he bent toward the signal tube   who are you .     you d better let me in and find out  hadn t you .   the words came thinly out the receiver .    i ll inform you that this is a foundation ship and consequently foundation territory by international treaty .     i know that .     come with your arms free  or i ll shoot .  i m well armed .     done .    toran opened the inner door and closed contact on his blast pistol  thumb hovering over the pressure point .  there was the sound of footsteps and then the door swung open  and magnifico cried out   it s not the mule .  it s but a man .    the  man  bowed to the clown somberly   very accurate .  i m not the mule .   he held his hands apart   i m not armed  and i come on a peaceful errand .  you might relax and put the blast pistol away .  your hand isn t steady enough for my peace of mind .     who are you .   asked toran  brusquely .    i might ask you that   said the stranger  coolly   since you re the one under false pretenses  not i .     how so .     you re the one who claims to be a foundation citizen when there s not an authorized trader on the planet .     that s not so .  how would you know .     because i am a foundation citizen  and have my papers to prove it .  where are yours .     i think you d better get out .     i think not .  if you know anything about foundation methods  and despite your imposture you might  you d know that if i don t return alive to my ship at a specified time  there ll be a signal at the nearest foundation headquarters so i doubt if your weapons will have much effect  practically speaking .    there was an irresolute silence and then bayta said  calmly   put the blaster away  toran  and take him at face value .  he sounds like the real thing .     thank you   said the stranger .   toran put his gun on the chair beside him   suppose you explain all this now .    the stranger remained standing .  he was long of bone and large of limb .  his face consisted of hard flat planes and it was somehow evident that he never smiled .  but his eyes lacked hardness .   he said   news travels quickly  especially when it is apparently beyond belief .  i don t suppose there s a person on kalgan who doesn t know that the mule s men were kicked in the teeth today by two tourists from the foundation .  i knew of the important details before evening  and  as i said  there are no foundation tourists aside from myself on the planet .  we know about those things .     who are the  we  .      we  are      we  .  myself for one .  i knew you were at the hangar     you had been overheard to say so .  i had my ways of checking the registry  and my ways of finding the ship .    he turned to bayta suddenly   you re from the foundation     by birth  aren t you .     am i .     you re a member of the democratic opposition     they call it  the underground .   i don t remember your name  but i do the face .  you got out only recently     and wouldn t have if you were more important .    bayta shrugged   you know a lot .     i do .  you escaped with a man .  that one .     does it matter what i say .     no .  i merely want a thorough mutual understanding .  i believe that the password during the week you left so hastily was  seldon  hardin  and freedom .   porfirat hart was your section leader .      where d you get that .   bayta was suddenly fierce .   did the police get him .   toran held her back  but she shook herself loose and advanced .   the man from the foundation said quietly   nobody has him .  it s just that the underground spreads widely and in queer places .  i m captain han pritcher of information  and i m a section leader myself     never mind under what name .    he waited  then said   no  you don t have to believe me .  in our business it is better to overdo suspicion than the opposite .  but i d better get past the preliminaries .     yes   said toran   suppose you do .     may i sit down .  thanks .   captain pritcher swung a long leg across his knee and let an arm swing loose over the back of the chair .   i ll start out by saying that i don t know what all this is about     from your angle .  you two aren t from the foundation  but it s not a hard guess that you re from one of the independent trading worlds .  that doesn t bother me overmuch .  but out of curiosity  what do you want with that fellow  that clown you snatched to safety .  you re risking your life to hold on to him .     i can t tell you that .     hm m m .  well  i didn t think you would .  but if you re waiting for the mule himself to come behind a fanfarade of horns  drums  and electric organs     relax .  the mule doesn t work that way .     what .   it came from both toran and bayta  and in the comer where magnifico lurked with ears almost visibly expanded  there was a sudden joyful start .    that s right .  i ve been trying to contact him myself  and doing a rather more thorough job of it than you two amateurs can .  it won t work .  the man makes no personal appearance  does not allow himself to be photographed or simulated  and is seen only by his most intimate associates .     is that supposed to explain your interest in us  captain .   questioned toran .    no .  that clown is the key .  that clown is one of the very few that have seen him .  i want him .  he may be the proof i need     and i need something  galaxy knows     to awaken the foundation .     it needs awakening .   broke in bayta with sudden sharpness .   against what .  and in what role do you act as alarm  that of rebel democrat or of secret police and provocateur .    the captain s face set in its hard lines .   when the entire foundation is threatened  madame revolutionary  both democrats and tyrants perish .  let us save the tyrants from a greater  that we may overthrow them in their turn .     who s the greater tyrant you speak of .   flared bayta .    the mule .  i know a bit about him  enough to have been my death several times over already  if i had moved less nimbly .  send the clown out of the room .  this will require privacy .     magnifico   said bayta  with a gesture  and the clown left without a sound .   the captain s voice was grave and intense  and low enough so that toran and bayta drew close .   he said   the mule is a shrewd operator     far too shrewd not to realize the advantage of the magnetism and glamour of personal leadership .  if he gives that up  it s for a reason .  that reason must be the fact that personal contact would reveal something that is of overwhelming importance not to reveal .    he waved aside questions  and continued more quickly   i went back to his birthplace for this  and questioned people who for their knowledge will not live long .  few enough are still alive .  they remember the baby born thirty years before     the death of his mother     his strange youth .  the mule is not a human being .    and his two listeners drew back in horror at the misty implications .  neither understood  fully or clearly  but the menace of the phrase was definite .   the captain continued   he is a mutant  and obviously from his subsequent career  a highly successful one .  i don t know his powers or the exact extent to which he is what our thrillers would call a  superman   but the rise from nothing to the conqueror of kalgan s warlord in two years is revealing .  you see  don t you  the danger .  can a genetic accident of unpredictable biological properties be taken into account in the seldon plan .    slowly  bayta spoke   i don t believe it .  this is some sort of complicated trickery .  why didn t the mule s men kill us when they could have  if he s a superman .     i told you that i don t know the extent of his mutation .  he may not be ready  yet  for the foundation  and it would be a sign of the greatest wisdom to resist provocation until ready .  now let me speak to the clown .    the captain faced the trembling magnifico  who obviously distrusted this huge  hard man who faced him .   the captain began slowly   have you seen the mule with your own eyes .     i have but too well  respected sir .  and felt the weight of his arm with my own body as well .     i have no doubt of that .  can you describe him .     it is frightening to recall him  respected sir .  he is a man of mighty frame .  against him  even you would be but a spindling .  his hair is of a burning crimson  and with all my strength and weight i could not pull down his arm  once extended     not a hair s thickness .   magnifico s thinness seemed to collapse upon itself in a huddle of arms and legs .   often  to amuse his generals or to amuse only himself  he would suspend me by one finger in my belt from a fearful height  while i chattered poetry .  it was only after the twentieth verse that i was withdrawn  and each improvised and each a perfect rhyme  or else start over .  he is a man of overpowering might  respected sir  and cruel in the use of his power     and his eyes  respected sir  no one sees .     what .  what s that last .     he wears spectacles  respected sir  of a curious nature .  it is said that they are opaque and that he sees by a powerful magic that far transcends human powers .  i have heard   and his voice was small and mysterious   that to see his eyes is to see death  that he kills with his eyes  respected sir .    magnifico s eyes wheeled quickly from one watching face to another .  he quavered   it is true .  as i live  it is true .     bayta drew a long breath   sounds like you re right  captain .  do you want to take over .     well  let s look at the situation .  you don t owe anything here .  the hangar s barrier above is free .     i can leave any time .     then leave .  the mule may not wish to antagonize the foundation  but he runs a frightful risk in letting magnifico get away .  it probably accounts for the hue and cry after the poor devil in the first place .  so there may be ships waiting for you upstairs .  if you re lost in space  who s to pin the crime .     you re right   agreed toran  bleakly .    however  you ve got a shield and you re probably speedier than anything they ve got  so as soon as you re clear of the atmosphere make the circle in neutral to the other hemisphere  then just cut a track outwards at top acceleration .     yes   said bayta coldly   and when we are back on the foundation  what then  captain .         why  you are then co operative citizens of kalgan  are you not .  i know nothing to the contrary  do i .    nothing was said .  toran turned to the controls .  there was an imperceptible lurch .   it was when toran had left kalgan sufficiently far in the rear to attempt his first interstellar jump  that captain pritcher s face first creased slightly     for no ship of the mule had in any way attempted to bar their leaving .    looks like he s letting us carry off magnifico   said toran .   not so good for your story .     unless   corrected the captain   he wants us to carry him off  in which case it s not so good for the foundation .    it was after the last jump  when within neutral flight distance of the foundation  that the first hyperwave news broadcast reached the ship .   and there was one news item barely mentioned .  it seemed that a warlord     unidentified by the bored speaker     had made representations to the foundation concerning the forceful abduction of a member of his court .  the announcer went on to the sports news .   captain pritcher said icily   he s one step ahead of us after all .   thoughtfully  he added   he s ready for the foundation  and he uses this as an excuse for action .  it makes things more difficult for us .  we will have to act before we are really ready .           .  the psychologist  there was reason to the fact that the element known as  pure science  was the freest form of life on the foundation .  in a galaxy where the predominance     and even survival     of the foundation still rested upon the superiority of its technology     even despite its large access of physical power in the last century and a half     a certain immunity adhered to the scientist .  he was needed  and he knew it .   likewise  there was reason to the fact that ebling mis     only those who did not know him added his titles to his name     was the freest form of life in the  pure science  of the foundation .  in a world where science was respected  he was the scientist     with capital letters and no smile .  he was needed  and he knew it .   and so it happened  that when others bent their knee  he refused and added loudly that his ancestors in their time bowed no knee to any stinking mayor .  and in his ancestors  time the mayor was elected anyhow  and kicked out at will  and that the only people that inherited anything by right of birth were the congenital idiots .   so it also happened  that when ebling mis decided to allow indbur to honor him with an audience  he did not wait for the usual rigid line of command to pass his request up and the favored reply down  but  having thrown the less disreputable of his two formal jackets over his shoulders and pounded an odd hat of impossible design on one side of his head  and lit a forbidden cigar into the bargain  he barged past two ineffectually bleating guards and into the mayor s palace .   the first notice his excellence received of the intrusion was when from his garden he heard the gradually nearing uproar of expostulation and the answering bull roar of inarticulate swearing .   slowly  indbur lay down his trowel  slowly  he stood up  and slowly  he frowned .  for indbur allowed himself a daily vacation from work  and for two hours in the early afternoon  weather permitting  he was in his garden .  there in his garden  the blooms grew in squares and triangles  interlaced in a severe order of red and yellow  with little dashes of violet at the apices  and greenery bordering the whole in rigid lines .  there in his garden no one disturbed him     no one .   indbur peeled off his soil stained gloves as he advanced toward the little garden door .   inevitably  he said   what is the meaning of this .    it is the precise question and the precise wording thereof that has been put to the atmosphere on such occasions by an incredible variety of men since humanity was invented .  it is not recorded that it has ever been asked for any purpose other than dignified effect .   but the answer was literal this time  for mis s body came plunging through with a bellow  and a shake of a fist at the ones who were still holding tatters of his cloak .   indbur motioned them away with a solemn  displeased frown  and mis bent to pick up his ruin of a hat  shake about a quarter of the gathered dirt off it  thrust it under his armpit and say    look here  indbur  those unprintable minions of yours will be charged for one good cloak .  lots of good wear left in this cloak .   he puffed and wiped his forehead with just a trace of theatricality .   the mayor stood stiff with displeasure  and said haughtily from the peak of his five foot two   it has not been brought to my attention  mis  that you have requested an audience .  you have certainly not been assigned one .    ebling mis looked down at his mayor with what was apparently shocked disbelief   ga lax y  indbur  didn t you get my note yesterday .  i handed it to a flunky in purple uniform day before .  i would have handed it to you direct  but i know how you like formality .     formality .   indbur turned up exasperated eyes .  then  strenuously   have you ever heard of proper organization .  at all future times you are to submit your request for an audience  properly made out in triplicate  at the government office intended for the purpose .  you are then to wait until the ordinary course of events brings you notification of the time of audience to be granted .  you are then to appear  properly clothed     properly clothed  do you understand     and with proper respect  too .  you may leave .     what s wrong with my clothes .   demanded mis  hotly .   best cloak i had till those unprintable fiends got their claws on it .  i ll leave just as soon as i deliver what i came to deliver .   ga lax y  if it didn t involve a seldon crisis  i would leave right now .     seldon crisis .   indbur exhibited first interest .  mis was a great psychologist     a democrat  boor  and rebel certainly  but a psychologist  too .  in his uncertainty  the mayor even failed to put into words the inner pang that stabbed suddenly when mis plucked a casual bloom  held it to his nostrils expectantly  then flipped it away with a wrinkled nose .   indbur said coldly   would you follow me .  this garden wasn t made for serious conversation .    he felt better in his built up chair behind his large desk from which he could look down on the few hairs that quite ineffectually hid mis s pink scalp skin .  he felt much better when mis cast a series of automatic glances about him for a non existent chair and then remained standing in uneasy shifting fashion .  he felt best of all when in response to a careful pressure of the correct contact  a liveried underling scurried in  bowed his way to the desk  and laid thereon a bulky  metal bound volume .    now  in order   said indbur  once more master of the situation   to make this unauthorized interview as short as possible  make your statement in the fewest possible words .    ebling mis said unhurriedly   you know what i m doing these days .     i have your reports here   replied the mayor  with satisfaction   together with authorized summaries of them .  as i understand it  your investigations into the mathematics of psychohistory have been intended to duplicate hari seldon s work and  eventually  trace the projected course of future history  for the use of the foundation .     exactly   said mis  dryly .   when seldon first established the foundation  he was wise enough to include no psychologists among the scientists placed here     so that the foundation has always worked blindly along the course of historical necessity .  in the course of my researches  i have based a good deal upon hints found at the time vault .     i am aware of that  mis .  it is a waste of time to repeat .     i m not repeating   blared mis   because what i m going to tell you isn t in any of those reports .     how do you mean  not in the reports .   said indbur  stupidly .   how could       ga lax y  let me tell this my own way  you offensive little creature .  stop putting words into my mouth and questioning my every statement or i ll tramp out of here and let everything crumble around you .  remember  you unprintable fool  the foundation will come through because it must  but if i walk out of here now     you won t .    dashing his hat on the floor  so that clods of earth scattered  he sprang up the stairs of the dais on which the wide desk stood and shoving papers violently  sat down upon a comer of it .   indbur thought frantically of summoning the guard  or using the built in blasters of his desk .  but mis s face was glaring down upon him and there was nothing to do but cringe the best face upon it .    dr .  mis   he began  with weak formality   you must       shut up   said mis  ferociously   and listen .  if this thing here   and his palm came down heavily on the metal of the bound data   is a mess of my reports     throw it out .  any report i write goes up through some twenty odd officials  gets to you  and then sort of winds down through twenty more .  that s fine if there s nothing you don t want kept secret .  well  i ve got something confidential here .  it s so confidential  even the boys working for me haven t got wind of it .  they did the work  of course  but each just a little unconnected piece     and i put it together .  you know what the time vault is .    indbur nodded his head  but mis went on with loud enjoyment of the situation   well  i ll tell you anyhow because i ve been sort of imagining this unprintable situation for a  ga lax y  of a long time  i can read your mind  you puny fraud .  you ve got your hand right near a little knob that ll call in about five hundred or so armed men to finish me off  but you re afraid of what i know     you re afraid of a seldon crisis .  besides which  if you touch anything on your desk  i ll knock your unprintable head off before anyone gets here .  you and your bandit father and pirate grandfather have been blood sucking the foundation long enough anyway .     this is treason   gabbled indbur .    it certainly is   gloated mis   but what are you going to do about it .  let me tell you about the time vault .  that time vault is what hari seldon placed here at the beginning to help us over the rough spots .  for every crisis  seldon has prepared a personal simulacrum to help     and explain .  four crises so far     four appearances .  the first time he appeared at the height of the first crisis .  the second time  he appeared at the moment just after the successful evolution of the second crisis .  our ancestors were there to listen to him both times .  at the third and fourth crises  he was ignored     probably because he was not needed  but recent investigations     not included in those reports you have     indicate that he appeared anyway  and at the proper times .  get it .    he did not wait for any answer .  his cigar  a tattered  dead ruin was finally disposed of  a new cigar groped for  and lit .  the smoke puffed out violently .   he said   officially i ve been trying to rebuild the science of psychohistory .  well  no one man is going to do that  and it won t get done in any one century  either .  but i ve made advances in the more simple elements and i ve been able to use it as an excuse to meddle with the time vault .  what i have done  involves the determination  to a pretty fair kind of certainty  of the exact date of the next appearance of hari seldon .  i can give you the exact day  in other words  that the coming seldon crisis  the fifth  will reach its climax .      how far off .   demanded indbur  tensely .   and mis exploded his bomb with cheerful nonchalance    four months   he said .   four unprintable months  less two days .     four months   said indbur  with uncharacteristic vehemence .   impossible .     impossible  my unprintable eye .     four months .  do you understand what that means .  for a crisis to come to a head in four months would mean that it has been preparing for years .     and why not .  is there a law of nature that requires the process to mature in the full light of day .     but nothing impends .  nothing hangs over us .   indbur almost wrung his hands for anxiety .  with a sudden spasmodic recrudescence of ferocity  he screamed   will you get off my desk and let me put it in order .  how do you expect me to think .    mis  startled  lifted heavily and moved aside .   indbur replaced objects in their appropriate niches with a feverish motion .  he was speaking quickly   you have no right to come here like this .  if you had presented your theory       it is not a theory .     i say it is a theory .  if you had presented it together with your evidence and arguments  in appropriate fashion  it would have gone to the bureau of historical sciences .  there it could have been properly treated  the resulting analyses submitted to me  and then  of course  proper action would have been taken .  as it is  you ve vexed me to no purpose .  ah  here it is .    he had a sheet of transparent  silvery paper in his hand which he shook at the bulbous psychologist beside him .    this is a short summary i prepare myself     weekly     of foreign matters in progress .  listen     we have completed negotiations for a commercial treaty with mores  continue negotiations for one with lyonesse  sent a delegation to some celebration or other on bonde  received some complaint or other from kalgan and we ve promised to look into it  protested some sharp trade practices in asperta and they ve promised to look into it     and so on and so on .   the mayor s eyes swarmed down the list of coded notations  and then he carefully placed the sheet in its proper place in the proper folder in the proper pigeonhole .   i tell you  mis  there s not a thing there that breathes anything but order and peace      the door at the far  long end opened  and  in far too dramatically coincident a fashion to suggest anything but real life  a plainly costumed notable stepped in .   indbur half rose .  he had the curiously swirling sensation of unreality that comes upon those days when too much happens .  after mis s intrusion and wild fumings there now came the equally improper  hence disturbing  intrusion unannounced  of his secretary  who at least knew the rules .   the secretary kneeled low .   indbur said  sharply   well .    the secretary addressed the floor   excellence  captain han pritcher of information  returning from kalgan  in disobedience to your orders  has according to prior instructions     your order x           been imprisoned  and awaits execution .  those accompanying him are being held for questioning .  a full report has been filed .    indbur  in agony  said   a full report has been received .  well .     excellence  captain pritcher has reported  vaguely  dangerous designs on the part of the new warlord of kalgan .  he has been given  according to prior instructions     your order x           no formal hearing  but his remarks have been recorded and a full report filed .    indbur screamed   a full report has been received .  well .     excellence  reports have within the quarter hour been received from the salinnian frontier .  ships identified as kalganian have been entering foundation territory  unauthorized .  the ships are armed .  fighting has occurred .    the secretary was bent nearly double .  indbur remained standing .  ebling mis shook himself  clumped up to the secretary  and tapped him sharply on the shoulder .    here  you d better have them release this captain pritcher  and have him sent here .  get out .    the secretary left  and mis turned to the mayor   hadn t you better get the machinery moving  indbur .  four months  you know .    indbur remained standing  glaze eyed .  only one finger seemed alive     and it traced rapid jerky triangles on the smooth desk top before him .          .  conference  when the twenty seven independent trading worlds  united only by their distrust of the mother planet of the foundation  concert an assembly among themselves  and each is big with a pride grown of its smallness  hardened by its own insularity and embittered by eternal danger     there are preliminary negotiations to be overcome of a pettiness sufficiently staggering to heartsicken the most persevering .   it is not enough to fix in advance such details as methods of voting  type of representation     whether by world or by population .  these are matters of involved political importance .  it is not enough to fix matters of priority at the table  both council and dinner  those are matters of involved social importance .   it was the place of meeting     since that was a matter of overpowering provincialism .  and in the end the devious routes of diplomacy led to the world of radole  which some commentators had suggested at the start for logical reason of central position .   radole was a small world     and  in military potential  perhaps the weakest of the twenty seven .  that  by the way  was another factor in the logic of the choice .   it was a ribbon world     of which the galaxy boasts sufficient  but among which  the inhabited variety is a rarity for the physical requirements are difficult to meet .  it was a world  in other words  where the two halves face the monotonous extremes of heat and cold  while the region of possible life is the girdling ribbon of the twilight zone .   such a world invariably sounds uninviting to those who have not tried it  but there exist spots  strategically placed     and radole city was located in such a one .   it spread along the soft slopes of the foothills before the hacked out mountains that backed it along the rim of the cold hemisphere and held off the frightful ice .  the warm  dry air of the sun half spilled over  and from the mountains was piped the water and between the two  radole city became a continuous garden  swimming in the eternal morning of an eternal june .   each house nestled among its flower garden  open to the fangless elements .  each garden was a horticultural forcing ground  where luxury plants grew in fantastic patterns for the sake of the foreign exchange they brought     until radole had almost become a producing world  rather than a typical trading world .   so  in its way  radole city was a little point of softness and luxury on a horrible planet     a tiny scrap of eden     and that  too  was a factor in the logic of the choice .   the strangers came from each of the twenty six other trading worlds  delegates  wives  secretaries  newsmen  ships  and crews     and radole s population nearly doubled and radole s resources strained themselves to the limit .  one ate at will  and drank at will  and slept not at all .   yet there were few among the roisterers who were not intensely aware that all that volume of the galaxy burnt slowly in a sort of quiet  slumbrous war .  and of those who were aware  there were dime classes .  first  there were the many who knew little and were very confident .   such as the young space pilot who wore the haven cockade on the clasp of his cap  and who managed  in holding his glass before his eyes  to catch those of the faintly smiling radolian girl opposite .  he was saying    we came fight through the war zone to get here on purpose .  we traveled about a light minute or so  in neutral  right past horleggor       horleggor .   broke in a long legged native  who was playing host to that particular gathering .   that s where the mule got the guts beat out of him last week  wasn t it .     where d you hear that the mule got the guts beat out of him .   demanded the pilot  loftily .    foundation radio .     yeah .  well  the mule s got horleggor .  we almost ran into a convoy of his ships  and that s where they were coming from .  it isn t a gut beating when you stay where you fought  and the gut beater leaves in a hurry .    someone else said in a high  blurred voice   don t talk like that .  foundation always takes it on the chin for a while .  you watch  just sit tight and watch .  ol  foundation knows when to come back .  and then     pow .   the thick voice concluded and was succeeded by a bleary grin .    anyway .   said the pilot from haven  after a short pause   as i say  we saw the mule s ships  and they looked pretty good  pretty good .  i tell you what     they looked new .     new .   said the native  thoughtfully .   they build them themselves .   he broke a leaf from an overhanging branch  sniffed delicately at it  then crunched it between his teeth  the bruised tissues bleeding greenly and diffusing a minty odor .  he said   you trying to tell me they beat foundation ships with homebuilt jobs .  go on .     we saw them  doc .  and i can tell a ship from a comet  too  you know .    the native leaned close .   you know what i think .  listen  don t kid yourself .  wars don t just start by themselves  and we have a bunch of shrewd apples running things .  they know what they re doing .    the well unthirsted one said with sudden loudness   you watch ol  foundation .  they wait for the last minute  then     pow .   he grinned with vacuously open mouth at the girl  who moved away from him .   the radolian was saying   for instance  old man  you think maybe that this mule guy s running things .  no o o .   and he wagged a finger horizontally .   the way i hear it  and from pretty high up  mind you  he s our boy .  we re paying him off  and we probably built those ships .  let s be realistic about it     we probably did .  sure  he can t beat the foundation in the long run  but he can get them shaky  and when he does     we get in .    the girl said   is that all you can talk about  klev .  the war .  you make me tired .    the pilot from haven said  in an access of gallantry    change the subject .  can t make the girls tired .    the bedewed one took up the refrain and banged a mug to the rhythm .  the little groups of two that had formed broke up with giggles and swagger  and a few similar groups of twos emerged from the sun house in the background .   the conversation became more general  more varied  more meaningless .   then there were those who knew a little more and were less confident .   such as the one armed fran  whose large bulk represented haven as official delegated  and who lived high in consequence  and cultivated new friendships     with women when he could and with men when he had to .   it was on the sun platform of the hilltop home  of one of these new friends  that he relaxed for the first of what eventually proved to be a total of two times while on radole .  the new friend was iwo lyon  a kindred soul of radole .  iwo s house was apart from the general cluster  apparently alone in a sea of floral perfume and insect chatter .  the sun platform was a grassy strip of lawn set at a forty five degree angle  and upon it fran stretched out and fairly sopped up sun .   he said   don t have anything like this on haven .    iwo replied  sleepily   ever seen the cold side .  there s a spot twenty miles from here where the oxygen runs like water .      go on .    fact .     well  i ll tell you  iwo in the old days before my arm was chewed off i knocked around  see     and you won t believe this  but      the story that followed lasted considerably  and iwo didn t believe it .   iwo said  through yawns   they don t make them like in the old days  that s the truth .     no  guess they don t .  well  now   fran fired up   don t say that .  i told you about my son  didn t i .  he s one of the old school  if you like .  he ll make a great trader  blast it .  he s his old man up and down .  up and down  except that he gets married .     you mean legal contract .  with a girl .     that s right .  don t see the sense in it myself .  they went to kalgan for their honeymoon .     kalgan .  kalgan .  when the galaxy was this .    fran smiled broadly  and said with slow meaning   just before the mule declared war on the foundation .     that so .    fran nodded and motioned iwo closer with his head .  he said  hoarsely   in fact  i can tell you something  if you don t let it go any further .  my boy was sent to kalgan for a purpose .  now i wouldn t like to let it out  you know  just what the purpose was  naturally  but you look at the situation now  and i suppose you can make a pretty good guess .  in any case  my boy was the man for the job .  we traders needed some sort of ruckus .   he smiled  craftily .   it s here .  i m not saying how we did it  but     my boy went to kalgan  and the mule sent out his ships .  my son .    iwo was duly impressed .  he grew confidential in his turn   that s good .  you know  they say we ve got five hundred ships ready to pitch in on our own at the right time .     fran said authoritatively   more than that  maybe .  this is real strategy .  this is the kind i like .   he clawed loudly at the skin of his abdomen .   but don t you forget that the mule is a smart boy  too .  what happened at horleggor worries me .     i heard he lost about ten ships .     sure  but he had a hundred more  and the foundation had to get out .  it s all to the good to have those tyrants beaten  but not as quickly as all that .   he shook his head .    the question i ask is where does the mule get his ships .  there s a widespread rumor we re making them for him .     we .  the traders .  haven has the biggest ship factories anywhere in the independent worlds  and we haven t made one for anyone but ourselves .  do you suppose any world is building a fleet for the mule on its own  without taking the precaution of united action .  that s a  .  .  .  a fairy tale .     well  where does he get them .    and fran shrugged   makes them himself  i suppose .  that worries me  too .    fran blinked at the sun and curled his toes about the smooth wood of the polished foot rest .  slowly  he fell asleep and the soft burr of his breathing mingled with the insect sibilance .   lastly  there were the very few who knew considerable and were not confident at all .   such as randu  who on the fifth day of the all trader convention entered the central hall and found the two men he had asked to be there  waiting for him .  the five hundred seats were empty     and were going to stay so .   randu said quickly  almost before he sat down   we three represent about half the military potential of the independent trading worlds .     yes   said mangin of iss   my colleague and i have already commented upon the fact .     i am ready   said randu   to speak quickly and earnestly .  i am not interested in bargaining or subtlety .  our position is radically in the worse .     as a result of     urged ovall gri of mnemon .    of developments of the last hour .  please .  from the beginning .  first  our position is not of our doing  and but doubtfully of our control .  our original dealings were not with the mule  but with several others  notably the ex warlord of kalgan  whom the mule defeated at a most inconvenient time for us .     yes  but this mule is a worthy substitute   said mangin .   i do not cavil at details .     you may when you know all the details .   randu leaned forward and placed his hands upon the table palms up in an obvious gesture .   he said   a month ago i sent my nephew and my nephew s wife to kalgan .     your nephew .   cried ovall gri  in surprise .   i did not know he was your nephew .     with what purpose   asked mangin  dryly .   this .   and his thumb drew an inclusive circle high in the air .    no .  if you mean the mule s war on the foundation  no .  how could i aim so high .  the young man knew nothing     neither of our organization nor of our aims .  he was told i was a minor member of an intra haven patriotic society  and his function at kalgan was nothing but that of an amateur observer .  my motives were  i must admit  rather obscure .  mainly  i was curious about the mule .  he is a strange phenomenon     but that s a chewed cud  i ll not go into it .  secondly  it would make an interesting and educational training project for a man who had experience with the foundation and the foundation underground and showed promise of future usefulness to us .  you see      ovall s long face fell into vertical lines as he showed his large teeth   you must have been surprised at the outcome  then  since there is not a world among the traders  i believe  that does not know that this nephew of yours abducted a mule underling in the name of the foundation and furnished the mule with a casus belli .  galaxy  randu  you spin romances .  i find it hard to believe you had no hand in that .  come  it was a skillful job .    randu shook his white head   not of my doing .  nor  willfully  of my nephew s  who is now held prisoner at the foundation  and may not live to see the completion of this so skillful job .  i have just heard from him .  the personal capsule has been smuggled out somehow  come through the war zone  gone to haven  and traveled from there to here .  it has been a month on its travels .     and .       randu leaned a heavy hand upon the heel of his palm and said  sadly   i m afraid we are cast for the same role that the onetime warlord of kalgan played .  the mule is a mutant .    there was a momentary qualm  a faint impression of quickened heartbeats .  randu might easily have imagined it .   when mangin spoke  the evenness of his voice was unchanged   how do you know .     only because my nephew says so  but he was on kalgan .    what kind of a mutant .  there are all kinds  you know .    randu forced the rising impatience down   all kinds of mutants  yes  mangin .  all kinds .  but only one kind of mule .  what kind of a mutant would start as an unknown  assemble an army  establish  they say  a five mile asteroid as original base  capture a planet  then a system  then a region     and then attack the foundation  and defeat them at horleggor .  and all in two or three years .    ovall gri shrugged   so you think he ll beat the foundation .     i don t know .  suppose he does .     sorry  i can t go that far .  you don t beat the foundation .  look  there s not a new fact we have to go on except for the statements of a  .  .  .  well  of an inexperienced boy .  suppose we shelve it for a while .  with all the mule s victories  we weren t worried until now  and unless he goes a good deal further than he has  i see no reason to change that .  yes .    randu frowned and despaired at the cobweb texture of his argument .  he said to both   have we yet made any contact with the mule .     no   both answered .    it s true  though  that we ve tried  isn t it .  it s true that there s not much purpose to our meeting unless we do reach him  isn t it .  it s true that so far there s been more drinking than thinking  and more wooing than doing     i quote from an editorial in today s radole tribune     and all because we can t reach the mule .  gentlemen  we have nearly a thousand ships waiting to be thrown into the fight at the proper moment to seize control of the foundation .  i say we should change that .  i say  throw those thousand onto the board now     against the mule .     you mean for the tyrant indbur and the bloodsuckers of the foundation .   demanded mangin  with quiet venom .   randu raised a weary hand   spare me the adjectives .  against the mule  i say  and for i don t care who .    ovall gri rose   randu  i ll have nothing to do with that  you present it to the full council tonight if you particularly hunger for political suicide .    he left without another word and mangin followed silently  leaving randu to drag out a lonely hour of endless  insoluble consideration .   at the full council that night  he said nothing .   but it was ovall gri who pushed into his room the next morning  an ovall gri only sketchily dressed and who had neither shaved nor combed his hair .   randu stared at him over a yet uncleared breakfast table with an astonishment sufficiently open and strenuous to cause him to drop his pipe .   ovall said baldly  harshly .   mnemon has been bombarded from space by treacherous attack .    randu s eyes narrowed   the foundation .     the mule .   exploded ovall .   the mule .   his words raced   it was unprovoked and deliberate .  most of our fleet had joined the international flotilla .  the few left as home squadron were insufficient and were blown out of the sky .  there have been no landings yet  and there may not be  for half the attackers are reported destroyed     but it is war     and i have come to ask how haven stands on the matter .     haven  i am sure  will adhere to the spirit of the charter of federation .  but  you see .  he attacks us as well .     this mule is a madman .  can he defeat the universe .   he faltered and sat down to seize randu s wrist   our few survivors have reported the mule s poss  .  .  .  enemy s possession of a new weapon .  a nuclear field depressor .     a what .    ovall said   most of our ships were lost because their nuclear weapons failed them .  it could not have happened by either accident or sabotage .  it must have been a weapon of the mule .  it didn t work perfectly  the effect was intermittent  there were ways to neutralize     my dispatches are not detailed .  but you see that such a tool would change the nature of war and  possibly  make our entire fleet obsolete .    randu felt an old  old man .  his face sagged hopelessly   i am afraid a monster is grown that will devour all of us .  yet we must fight him .           .  the visi sonor  ebling mis s house in a not so pretentious neighborhood of terminus city was well known to the intelligentsia  literati  and just plain well read of the foundation .  its notable characteristics depended  subjectively  upon the source material that was read .  to a thoughtful biographer  it was the  symbolization of a retreat from a nonacademic reality   a society columnist gushed silkily at its  frightfully masculine atmosphere of careless disorder   a university ph . d .  called it brusquely   bookish  but unorganized   a nonuniversity friend said   good for a drink anytime and you can put your feet on the sofa   and a breezy newsweekly broadcast  that went in for color  spoke of the  rocky  down to earth  no nonsense living quarters of blaspheming  leftish  balding ebling mis .    to bayta  who thought for no audience but herself at the moment  and who had the advantage of first hand information  it was merely sloppy .   except for the first few days  her imprisonment had been a light burden .  far lighter  it seemed  that this half hour wait in the psychologist s home     under secret observation  perhaps .  she had been with toran then  at least .   perhaps she might have grown wearier of the strain  had not magnifico s long nose drooped in a gesture that plainly showed his own far greater tension .   magnifico s pipe stem legs were folded up under a pointed  sagging chin  as if he were trying to huddle himself into disappearance  and bayta s hand went out in a gentle and automatic gesture of reassurance .  magnifico winced  then smiled .    surely  my lady  it would seem that even yet my body denies the knowledge of my mind and expects of others  hands a blow .     there s no need for worry  magnifico .  i m with you  and i won t let anyone hurt you .    the clown s eyes sidled towards her  then drew away quickly .   but they kept me away from you earlier     and from your kind husband     and  on my word  you may laugh  but i was lonely for missing friendship .     i wouldn t laugh at that .  i was  too .    the clown brightened  and he hugged his knees closer .  he said   you have not met this man who will see us .   it was a cautious question .    no .  but he is a famous man .  i have seen him in the newscasts and heard quite a good deal of him .  i think he s a good man  magnifico  who means us no harm .     yes .   the clown stirred uneasily .   that may be  my lady  but he has questioned me before  and his manner is of an abruptness and loudness that bequivers me .  he is full of strange words  so that the answers to his questions could not worm out of my throat .  almost  i might believe the romancer who once played on my ignorance with a tale that  at such moments  the heart lodged in the windpipe and prevented speech .     but it s different now .  we re two to his one  and he won t be able to frighten the both of us  will he .     no  my lady .    a door slammed somewheres  and the roaring of a voice entered the house .  just outside the room  it coagulated into words with a fierce   get the  ga lax y out of here .   and two uniformed guards were momentarily visible through the opening door  in quick retreat .   ebling mis entered frowning  deposited a carefully wrapped bundle on the floor  and approached to shake bayta s hand with careless pressure .  bayta returned it vigorously  man fashion .  mis did a double take as he turned to the clown  and favored the girl with a longer look .   he said   married .     yes .  we went through the legal formalities .    mis paused .  then   happy about it .     so far .    mis shrugged  and turned again to magnifico .  he unwrapped the package   know what this is  boy .    magnifico fairly hurled himself out of his seat and caught the multi keyed instrument .  he fingered the myriad knobby contacts and threw a sudden back somersault of joy  to the imminent destruction of the nearby furniture .   he croaked   a visi sonor     and of a make to distill joy out of a dead man s heart .   his long fingers caressed softly and slowly  pressing lightly on contacts with a rippling motion  resting momentarily on one key then another     and in the air before them there was a soft glowing rosiness  just inside the range of vision .   ebling mis said   all right  boy  you said you could pound on one of those gadgets  and there s your chance .  you d better tune it  though .  it s out of a museum .   then  in an aside to bayta   near as i can make it  no one on the foundation can make it talk right .    he leaned closer and said quickly   the clown won t talk without you .  will you help .    she nodded .    good .   he said .   his state of fear is almost fixed  and i doubt that his mental strength would possibly stand a psychic probe .  if i m to get anything out of him otherwise  he s got to feel absolutely at ease .  you understand .    she nodded again .    this visi sonor is the first step in the process .  he says he can play it  and his reaction now makes it pretty certain that it s one of the great joys of his life .  so whether the playing is good or bad  be interested and appreciative .  then exhibit friendliness and confidence in me .  above all  follow my lead in everything .   there was a swift glance at magnifico  huddled in a comer of the sofa  making rapid adjustments in the interior of the instrument .  he was completely absorbed .   mis said in a conversational tone to bayta   ever hear a visi sonor .     once   said bayta  equally casually   at a concert of rare instruments .  i wasn t impressed .     well  i doubt that you came across good playing .  there are very few really good players .  it s not so much that it requires physical co ordination     a multi bank piano requires more  for instance     as a certain type of free wheeling mentality .   in a lower voice   that s why our living skeleton there might be better than we think .  more often than not  good players are idiots otherwise .  it s one of those queer setups that makes psychology interesting .    he added  in a patent effort to manufacture light conversation   you know how the beblistered thing works .  i looked it up for this purpose  and all i ve made out so far is that its radiations stimulate the optic center of the brain directly  without ever touching the optic nerve .  it s actually the utilization of a sense never met with in ordinary nature .  remarkable  when you come to think of it .  what you hear is all right .  that s ordinary .  eardrum  cochlea  all that .  but     shh .  he s ready .  will you kick that switch .  it works better in the dark .    in the darkness  magnifico was a mere blob  ebling mis a heavy breathing mass .  bayta found herself straining her eyes anxiously  and at first with no effect .  there was a thin  reedy quaver in the air  that wavered raggedly up the scale .  it hovered  dropped and caught itself  gained in body  and swooped into a booming crash that had the effect of a thunderous split in a veiling curtain .   a little globe of pulsing color grew in rhythmic spurts and burst in midair into formless gouts that swirled high and came down as curving streamers in interfacing patterns .  they coalesced into little spheres  no two alike in color     and bayta began discovering things .   she noticed that closing her eyes made the color pattern all the clearer  that each little movement of color had its own little pattern of sound  that she could not identify the colors  and  lastly  that the globes were not globes but little figures .   little figures  little shifting flames  that danced and flickered in their myriads  that dropped out of sight and returned from nowhere  that whipped about one another and coalesced then into a new color .   incongruously  bayta thought of the little blobs of color that come at night when you close your eyelids till they hurt  and stare patiently .  there was the old familiar effect of the marching polka dots of shifting color  of the contracting concentric circles  of the shapeless masses that quiver momentarily .  all that  larger  multivaried     and each little dot of color a tiny figure .   they darted at her in pairs  and she lifted her hands with a sudden gasp  but they tumbled and for an instant she was the center of a brilliant snowstorm  while cold light slipped off her shoulders and down her arm in a luminous ski slide  shooting off her stiff fingers and meeting slowly in a shining midair focus .  beneath it all  the sound of a hundred instruments flowed in liquid streams until she could not tell it from the light .   she wondered if ebling mis were seeing the same thing  and if not  what he did see  the wonder passed  and then     she was watching again .  the little figures were they little figures .     little tiny women with burning hair that turned and bent too quickly for the mind to focus .     seized one another in star shaped groups that turned     and the music was faint laughter     girls  laughter that began inside the ear .   the stars drew together  sparked towards one another  grew slowly into structure     and from below  a palace shot upward in rapid evolution .  each brick a tiny color  each color a tiny spark  each spark a stabbing light that shifted patterns and led the eye skyward to twenty jeweled minarets .   a glittering carpet shot out and about  whirling  spinning an insubstantial web that engulfed all space  and from it luminous shoots stabbed upward and branched into trees that sang with a music all their own .   bayta sat inclosed in it .  the music welled about her in rapid  lyrical flights .  she reached out to touch a fragile tree and blossoming spicules floated downwards and faded  each with its clear  tiny tinkle .   the music crashed in twenty cymbals  and before her an area flamed up in a spout and cascaded down invisible steps into bayta s lap  where it spilled over and flowed in rapid current  raising the fiery sparkle to her waist  while across her lap was a rainbow bridge and upon it the little figures     a palace  and a garden  and tiny men and women on a bridge  stretching out as far as she could see  swimming through the stately swells of stringed music converging in upon her     and then     there seemed a frightened pause  a hesitant  indrawn motion  a swift collapse .  the colors fled  spun into a globe that shrank  and rose  and disappeared .   and it was merely dark again .   a heavy foot scratched for the pedal  reached it  and the light flooded in  the flat light of a prosy sun .  bayta blinked until the tears came  as though for the longing of what was gone .  ebling mis was a podgy inertness with his eyes still round and his mouth still open .   only magnifico himself was alive  and he fondled his visi sonor in a crooning ecstasy .    my lady   he gasped   it is indeed of an effect the most magical .  it is of balance and response almost beyond hope in its delicacy and stability .  on this  it would seem i could work wonders .  how liked you my composition  my lady .     was it yours .   breathed bayta .   your own .    at her awe  his thin face turned a glowing red to the tip of his mighty nose .   my very own  my lady .  the mule liked it not  but often and often i have played it for my own amusement .  it was once  in my youth  that i saw the palace     a gigantic place of jeweled riches that i saw from a distance at a time of high carnival .  there were people of a splendor undreamed of     and magnificence more than ever i saw afterwards  even in the mule s service .  it is but a poor makeshift i have created  but my mind s poverty precludes more .  i call it   the memory of heaven .     now through the midst of the chatter  mis shook himself to active life .   here   he said   here  magnifico  would you like to do that same thing for others .    for a moment  the clown drew back .   for others .   he quavered .    for thousands   cried mis   in the great halls of the foundation .  would you like to be your own master  and honored by all  wealthy  and  .  .  .  and     his imagination failed him .   and all that .  eh .  what do you say .     but how may i be all that  mighty sir  for indeed i am but a poor clown ungiven to the great things of the world .    the psychologist puffed out his lips  and passed the back of his hand across his brow .  he said   but your playing  man .  the world is yours if you would play so for the mayor and his trading trusts .  wouldn t you like that .    the clown glanced briefly at bayta   would she stay with me .    bayta laughed   of course  silly .  would it be likely that i d leave you now that you re on the point of becoming rich and famous .     it would all be yours   he replied earnestly   and surely the wealth of galaxy itself would be yours before i could repay my debt to your kindness .     but   said mis  casually   if you would first help me       what is that .    the psychologist paused  and smiled   a little surface probe that doesn t hurt .  it wouldn t touch but the peel of your brain .    there was a flare of deadly fear in magnifico s eyes .   not a probe .  i have seen it used .  it drains the mind and leaves an empty skull .  the mule did use it upon traitors and let them wander mindless through the streets  until out of mercy  they were killed .   he held up his hand to push mis away .    that was a psychic probe   explained mis  patiently   and even that would only harm a person when misused .  this probe i have is a surface probe that wouldn t hurt a baby .      that s right  magnifico   urged bayta .   it s only to help beat the mule and keep him far away .  once that s done  you and i will be rich and famous all our lives .    magnifico held out a trembling hand   will you hold my hand  then .    bayta took it in both her own  and the clown watched the approach of the burnished terminal plates with large eyes .   ebling mis rested carelessly on the too lavish chair in mayor indbur s private quarters  unregenerately unthankful for the condescension shown him and watched the small mayor s fidgeting unsympathetically .  he tossed away a cigar stub and spat out a shred of tobacco .    and  incidentally  if you want something for your next concert at mallow hall  indbur   he said   you can dump out those electronic gadgeteers into the sewers they came from and have this little freak play the visi sonor for you .  indbur     it s out of this world .    indbur said peevishly   i did not call you here to listen to your lectures on music .  what of the mule .  tell me that .  what of the mule .     the mule .  well  i ll tell you     i used a surface probe and got little .  can t use the psychic probe because the freak is scared blind of it  so that his resistance will probably blow his unprintable mental fuses as soon as contact is made .  but this is what i ve got  if you ll just stop tapping your fingernails      first place  de stress the mule s physical strength .  he s probably strong  but most of the freak s fairy tales about it are probably considerably blown up by his own fearful memory  he wears queer glasses and his eyes kill  he evidently has mental powers .     so much we had at the start   commented the mayor  sourly .    then the probe confirms it  and from there on i ve been working mathematically .     so .  and how long will all this take .  your word rattling will deafen me yet .     about a month  i should say  and i may have something for you .  and i may not  of course .  but what of it .  if this is all outside seldon s plans  our chances are precious little  unprintable little .    indbur whirled on the psychologist fiercely   now i have you  traitor .  lie .  say you re not one of these criminal rumormongers that are spreading defeatism and panic through the foundation  and making my work doubly hard .     i .  i .   mis gathered anger slowly .   indbur swore at him   because by the dust clouds of space  the foundation will win     the foundation must win .     despite the loss at horleggor .     it was not a loss .  you have swallowed that spreading lie  too .  we were outnumbered and betreasoned       by whom .   demanded mis  contemptuously .    by the lice ridden democrats of the gutter   shouted indbur back at him .   i have known for long that the fleet has been riddled by democratic cells .  most have been wiped out  but enough remain for the unexplained surrender of twenty ships in the thickest of the swarming fight .  enough to force an apparent defeat .    for that matter  my rough tongued  simple patriot and epitome of the primitive virtues  what are your own connections with the democrats .    ebling mis shrugged it off   you rave  do you know that .  what of the retreat since  and the loss of half of siwenna .  democrats again .     no .  not democrats   the little man smiled sharply .   we retreat     as the foundation has always retreated under attack  until the inevitable march of history turns with us .  already  i see the outcome .  already  the so called underground of the democrats has issued manifestoes swearing aid and allegiance to the government .  it could be a feint  a cover for a deeper treachery  but i make good use of it  and the propaganda distilled from it will have its effect  whatever the crawling traitors scheme .  and better than that       even better than that  indbur .     judge for yourself .  two days ago  the so called association of independent traders declared war on the mule  and the foundation fleet is strengthened  at a stroke  by a thousand ships .  you see  this mule goes too far .  he finds us divided and quarreling among ourselves and under the pressure of his attack we unite and grow strong .  he must lose .  it is inevitable     as always .    mis still exuded skepticism   then you tell me that seldon planned even for the fortuitous occurrence of a mutant .     a mutant .  i can t tell him from a human  nor could you but for the ravings of a rebel captain  some outland youngsters  and an addled juggler and clown .  you forget the most conclusive evidence of all     your own .     my own .   for just a moment  mis was startled .    your own   sneered the mayor .   the time vault opens in nine weeks .  what of that .  it opens for a crisis .  if this attack of the mule is not the crisis  where is the  real  one  the one the vault is opening for .  answer me  you lardish ball .    the psychologist shrugged   all tight .  if it keeps you happy .  do me a favor  though .  just in case  .  .  .  just in case old seldon makes his speech and it does go sour  suppose you let me attend the grand opening .     all right .  get out of here .  and stay out of my sight for nine weeks .     with unprintable pleasure  you wizened horror   muttered mis to himself as he left .          .  fall of the foundation  there was an atmosphere about the time vault that just missed definition in several directions at once .  it was not one of decay  for it was well lit and well conditioned  with the color scheme of the walls lively  and the rows of fixed chairs comfortable and apparently designed for eternal use .  it was not even ancient  for three centuries had left no obvious mark .  there was certainly no effort at the creation of awe or reverence  for the appointments were simple and everyday     next door to bareness  in fact .   yet after all the negatives were added and the sum disposed of  something was left     and that something centered about the glass cubicle that dominated half the room with its clear emptiness .  four times in three centuries  the living simulacrum of hari seldon himself had sat there and spoken .  twice he had spoken to no audience .   through three centuries and nine generations  the old man who had seen the great days of universal empire projected himself     and still he understood more of the galaxy of his great ultra great grandchildren  than did those grandchildren themselves .   patiently that empty cubicle waited .   the first to arrive was mayor indbur iii  driving his ceremonial ground car through the hushed and anxious streets .  arriving with him was his own chair  higher than those that belonged there  and wider .  it was placed before all the others  and indbur dominated all but the empty glassiness before him .   the solemn official at his left bowed a reverent head .   excellence  arrangements are completed for the widest possible sub etheric spread for the official announcement by your excellence tonight .     good .  meanwhile  special interplanetary programs concerning the time vault are to continue .  there will  of course  be no predictions or speculations of any sort on the subject .  does popular reaction continue satisfactory .     excellence  very much so .  the vicious rumors prevailing of late have decreased further .  confidence is widespread .     good .   he gestured the man away and adjusted his elaborate neckpiece to a nicety .   it was twenty minutes of noon .   a select group of the great props of the mayoralty     the leaders of the great trading organizations     appeared in ones and twos with the degree of pomp appropriate to their financial status and place in mayoral favor .  each presented himself to the mayor  received a gracious word or two  took an assigned seat .   somewhere  incongruous among the stilted ceremony of all this  randu of haven made his appearance and wormed his way unannounced to the mayor s seat .    excellence .   he muttered  and bowed .   indbur frowned .   you have not been granted an audience .      excellence  i have requested one for a week .     i regret that the matters of state involved in the appearance of seldon have       excellence  i regret them  too  but i must ask you to rescind your order that the ships of the independent traders be distributed among the fleets of the foundation .    indbur had flushed red at the interruption .   this is not the time for discussion .     excellence  it is the only time   randu whispered urgently .   as representative of the independent trading worlds  i tell you such a move can not be obeyed .  it must be rescinded before seldon solves our problem for us .  once the emergency is passed  it will be too late to conciliate and our alliance will melt away .    indbur stared at randu coldly .   you realize that i am head of the foundation armed forces .  have i the right to determine military policy or have i not .     excellence  you have  but some things are inexpedient .     i recognize no inexpediency .  it is dangerous to allow your people separate fleets in this emergency .  divided action plays into the hands of the enemy .  we must unite  ambassador  militarily as well as politically .    randu felt his throat muscles tighten .  he omitted the courtesy of the opening title .   you feet safe now that seldon will speak  and you move against us .  a month ago you were soft and yielding  when our ships defeated the mule at terel .  i might remind you  sir  that it is the foundation fleet that has been defeated in open battle five times  and that the ships of the independent trading worlds have won your victories for you .    indbur frowned dangerously   you are no longer welcome upon terminus  ambassador .  your return will be requested this evening .  furthermore  your connection with subversive democratic forces on terminus will be     and has been     investigated .    randu replied   when i leave  our ships will go with me .  i know nothing of your democrats .  i know only that your foundation s ships have surrendered to the mule by the treason of their high officers  not their sailors  democratic or otherwise .  i tell you that twenty ships of the foundation surrendered at horleggor at the orders of their rear admiral  when they were unharmed and unbeaten .  the rear admiral was your own close associate     he presided at the trial of my nephew when he first arrived from kalgan .  it is not the only case we know of and our ships and men will not be risked under potential traitors .   indbur said   you will be placed under guard upon leaving here .    randu walked away under the silent stares of the contemptuous coterie of the rulers of terminus .   it was ten minutes of twelve .   bayta and toran had already arrived .  they rose in their back seats and beckoned to randu as he passed .   randu smiled gently   you are here after all .  how did you work it .     magnifico was our politician   grinned toran .   indbur insists upon his visi sonor composition based on the time vault  with himself  no doubt  as hero .  magnifico refused to attend without us  and there was no arguing him out of it .  ebling mis is with us  or was .  he s wandering about somewhere .   then  with a sudden access of anxious gravity   why  what s wrong  uncle .  you don t look well .    randu nodded   i suppose not .  we re in for bad times  toran .  when the mule is disposed of  our turn will come  i m afraid .     a straight solemn figure in white approached  and greeted them with a stiff bow .   bayta s dark eyes smiled  as she held out her hand   captain pritcher .  are you on space duty then .    the captain took the hand and bowed lower   nothing like it .  dr .  mis  i understand  has been instrumental in bringing me here  but it s only temporary .  back to home guard tomorrow .  what time is it .    it was three minutes of twelve .   magnifico was the picture of misery and heartsick depression .  his body curled up  in his eternal effort at self effacement .  his long nose was pinched at the nostrils and his large  down slanted eyes darted uneasily about .   he clutched at bayta s hand  and when she bent down  he whispered   do you suppose  my lady  that all these great ones were in the audience  perhaps  when i  .  .  .  when i played the visi sonor .     everyone  i m sure   bayta assured him  and shook him gently .   and i m sure they all think you re the most wonderful player in the galaxy and that your concert was the greatest ever seen  so you just straighten yourself and sit correctly .  we must have dignity .    he smiled feebly at her mock frown and unfolded his long boned limbs slowly .   it was noon     and the glass cubicle was no longer empty .   it was doubtful that anyone had witnessed the appearance .  it was a clean break  one moment not there and the next moment there .   in the cubicle was a figure in a wheelchair  old and shrunken  from whose wrinkled face bright eyes shone  and whose voice  as it turned out  was the livest thing about him .  a book lay face downward in his lap  and the voice came softly .    i am hari seldon .    he spoke through a silence  thunderous in its intensity .    i am hari seldon .  i do not know if anyone is here at all by mere sense perception but that is unimportant .  i have few fears as yet of a breakdown in the plan .  for the first three centuries the percentage probability of nondeviation is nine four point two .    he paused to smile  and then said genially   by the way  if any of you are standing  you may sit .  if any would like to smoke  please do .  i am not here in the flesh .  i require no ceremony .    let us take up the problem of the moment  then .  for the first time  the foundation has been faced  or perhaps  is in the last stages of facing  civil war .  till now  the attacks from without have been adequately beaten off  and inevitably so  according to the strict laws of psychohistory .  the attack at present is that of a too undisciplined outer group of the foundation against the too authoritarian central government .  the procedure was necessary  the result obvious .    the dignity of the high born audience was beginning to break .  indbur was half out of his chair .   bayta leaned forward with troubled eyes .  what was the great seldon talking about .  she had missed a few of the words         that the compromise worked out is necessary in two respects .  the revolt of the independent traders introduces an element of new uncertainty in a government perhaps grown over confident .  the element of striving is restored .  although beaten  a healthy increase of democracy      there were raised voices now .  whispers had ascended the scale of loudness  and the edge of panic was in them .   bayta said in toran s ear   why doesn t he talk about the mule .  the traders never revolted .    toran shrugged his shoulders .   the seated figure spoke cheerfully across and through the increasing disorganization       a new and firmer coalition government was the necessary and beneficial outcome of the logical civil war forced upon the foundation .  and now only the remnants of the old empire stand in the way of further expansion  and in them  for the next few years  at any rate  is no problem .  of course  i can not reveal the nature of the next prob      in the complete uproar  seldon s lips moved soundlessly .   ebling mis was next to randu  face ruddy .  he was shouting .   seldon is off his rocker .  he s got the wrong crisis .  were your traders ever planning civil war .    randu said thinly   we planned one  yes .  we called it off in the face of the mule .     then the mule is an added feature  unprepared for in seldon s psychohistory .  now what s happened .    in the sudden  frozen silence  bayta found the cubicle once again empty .  the nuclear glow of the walls was dead  the soft current of conditioned air absent .   somewhere the sound of a shrill siren was rising and falling in the scale and randu formed the words with his lips   space raid .    and ebling mis held his wrist watch to his ears and shouted suddenly   stopped  by the  ga lax y  is there a watch in the room that is going .   his voice was a roar .   twenty wrists went to twenty ears .  and in far less than twenty seconds  it was quite certain that none were .    then   said mis  with a grim and horrible finality   something has stopped all nuclear power in the time vault     and the mule is attacking .    indbur s wail rose high above the noise   take your seats .  the mule is fifty parsecs distant .     he was   shouted back mis   a week ago .  right now  terminus is being bombarded .    bayta felt a deep depression settle softly upon her .  she felt its folds tighten close and thick  until her breath forced its way only with pain past her tightened throat .   the outer noise of a gathering crowd was evident .  the doors were thrown open and a harried figure entered  and spoke rapidly to indbur  who had rushed to him .    excellence   he whispered   not a vehicle is running in the city  not a communication line to the outside is open .   the tenth fleet is reported defeated and the mule s ships are outside the atmosphere .  the general staff      indbur crumpled  and was a collapsed figure of impotence upon the floor .  in all that hall  not a voice was raised now .  even the growing crowd without was fearful  but silent  and the horror of cold panic hovered dangerously .   indbur was raised .  wine was held to his lips .  his lips moved before his eyes opened  and the word they formed was   surrender .    bayta found herself near to crying     not for sorrow or humiliation  but simply and plainly out of a vast frightened despair .  ebling mis plucked at her sleeve .   come  young lady      she was pulled out of her chair  bodily .    we re leaving   he said   and take your musician with you .   the plump scientist s lips were trembling and colorless .    magnifico   said bayta  faintly .  the clown shrank in horror .  his eyes were glassy .    the mule   he shrieked .   the mule is coming for me .    he thrashed wildly at her touch .  toran leaned over and brought his fist up sharply .  magnifico slumped into unconsciousness and toran carried him out potato sack fashion .   the next day  the ugly  battle black ships of the mule poured down upon the landing fields of the planet terminus .  the attacking general sped down the empty main street of terminus city in a foreign made ground car that ran where a whole city of atomic cars still stood useless .   the proclamation of occupation was made twenty four hours to the minute after seldon had appeared before the former mighty of the foundation .   of all the foundation planets  only the independent traders still stood  and against them the power of the mule     conqueror of the foundation     now turned itself .          .  start of the search  the lonely planet  haven     only planet of an only sun of a galactic sector that trailed raggedly off into intergalactic vacuum     was under siege .   in a strictly military sense  it was certainly under siege  since no area of space on the galactic side further than twenty parsecs distance was outside range of the mule s advance bases .  in the four months since the shattering fall of the foundation  haven s communications had fallen apart like a spiderweb under the razor s edge .  the ships of haven converged inwards upon the home world  and only haven itself was now a fighting base .   and in other respects  the siege was even closer  for the shrouds of helplessness and doom had already invaded  bayta plodded her way down the pink waved aisle past the rows of milky plastic topped tables and found her seat by blind reckoning .  she eased on to the high  armless chair  answered half heard greetings mechanically  rubbed a wearily itching eye with the back of a weary hand  and reached for her menu .   she had time to register a violent mental reaction of distaste to the pronounced presence of various cultured fungus dishes  which were considered high delicacies at haven  and which her foundation taste found highly inedible     and then she was aware of the sobbing near her and looked up .   until then  her notice of juddee  the plain  snub nosed  indifferent blonde at the dining unit diagonally across had been the superficial one of the nonacquaintance .  and now juddee was crying  biting woefully at a moist handkerchief  and choking back sobs until her complexion was blotched with turgid red .  her shapeless radiation proof costume was thrown back upon her shoulders  and her transparent face shield had tumbled forward into her dessert  and there remained .   bayta joined the three girls who were taking turns at the eternally applied and eternally inefficacious remedies of shoulder patting  hair smoothing  and incoherent murmuring .    what s the matter .   she whispered .   one turned to her and shrugged a discreet   i don t know .   then  feeling the inadequacy of the gesture  she pulled bayta aside .    she s had a hard day  i guess .  and she s worrying about her husband .     is he on space patrol .     yes  .   bayta reached a friendly hand out to juddee .    why don t you go home  juddee .   her voice was a cheerfully businesslike intrusion on the soft  flabby inanities that had preceded .   juddee looked up half in resentment .   i ve been out once this week already       then you ll be out twice .  if you try to stay on  you know  you ll just be out three days next week     so going home now amounts to patriotism .  any of you girls work in her department .  well  then  suppose you take care of her card .  better go to the washroom first  juddee  and get the peaches and cream back where it belongs .  go ahead .  shoo .    bayta returned to her seat and took up the menu again with a dismal relief .  these moods were contagious .  one weeping girl would have her entire department in a frenzy these nerve torn days .   she made a distasteful decision  pressed the correct buttons at her elbow and put the menu back into its niche .   the tall  dark girl opposite her was saying   isn t much any of us can do except cry  is there .    her amazingly full lips scarcely moved  and bayta noticed that their ends were carefully touched to exhibit that artificial  just so half smile that was the current last word in sophistication .   bayta investigated the insinuating thrust contained in the words with lashed eyes and welcomed the diversion of the arrival of her lunch  as the tile top of her unit moved inward and the food lifted .  she tore the wrappings carefully off her cutlery and handled them gingerly till they cooled .   she said   can t you think of anything else to do  hella .     oh  yes   said hella .   i can .   she flicked her cigarette with a casual and expert finger motion into the little recess provided and the tiny flash caught it before it hit shallow bottom .    for instance   and hella clasped slender  well kept hands under her chin   i think we could make a very nice arrangement with the mule and stop all this nonsense .  but then i don t have the  .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  facilities to manage to get out of places quickly when the mule takes over .    bayta s clear forehead remained clear .  her voice was light and indifferent .   you don t happen to have a brother or husband in the fighting ships  do you .     no .  all the more credit that i see no reason for the sacrifice of the brothers and husbands of others .     the sacrifice will come the more surely for surrender .     the foundation surrendered and is at peace .  our men are away and the galaxy is against us .    bayta shrugged  and said sweetly   i m afraid it is the first of the pair that bothers you .   she returned to her vegetable platter and ate it with the clammy realization of the silence about her .  no one in ear shot had cared to answer hella s cynicism .   she left quickly  after stabbing at the button which cleared her dining unit for the next shift s occupant .   a new girl  three seats away  stage whispered to hella   who was she .    hella s mobile lips curled in indifference .   she s our coordinator s niece .  didn t you know that .     yes .   her eyes sought out the last glimpse of disappearing back .   what s she doing here .     just an assembly girl .  don t you know it s fashionable to be patriotic .  it s all so democratic  it makes me retch .     now  hella   said the plump girl to her right .   she s never pulled her uncle on us yet .  why don t you lay off .    hella ignored her neighbor with a glazed sweep of eyes and lit another cigarette .   the new girl was listening to the chatter of the bright eyed accountant opposite .  the words were coming quickly       and she s supposed to have been in the vault     actually in the vault  you know     when seldon spoke     and they say the mayor was in frothing furies and there were riots  and all of that sort of thing  you know .  she got away before the mule landed  and they say she had the most tha rilling escape     had to go through the blockade  and all     and i do wonder she doesn t write a book about it  these war books being so popular these days  you know .  and she was supposed to be on this world of the mule s  too     kalgan  you know     and      the time bell shrilled and the dining room emptied slowly .  the accountant s voice buzzed on  and the new girl interrupted only with the conventional and wide eyed   really y y y .   at appropriate points .   the huge cave lights were being shielded group wise in the gradual descent towards the darkness that meant sleep for the righteous and hard working  when bayta returned home .   toran met her at the door  with a slice of buttered bread in his hand .    where ve you been .   he asked  food muffled .  then  more clearly   i ve got a dinner of sorts rassled up .  if it isn t much  don t blame me .    but she was circling him  wide eyed .   torie .  where s your uniform .  what are you doing in civvies .     orders  bay .  randu is holed up with ebling mis right now  and what it s all about  i don t know .  so there you have everything .     am i going .   she moved towards him impulsively .   he kissed her before he answered   i believe so .  it will probably be dangerous .     what isn t dangerous .     exactly .  oh  yes  and i ve already sent for magnifico  so he s probably coming too .     you mean his concert at the engine factory will have to be cancelled .     obviously .    bayta passed into the next room and sat down to a meal that definitely bore signs of having been  rassled up .   she cut the sandwiches in two with quick efficiency and said    that s too bad about the concert .  the girls at the factory were looking forward to it .  magnifico  too  for that matter .   she shook her head .   he s such a queer thing .     stirs your mother complex  bay  that s what he does .  some day we ll have a baby  and then you ll forget magnifico .     bayta answered from the depths of her sandwich   strikes me that you re all the stirring my mother complex can stand .    and then she laid the sandwich down  and was gravely serious in a moment .    torie .     m m m .     torie  i was at city hall today     at the bureau of production .  that is why i was so late today .     what were you doing there .     well .  .  .   she hesitated  uncertainly .   it s been building up .  i was getting so i couldn t stand it at the factory .  morale just doesn t exist .  the girls go on crying jags for no particular reason .  those who don t get sick become sullen .  even the little mousie types pout .  in my particular section  production isn t a quarter what it was when i came  and there isn t a day that we have a full roster of workers .     all right   said toran   tie in the b .  of p .  what did you do there .     asked a few questions .  and it s so  torie  it s so all over haven .  dropping production  increasing sedition and disaffection .  the bureau chief just shrugged his shoulders     after i had sat in the anteroom an hour to see him  and only got in because i was the co ordinator s niece     and said it was beyond him .  frankly  i don t think he cared .     now  don t go off base  bay .     i don t think he did .   she was strenuously fiery .   i tell you there s something wrong .  it s that same horrible frustration that hit me in the time vault when seldon deserted us .  you felt it yourself .     yes  i did .     well  it s back   she continued savagely .   and we ll never be able to resist the mule .  even if we had the material  we lack the heart  the spirit  the will     torie  there s no use fighting      bayta had never cried in toran s memory  and she did not cry now .  not really .  but toran laid a light hand on her shoulder and whispered   suppose you forget it  baby .  i know what you mean .  but there s nothing       yes  there s nothing we can do .  everyone says that     and we just sit and wait for the knife to come down .    she returned to what was left of her sandwich and tea .  quietly  toran was arranging the beds .  it was quite dark outside .   randu  as newly appointed co ordinator     in itself a wartime post     of the confederation of cities on haven  had been assigned  at his own request  to an upper room  out of the window of which he could brood over the roof tops and greenery of the city .  now  in the fading of the cave lights  the city receded into the level lack of distinction of the shades .  randu did not care to meditate upon the symbolism .   he said to ebling mis     whose clear  little eyes seemed to have no further interest than the red filled goblet in his hand      there s a saying on haven that when the cave lights go out  it is time for the righteous and hard working to sleep .     do you sleep much lately .     no .  sorry to call you so late  mis .  i like the night better somehow these days .  isn t that strange .  the people on haven condition themselves pretty strictly on the lack of light meaning sleep .  myself  too .  but it s different now       you re hiding   said mis  flatly .   you re surrounded by people in the waking period  and you feel their eyes and their hopes on you .  you can t stand up under it .  in the sleep period  you re free .     do you feel it  too  then .  this miserable sense of defeat .    ebling mis nodded slowly   i do .  it s a mass psychosis  an unprintable mob panic .   ga lax y  randu  what do you expect .  here you have a whole culture brought up to a blind  blubbering belief that a folk hero of the past has everything all planned out and is taking care of every little piece of their unprintable lives .  the thought pattern evoked has religious characteristics  and you know what that means .     not a bit .    mis was not enthusiastic about the necessity of explanation .  he never was .  so he growled  stared at the long cigar he rolled thoughtfully between his fingers and said   characterized by strong faith reactions .  beliefs can t be shaken short of a major shock  in which case  a fairly complete mental disruption results .  mild cases hysteria  morbid sense of insecurity .  advanced cases     madness and suicide .    randu bit at a thumbnail .   when seldon fails us  in other words  our prop disappears  and we ve been leaning upon it so long  our muscles are atrophied to where we can not stand without it .     that s it .  sort of a clumsy metaphor  but that s it .     and you  ebling  what of your own muscles .    the psychologist filtered a long draught of air through his cigar  and let the smoke laze out .   rusty  but not atrophied .  my profession has resulted in just a bit of independent thinking .     and you see a way out .     no  but there must be one .  maybe seldon made no provisions for the mule .  maybe he didn t guarantee our victory .  but  then  neither did he guarantee defeat .  he s just out of the game and we re on our own .  the mule can be licked .     how .     by the only way anyone can be licked     by attacking in strength at weakness .  see here  randu  the mule isn t a superman .  if he is finally defeated  everyone will see that for himself .  it s just that he s an unknown  and the legends cluster quickly .  he s supposed to be a mutant .  well  what of that .  a mutant means a  superman  to the ignoramuses of humanity .  nothing of the sort .    it s been estimated that several million mutants are born in the galaxy every day .  of the several million  all but one or two percent can be detected only by means of microscopes and chemistry .  of the one or two percent macromutants  that is  those with mutations detectable to the naked eye or naked mind  all but one or two percent are freaks  fit for the amusement centers  the laboratories  and death .  of the few macromutants whose differences are to the good  almost all are harmless curiosities  unusual in some single respect  normal     and often subnormal     in most others .  you see that  randu .     i do .  but what of the mule .     supposing the mule to be a mutant then  we can assume that he has some attribute  undoubtedly mental  which can be used to conquer worlds .  in other respects  he undoubtedly has his shortcomings  which we must locate .  he would not be so secretive  so shy of others  eyes  if these shortcomings were not apparent and fatal .  if he s a mutant .     is there an alternative .     there might be .  evidence for mutation rests on captain han pritcher of what used to be foundation s intelligence .  he drew his conclusions from the feeble memories of those who claimed to know the mule or somebody who might have been the mule     in infancy and early childhood .  pritcher worked on slim pickings there  and what evidence he found might easily have been planted by the mule for his own purposes  for it s certain that the mule has been vastly aided by his reputation as a mutant superman .     this is interesting .  how long have you thought that .     i never thought that  in the sense of believing it .  it is merely an alternative to be considered .  for instance  randu  suppose the mule has discovered a form of radiation capable of depressing mental energy just as he is in possession of one which depresses nuclear reactions .  what then  eh .  could that explain what s hitting us now     and what did hit the foundation .    randu seemed immersed in a near wordless gloom .   he said   what of your own researches on the mule s clown .    and now ebling mis hesitated .   useless as yet .  i spoke bravely to the mayor previous to the foundation s collapse  mainly to keep his courage up     partly to keep my own up as well .  but  randu  if my mathematical tools were up to it  then from the clown alone i could analyze the mule completely .  then we would have him .  then we could solve the queer anomalies that have impressed me already .     such as .     think  man .  the mule defeated the navies of the foundation at will  but he has not once managed to force the much weaker fleets of the independent traders to retreat in open combat .  the foundation fell at a blow  the independent traders hold out against all his strength .  he first used extinguishing field upon the nuclear weapons of the independent traders of mnemon .  the element of surprise lost them that battle but they countered the field .  he was never able to use it successfully against the independents again .    but over and over again  it worked against foundation forces .  it worked on the foundation itself .  why .  with our present knowledge  it is all illogical .  so there must be factors of which we are not aware .     treachery .     that s rattle pated nonsense  randu .  unprintable twaddle .  there wasn t a man on the foundation who wasn t sure of victory .  who would betray a certain to win side .    randu stepped to the curved window and stared unseeingly out into the unseeable .  he said   but we re certain to lose now  if the mule had a thousand weaknesses  if he were a network of holes      he did not turn .  it was as if the slump of his back  the nervous groping for one another of the hands behind him that spoke .  he said   we escaped easily after the time vault episode  ebling .  others might have escaped as well .  a few did .  most did not .  the extinguishing field could have been counteracted .  it asked ingenuity and a certain amount of labor .  all the ships of the foundation navy could have flown to haven or other nearby planets to continue the fight as we did .  not one percent did so .  in effect  they deserted to the enemy .    the foundation underground  upon which most people here seem to rely so heavily  has thus far done nothing of consequence .  the mule has been politic enough to promise to safeguard the property and profits of the great traders and they have gone over to him .    ebling mis said stubbornly   the plutocrats have always been against us .     they always held the power  too .  listen  ebling .  we have reason to believe that the mule or his tools have already been in contact with powerful men among the independent traders .  at least ten of the twenty seven trading worlds are known to have gone over to the mule .  perhaps ten more waver .  there are personalities on haven itself who would not be unhappy over the mule s domination .  it s apparently an insurmountable temptation to give up endangered political power  if that will maintain your hold over economic affairs .      you don t think haven can fight the mule .     i don t think haven will .   and now randu turned his troubled face full upon the psychologist .   i think haven is waiting to surrender .  it s what i called you here to tell you .  i want you to leave haven .    ebling mis puffed up his plump checks in amazement .   already .    randu felt horribly tired .   ebling  you are the foundation s greatest psychologist .  the real master psychologists went out with seldon  but you re the best we have .  you re our only chance of defeating the mule .  you can t do that here  you ll have to go to what s left of the empire .     to trantor .     that s right .  what was once the empire is bare bones today  but something must still be at the center .  they ve got the records there  ebling .  you may learn more of mathematical psychology  perhaps enough to be able to interpret the clown s mind .  he will go with you  of course .    mis responded dryly   i doubt if he d be willing to  even for fear of the mule  unless your niece went with him .     i know that .  toran and bayta are leaving with you for that very reason .  and  ebling  there s another  greater purpose .  hari seldon founded two foundations three centuries ago  one at each end of the galaxy .  you must find that second foundation .           .  conspirator  the mayor s palace     what was once the mayor s palace     was a looming smudge in the darkness .  the city was quiet under its conquest and curfew  and the hazy milk of the great galactic lens  with here and there a lonely star  dominated the sky of the foundation .   in three centuries the foundation had grown from a private project of a small group of scientists to a tentacular trade empire sprawling deep into the galaxy and half a year had flung it from its heights to the status of another conquered province .   captain han pritcher refused to grasp that .   the city s sullen nighttime quiet  the darkened palace  intruder occupied  were symbolic enough  but captain han pritcher  just within the outer gate of the palace  with the tiny nuclear bomb under his tongue  refused to understand .   a shape drifted closer     the captain bent his head .   the whisper came deathly low   the alarm system is as it always was  captain .  proceed .  it will register nothing .    softly  the captain ducked through the low archway  and down the fountain lined path to what had been indbur s garden .   four months ago had been the day in the time vault  the fullness of which his memory balked at .  singly and separately the impressions would come back  unwelcome  mostly at night .   old seldon speaking his benevolent words that were so shatteringly wrong     the jumbled confusion     indbur  with his mayoral costume incongruously bright about his pinched  unconscious face     the frightened crowds gathering quickly  waiting noiselessly for the inevitable word of surrender     the young man  toran  disappearing out of a side door with the mule s clown dangling over his shoulder .   and himself  somehow out of it all afterward  with his car unworkable .   shouldering his way along and through the leaderless mob that was already leaving the city     destination unknown .   making blindly for the various rat holes which were     which had once been     the headquarters for a democratic underground that for eighty years had been failing and dwindling .   and the rat holes were empty .   the next day  black alien ships were momentarily visible in the sky  sinking gently into the clustered buildings of the nearby city .  captain han pritcher felt an accumulation of helplessness and despair drown him .   he started his travels in earnest .   in thirty days he had covered nearly two hundred miles on foot  changed to the clothing of a worker in the hydroponic factories whose body he found newly dead by the side of the road  grown a fierce beard of russet intensity  and found what was left of the underground .   the city was newton  the district a residential one of one time elegance slowly edging towards squalor  the house an undistinguished member of a row  and the man a small eyed  big boned whose knotted fists bulged through his pockets and whose wiry body remained unbudgingly in the narrow door opening .   the captain mumbled   i come from miran .    the man returned the gambit  grimly .   miran is early this year .    the captain said   no earlier than last year .    but the man did not step aside .  he said   who are you .     aren t you fox .     do you always answer by asking .    the captain took an imperceptibly longer breath  and then said calmly   i am han pritcher  captain of the fleet  and member of the democratic underground party .  will you let me in .    the fox stepped aside .  he said   my real name is orum palley .    he held out his hand .  the captain took it .   the room was well kept  but not lavish .  in one comer stood a decorative book film projector  which to the captain s military eyes might easily have been a camouflaged blaster of respectable caliber .  the projecting lens covered the doorway  and such could be remotely controlled .   the fox followed his bearded guest s eyes  and smiled tightly .  he said   yes .  but only in the days of indbur and his lackey hearted vampires .  it wouldn t do much against the mule  eh .  nothing would help against the mule .  are you hungry .    the captain s jaw muscles tightened beneath his beard  and he nodded .    it ll take a minute if you don t mind waiting .   the fox removed cans from a cupboard and placed two before captain pritcher .   keep your finger on it  and break them when they re hot enough .  my heat control unit s out of whack .  things like that remind you there s a war on     or was on  eh .    his quick words had a jovial content  but were said in anything but a jovial tone     and his eyes were coldly thoughtful .  he sat down opposite the captain and said   there ll be nothing but a burn spot left where you re sitting  if there s anything about you i don t like .  know that .    the captain did not answer .  the cans before him opened at a pressure .   the fox said  shortly   stew .  sorry  but the food situation is short .     i know   said the captain .  he ate quickly  not looking up .   the fox said   i once saw you .  i m trying to remember  and the beard is definitely out of the picture .     i haven t shaved in thirty days .   then  fiercely   what do you want .  i had the correct passwords .  i have identification .    the other waved a hand   oh  i ll grant you re pritcher all right .  but there are plenty who have the passwords  and the identifications  and the identities     who are with the mule .  ever hear of levvaw  eh .     yes .     he s with the mule .     what .  he       yes .  he was the man they called  no surrender .    the fox s lips made laughing motions  with neither sound nor humor .   then there s willig .  with the mule .  garre and noth .  with the mule .  why not pritcher as well  eh .  how would i know .    the captain merely shook his head .    but it doesn t matter   said the fox  softly .   they must have my name  if noth has gone over     so if you re legitimate  you re in more new danger than i am over our acquaintanceship .    the captain had finished eating .  he leaned back   if you have no organization here  where can i find one .  the foundation may have surrendered  but i haven t .     so .  you can t wander forever  captain .  men of the foundation must have travel permits to move from town to town these days .  you know that .  also identity cards .  you have one .  also  all officers of the old navy have been requested to report to the nearest occupation headquarters .  that s you  eh .     yes .   the captain s voice was hard .   do you think i run through fear .  i was on kalgan not long after its fall to the mule .  within a month  not one of the old warlord s officers was at large  because they were the natural military leaders of any revolt .  it s always been the underground s knowledge that no revolution can be successful without the control of at least part of the navy .  the mule evidently knows it  too .    the fox nodded thoughtfully   logical enough .  the mule is thorough .     i discarded the uniform as soon as i could .  i grew the beard .  afterwards there may be a chance that others have taken the same action .     are you married .     my wife is dead .  i have no children .    you re hostage immune  then .     yes .     you want my advice .     if you have any .    a don t know what the mule s policy is or what he intends  but skilled workers have not been harmed so far .  pay rates have gone up .  production of all sorts of nuclear weapons is booming .     yes .  sounds like a continuing offensive .     i don t know .  the mule s a subtle son of a drab  and he may merely be soothing the workers into submission .  if seldon couldn t figure him out with all his psychohistory  i m not going to try .  but you re wearing work clothes .  that suggests something  eh .     i m not a skilled worker .     you ve had a military course in nucleics  haven t you .     certainly .     that s enough .  the nuclear field bearings  inc .   is located here in town .  tell them you ve had experience .  the stinkers who used to run the factory for indbur are still running it     for the mule .  they won t ask questions  as long as they need more workers to make their fat hunk .  they ll give you an identity card and you can apply for a room in the corporation s housing district .  you might start now .    in that manner  captain han pritcher of the national fleet became shield man lo moro of the    shop of nuclear field bearings  inc .  and from an intelligence agent  he descended the social scale to  conspirator     a calling which led him months later to what had been indbur s private garden   in the garden  captain pritcher consulted the radometer in the palm of his hand .  the inner warning field was still in operation  and he waited .  half an hour remained to the life of the nuclear bomb in his mouth .  he rolled it gingerly with his tongue .   the radometer died into an ominous darkness and the captain advanced quickly .   so far  matters had progressed well .   he reflected objectively that the life of the nuclear bomb was his as well  that its death was his death     and the mule s death .   and the grand climacteric of a four month s private war would be reached  a war that had passed from flight through a newton factory  for two months  captain pritcher wore leaden aprons and heavy face shields  till all things military had been frictioned off his outer bearing .  he was a laborer  who collected his pay  spent his evenings in town  and never discussed politics .   for two months  he did not see the fox .   and then  one day  a man stumbled past his bench  and there was a scrap of paper in his pocket .  the word  fox  was on it .  he tossed it into the nuclear chamber  where it vanished in a sightless puff  sending the energy output up a millimicrovolt     and turned back to his work .   that night he was at the fox s home  and took a hand in a game of cards with two other men he knew by reputation and one by name and face .   over the cards and the passing and repassing tokens  they spoke .   the captain said   it s a fundamental error .  you live in the exploded past .  for eighty years our organization has been waiting for the correct historical moment .  we ve been blinded by seldon s psychohistory  one of the first propositions of which is that the individual does not count  does not make history  and that complex social and economic factors override him  make a puppet out of him .   he adjusted his cards carefully  appraised their value and said  as he put out a token .   why not kill the mule .     well  now  and what good would that do .   demanded the man at his left  fiercely .    you see   said the captain  discarding two cards   that s the attitude .  what is one man     out of quadrillions .  the galaxy won t stop rotating because one man dies .  but the mule is not a man  he is a mutant .  already  he had upset seldon s plan  and if you ll stop to analyze the implications  it means that he     one man     one mutant     upset all of seldon s psychohistory .  if he had never lived  the foundation would not have fallen .  if he ceased living  it would not remain fallen .    come  the democrats have fought the mayors and the traders for eighty years by connivery .  let s try assassination .     how .   interposed the fox  with cold common sense .   the captain said  slowly   i ve spent three months of thought on that with no solution .  i came here and had it in five minutes .   he glanced briefly at the man whose broad  pink melon of a face smiled from the place at his right .   you were once mayor indbur s chamberlain .  i did not know you were of the underground     nor i  that you were .     well  then  in your capacity as chamberlain you periodically checked the working of the alarm system of the palace .     i did .     and the mule occupies the palace now .     so it has been announced     though he is a modest conqueror who makes no speeches  proclamations nor public appearances of any sort .     that s an old story  and affects nothing .  you  my ex chamberlain  are all we need .    the cards were shown and the fox collected the stakes .  slowly  he dealt a new hand .   the man who had once been chamberlain picked up his cards  singly .   sorry  captain .  i checked the alarm system  but it was routine .  i know nothing about it .     i expected that  but your mind carries an eidetic memory of the controls if it can be probed deeply enough     with a psychic probe .    the chamberlain s ruddy face paled suddenly and sagged .  the cards in his hand crumpled under sudden fist pressure   a psychic probe .     you needn t worry   said the captain  sharply .   i know how to use one .  it will not harm you past a few days  weakness .  and if it did  it is the chance you take and the price you pay .  there are some among us  no doubt  who from the controls of the alarm could determine the wavelength combinations .  there are some among us who could manufacture a small bomb under time control and i myself will carry it to the mule .    the men gathered over the table .   the captain announced   on a given evening  a riot will start in terminus city in the neighborhood of the palace .  no real fighting .  disturbance     then flight .  as long as the palace guard is attracted  .  .  .  or  at the very least  distracted      from that day for a month the preparations went on  and captain han pritcher of the national fleet having become conspirator descended further in the social scale and became an  assassin .    captain pritcher  assassin  was in the palace itself  and found himself grimly pleased with his psychology .  a thorough alarm system outside meant few guards within .  in this case  it meant none at all .   the floor plan was clear in his mind .  he was a blob moving noiselessly up the well carpeted ramp .  at its head  he flattened against the wall and waited .   the small closed door of a private room was before him .  behind that door must be the mutant who had beaten the unbeatable .  he was early     the bomb had ten minutes of life in it .   five of these passed  and still in all the world there was no sound .  the mule had five minutes to live     so had captain pritcher     he stepped forward on sudden impulse .  the plot could no longer fail .  when the bomb went  the palace would go with it     all the palace .  a door between     ten yards between     was nothing .  but he wanted to see the mule as they died together .   in a last  insolent gesture  he thundered upon the door .   and it opened and let out the blinding light .   captain pritcher staggered  then caught himself .  the solemn man  standing in the center of the small room before a suspended fish bowl  looked up mildly .   his uniform was a somber black  and as he tapped the bowl in an absent gesture  it bobbed quickly and the feather finned  orange and vermilion fish within darted wildly .   he said   come in  captain .    to the captain s quivering tongue the little metal globe beneath was swelling ominously     a physical impossibility  the captain knew .  but it was in its last minute of life .   the uniformed man said   you had better spit out the foolish pellet and free yourself for speech .  it won t blast .    the minute passed and with a slow  sodden motion the captain bent his head and dropped the silvery globe into his palm .  with a furious force it was flung against the wall .  it rebounded with a tiny  sharp clangor  gleaming harmlessly as it flew .   the uniformed man shrugged .   so much for that  then .  it would have done you no good in any case  captain .  i am not the mule .  you will have to be satisfied with his viceroy .     how did you know .   muttered the captain  thickly .    blame it on an efficient counter espionage system .  i can name every member of your little gang  every step of their planning       and you let it go this far .     why not .  it has been one of my great purposes here to find you and some others .  particularly you .  i might have had you some months ago  while you were still a worker at the newton bearings works  but this is much better .  if you hadn t suggested the main outlines of the plot yourself  one of my own men would have advanced something of much the same sort for you .  the result is quite dramatic  and rather grimly humorous .    the captain s eyes were hard .   i find it so  too .  is it all over now .     just begun .  come  captain  sit down .  let us leave heroics for the fools who are impressed by it .  captain  you are a capable man .  according to the information i have  you were the first on the foundation to recognize the power of the mule .  since then you have interested yourself  rather daringly  in the mule s early life .  you have been one of those who carried off his clown  who  incidentally  has not yet been found  and for which there will yet be full payment .  naturally  your ability is recognized and the mule is not of those who fear the ability of his enemies as long as he can convert it into the ability of a new friend .     is that what you re hedging up to .  oh  no .     oh  yes .  it was the purpose of tonight s comedy .  you are an intelligent man  yet your little conspiracies against die mule fail humorously .  you can scarcely dignify it with the name of conspiracy .  is it part of your military training to waste ships in hopeless actions .     one must first admit them to be hopeless .     one will   the viceroy assured him  gently .   the mule has conquered the foundation  it is rapidly being turned into an arsenal for accomplishment of his greater aims .     what greater aims .     the conquest of the entire galaxy .  the reunion of all the tom worlds into a new empire .  the fulfillment  you dull witted patriot  of your own seldon s dream seven hundred years before he hoped to see it .  and in the fulfillment  you can help us .     i can  undoubtedly .  but i won t  undoubtedly .     i understand   reasoned the viceroy   that only three of the independent trading worlds yet resist .  they will not last much longer .  it will be the last of all foundation forces .  you still hold out .     yes .     yet you won t .  a voluntary recruit is the  most efficient .  but the other kind will do .  unfortunately  the mule is absent .  he leads the fight  as always  against the resisting traders .  but he is in continual contact with us .  you will not have to wait long .     for what .     for your conversion .    the mule   said the captain  frigidly   will find that beyond his ability .     but he won t .  i was not beyond it .  you don t recognize me .  come  you were on kalgan  so you have seen me .  i wore a monocle  a fur lined scarlet robe  a high crowned hat      the captain stiffened in dismay .   you were the warlord of kalgan .     yes .  and now i am the loyal viceroy of the mule .  you see  he is persuasive .           .  interlude in space  the blockade was run successfully .  in the vast volume of space  not all the navies ever in existence could keep their watch in tight proximity .  given a single ship  a skillful pilot  and a moderate degree of luck  and there are holes and to spare .   with cold eyed calm  toran drove a protesting vessel from the vicinity of one star to that of another .  if the neighborhood of great mass made an interstellar jump erratic and difficult  it also made the enemy detection devices useless or nearly so .   and once the girdle of ships had been passed the inner sphere of dead space  through whose blockaded sub ether no message could be driven  was passed as well .  for the first time in over three months toran felt unisolated .   a week passed before the enemy news programs dealt with anything more than the dull  self laudatory details of growing control over the foundation .  it was a week in which toran s armored trading ship fled inward from the periphery in hasty jumps .   ebling mis called out to the pilot room and toran rose blink eyed from his charts .    what s the matter .   toran stepped down into the small central chamber which bayta had inevitably devised into a living room .   mis shook his head   bescuppered if i know .  the mule s newsmen are announcing a special bulletin .  thought you might want to get in on it .     might as well .  where s bayta .     setting the table in the diner and picking out a menuor some such frippery .    toran sat down upon the cot that served as magnifico s bed  and waited .  the propaganda routine of the mule s  special bulletins  were monotonously similar .  first the martial music  and then the buttery slickness of the announcer .  the minor news items would come  following one another in patient lock step .  then the pause .  then the trumpets and the rising excitement and the climax .   toran endured it .  mis muttered to himself .   the newscaster spilled out  in conventional war correspondent phraseology  the unctuous words that translated into sound the molten metal and blasted flesh of a battle in space .    rapid cruiser squadrons under lieutenant general sammin hit back hard today at the task force striking out from iss     the carefully expressionless face of the speaker upon the screen faded into the blackness of a space cut through by the quick swaths of ships reeling across emptiness in deadly battle .  the voice continued through the soundless thunder   the most striking action of the battle was the subsidiary combat of the heavy cruiser cluster against three enemy ships of the  nova  class      the screen s view veered and closed in .  a great ship sparked and one of the frantic attackers glowed angrily  twisted out of focus  swung back and rammed .  the cluster bowed wildly and survived the glancing blow that drove the attacker off in twisting reflection .   the newsman s smooth unimpassioned delivery continued to the last blow and the last hulk .   then a pause  and a large similar voice and picture of the fight off mnemon  to which the novelty was added of a lengthy description of a hit and run landing     the picture of a blasted city     huddled and weary prisoners     and off again .   mnemon had not long to live .   the pause again     and this time the raucous sound of the expected brasses .  the screen faded into the long  impressively soldier lined corridor up which the government spokesman in councilor s uniform strode quickly .   the silence was oppressive .   the voice that came at last was solemn  slow and hard   by order of our sovereign  it is announced that the planet  haven  hitherto in warlike opposition to his will  has submitted to the acceptance of defeat .  at this moment  the forces of our sovereign are occupying the planet .  opposition was scattered  unco ordinated  and speedily crushed .    the scene faded out  the original newsman returned to state importantly that other developments would be transmitted as they occurred .   then there was dance music  and ebling mis threw the shield that cut the power .   toran rose and walked unsteadily away  without a word .  the psychologist made no move to stop him .   when bayta stepped out of the kitchen  mis motioned silence .   he said   they ve taken haven .    and bayta said   already .   her eyes were round  and sick with disbelief .    without a fight .  without an unprin     he stopped and swallowed .   you d better leave toran alone .  it s not pleasant for him .  suppose we eat without him this once .    bayta looked once toward the pilot room  then turned hopelessly .   very well .    magnifico sat unnoticed at the table .  he neither spoke nor ate but stared ahead with a concentrated fear that seemed to drain all the vitality out of his thread of a body .   ebling mis pushed absently at his iced fruit dessert and said  harshly   two trading worlds fight .  they fight  and bleed  and die and don t surrender .  only at haven     just as at the foundation       but why .  why .    the psychologist shook his head .   it s of a piece with all the problem .  every queer facet is a hint at the nature of the mule .  first  the problem of how he could conquer the foundation  with little blood  and at a single blow essentially     while the independent trading worlds held out .  the blanket on nuclear reactions was a puny weapon     we ve discussed that back and forth till i m sick of it     and it did not work on any but the foundation .    randu suggested   and ebling s grizzly eyebrows pulled together   it might have been a radiant will depresser .  it s what might have done the work on haven .  but then why wasn t it used on mnemon and iss     which even now fight with such demonic intensity that it is taking half the foundation fleet in addition to the mule s forces to beat them down .  yes  i recognized foundation ships in the attack .    bayta whispered   the foundation  then haven .  disaster seems to follow us  without touching .  we always seem to get out by a hair .  will it last forever .    ebling mis was not listening .  to himself  he was making a point .   but there s another problem     another problem .  bayta  you remember the news item that the mule s clown was not found on terminus  that it was suspected he had fled to haven  or been carried there by his original kidnappers .  there is an importance attached to him  bayta  that doesn t fade  and we have not located it yet .  magnifico must know something that is fatal to the mule .  i m sure of it .     magnifico  white and stuttering  protested   sire  .  .  .  noble lord  .  .  .  indeed  i swear it is past my poor reckoning to penetrate your wants .  i have told what i know to the utter limits  and with your probe  you have drawn out of my meager wit that which i knew  but knew not that i knew .     i know  .  .  .  i know .  it is something small .  a hint so small that neither you nor i recognize it for what it is .  yet i must find it     for mnemon and iss will go soon  and when they do  we are the last remnants  the last droplets of the independent foundation .    the stars begin to cluster closely when the core of the galaxy is penetrated .  gravitational fields begin to overlap at intensities sufficient to introduce perturbations in an interstellar jump that can not be overlooked .   toran became aware of that when a jump landed their ship in the full glare of a red giant which clutched viciously  and whose grip was loosed  then wrenched apart  only after twelve sleepless  soul battering hours .   with charts limited in scope  and an experience not at all fully developed  either operationally or mathematically  toran resigned himself to days of careful plotting between jumps .   it became a community project of a sort .  ebling mis checked toran s mathematics and bayta tested possible routes  by the various generalized methods  for the presence of real solutions .  even magnifico was put to work on the calculating machine for routine computations  a type of work  which  once explained  was a source of great amusement to him and at which he was surprisingly proficient .   so at the end of a month  or nearly  bayta was able to survey the red line that wormed its way through the ship s trimensional model of the galactic lens halfway to its center  and say with satiric relish   you know what it looks like .  it looks like a ten foot earth worm with a terrific case of indigestion .  eventually  you ll land us back in haven .     i will   growled toran  with a fierce rustle of his chart   if you don t shut up .     and at that   continued bayta   there is probably a route fight through  straight as a meridian of longitude .     yeah .  well  in the first place  dimwit  it probably took five hundred ships five hundred years to work out that route by hit and miss  and my lousy half credit charts don t give it .  besides  maybe those straight routes are a good thing to avoid .  they re probably choked up with ships .  and besides       oh  for galaxy s sake  stop driveling and slavering so much righteous indignation .   her hands were in his hair .   he yowled   ouch .  let go .   seized her wrists and whipped downward  whereupon toran  bayta  and chair formed a tangled threesome on the floor .  it degenerated into a panting wrestling match  composed mostly of choking laughter and various foul blows .   toran broke loose at magnifico s breathless entrance .    what is it .    the lines of anxiety puckered the clown s face and tightened the skin whitely over the enormous bridge of his nose .   the instruments are behaving queerly  sir .  i have not  in the knowledge of my ignorance  touched anything      in two seconds  toran was in the pilot room .  he said quietly to magnifico   wake up ebling mis .  have him come down here .    he said to bayta  who was trying to get a basic order back to her hair by use of her fingers   we ve been detected  bay .     detected .   and bayta s arms dropped .   by whom .     galaxy knows   muttered toran   but i imagine by someone with blasters already ranged and trained .    he sat down and in a low voice was already sending into the sub ether the ship s identification code .   and when ebling mis entered  bathrobed and blear eyed  toran said with a desperate calm   it seems we re inside the borders of a local inner kingdom which is called the autarchy of filia .     never heard of it   said mis  abruptly .    well  neither did i   replied toran   but we re being stopped by a filian ship just the same  and i don t know what it will involve .    the captain inspector of the filian ship crowded aboard with six armed men following him .  he was short  thin haired  thin lipped  and dry skinned .  he coughed a sharp cough as he sat down and threw open the folio under his arm to a blank page .    your passports and ship s clearance  please .     we have none   said toran .    none  hey .   he snatched up a microphone suspended from his belt and spoke into it quickly   three men and one woman .  papers not in order .   he made an accompanying notation in the folio .   he said   where are you from .     siwenna   said toran warily .    where is that .     thirty thousand parsecs  eighty degrees west trantor  forty degrees       never mind  never mind .   toran could see that his inquisitor had written down   point of origin     periphery .    the filian continued   where are you going .    toran said   trantor sector .     purpose .     pleasure trip .     carrying any cargo .     no .     hm m m .  we ll check on that .   he nodded and two men jumped to activity .  toran made no move to interfere .    what brings you into filian territory .   the filian s eyes gleamed unamiably .    we didn t know we were .  i lack a proper chart .     you will be required to pay a hundred credits for that lack     and  of course  the usual fees required for tariff duties  et cetera .    he spoke again into the microphone     but listened more than he spoke .  then  to toran   know anything about nuclear technology .     a little   replied toran  guardedly .    yes .   the filian closed his folio  and added   the men of the periphery have a knowledgeable reputation that way .  put on a suit and come with me .    bayta stepped forward   what are you going to do with him .    toran put her aside gently  and asked coldly   where do you want me to come .     our power plant needs minor adjustments .  he ll come with you .   his pointing finger aimed directly at magnifico  whose brown eyes opened wide in a blubbery dismay .    what s he got to do with it .   demanded toran fiercely .   the official looked up coldly .   i am informed of pirate activities in this vicinity .  a description of one of the known thugs tallies roughly .  it is a purely routine matter of identification .     toran hesitated  but six men and six blasters are eloquent arguments .  he reached into the cupboard for the suits .   an hour later  he rose upright in the bowels of the filian ship and raged   there s not a thing wrong with the motors that i can see .  the busbars are true  the l tubes are feeding properly and the reaction analysis checks .  who s in charge here .    the head engineer said quietly   i am .     well  get me out of here      he was led to the officers  level and the small anteroom held only an indifferent ensign .    where s the man who came with me .     please wait   said the ensign .   it was fifteen minutes later that magnifico was brought in .    what did they do to you .   asked toran quickly .    nothing .  nothing at all .   magnifico s head shook a slow negative .   it took two hundred and fifty credits to fulfill the demands of filia     fifty credits of it for instant release     and they were in free space again .   bayta said with a forced laugh   don t we rate an escort .  don t we get the usual figurative boot over the border .    and toran replied  grimly   that was no filian ship     and we re not leaving for a while .  come in here .    they gathered about him .   he said  whitely   that was a foundation ship  and those were the mule s men aboard .    ebling bent to pick up the cigar he had dropped .  he said   here .  we re fifteen thousand parsecs from the foundation .      and we re here .  what s to prevent them from making the same trip .  galaxy  ebling  don t you think i can tell ships apart .  i saw their engines  and that s enough for me .  i tell you it was a foundation engine in a foundation ship .     and how did they get here .   asked bayta  logically .   what are the chances of a random meeting of two given ships in space .     what s that to do with it .   demanded toran  hotly .   it would only show we ve been followed .     followed .   hooted bayta .   through hyperspace .    ebling mis interposed wearily   that can be done     given a good ship and a great pilot .  but the possibility doesn t impress me .     i haven t been masking my trail   insisted toran .   i ve been building up take off speed on the straight .  a blind man could have calculated our route .     the blazes he could   cried bayta .   with the cockeyed jumps you are making  observing our initial direction didn t mean a thing .  we came out of the jump wrong end forwards more than once .     we re wasting time   blazed toran  with gritted teeth .   it s a foundation ship under the mule .  it s stopped us .  it s searched us .  it s had magnifico     alone     with me as hostage to keep the rest of you quiet  in case you suspected .  and we re going to bum it out of space right now .     hold on now   and ebling mis clutched at him .   are you going to destroy us for one ship you think is an enemy .  think  man  would those scuppers chase us over an impossible route half through the bestinkered galaxy  look us over  and then let us go .     they re still interested in where we re going .     then why stop us and put us on our guard .  you can t have it both ways  you know .     i ll have it my way .  let go of me  ebling  or i ll knock you down .    magnifico leaned forward from his balanced perch on his favorite chair back .  his long nostrils flared with excitement .   i crave your pardon for my interruption  but my poor mind is of a sudden plagued with a queer thought .    bayta anticipated toran s gesture of annoyance  and added her grip to ebling s .   go ahead and speak  magnifico .  we will all listen faithfully .    magnifico said   in my stay in their ship what addled wits i have were bemazed and bemused by a chattering fear that befell men .  of a truth i have a lack of memory of most that happened .  many men staring at me  and talk i did not understand .  but towards the last     as though a beam of sunlight had dashed through a cloud rift     there was a face i knew .  a glimpse  the merest glimmer     and yet it glows in my memory ever stronger and brighter .    toran said   who was it .     that captain who was with us so long a time ago  when first you saved me from slavery .    it had obviously been magnifico s intention to create a sensation  and the delighted smile that curled broadly in the shadow of his proboscis  attested to his realization of the intention s success .    captain  .  .  .  han  .  .  .  pritcher .   demanded mis  sternly .   you re sure of that .  certain sure now .     sir  i swear   and he laid a bone thin hand upon his narrow chest .   i would uphold the truth of it before the mule and swear it in his teeth  though all his power were behind him to deny it .    bayta said in pure wonder   then what s it all about .   the clown faced her eagerly   my lady  i have a theory .  it came upon me  ready made  as though the galactic spirit had gently laid it in my mind .   he actually raised his voice above toran s interrupting objection .    my lady   he addressed himself exclusively to bayta   if this captain had  like us  escaped with a ship  if he  like us  were on a trip for a purpose of his own devising  if he blundered upon us     he would suspect us of following and waylaying him  as we suspect him of the like .  what wonder he played this comedy to enter our ship .     why would he want us in his ship  then .   demanded toran .   that doesn t fit .     why  yes  it does   clamored the clown  with a flowing inspiration .   he sent an underling who knew us not  but who described us into his microphone .  the listening captain would be struck at my own poor likeness     for  of a truth there are not many in this great galaxy who bear a resemblance to my scantiness .  i was the proof of the identity of the rest of you .     and so he leaves us .     what do we know of his mission  and the secrecy thereof .  lie has spied us out for not an enemy and having it done so  must he needs think it wise to risk his plan by widening the knowledge thereof .    bayta said slowly   don t be stubborn  torie .  it does explain things .     it could be   agreed mis .   toran seemed helpless in the face of united resistance .  something in the clown s fluent explanations bothered him .  something was wrong .  yet he was bewildered and  in spite of himself  his anger ebbed .    for a while   he whispered   i thought we might have had one of the mule s ships .    and his eyes were dark with the pain of haven s loss .   the others understood .          .  death on neotrantor  neotrantor the small planet of delicass  renamed after the great sack  was for nearly a century  the seat of the last dynasty of the first empire .  it was a shadow world and a shadow empire and its existence is only of legalistic importance .  under the first of the neotrantorian dynasty .  .  .  .   encyclopedia galactica  neotrantor was the name .  new trantor .  and when you have said the name you have exhausted at a stroke all the resemblances of the new trantor to the great original .  two parsecs away  the sun of old trantor still shone and the galaxy s imperial capital of the previous century still cut through space in the silent and eternal repetition of its orbit .   men even inhabited old trantor .  not many     a hundred million  perhaps  where fifty years before  forty billions had swarmed .  the huge  metal world was in jagged splinters .  the towering thrusts of the multi towers from the single world girdling base were torn and empty     still bearing the original blastholes and firegut     shards of the great sack of forty years earlier .   it was strange that a world which had been the center of a galaxy for two thousand years     that had ruled limitless space and been home to legislators and rulers whose whims spanned the parsecs     could die in a month .  it was strange that a world which had been untouched through the vast conquering sweeps and retreats of a millennia  and equally untouched by the civil wars and palace revolutions of other millennia     should lie dead at last .  it was strange that the glory of the galaxy should be a rotting corpse .   and pathetic .   for centuries would yet pass before the mighty works of fifty generations of humans would decay past use .  only the declining powers of men  themselves  rendered them useless now .   the millions left after the billions had died tore up the gleaming metal base of the planet and exposed soil that had not felt the touch of sun in a thousand years .   surrounded by the mechanical perfections of human efforts  encircled by the industrial marvels of mankind freed of the tyranny of environment     they returned to the land .  in the huge traffic clearings  wheat and corn grew .  in the shadow of the towers  sheep grazed .   but neotrantor existed     an obscure village of a planet drowned in the shadow of mighty trantor  until a heart throttled royal family  racing before the fire and flame of the great sack sped to it as its last refuge     and held out there  barely  until the roaring wave of rebellion subsided .  there it ruled in ghostly splendor over a cadaverous remnant of imperium .   twenty agricultural worlds were a galactic empire .   dagobert ix  ruler of twenty worlds of refractory squires and sullen peasants  was emperor of the galaxy  lord of the universe .   dagobert ix had been twenty five on the bloody day he arrived with his father upon neotrantor .  his eyes and mind were still alive with the glory and the power of the empire that was .  but his son  who might one day be dagobert x  was born on neotrantor .   twenty worlds were all he knew .   jord commason s open air car was the finest vehicle of its type on all neotrantor     and  after all  justly so .  it did not end with the fact that commason was the largest landowner on neotrantor .  it began there .  for in earlier days he had been the companion and evil genius of a young crown prince  restive in the dominating grip of a middle aged emperor .  and now he was the companion and still the evil genius of a middle aged crown prince who hated and dominated an old emperor .   so jord commason  in his air car  which in mother of pearl finish and gold and lumetron ornamentation needed no coat of arms as owner s identification  surveyed the lands that were his  and the miles of rolling wheat that were his  and the huge threshers and harvesters that were his  and the tenant farmers and machine tenders that were his     and considered his problems cautiously .   beside him  his bent and withered chauffeur guided the ship gently through the upper winds and smiled .   jord commason spoke to the wind  the air  and the sky   you remember what i told you  inchney .    inchney s thin gray hair wisped lightly in the wind .  his gap toothed smile widened in its thin lipped fashion and the vertical wrinkles of his cheeks deepened as though he were keeping an eternal secret from himself .  the whisper of his voice whistled between his teeth .    i remember  sire  and i have thought .     and what have you thought  inchney .   there was an impatience about the question .   inchney remembered that he had been young and handsome  and a lord on old trantor .  inchney remembered that he was a disfigured ancient on neotrantor  who lived by grace of squire jord commason  and paid for the grace by lending his subtlety on request .  he sighed very softly .   he whispered again   visitors from the foundation  sire  are a convenient thing to have .  especially  sire  when they come with but a single ship  and but a single fighting man .  how welcome they might be .     welcome .   said commason  gloomily .   perhaps so .  but those men are magicians and may be powerful .     pugh   muttered inchney   the mistiness of distance hides the truth .  the foundation is but a world .  its citizens are but men .  if you blast them  they die .    inchney held the ship on its course     a river was a winding sparkle below .  he whispered   and is there not a man they speak of now who stirs the worlds of the periphery .    commason was suddenly suspicious .   what do you know of this .    there was no smile on his chauffeur s face .   nothing  sire .  it was but an idle question .    the squire s hesitation was short .  he said  with brutal directness   nothing you ask is idle  and your method of acquiring knowledge will have your scrawny neck in a vise yet .  but     i have it .  this man is called the mule  and a subject of his had been here some months ago on a  .  .  .  matter of business .  i await another  .  .  .  now  .  .  .  for its conclusion .     and these newcomers .  they are not the ones you want  perhaps .     they lack the identification they should have .     it has been reported that the foundation has been captured       i did not tell you that .     it has been so reported   continued inchney  coolly   and if that is correct  then these may be refugees from the destruction  and may be held for the mule s man out of honest friendship .     yes .   commason was uncertain .    and  sire  since it is well known that the friend of a conqueror is but the last victim  it would be but a measure of honest self defense .  for there are such things as psychic probes  and here we have four foundation brains .  there is much about the foundation it would be useful to know  much even about the mule .  and then the mule s friendship would be a trifle the less overpowering .    commason  in the quiet of the upper air  returned with a shiver to his first thought .   but if the foundation has not fallen .  if the reports are lies .  it is said that it has been foretold it can not fall .     we are past the age of soothsayers  sire .     and yet if it did not fall  inchney .  think .  if it did not fall .  the mule made me promises  indeed     he had gone too far  and backtracked .   that is  he made boasts .  but boasts are wind and deeds are hard .    inchney laughed noiselessly .   deeds are hard indeed  until begun .  one could scarcely find a further fear than a galaxy end foundation .     there is still the prince   murmured commason  almost to himself .    he deals with the mule also  then  sire .    commason could not quite choke down the complacent shift of features .   not entirely .  not as i do .  but he grows wilder  more uncontrollable .  a demon is upon him .  if i seize these people and he takes them away for his own use     for he does not lack a certain shrewdness     i am not yet ready to quarrel with him .   he frowned and his heavy cheeks bent downwards with dislike .    i saw those strangers for a few moments yesterday   said the gray chauffeur  irrelevantly   and it is a strange woman  that dark one .  she walks with the freedom of a man and she is of a startling paleness against the dark luster of hair .   there was almost a warmth in the husky whisper of the withered voice  so that commason turned toward him in sudden surprise .   inchney continued   the prince  i think  would not find his shrewdness proof against a reasonable compromise .  you could have the rest  if you left him the girl      a light broke upon commason   a thought .  indeed a thought .  inchney  turn back .  and inchney  if all turns well  we will discuss further this matter of your freedom .    it was with an almost superstitious sense of symbolism that commason found a personal capsule waiting for him in his private study when he returned .  it had arrived by a wavelength known to few .  commason smiled a fat smile .  the mule s man was coming and the foundation had indeed fallen .   bayta s misty visions  when she had them  of an imperial palace  did not jibe with the reality  and inside her  there was a vague sense of disappointment .  the room was small  almost plain  almost ordinary .  the palace did not even match the mayor s residence back at the foundation     and dagobert ix      bayta had definite ideas of what an emperor ought to look like .  he ought not look like somebody s benevolent grandfather .  he ought not be thin and white and faded     or serving cups of tea with his own hand in an expressed anxiety for the comfort of his visitors .   but so it was .   dagobert ix chuckled as he poured tea into her stiffly outheld cup .    this is a great pleasure for me  my dear .  it is a moment away from ceremony and courtiers .  i have not had the opportunity for welcoming visitors from my outer provinces for a time now .  my son takes care of these details now that i m older .  you haven t met my son .  a fine boy .  headstrong  perhaps .  but then he s young .  do you care for a flavor capsule .  no .    toran attempted an interruption   your imperial majesty       yes .     your imperial majesty  it has not been our intention to intrude upon you       nonsense  there is no intrusion .  tonight there will be the official reception  but until then  we are free .  let s see  where did you say you were from .  it seems a long time since we had an official reception .  you said you were from the province of anacreon .     from the foundation  your imperial majesty .     yes  the foundation .  i remember now .  i had it located .  it is in the province of anacreon .  i have never been there .  my doctor forbids extensive traveling .  i don t recall any recent reports from my viceroy at anacreon .  how are conditions there .   he concluded anxiously .    sire   mumbled toran   i bring no complaints .     that is gratifying .  i will commend my viceroy .    toran looked helplessly at ebling mis  whose brusque voice rose .   sire  we have been told that it will require your permission for us to visit the imperial university library on trantor .     trantor .   questioned the emperor  mildly   trantor .    then a look of puzzled pain crossed his thin face .   trantor .   he whispered .   i remember now .  i am making plans now to return there with a flood of ships at my back .  you shall come with me .  together we will destroy the rebel  gilmer .  together we shall restore the empire .    his bent back had straightened .  his voice had strengthened .  for a moment his eyes were hard .  then  he blinked and said softly   but gilmer is dead .  i seem to remember     yes .  yes .  gilmer is dead .  trantor is dead     for a moment  it seemed     where was it you said you came from .    magnifico whispered to bayta   is this really an emperor .  for somehow i thought emperors were greater and wiser than ordinary men .    bayta motioned him quiet .  she said   if your imperial majesty would but sign an order permitting us to go to trantor  it would avail greatly the common cause .     to trantor .   the emperor was blank and uncomprehending .    sire  the viceroy of anacreon  in whose name we speak  sends word that gilmer is yet alive       alive .  alive .   thundered dagobert .   where .  it will be war .     your imperial majesty  it must not yet be known .  his whereabouts are uncertain .  the viceroy sends us to acquaint you of the fact  and it is only on trantor that we may find his hiding place .  once discovered       yes  yes     he must be found     the old emperor doddered to the wall and touched the little photocell with a trembling finger .  he muttered  after an ineffectual pause   my servants do not come .  i can not wait for them .    he was scribbling on a blank sheet  and ended with a flourished  d .   he said   gilmer will yet learn the power of his emperor .  where was it you came from .  anacreon .  what are the conditions there .  is the name of the emperor powerful .    bayta took the paper from his loose fingers   your imperial majesty is beloved by the people .  your love for them is widely known .     i shall have to visit my good people of anacreon  but my doctor says  .  .  .  i don t remember what he says  but     he looked up  his old gray eyes sharp   were you saying something of gilmer .     no  your imperial majesty .     he shall not advance further .  go back and tell your people that .  trantor shall hold .  my father leads the fleet now  and the rebel vermin gilmer shall freeze in space with his regicidal rabble .    he staggered into a seat and his eyes were blank once more .   what was i saying .    toran rose and bowed low   your imperial majesty has been kind to us  but the time allotted us for an audience is over .     for a moment  dagobert ix looked like an emperor indeed as he rose and stood stiff backed while  one by one  his visitors retreated backward through the door     to where twenty armed men intervened and locked a circle about them .   a hand weapon flashed     to bayta  consciousness returned sluggishly  but without the  where am i .   sensation .  she remembered clearly the odd old man who called himself emperor  and the other men who waited outside .  the arthritic tingle in her finger joints meant a stun pistol .   she kept her eyes closed  and listened with painful attention to the voices .   there were two of them .  one was slow and cautious  with a slyness beneath the surface obsequity .  the other was hoarse and thick  almost sodden  and blurted out in viscous spurts .  bayta liked neither .   the thick voice was predominant .   bayta caught the last words   he will live forever  that old madman .  it wearies me .  it annoys me .  commason  i will have it .  i grow older  too .     your highness  let us first see of what use these people are .  it may be we shall have sources of strength other than your father still provides .    the thick voice was lost in a bubbling whisper .  bayta caught only the phrase       the girl     but the other  fawning voice was a nasty  low  running chuckle followed by a comradely  near patronizing   dagobert  you do not age .  they lie who say you are not a youth of twenty .    they laughed together  and bayta s blood was an icy trickle .  dagobert     your highness     the old emperor had spoken of a headstrong son  and the implication of the whispers now beat dully upon her .  but such things didn t happen to people in real life     toran s voice broke upon her in a slow  hard current of cursing .   she opened her eyes  and toran s  which were upon her  showed open relief .  he said  fiercely   this banditry will be answered by the emperor .  release us .    it dawned upon bayta that her wrists and ankles were fastened to wall and floor by a tight attraction field .   thick voice approached toran .  he was paunchy  his lower eyelids puffed darkly  and his hair was thinning out .  there was a gay feather in his peaked hat  and the edging of his doublet was embroidered with silvery metal foam .   he sneered with a heavy amusement .   the emperor .  the poor  mad emperor .     i have his pass .  no subject may hinder our freedom .     but i am no subject  space garbage .  i am the regent and crown prince and am to be addressed as such .  as for my poor silly father  it amuses him to see visitors occasionally .  and we humor him .  it tickles his mock imperial fancy .  but  of course  it has no other meaning .    and then he was before bayta  and she looked up at him contemptuously .  he leaned close and his breath was overpoweringly minted .   he said   her eyes suit well  commason     she is even prettier with them open .  i think she ll do .  it will be an exotic dish for a jaded taste  eh .    there was a futile surge upwards on toran s part  which the crown prince ignored and bayta felt the iciness travel outward to the skin .  ebling mis was still out  head lolling weakly upon his chest  but  with a sensation of surprise  bayta noted that magnifico s eyes were open  sharply open  as though awake for many minutes .  those large brown eyes swiveled towards bayta and stared at her out of a doughy face .   he whimpered  and nodded with his head towards the crown prince   that one has my visi sonor .    the crown prince turned sharply toward the new voice   this is yours  monster .   he swung the instrument from his shoulder where it had hung  suspended by its green strap  unnoticed by bayta .   he fingered it clumsily  tried to sound a chord and got nothing for his pains   can you play it  monster .    magnifico nodded once .   toran said suddenly   you ve rifled a ship of the foundation .  if the emperor will not avenge  the foundation will .    it was the other  commason  who answered slowly   what foundation .  or is the mule no longer the mule .    there was no answer to that .  the prince s grin showed large uneven teeth .  the clown s binding field was broken and he was nudged ungently to his feet .  the visi sonor was thrust into his hand .    play for us  monster   said the prince .   play us a serenade of love and beauty for our foreign lady here .  tell her that my father s country prison is no palace  but that i can take her to one where she can swim in rose water     and know what a prince s love is .  sing of a prince s love  monster .    he placed one thick thigh upon a marble table and swung a leg idly  while his fatuous smiling stare swept bayta into a silent rage .  toran s sinews strained against the field  in painful  perspiring effort .  ebling mis stirred and moaned .   magnifico gasped   my fingers are of useless stiffness       play  monster .   roared the prince .  the lights dimmed at a gesture to commason and in the dimness he crossed his arms and waited .   magnifico drew his fingers in rapid  rhythmic jumps from end to end of the multikeyed instrument     and a sharp  gliding rainbow of light jumped across the room .  a low  soft tone sounded     throbbing  tearful .  it lifted in sad laughter  and underneath it there sounded a dull tolling .   the darkness seemed to intensify and grow thick .  music reached bayta through the muffled folds of invisible blankets .  gleaming light reached her from the depths as though a single candle glowed at the bottom of a pit .   automatically  her eyes strained .  the light brightened  but remained blurred .  it moved fuzzily  in confused color  and the music was suddenly brassy  evil     flourishing in high crescendo .  the light flickered quickly  in swift motion to the wicked rhythm .  something writhed within the light .  something with poisonous metallic scales writhed and yawned .  and the music writhed and yawned with it .   bayta struggled with a strange emotion and then caught herself in a mental gasp .  almost  it reminded her of the time in the time vault  of those last days on haven .  it was that horrible  cloying  clinging spiderweb of horror and despair .  she shrunk beneath it oppressed .   the music dinned upon her  laughing horribly  and the writhing terror at the wrong end of the telescope in the small circle of light was lost as she turned feverishly away .  her forehead was wet and cold .   the music died .  it must have lasted fifteen minutes  and a vast pleasure at its absence flooded bayta .  light glared  and magnifico s face was close to hers  sweaty  wild eyed  lugubrious .    my lady   he gasped   how fare you .     well enough   she whispered   but why did you play like that .    she became aware of the others in the room .  toran and mis were limp and helpless against the wall  but her eyes skimmed over them .  there was the prince  lying strangely still at the foot of the table .  there was commason  moaning wildly through an open  drooling mouth .   commason flinched  and yelled mindlessly  as magnifico took a step towards him .   magnifico turned  and with a leap  turned the others loose .   toran lunged upwards and with eager  taut fists seized the landowner by the neck   you come with us .  we ll want you     to make sure we get to our ship .    two hours later  in the ship s kitchen  bayta served a walloping homemade pie  and magnifico celebrated the return to space by attacking it with a magnificent disregard of table manners .    good  magnifico .     um m m m .     magnifico .     yes  my lady .     what was it you played back there .    the clown writhed   i  .  .  .  i d rather not say .  i learned it once  and the visi sonor is of an effect upon the nervous system most profound .  surely  it was an evil thing  and not for your sweet innocence  my lady .     oh  now  come  magnifico .  i m not as innocent as that .  don t flatter so .  did i see anything like what they saw .     i hope not .  i played it for them only .  if you saw  it was but the rim of it     from afar .     and that was enough .  do you know you knocked the prince out .    magnifico spoke grimly through a large  muffling piece of pie .   i killed him  my lady .     what .   she swallowed  painfully .    he was dead when i stopped  or i would have continued .  i cared not for commason .  his greatest threat was death or torture .  but  my lady  this prince looked upon you wickedly  and     he choked in a mixture of indignation and embarrassment .   bayta felt strange thoughts come and repressed them sternly .   magnifico  you ve got a gallant soul .     oh  my lady .   he bent a red nose into his pie  but  somehow did not eat .   ebling mis stared out the port .  trantor was near     its metallic shine fearfully bright .  toran was standing there  too .   he said with dull bitterness   we ve come for nothing  ebling .  the mule s man precedes us .    ebling mis rubbed his forehead with a hand that seemed shriveled out of its former plumpness .  his voice was an abstracted mutter .   toran was annoyed .   i say those people know the foundation has fallen .  i say       eh .   mis looked up  puzzled .  then  he placed a gentle hand upon toran s wrist  in complete oblivion of any previous conversation   toran  i  .  .  .  i ve been looking at trantor .  do you know  .  .  .  i have the queerest feeling  .  .  .  ever since we arrived on neotrantor .  it s an urge  a driving urge that s pushing and pushing inside .  toran  i can do it  i know i can do it .  things are becoming clear in my mind     they have never been so clear .    toran stared     and shrugged .  the words brought him no confidence .   he said  tentatively   mis .     yes .     you didn t see a ship come down on neotrantor as we left .    consideration was brief .   no .     i did .  imagination  i suppose  but it could have been that filian ship .     the one with captain han pritcher on it .     the one with space knows who upon it .  magnifico s information     it followed us here  mis .    ebling mis said nothing   toran said strenuously   is there anything wrong with you .  aren t you well .    mis s eyes were thoughtful  luminous  and strange .  he did not answer .          .  the ruins of trantor  the location of an objective upon the great world of trantor presents a problem unique in the galaxy .  there are no continents or oceans to locate from a thousand miles distance .  there are no rivers  lakes  and islands to catch sight of through the cloud rifts .   the metal covered world was     had been     one colossal city  and only the old imperial palace could be identified readily from outer space by a stranger .  the bayta circled the world at almost air car height in repeated painful search .   from polar regions  where the icy coating of the metal spires were somber evidence of the breakdown or neglect of the weather conditioning machinery  they worked southwards .  occasionally they could experiment with the correlations     or presumable correlations     between what they saw and what the inadequate map obtained at neotrantor showed .   but it was unmistakable when it came .  the gap in the metal coat of the planet was fifty miles .  the unusual greenery spread over hundreds of square miles  inclosing the mighty grace of the ancient imperial residences .   the bayta hovered and slowly oriented itself .  there were only the huge supercauseways to guide them .  long straight arrows on the map  smooth  gleaming ribbons there below them .   what the map indicated to be the university area was reached by dead reckoning  and upon the flat area of what once must have been a busy landing field  the ship lowered itself .   it was only as they submerged into the welter of metal that the smooth beauty apparent from the air dissolved into the broken  twisted near wreckage that had been left in the wake of the sack .  spires were truncated  smooth walls gouted and twisted  and just for an instant there was the glimpse of a shaven area of earth     perhaps several hundred acres in extent     dark and plowed .   lee senter waited as the ship settled downward cautiously .  it was a strange ship  not from neotrantor  and inwardly he sighed .  strange ships and confused dealings with the men of outer space could mean the end of the short days of peace  a return to the old grandiose times of death and battle .  senter was leader of the group  the old books were in his charge and he had read of those old days .  he did not want them .   perhaps ten minutes spent themselves as the strange ship came down to nestle upon the flatness  but long memories telescoped themselves in that time .  there was first the great farm of his childhood     that remained in his mind merely as busy crowds of people .  then there was the trek of the young families to new lands .  he was ten  then  an only child  puzzled  and frightened .   then the new buildings  the great metal slabs to be uprooted and tom aside  the exposed soil to be turned  and freshened  and invigorated  neighboring buildings to be tom down and leveled  others to be transformed to living quarters .   there were crops to be grown and harvested  peaceful relations with neighboring farms to be established     there was growth and expansion  and the quiet efficiency of self rule .  there was the coming of a new generation of hard  little youngsters born to the soil .  there was the great day when he was chosen leader of the group and for the first time since his eighteenth birthday he did not shave and saw the first stubble of his leader s beard appear .   and now the galaxy might intrude and put an end to the brief idyll of isolation     the ship landed .  he watched wordlessly as the port opened .  four emerged  cautious and watchful .  there were three men  varied  old  young  thin and beaked .  and a woman striding among them like an equal .  his hand left the two glassy black tufts of his beard as he stepped forward .   he gave the universal gesture of peace .  both hands were before him  hard  calloused palms upward .   the young man approached two steps and duplicated the gesture .   i come in peace .    the accent was strange  but the words were understandable  and welcome .  he replied  deeply   in peace be it .  you are welcome to the hospitality of the group .  are you hungry .  you shall eat .  are you thirsty .  you shall drink .    slowly  the reply came   we thank you for your kindness  and shall bear good report of your group when we return to our world .    a queer answer  but good .  behind him  the men of the group were smiling  and from the recesses of the surrounding structures  the women emerged .   in his own quarters  he removed the locked  mirror walled box from its hidden place  and offered each of the guests the long  plump cigars that were reserved for great occasions .  before the woman  he hesitated .  she had taken a seat among the men .  the strangers evidently allowed  even expected  such effrontery .  stiffly  he offered the box .   she accepted one with a smile  and drew in its aromatic smoke  with all the relish one could expect .  lee senter repressed a scandalized emotion .   the stiff conversation  in advance of the meal  touched politely upon the subject of fanning on trantor .   it was the old man who asked   what about hydroponics .  surely  for such a world as trantor  hydroponics would be the answer .    senter shook his head slowly .  he felt uncertain .  his knowledge was the unfamiliar matter of the books he had read   artificial fanning in chemicals  i think .  no  not on trantor .  this hydroponics requires a world of industy     for instance  a great chemical industry .  and in war or disaster  when industry breaks down  the people starve .  nor can all foods be grown artificially .  some lose their food value .  the soil is cheaper  still better     always more dependable .     and your food supply is sufficient .     sufficient  perhaps monotonous .  we have fowl that supply eggs  and milk yielders for our dairy products     but our meat supply rests upon our foreign trade .     trade .   the young man seemed roused to sudden interest .   you trade then .  but what do you export .     metal   was the curt answer .   look for yourself .  we have an infinite supply  ready processed .  they come from neotrantor with ships  demolish an indicated area increasing our growing space     and leave us in exchange meat  canned fruit  food concentrates  farm machinery and so on .  they carry off the metal and both sides profit .    they feasted on bread and cheese  and a vegetable stew that was unreservedly delicious .  it was over the dessert of frosted fruit  the only imported item on the menu  that  for the first time  the outlanders became other than mere guests .  the young man produced a map of trantor .   calmly  lee senter studied it .  he listened     and said gravely   the university grounds are a static area .  we farmers do not grow crops on it .  we do not  by preference  even enter it .  it is one of our few relics of another time we would keep undisturbed .      we are seekers after knowledge .  we would disturb nothing .  our ship would be our hostage .   the old man offered this     eagerly  feverishly .    i can take you there then   said senter .   that night the strangers slept  and that night lee senter sent a message to neotrantor .          .  convert  the thin life of trantor trickled to nothing when they entered among the wide spaced buildings of the university grounds .  there was a solemn and lonely silence over it .   the strangers of the foundation knew nothing of the swirling days and nights of the bloody sack that had left the university untouched .  they knew nothing of the time after the collapse of the imperial power  when the students  with their borrowed weapons  and their pale faced inexperienced bravery  formed a protective volunteer army to protect the central shrine of the science of the galaxy .  they knew nothing of the seven days fight  and the armistice that kept the university free  when even the imperial palace clanged with the boots of gilmer and his soldiers  during the short interval of their rule .   those of the foundation  approaching for the first time  realized only that in a world of transition from a gutted old to a strenuous new this area was a quiet  graceful museum piece of ancient greatness .   they were intruders in a sense .  the brooding emptiness rejected them .  the academic atmosphere seemed still to live and to stir angrily at the disturbance .   the library was a deceptively small building which broadened out vastly underground into a mammoth volume of silence and reverie .  ebling mis paused before the elaborate murals of the reception room .   he whispered     one had to whisper here   i think we passed the catalog rooms back a way .  i ll stop there .    his forehead was flushed  his hand trembling   i mustn t be disturbed  toran .  will you bring my meals down to me .     anything you say .  we ll do all we can to help .  do you want us to work under you       no .  i must be alone       you think you will get what you want .    and ebling mis replied with a soft certainty   i know i will .    toran and bayta came closer to  setting up housekeeping  in normal fashion than at any time in their year of married life .  it was a strange sort of  housekeeping .   they lived in the middle of grandeur with an inappropriate simplicity .  their food was drawn largely from lee senter s farm and was paid for in the little nuclear gadgets that may be found on any trader s ship .   magnifico taught himself how to use the projectors in the library reading room  and sat over adventure novels and romances to the point where he was almost as forgetful of meals and sleep as was ebling mis .   ebling himself was completely buried .  he had insisted on a hammock being slung up for him in the psychology reference room .  his face grew thin and white .  his vigor of speech was lost and his favorite curses had died a mild death .  there were times when the recognition of either toran or bayta seemed a struggle .   he was more himself with magnifico who brought him his meals and often sat watching him for hours at a time  with a queer  fascinated absorption  as the aging psychologist transcribed endless equations  cross referred to endless book films  scurried endlessly about in a wild mental effort towards an end he alone saw .   toran came upon her in the darkened room  and said sharply   bayta .    bayta started guiltily .   yes .  you want me  torie .     sure i want you .  what in space are you sitting there for .  you ve been acting all wrong since we got to trantor .  what s the matter with you .     oh  torie  stop   she said  wearily .   and  oh  torie  stop .   he mimicked impatiently .  then  with sudden softness   won t you tell me what s wrong  bay .  something s bothering you .     no .  nothing is  torie .  if you keep on just nagging and nagging  you ll have me mad .  i m just     thinking .     thinking about what .     about nothing .  well  about the mule  and haven  and the foundation  and everything .  about ebling mis and whether he ll find anything about the second foundation  and whether it will help us when he does find it     and a million other things .  are you satisfied .   her voice was agitated .    if you re just brooding  do you mind stopping .  it isn t pleasant and it doesn t help the situation .    bayta got to her feet and smiled weakly .   all right .  i m happy .  see  i m smiling and jolly .     magnifico s voice was an agitated cry outside .   my lady       what is it .  come      bayta s voice choked off sharply when the opening door framed the large  hard faced      pritcher   cried toran .   bayta gasped   captain .  how did you find us .    han pritcher stepped inside .  his voice was clear and level  and utterly dead of feeling   my rank is colonel now     under the mule .     under the  .  .  .  mule .   toran s voice trailed off .  they formed a tableau there  the three .   magnifico stared wildly and shrank behind toran .  nobody stopped to notice him .   bayta said  her hands trembling in each other s tight grasp   you are arresting us .  you have really gone over to them .    the colonel replied quickly   i have not come to arrest you .  my instructions make no mention of you .  with regard to you  i am free  and i choose to exercise our old friendship  if you will let me .    toran s face was a twisted suppression of fury   how did you find us .  you were in the filian ship  then .  you followed us .    the wooden lack of expression on pritcher s face might have flickered in embarrassment .   i was on the filian ship .  i met you in the first place  .  .  .  well  .  .  .  by chance .     it is a chance that is mathematically impossible .     no .  simply rather improbable  so my statement will have to stand .  in any case  you admitted to the .  filians     there is  of course  no such nation as filia actually     that you were heading for the trantor sector  and since the mule already had his contacts upon neotrantor  it was easy to have you detained there .  unfortunately  you got away before i arrived  but not long before .  i had time to have the farms on trantor ordered to report your arrival .  it was done and i am here .  may i sit down .  i come in friendliness  believe me .   he sat .  toran bent his head and thought futilely .  with a numbed lack of emotion  bayta prepared tea .   toran looked up harshly .   well  what are you waiting for     colonel .  what s your friendship .  if it s not arrest  what is it then .  protective custody .  call in your men and give your orders .    patiently  pritcher shook his head .   no  toran .  i come of my own will to speak to you  to persuade you of the uselessness of what you are doing .  if i fail i shall leave .  that is all .     that is all .  well  then peddle your propaganda  give us your speech  and leave .  i don t want any tea  bayta .    pritcher accepted a cup  with a grave word of thanks .  he looked at toran with a clear strength as he sipped lightly .  then he said   the mule is a mutant .  he can not be beaten in the very nature of the mutation       why .  what is the mutation .   asked toran  with sour humor .   i suppose you ll tell us now  eh .     yes  i will .  your knowledge won t hurt him .  you see     he is capable of adjusting the emotional balance of human beings .  it sounds like a little trick  but it s quite unbeatable .    bayta broke in   the emotional balance .   she frowned   won t you explain that .  i don t quite understand .     i mean that it is an easy matter for him to instill into a capable general  say  the emotion of utter loyalty to the mule and complete belief in the mule s victory .  his generals are emotionally controlled .  they can not betray him  they can not weaken     and the control is permanent .  his most capable enemies become his most faithful subordinates  the warlord of kalgan surrenders his planet and becomes his viceroy for the foundation .     and you   added bayta  bitterly   betray your cause and become mule s envoy to trantor .  i see .     i haven t finished .  the mule s gift works in reverse even more effectively .  despair is an emotion .  at the crucial moment  keymen on the foundation     keymen on haven     despaired .  their worlds fell without too much struggle .     do you mean to say   demanded bayta  tensely   that the feeling i had in the time vault was the mule juggling my emotional control .     mine  too .  everyone s .  how was it on haven towards the end .    bayta turned away .   colonel pritcher continued earnestly   as it works for worlds  so it works for individuals .  can you fight a force which can make you surrender willingly when it so desires  can make you a faithful servant when it so desires .    toran said slowly   how do i know this is the truth .     can you explain the fall of the foundation and of haven otherwise .  can you explain my conversion otherwise .  think  man .  what have you     or i     or the whole galaxy accomplished against the mule in all this time .  what one little thing .    toran felt the challenge   by the galaxy  i can .   with a sudden touch of fierce satisfaction  he shouted   your wonderful mule had contacts with neotrantor you say that were to have detained us  eh .  those contacts are dead or worse .  we killed the crown prince and left the other a whimpering idiot .  the mule did not stop us there  and that much has been undone .     why  no  not at all .  those weren t our men .  the crown prince was a wine soaked mediocrity .  the other man  commason  is phenomenally stupid .  he was a power on his world but that didn t prevent him from being vicious  evil  and completely incompetent .  we had nothing really to do with them .  they were  in a sense  merely feints       it was they who detained us  or tried .     again  no .  commason had a personal slave     a man called inchney .  detention was his policy .  he is old  but will serve our temporary purpose .  you would not have killed him  you see .    bayta whirled on him .  she had not touched her own tea .   but  by your very statement  your own emotions have been tampered with .  you ve got faith and belief in the mule  an unnatural  a diseased faith in the mule .  of what value are your opinions .  you ve lost all power of objective thought .     you are wrong .   slowly  the colonel shook his head .   only my emotions are fixed .  my reason is as it always was .  it may be influenced in a certain direction by my conditioned emotions  but it is not forced .  and there are some things i can see more clearly now that i am freed of my earlier emotional trend .    i can see that the mule s program is an intelligent and worthy one .  in the time since i have been     converted  i have followed his career from its start seven years ago .  with his mutant mental power  he began by winning over a condottiere and his band .  with that     and his power     he won a planet .  with that     and his power     he extended his grip until he could tackle the warlord of kalgan .  each step followed the other logically .  with kalgan in his pocket  he had a first class fleet  and with that     and his power     he could attack the foundation .    the foundation is the key .  it is the greatest area of industrial concentration in the galaxy  and now that the nuclear techniques of the foundation are in his hands  he is the actual master of the galaxy .  with those techniques     and his power     he can force the remnants of the empire to acknowledge his rule  and eventually     with the death of the old emperor  who is mad and not long for this world     to crown him emperor .  he will then have the name as well as the fact .  with that     and his power     where is the world in the galaxy that can oppose him .    in these last seven years  he has established a new empire .  in seven years  in other words  he will have accomplished what all seldon s psychohistory could not have done in less than an additional seven hundred .  the galaxy will have peace and order at last .    and you could not stop it     any more than you could stop a planet s rush with your shoulders .    a long silence followed pritcher s speech .  what remained of his tea had grown cold .  he emptied his cup  filled it again  and drained it slowly .  toran bit viciously at a thumbnail .  bayta s face was cold  and distant  and white .   then bayta said in a thin voice   we are not convinced .  if the mule wishes us to be  let him come here and condition us himself .  you fought him until the last moment of your conversion  i imagine  didn t you .     i did   said colonel pritcher  solemnly .    then allow us the same privilege .    colonel pritcher arose .  with a crisp air of finality  he said   then i leave .  as i said earlier  my mission at present concerns you in no way .  therefore  i don t think it will be necessary to report your presence here .  that is not too great a kindness .  if the mule wishes you stopped  he no doubt has other men assigned to the job  and you will be stopped .  but  for what it is worth  i shall not contribute more than my requirement .     thank you   said bayta faintly .    as for magnifico .  where is he .  come out  magnifico  i won t hurt you       what about him .   demanded bayta  with sudden animation .    nothing .  my instructions make no mention of him  either .  i have heard that he is searched for  but the mule will find him when the time suits him .  i shall say nothing .  will you shake hands .    bayta shook her head .  toran glared his frustrated contempt .   there was the slightest lowering of the colonel s iron shoulders .  he strode to the door  turned and said    one last thing .  don t think i am not aware of the source of your stubbornness .  it is known that you search for the second foundation .  the mule  in his time  will take his measures .  nothing will help you     but i knew you in other times  perhaps there is something in my conscience that urged me to this  at any rate  i tried to help you and remove you from the final danger before it was too late .  good by .    he saluted sharply     and was gone .   bayta turned to a silent toran  and whispered   they even know about the second foundation .    in the recesses of the library  ebling mis  unaware of all  crouched under the one spark of light amid the murky spaces and mumbled triumphantly to himself .          .  death of a psychologist  after that there were only two weeks left to the life of ebling mis .   and in those two weeks  bayta was with him three times .  the first time was on the night after the evening upon which they saw colonel pritcher .  the second was one week later .  and the third was again a week later     on the last day     the day mis died .   first  there was the night of colonel pritcher s evening  the first hour of which was spent by a stricken pair in a brooding  unmerry merry go round .   bayta said   torie  let s tell ebling .    toran said dully   think he can help .     we re only two .  we ve got to take some of the weight off .  maybe he can help .    toran said   he s changed .  he s lost weight .  he s a little feathery  a little woolly .   his fingers groped in air  metaphorically .   sometimes  i don t think he ll help us muchever .  sometimes  i don t think anything will help .     don t .   bayta s voice caught and escaped a break   torie  don t .  when you say that  i think the mule s getting us .  let s tell ebling  torie     now .    ebling mis raised his head from the long desk  and bleared at them as they approached .  his thinning hair was scuffed up  his lips made sleepy  smacking sounds .    eh .   he said .   someone want me .    bayta bent to her knees   did we wake you .  shall we leave .     leave .  who is it .  bayta .  no  no  stay .  aren t there chairs .  i saw them     his finger pointed vaguely .   toran pushed two ahead of him .  bayta sat down and took one of the psychologist s flaccid hands in hers .   may we talk to you  doctor .   she rarely used the title .    is something wrong .   a little sparkle returned to his abstracted eyes .  his sagging cheeks regained a touch of color .   is something wrong .    bayta said   captain pritcher has been here .  let me talk  torie .  you remember captain pritcher  doctor .     yes    yes     his fingers pinched his lips and released them .   tall man .  democrat .     yes  he .  he s discovered the mule s mutation .  he was here  doctor  and told us .     but that is nothing new .  the mule s mutation is straightened out .   in honest astonishment   haven t i told you .  have i forgotten to tell you .     forgotten to tell us what .   put in toran  quickly .    about the mule s mutation  of course .  he tampers with emotions .  emotional control .  i haven t told you .  now what made me forget .   slowly  he sucked in his under lip and considered .   then  slowly  life crept into his voice and his eyelids lifted wide  as though his sluggish brain had slid onto a well greased single track .  he spoke in a dream  looking between the two listeners rather than at them .   it is really so simple .  it requires no specialized knowledge .  in the mathematics of psychohistory  of course  it works out promptly  in a third level equation involving no more     never mind that .  it can be put into ordinary words     roughly     and have it make sense  which isn t usual with psychohistorical phenomena .    ask yourselves     what can upset hari seldon s careful scheme of history  eh .   he peered from one to the other with a mild  questioning anxiety .   what were seldon s original assumptions .  first  that there would be no fundamental change in human society over the next thousand years .    for instance  suppose there were a major change in the galaxy s technology  such as finding a new principle for the utilization of energy  or perfecting the study of electronic neurobiology .  social changes would render seldon s original equations obsolete .  but that hasn t happened  has it now .     or suppose that a new weapon were to be invented by forces outside the foundation  capable of withstanding all the foundation s armaments .  that might cause a ruinous deviation  though less certainly .  but even that hasn t happened .  the mule s nuclear field depressor was a clumsy weapon and could be countered .  and that was the only novelty he presented  poor as it was .    but there was a second assumption  a more subtle one .  seldon assumed that human reaction to stimuli would remain constant .  granted that the first assumption held true  then the second must have broken down .  some factor must be twisting and distorting the emotional responses of human beings or seldon couldn t have failed and the foundation couldn t have fallen .  and what factor but the mule .    am i right .  is there a flaw in the reasoning .    bayta s plump hand patted his gently .   no flaw  ebling .    mis was joyful  like a child .   this and more comes so easily .  i tell you i wonder sometimes what is going on inside me .  i seem to recall the time when so much was a mystery to me and now things are so clear .  problems are absent .  i come across what might be one  and somehow  inside me  i see and understand .  and my guesses  my theories seem always to be borne out .  there s a drive in me  .  .  .  always onward  .  .  .  so that i can t stop  .  .  .  and i don t want to eat or sleep  .  .  .  but always go on  .  .  .  and on  .  .  .  and on      his voice was a whisper  his wasted  blue veined hand rested tremblingly upon his forehead .  there was a frenzy in his eyes that faded and went out .   he said more quietly   then i never told you about the mule s mutant powers  did i .  but then  .  .  .  did you say you knew about it .     it was captain pritcher  ebling   said bayta .   remember .     he told you .   there was a tinge of outrage in his tone .   but how did he find out .     he s been conditioned by the mule .  he s a colonel now  a mule s man .  he came to advise us to surrender to the mule  and he told us     what you told us .     then the mule knows we re here .  i must hurry     where s magnifico .  isn t he with you .     magnifico s sleeping   said toran  impatiently .   it s past midnight  you know .     it is .  then     was i sleeping when you came in .     you were   said bayta decisively   and you re not going back to work  either .  you re getting into bed .  come on  torie  help me .  and you stop pushing at me  ebling  because it s just your luck i don t shove you under a shower first .  pull off his shoes  torie  and tomorrow you come down here and drag him out into the open air before he fades completely away .  look at you  ebling  you ll be growing cobwebs .  are you hungry .    ebling mis shook his head and looked up from his cot in a peevish confusion .   i want you to send magnifico down tomorrow   he muttered .   bayta tucked the sheet around his neck .   you ll have me down tomorrow  with washed clothes .  you re going to take a good bath  and then get out and visit the farm and feel a little sun on you .     i won t do it   said mis weakly .   you hear me .  i m too busy .    his sparse hair spread out on the pillow like a silver fringe about his head .  his voice was a confidential whisper .   you want that second foundation  don t you .    toran turned quickly and squatted down on the cot beside him .   what about the second foundation  ebling .    the psychologist freed an arm from beneath the sheet and his tired fingers clutched at toran s sleeve .   the foundations were established at a great psychological convention presided over by hari seldon .  toran  i have located the published minutes of that convention .  twenty five fat films .  i have already looked through various summaries .     well .     well  do you know that it is very easy to find from them the exact location of the first foundation  if you know anything at all about psychohistory .  it is frequently referred to  when you understand the equations .  but toran  nobody mentions the second foundation  there has been no reference to it anywhere .    toran s eyebrows pulled into a frown .   it doesn t exist .     of course it exists   cried mis  angrily   who said it didn t .  but there s less talk of it .  its significance     and all about it     are better hidden  better obscured .  don t you see .  it s the more important of the two .  it s the critical one  the one that counts .  and i ve got the minutes of the seldon convention .  the mule hasn t won yet      quietly  bayta turned the lights down .   go to sleep .    without speaking  toran and bayta made their way up to their own quarters .   the next day  ebling mis bathed and dressed himself  saw the sun of trantor and felt the wind of trantor for the last time .  at the end of the day he was once again submerged in the gigantic recesses of the library  and never emerged thereafter .   in the week that followed  life settled again into its groove .  the sun of neotrantor was a calm  bright star in trantor s night sky .  the farm was busy with its spring planting .  the university grounds were silent in their desertion .  the galaxy seemed empty .  the mule might never have existed .   bayta was thinking that as she watched toran light his cigar carefully and look up at the sections of blue sky visible between the swarming metal spires that encircled the horizon .    it s a nice day   he said .    yes  it is .  have you everything mentioned on the list  torie .     sure .  half pound butter  dozen eggs  string beans     got it all down here  bay .  i ll have it right .     good .  and make sure the vegetables are of the last harvest and not museum relics .  did you see magnifico anywhere  by the way .     not since breakfast .  guess he s down with ebling  watching a book film .     all right .  don t waste any time  because i ll need the eggs for dinner .    toran left with a backward smile and a wave of the hand .   bayta turned away as toran slid out of sight among the maze of metal .  she hesitated before the kitchen door  about faced slowly  and entered the colonnade leading to the elevator that burrowed down into the recesses .   ebling mis was there  head bent down over the eyepieces of the projector  motionless  a frozen  questing body .  near him sat magnifico  screwed up into a chair  eyes sharp and watching     a bundle of slatty limbs with a nose emphasizing his scrawny face .   bayta said softly   magnifico      magnifico scrambled to his feet .  his voice was an eager whisper .   my lady .     magnifico   said bayta   toran has left for the farm and won t be back for a while .  would you be a good boy and go out after him with a message that i ll write for you .     gladly  my lady .  my small services are but too eagerly yours  for the tiny uses you can put them to .    she was alone with ebling mis  who had not moved .  firmly  she placed her hand upon his shoulder .   ebling      the psychologist started  with a peevish cry   what is it .   he wrinkled his eyes .   is it you  bayta .  where s magnifico .     i sent him away .  i want to be alone with you for a while .   she enunciated her words with exaggerated distinctness .   i want to talk to you  ebling .    the psychologist made a move to return to his projector  but her hand on his shoulder was firm .  she felt the bone under the sleeve clearly .  the flesh seemed to have fairly melted away since their arrival on trantor .  his face was thin  yellowish  and bore a half week stubble .  his shoulders were visibly stooped  even in a sitting position .   bayta said   magnifico isn t bothering you  is he  ebling .  he seems to be down here night and day .     no  no  no .  not at all .  why  i don t mind him .  he is silent and never disturbs me .  sometimes he carries the films back and forth for me  seems to know what i want without my speaking .  just let him be .     very well     but  ebling  doesn t he make you wonder .  do you hear me  ebling .  doesn t he make you wonder .    she jerked a chair close to his and stared at him as though to pull the answer out of his eyes .   ebling mis shook his head .   no .  what do you mean .     i mean that colonel pritcher and you both say the mule can condition the emotions of human beings .  but are you sure of it .  isn t magnifico himself a flaw in the theory .    there was silence .   bayta repressed a strong desire to shake the psychologist .   what s wrong with you  ebling .  magnifico was the mule s clown .  why wasn t he conditioned to love and faith .  why should he  of all those in contact with the mule  hate him so .    but  .  .  .  but he was conditioned .  certainly  bay .   he seemed to gather certainty as he spoke .   do you suppose that the mule treats his clown the way he treats his generals .  he needs faith and loyalty in the latter  but in his clown he needs only fear .  didn t you ever notice that magnifico s continual state of panic is pathological in nature .  do you suppose it is natural for a human being to be as frightened as that all the time .  fear to such an extent becomes comic .  it was probably comic to the mule     and helpful  too  since it obscured what help we might have gotten earlier from magnifico .    bayta said   you mean magnifico s information about the mule was false .     it was misleading .  it was colored by pathological fear .  the mule is not the physical giant magnifico thinks .  he is more probably an ordinary man outside his mental powers .  but if it amused him to appear a superman to poor magnifico     the psychologist shrugged .   in any case  magnifico s information is no longer of importance .     what is  then .    but mis shook himself loose and returned to his projector .    what is  then .   she repeated .   the second foundation .    the psychologist s eyes jerked towards her .   have i told you anything about that .  i don t remember telling you anything .  i m not ready yet .  what have i told you .     nothing   said bayta  intensely .   oh  galaxy  you ve told me nothing  but i wish you would because i m deathly tired .  when will it be over .    ebling mis peered at her  vaguely rueful   well  now  my  .  .  .  my dear  i did not mean to hurt you .  i forget sometimes  .  .  .  who my friends are .  sometimes it seems to me that i must not talk of all this .  there s a need for secrecy     but from the mule  not from you  my dear .   he patted her shoulder with a weak amiability .   she said   what about the second foundation .    his voice was automatically a whisper  thin and sibilant .   do you know the thoroughness with which seldon covered his traces .  the proceedings of the seldon convention would have been of no use to me at a as little as a month ago  before this strange insight came .  even now  it seems     tenuous .  the papers put out by the convention are often apparently unrelated  always obscure .  more than once i wondered if the members of the convention  themselves  knew all that was in seldon s mind .  sometimes i think he used the convention only as a gigantic front  and single handed erected the structure       of the foundations .   urged bayta .    of the second foundation .  our foundation was simple .  but the second foundation was only a name .  it was mentioned  but if there was any elaboration  it was hidden deep in the mathematics .  there is still much i don t even begin to understand  but for seven days  the bits have been clumping together into a vague picture .    foundation number one was a world of physical scientists .  it represented a concentration of the dying science of the galaxy under the conditions necessary to make it live again .  no psychologists were included .  it was a peculiar distortion  and must have had a purpose .  the usual explanation was that seldon s psychohistory worked best where the individual working units     human beings     had no knowledge of what was coming  and could therefore react naturally to all situations .  do you follow me  my dear       yes  doctor .     then listen carefully .  foundation number two was a world of mental scientists .  it was the mirror image of our world .  psychology  not physics  was king .   triumphantly .   you see .     i don t .     but think  bayta  use your head .  hari seldon knew that his psychohistory could predict only probabilities  and not certainties .  there was always a margin of error  and as time passed that margin increases in geometric progression .  seldon would naturally guard as well as he could against it .  our foundation was scientifically vigorous .  it could conquer armies and weapons .  it could pit force against force .  but what of the mental attack of a mutant such as the mule .     that would be for the psychologists of the second foundation .   bayta felt excitement rising within her .    yes  yes  yes .  certainly .     but they have done nothing so far .     how do you know they haven t .    bayta considered that   i don t .  do you have evidence that they have .     no .  there are many factors i know nothing of .  the second foundation could not have been established full grown  any more than we were .  we developed slowly and grew in strength  they must have also .  the stars know at what stage their strength is now .  are they strong enough to fight the mule .  are they aware of the danger in the first place .  have they capable leaders .     but if they follow seldon s plan  then the mule must be beaten by the second foundation .     ah   and ebling mis s thin face wrinkled thoughtfully   is it that again .  but the second foundation was a more difficult job than the first .  its complexity is hugely greater  and consequently so is its possibility of error .  and if the second foundation should not beat the mule  it is bad     ultimately bad .  it is the end  may be  of the human race as we know it .     no .    yes .  if the mule s descendants inherit his mental powers     you see .  homo sapiens could not compete .  there would be a new dominant race     a new aristocracy     with homo sapiens demoted to slave labor as an inferior race .  isn t that so .     yes  that is so .     and even if by some chance the mule did not establish a dynasty  he would still establish a distorted new empire upheld by his personal power only .  it would die with his death  the galaxy would be left where it was before he came  except that there would no longer be foundations around which a real and healthy second empire could coalesce .  it would mean thousands of years of barbarism .  it would mean no end in sight .     what can we do .  can we warn the second foundation .     we must  or they may go under through ignorance  which we can not risk .  but there is no way of warning them .     no way .     i don t know where they are located .  they are  at the other end of the galaxy  but that is all  and there are millions of worlds to choose from .     but  ebling  don t they say .   she pointed vaguely at the films that covered the table .    no  they don t .  not where i can find it     yet .  the secrecy must mean something .  there must be a reason     a puzzled expression returned to his eyes .   but i wish you d leave .  i have wasted enough time  and it s growing short     it s growing short .    he tore away  petulant and frowning .   magnifico s soft step approached .   your husband is home  my lady .    ebling mis did not greet the clown .  he was back at his projector .   that evening toran  having listened  spoke   and you think he s really right  bay .  you think he isn t     he hesitated .    he is right  torie .  he s sick  i know that .  the change that s come over him  the loss in weight  the way he speaks     he s sick .  but as soon as the subject of the mule or the second foundation  or anything he is working on  comes up  listen to him .  he is lucid and clear as the sky of outer space .  he knows what he s talking about .  i believe him .     then there s hope .   it was half a question .    i  .  .  .  i haven t worked it out .  maybe .  maybe not .  i m carrying a blaster from now on .   the shiny barreled weapon was in her hand as she spoke .   just in case  torie  just in case .     in case what .    bayta laughed with a touch of hysteria   never mind .  maybe i m a little crazy  too     like ebling mis .    ebling mis at that time had seven days to live  and the seven days slipped by  one after the other  quietly .   to toran  there was a quality of stupor about them .  the warming days and the dull silence covered him with lethargy .  all life seemed to have lost its quality of action  and changed into an infinite sea of hibernation .   mis was a hidden entity whose burrowing work produced nothing and did not make itself known .  he had barricaded himself .  neither toran nor bayta could see him .  only magnifico s go between characteristics were evidence of his existence .  magnifico  grown silent and thoughtful  with his tiptoed trays of food and his still  watchful witness in the gloom .   bayta was more and more a creature of herself .  the vivacity died  the self assured competence wavered .  she  too  sought her own worried  absorbed company  and once toran bad come upon her  fingering her blaster .  she had put it away quickly  forced a smile .    what are you doing with it  bay .     holding it .  is that a crime .     you ll blow your fool head off .     then i ll blow it off .  small loss .    married life had taught toran the futility of arguing with a female in a dark brown mood .  he shrugged  and left her .   on the last day  magnifico scampered breathless into their presence .  he clutched at them  frightened .   the learned doctor calls for you .  he is not well .    and he wasn t well .  he was in bed  his eyes unnaturally large  unnaturally bright .  he was dirty  unrecognizable .    ebling .   cried bayta .    let me speak   croaked the psychologist  lifting his weight to a thin elbow with an effort .   let me speak .  i am finished  the work i pass on to you .  i have kept no notes  the scrap figures i have destroyed .  no other must know .  all must remain in your minds .     magnifico   said bayta  with rough directness .   go upstairs .    reluctantly  the clown rose and took a backward step .  his sad eyes were on mis .   mis gestured weakly   he won t matter  let him stay .  stay  magnifico .    the clown sat down quickly .  bayta gazed at the floor .   slowly  slowly  her lower lip caught in her teeth .   mis said  in a hoarse whisper   i am convinced the second foundation can win  if it is not caught prematurely by the mule .  it has kept itself secret  the secrecy must be upheld  it has a purpose .  you must go there  your information is vital  .  .  .  may make all the difference .  do you hear me .    toran cried in near agony   yes  yes .  tell us how to get there  ebling .  where is it .     i can tell you   said the faint voice .   he never did .   bayta  face frozen white  lifted her blaster and shot  with an echoing clap of noise .  from the waist upward  mis was not  and a ragged hole was in the wall behind .  from numb fingers  bayta s blaster dropped to the floor .          .  end of the search  there was not a word to be said .  the echoes of the blast rolled away into the outer rooms and rumbled downward into a hoarse  dying whisper .  before its death  it had muffled the sharp clamor of bayta s falling blaster  smothered magnifico s high pitched cry  drowned out toran s inarticulate roar .   there was a silence of agony .   bayta s head was bent into obscurity .  a droplet caught the light as it fell .  bayta had never wept since her childhood .   toran s muscles almost cracked in their spasm  but he did not relax     he felt as if he would never unclench his teeth again .  magnifico s face was a faded  lifeless mask .   finally  from between teeth still tight  toran choked out in an unrecognizable voice   you re a mule s woman  then .  he got to you .    bayta looked up  and her mouth twisted with a painful merriment   i  a mule s woman .  that s ironic .    she smiled     a brittle effort     and tossed her hair back .  slowly  her voice verged back to the normal  or something near it .   it s over  toran  i can talk now .  how much i will survive  i don t know .  but i can start talking      toran s tension had broken of its own weight and faded into a flaccid dullness   talk about what  bay .  what s there to talk about .     about the calamity that s followed us .  we ve remarked about it before  torie .  don t you remember .  how defeat has always bitten at our heels and never actually managed to nip us .  we were on the foundation  and it collapsed while the independent traders still fought     but we got out in time to go to haven .  we were on haven  and it collapsed while the others still fought     and again we got out in time .  we went to neotrantor  and by now it s undoubtedly joined the mule .    toran listened and shook his head   i don t understand .     torie  such things don t happen in real life .  you and i are insignificant people  we don t fall from one vortex of politics into another continuously for the space of a year     unless we carry the vortex with us .  unless we carry the source of infection with us .  now do you see .    toran s lips tightened .  his glance fixed horribly upon the bloody remnants of what had once been a human  and his eyes sickened .    let s get out of here  bay .  let s get out into the open .    it was cloudy outside .  the wind scudded about them in drab spurts and disordered bayta s hair .  magnifico had crept after them and now he hovered at the edge of their conversation .   toran said tightly   you killed ebling mis because you believed him to be the focus of infection .   something in her eyes struck him .  he whispered   he was the mule .   he did not     could not     believe the implications of his own words .   bayta laughed sharply   poor ebling the mule .  galaxy  no .  i couldn t have killed him if he were the mule .  he would have detected the emotion accompanying the move and changed it for me to love  devotion  adoration  terror  whatever he pleased .  no  i killed ebling because he was not the mule .  i killed him because he knew where the second foundation was  and in two seconds would have told the mule the secret .     would have told the mule the secret   toran repeated stupidly .   told the mule      and then he emitted a sharp cry  and turned to stare in horror at the clown  who might have been crouching unconscious there for the apparent understanding he had of what he heard .    not magnifico .   toran whispered the question .    listen .   said bayta .   do you remember what happened on neotrantor .  oh  think for yourself  torie      but he shook his head and mumbled at her .   she went on  wearily   a man died on neotrantor .  a man died with no one touching him .  isn t that true .  magnifico played on his visi sonor and when he was finished  the crown prince was dead .  now isn t that strange .  isn t it queer that a creature afraid of everything  apparently helpless with terror  has the capacity to kill at will .     the music and the light effects   said toran   have a profound emotional effect       yes  an emotional effect .  a pretty big one .  emotional effects happen to be the mule s specialty .  that  i suppose  can be considered a coincidence .  and a creature who can kill by suggestion is so full of fright .  well  the mule tampered with his mind  supposedly  so that can be explained .  but  toran  i caught a little of that visi sonor selection that killed the crown prince .  just a little     but it was enough to give me that same feeling of despair i had in the time vault and on haven .  toran  i can t mistake that particular feeling .    toran s face was darkening .   i  .  .  .  felt it  too .  i forgot .  i never thought       it was then that it first occurred to me .  it was just a vague feeling     intuition  if you like .  i had nothing to go on .  and then pritcher told us of the mule and his mutation  and it was clear in a moment .  it was the mule who had created the despair in the time vault  it was magnifico who had created the despair on neotrantor .  it was the same emotion .  therefore  the mule and magnifico were the same person .  doesn t it work out nicely  torie .  isn t it just like an axiom in geometry     things equal to the same thing are equal to each other .    she was at the edge of hysteria  but dragged herself back to sobriety by main force .  she continued   the discovery scared me to death .  if magnifico were the mule  he could know my emotions     and cure them for his own purposes .  i dared not let him know .  i avoided him .  luckily  he avoided me also  he was too interested in ebling mis .  i planned killing mis before he could talk .  i planned it secretly     as secretly as i could     so secretly i didn t dare tell it to myself .    if i could have killed the mule himself     but i couldn t take the chance .  he would have noticed  and i would have lost everything .    she seemed drained of emotion .   toran said harshly and with finality   it s impossible .  look at the miserable creature .  he the mule .  he doesn t even hear what we re saying .    but when his eyes followed his pointing finger  magnifico was erect and alert  his eyes sharp and darkly bright .  his voice was without a trace of an accent   i hear her  my friend .  it is merely that i have been sitting here and brooding on the fact that with all my cleverness and forethought i could make a mistake  and lose so much .    toran stumbled backward as if afraid the clown might touch him or that his breath might contaminate him .   magnifico nodded  and answered the unspoken question .   i am the mule .    he seemed no longer a grotesque  his pipestem limbs  his beak of a nose lost their humor compelling qualities .  his fear was gone  his bearing was firm .   he was in command of the situation with an ease born of usage .   he said  tolerantly   seat yourselves .  go ahead  you might as well sprawl out and make yourselves comfortable .  the game s over  and i d like to tell you a story .  it s a weakness of mine     i want people to understand me .    and his eyes as he looked at bayta were still the old  soft sad brown ones of magnifico  the clown .    there is nothing really to my childhood   he began  plunging bodily into quick  impatient speech   that i care to remember .  perhaps you can understand that .  my meagerness is glandular  my nose i was born with .  it was not possible for me to lead a normal childhood .  my mother died before she saw me .  i do not know my father .  i grew up haphazard  wounded and tortured in mind  full of self pity and hatred of others .  i was known then as a queer child .  all avoided me  most out of dislike  some out of fear .  queer incidents occurred     well  never mind .  enough happened to enable captain pritcher  in his investigation of my childhood to realize that i was a mutant  which was more than i ever realized until i was in my twenties .    toran and bayta listened distantly .  the wash of his voice broke over them  seated on the ground as they were  unheeded almost .  the clown     or the mule     paced before them with little steps  speaking downward to his own folded arms .    the whole notion of my unusual power seems to have broken on me so slowly  in such sluggish steps .  even toward the end  i couldn t believe it .  to me  men s minds are dials  with pointers that indicate the prevailing emotion .  it is a poor picture  but how else can i explain it .  slowly  i learned that i could reach into those minds and turn the pointer to the spot i wished  that i could nail it there forever .  and then it took even longer to realize that others couldn t .    but the consciousness of power came  and with it  the desire to make up for the miserable position of my earlier life .  maybe you can understand it .  maybe you can try to understand it .  it isn t easy to be a freak     to have a mind and an understanding and be a freak .  laughter and cruelty .  to be different .  to be an outsider .    you ve never been through it .    magnifico looked up to the sky and teetered on the balls of his feet and reminisced stonily   but i eventually did learn  and i decided that the galaxy and i could take turns .  come  they had had their innings  and i had been patient about it     for twenty two years .  my turn .  it would be up to the rest of you to take it .  and the odds would be fair enough for the galaxy .  one of me .  quadrillions of them .    he paused to glance at bayta swiftly .   but i had a weakness .  i was nothing in myself .  if i could gain power  it could only be by means of others .  success came to me through middlemen .  always .  it was as pritcher said .  through a pirate  i obtained my first asteroidal base of operations .  through an industrialist i got my first foothold on a planet .  through a variety of others ending with the warlord of kalgan  i won kalgan itself and got a navy .  after that  it was the foundation     and you two come into the story .    the foundation   he said  softly   was the most difficult task i had met .  to beat it  i would have to win over  break down  or render useless an extraordinary proportion of its ruling class .  i could have done it from scratch     but a short cut was possible  and i looked for it .  after all  if a strong man can lift five hundred pounds  it does not mean that he is eager to do so continuously .  my emotional control is not an easy task  i prefer not to use it  where not fully necessary .  so i accepted allies in my first attack upon the foundation .    as my clown  i looked for the agent  or agents  of the foundation that must inevitably have been sent to kalgan to investigate my humble self .  i know now it was han pritcher i was looking for .  by a stroke of fortune  i found you instead .  i am a telepath  but not a complete one  and  my lady  you were from the foundation .  i was led astray by that .  it was not fatal for pritcher joined us afterward  but it was the starting point of an error that was fatal .    toran stirred for the first time .  he spoke in an outraged tone   hold on  now .  you mean that when i outfaced that lieutenant on kalgan with only a stun pistol  and rescued you     that you had emotionally controlled me into it .   he was spluttering .   you mean i ve been tampered with all along .    a thin smile played on magnifico s face .   why not .  you don t think it s likely .  ask yourself then     would you have risked death for a strange grotesque you had never seen before  if you had been in your right mind .  i imagine you were surprised at events in cold after blood .     yes   said bayta  distantly   he was .  it s quite plain .     as it was   continued the mule   toran was in no danger .  the lieutenant had his own strict instructions to let us go .  so the three of us and pritcher went to the foundation     and see how my campaign shaped itself instantly .  when pritcher was court martialed and we were present  i was busy .  the military judges of that trial later commanded their squadrons in the war .  they surrendered rather easily  and my navy won the battle of horleggor  and other lesser affairs .    through pritcher  i met dr .  mis  who brought me a visi sonor  entirely of his own accord  and simplified my task immensely .  only it wasn t entirely of his own accord .    bayta interrupted   those concerts .  i ve been trying to fit them in .  now i see .     yes   said magnifico   the visi sonor acts as a focusing device .  in a way  it is a primitive device for emotional control in itself .  with it  i can handle people in quantity and single people more intensively .  the concerts i gave on terminus before it fell and haven before it fell contributed to the general defeatism .  i might have made the crown prince of neotrantor very sick without the visi sonor  but i could not have killed him .  you see .    but it was ebling mis who was my most important find .  he might have been     magnifico said it with chagrin  then hurried on   there is a special facet to emotional control you do not know about .  intuition or insight or hunch tendency  whatever you wish to call it  can be treated as an emotion .  at least  i can treat it so .  you don t understand it  do you .    he waited for no negative   the human mind works at low efficiency .  twenty percent is the figure usually given .  when  momentarily  there is a flash of greater power it is termed a hunch  or insight  or intuition .  i found early that i could induce a continual use of high brain efficiency .  it is a killing process for the person affected  but it is useful .  the nuclear field depressor which i used in the war against the foundation was the result of high pressuring a kalgan technician .  again i work through others .    ebling mis was the bull s eye .  his potentialities were high  and i needed him .  even before my war with the foundation had opened  i had already sent delegates to negotiate with the empire .  it was at that time i began my search for the second foundation .  naturally  i didn t find it .  naturally  i knew that i must find it     and ebling mis was the answer .  with his mind at high efficiency  he might possibly have duplicated the work of hari seldon .    partly  he did .  i drove him to the utter limit .  the process was ruthless  but had to be completed .  he was dying at the end  but he lived     again  his chagrin interrupted him .   he would have lived long enough .  together  we three could have gone onward to the second foundation .  it would have been the last battle     but for my mistake .    toran stirred his voice to hardness   why do you stretch it out so .  what was your mistake  and  .  .  .  and have done with your speech .     why  your wife was the mistake .  your wife was an unusual person .  i had never met her like before in my life .  i  .  .  .  i     quite suddenly  magnifico s voice broke .  he recovered with difficulty .  there was a grimness about him as he continued .   she liked me without my having to juggle her emotions .  she was neither repelled by me nor amused by me .  she liked me .    don t you understand .  can t you see what that would mean to me .  never before had anyone     well  i  .  .  .  cherished that .  my own emotions played me false  though i was master of all others .  i stayed out of her mind  you see  i did not tamper with it .  i cherished the natural feeling too greatly .  it was my mistake     the first .    you  toran  were under control .  you never suspected me  never questioned me  never saw anything peculiar or strange about me .  as for instance  when the  filian  ship stopped us .  they knew our location  by the way  because i was in communication with them  as i ve remained in communication with my generals at all times .  when they stopped us  i was taken aboard to adjust han pritcher  who was on it as a prisoner .  when i left  he was a colonel  a mule s man  and in command .  the whole procedure was too open even for you  toran .  yet you accepted my explanation of the matter  which was full of fallacies .  see what i mean .    toran grimaced  and challenged him   how did you retain communications with your generals .     there was no difficulty to it .  hyperwave transmitters are easy to handle and eminently portable .  nor could i be detected in a real sense .  anyone who did catch me in the act would leave me with a slice gapped out of his memory .  it happened  on occasion .    on neotrantor  my own foolish emotions betrayed me again .  bayta was not under my control  but even so might never have suspected me if i had kept my head about the crown prince .  his intentions towards bayta     annoyed me .    i killed him .  it was a foolish gesture .  an unobtrusive flight would have served as well .    and still your suspicions would not have been certainties  if i had stopped pritcher in his well intentioned babbling  or paid less attention to mis and more to you     he shrugged .    that s the end of it .   asked bayta .    that s the end .     what now  then .     i ll continue with my program .  that i ll find another as adequately brained and trained as ebling mis in these degenerate days  i doubt .  i shall have to search for the second foundation otherwise .  in a sense you have defeated me .    and now bayta was upon her feet  triumphant .   in a sense .  only in a sense .  we have defeated you entirely .  all your victories outside the foundation count for nothing  since the galaxy is a barbarian vacuum now .  the foundation itself is only a minor victory  since it wasn t meant to stop your variety of crisis .  it s the second foundation you must beat     the second foundation     and it s the second foundation that will defeat you .  your only chance was to locate it and strike it before it was prepared .  you won t do that now .  every minute from now on  they will be readier for you .  at this moment  at this moment  the machinery may have started .  you ll know     when it strikes you  and your short term of power will be over  and you ll be just another strutting conqueror  flashing quickly and meanly across the bloody face of history .    she was breathing hard  nearly gasping in her vehemence   and we ve defeated you  toran and i .  i am satisfied to die .    but the mule s sad  brown eyes were the sad  brown  loving eyes of magnifico .   i won t kill you or your husband .  it is  after all  impossible for you two to hurt me further  and killing you won t bring back ebling mis .  my mistakes were my own  and i take responsibility for them .  your husband and yourself may leave .  go in peace  for the sake of what i call     friendship .    then  with a sudden touch of pride   and meanwhile i am still the mule  the most powerful man in the galaxy .  i shall still defeat the second foundation .    and bayta shot her last arrow with a firm  calm certitude   you won t .  i have faith in the wisdom of seldon yet .  you shall be the last ruler of your dynasty  as well as the first .    something caught magnifico .   of my dynasty .  yes  i had thought of that  often .  that i might establish a dynasty .  that i might have a suitable consort .    bayta suddenly caught the meaning of the look in his eyes and froze horribly .   magnifico shook his head .   i sense your revulsion  but that s silly .  if things were otherwise  i could make you happy very easily .  it would be an artificial ecstasy  but there would be no difference between it and the genuine emotion .  but things are not otherwise .  i call myself the mule     but not because of my strength     obviously      he left them  never looking back .       about the author  isaac asimov was born in the soviet union to his great surprise .  he moved quickly to correct the situation .  when his parents emigrated to the united states  isaac  three years old at the time  stowed away in their baggage .  he has been an american citizen since the age of eight .   brought up in brooklyn  and educated in its public

then infiltrated boston university and climbed the academic ladder  ignoring all cries of outrage  until he found himself professor of biochemistry .   meanwhile  at the age of nine  he found the love of his life  in the inanimate sense  when he discovered his first science fiction magazine .  by the time he was eleven  he began to write stories  and at eighteen  he actually worked up the nerve to submit one .  it was rejected .  after four long months of tribulation and suffering  he sold his first story and  thereafter  he never looked back .   in       when he was twenty one years old  he wrote the classic short story  nightfall  and his future was assured .  shortly before that he had begun writing his robot stories  and shortly after that he had begun his foundation series .     what
