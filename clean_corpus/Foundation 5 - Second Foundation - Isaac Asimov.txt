of thousands of years .  it had included all the planets of the galaxy in a centralized rule  sometimes tyrannical  sometimes benevolent  always orderly .  human beings had forgotten that any other form of existence could be .   all except hari seldon .   hari seldon was the last great scientist of the first empire .  it was he who brought the science of psycho history to its full development .  psycho history was the quintessence of sociology  it was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations .   the individual human being is unpredictable  but the reactions of human mobs  seldon found  could be treated statistically .  the larger the mob  the greater the accuracy that could be achieved .  and the size of the human masses that seldon worked with was no less than the population of the galaxy which in his time was numbered in the quintillions .   it was seldon  then  who foresaw  against all common sense and popular belief  that the brilliant empire which seemed so strong was in a state of irremediable decay and decline .  he foresaw  or he solved his equations and interpreted its symbols  which amounts to the same thing  that left to itself  the galaxy would pass through a thirty thousand year period of misery and anarchy before a unified government would rise once more .   he set about to remedy the situation  to bring about a state of affairs that would restore peace and civilization in a single thousand of years .  carefully  he set up two colonies of scientists that he called  foundations .   with deliberate intention  he set them up  at opposite ends of the galaxy .   one foundation was set up in the full daylight of publicity .  the existence of the other  the second foundation  was drowned in silence .   in foundation  gnome        and foundation and empire  gnome        are told the first three centuries of the history of the first foundation .  it began as a small community of encyclopedists lost in the emptiness of the outer periphery of the galaxy .  periodically  it faced a crisis in which the variables of human intercourse  of the social and economic currents of the time constricted about it .  its freedom to move lay along only one certain line and when it moved in that direction  a new horizon of development opened before it .  all had been planned by hari seldon  long dead now .   the first foundation  with its superior science  took over the barbarized planets that surrounded it .  it faced the anarchic warlords that broke away from the dying empire and beat them .  it faced the remnant of the empire itself under its last strong emperor and its last strong general and beat it .   then it faced something which hari seldon could not foresee  the overwhelming power of a single human being  a mutant .  the creature known as the mule was born with the ability to mold men s emotions and to shape their minds .  his bitterest opponents were made into his devoted servants .  armies could not  would not fight him .  before him  the first foundation fell and seldon s schemes lay partly in ruins .   there was left the mysterious second foundation  the goal of all searches .  the mule must find it to make his conquest of the galaxy complete .  the faithful of what was left of the first foundation must find it for quite another reason .  but where was it .  that no one knew .   this  then  is the story of the search for the second foundation .                part i  search by the mule                  two men and the mule  the mule it was after the fall of the first foundation that the constructive aspects of the mule s regime took shape .  after the definite break up at the first galactic empire  it was he who first presented history with a unified volume at space truly imperial in scope .  the earlier commercial empire at the fallen foundation had been diverse and loosely knit  despite the impalpable backing at the predictions of psycho history .  it was not to be compared with the tightly controlled  union of worlds  under the mule  comprising as it did  one tenth the volume of the galaxy and one fifteenth of its population .  particularly during the era of the so called search .  .  .  .   encyclopedia galactica      all quotations from the encyclopedia galactica here reproduced are taken from the    th edition published in      f . e .  by the encyclopedia galactica publishing co .   terminus  with permission of the publishers .   there is much more that the encyclopedia has to say on the subject of the mule and his empire but almost all of it is not germane to the issue at immediate hand  and most of it is considerably too dry for our purposes in any case .  mainly  the article concerns itself at this point with the economic conditions that led to the rise of the  first citizen of the union      the mule s official title     and with the economic consequences thereof .   if  at any time  the writer of the article is mildly astonished at the colossal haste with which the mule rose from nothing to vast dominion in five years  he conceals it .  if he is further surprised at the sudden cessation of expansion in favor of a five year consolidation of territory  he hides the fact .   we therefore abandon the encyclopedia and continue on our own path for our own purposes and take up the history of the great interregnum     between the first and second galactic empires     at the end of that five years of consolidation .   politically  the union is quiet .  economically  it is prosperous .  few would care to exchange the peace of the mule s steady grip for the chaos that had preceded  on the worlds that five years previously had known the foundation  there might be a nostalgic regret  but no more .  the foundation s leaders were dead  where useless  and converted  where useful .   and of the converted  the most useful was han pritcher  now lieutenant general .   in the days of the foundation  han pritcher had been a captain and a member of the underground democratic opposition .  when the foundation fell to the mule without a fight  pritcher fought the mule .  until  that is  he was converted .   the conversion was not the ordinary one brought on by the power of superior reason .  han pritcher know that well enough .  he had been changed because the mule was a mutant with mental powers quite capable of adjusting the conditions of ordinary humans to suit himself .  but that satisfied him completely .  that was as it should be .  the very contentment with the conversion was a prime symptom of it  but han pritcher was no longer even curious about the matter .   and now that he was returning from his fifth major expedition into the boundlessness of the galaxy outside the union  it was with something approaching artless joy that the veteran spaceman and intelligence agent considered his approaching audience with the  first citizen .   his hard face  gouged out of a dark  grainless wood that did not seem to be capable of smiling without cracking  didn t show it     but the outward indications were unnecessary .  the mule could see the emotions within  down to the smallest  much as an ordinary man could see the twitch of an eyebrow .   pritcher left his air car at the old vice regal hangars and entered the palace grounds on foot as was required .  he walked one mile along the arrowed highway     which was empty and silent .  pritcher knew that over the square miles of palace grounds  there was not one guard  not one soldier  not one armed man .   the mule had need of no protection .   the mule was his own best  all powerful protector .   pritcher s footsteps beat softly in his own cars  as the palace reared its gleaming  incredibly light and incredibly strong metallic walls before him in the daring  overblown  near hectic arches that characterized the architecture of the late empire .  it brooded strongly over the empty grounds  over the crowded city on the horizon .   within the palace was that one man     by himself     on whose inhuman mental attributes depended the new aristocracy  and the whole structure of the union .   the huge  smooth door swung massively open at the general s approach  and he entered .  he stepped on to the wide  sweeping ramp that moved upward under him .  he rose swiftly in the noiseless elevator .  he stood before the small plain door of the mule s own room in the highest glitter of the palace spires .   it opened     bail channis was young  and bail channis was unconverted .  that is  in plainer language  his emotional make up had been unadjusted by the mule .  it remained exactly as it had been formed by the original shape of its heredity and the subsequent modifications of his environment .  and that satisfied him  too .   at not quite thirty  he was in marvelously good odor in the capital .  he was handsome and quick witted     therefore successful in society .  he was intelligent and self possessed     therefore successful with the mule .  and he was thoroughly pleased at both successes .   and now  for the first time  the mule had summoned him to personal audience .   his legs carried him down the long  glittering highway that led tautly to the sponge aluminum spires that had been once the residence of the viceroy of kalgan  who ruled under the old emperors  and that had been later the residence of the independent princes of kalgan  who ruled in their own name  and that was now the residence of the first citizen of the union  who ruled over an empire of his own .   channis hummed softly to himself .  he did not doubt what this was all about .  the second foundation  naturally .  that all embracing bogey  the mere consideration of which had thrown the mule back from his policy of limitless expansion into static caution .  the official term was      consolidation .    now there were rumors     you couldn t stop rumors .  the mule was to begin the offensive once more .  the mule had discovered the whereabouts of the second foundation  and would attack the mule had come to an agreement with the second foundation and divided the galaxy .  the mule had decided the second foundation did not exist and would take over all the galaxy .   no use listing all the varieties one heard in the anterooms .  it was not even the first time such rumors had circulated .  but now they seemed to have more body in them  and all the free  expansive souls who thrived on war  military adventure  and political chaos and withered in times of stability and stagnant peace were joyful .   bail channis was one of these .  he did not fear the mysterious second foundation .  for that matter  he did not fear the mule  and boasted of it .  some  perhaps  who disapproved of one at once so young and so well off  waited darkly for the reckoning with the gay ladies  man who employed his wit openly at the expense of the mule s physical appearance and sequestered life .  none dared join him and few dared laugh  but when nothing happened to him  his reputation rose accordingly .   channis was improvising words to the tune he was humming .  nonsense words with the recurrent refrain   second foundation threatens the nation and all of creation .    he was at the palace .   the huge  smooth door swung massively open at his approach and he entered .  he stepped on to the wide  sweeping ramp that moved upward under him .  he rose swiftly in the noiseless elevator .  he stood before the small plain door of the mule s own room in the highest glitter of the palace spires .   it opened     the man who had no name other than the mule  and no title other than first citizen looked out through the one way transparency of the wall to the light and lofty city on the horizon .   in the darkening twilight  the stars were emerging  and not one but owed allegiance to him .   he smiled with fleeting bitterness at the thought .  the allegiance they owed was to a personality few had ever seen .   he was not a man to look at  the mule     not a man to look at without derision .  not more than one hundred and twenty pounds was stretched out into his five foot eight length .  his limbs were bony stalks that jutted out of his scrawniness in graceless angularity .  and his thin face was nearly drowned out in the prominence of a fleshy beak that thrust three inches outward .   only his eyes played false with the general farce that was the mule .  in their softness     a strange softness for the galaxy s greatest conqueror     sadness was never entirely subdued .   in the city was to be found all the gaiety of a luxurious capital on a luxurious world .  he might have established his capital on the foundation  the strongest of his now conquered enemies  but it was far out on the very rim of the galaxy .  kalgan  more centrally located  with a long tradition as aristocracy s playground  suited him better     strategically .   but in its traditional gaiety  enhanced by unheard of prosperity  he found no peace .   they feared him and obeyed him and  perhaps  even respected him     from a goodly distance .  but who could look at him without contempt .  only those he had converted .  and of what value was their artificial loyalty .  it lacked flavor .  he might have adopted titles  and enforced ritual and invented elaborations  but even that would have changed nothing .  better     or at least  no worse     to be simply the first citizen     and to hide himself .   there was a sudden surge of rebellion within him     strong and brutal .  not a portion of the galaxy must be denied him  for five years he had remained silent and buried here on kalgan because of the eternal  misty  space ridden menace of the unseen  unheard  unknown second foundation .  he was thirty two .  not old     but he felt old .  his body  whatever its mutant mental powers  was physically weak .   every star .  every star he could see     and every star he couldnt see .  it must all be his .   revenge on all .  on a humanity of which he wasn t a part .  on a galaxy in which he didn t fit .   the cool  overhead warning light flickered .  he could follow the progress of the man who had entered the palace  and simultaneously  as though his mutant sense had been enhanced and sensitized in the lonely twilight  he felt the wash of emotional content touch the fibers of his brain .   he recognized the identity without an effort .  it was pritcher .   captain pritcher of the one time foundation .  the captain pritcher who had been ignored and passed over by the bureaucrats of that decaying government .  the captain pritcher whose job as petty spy he had wiped out and whom he had lifted from its slime .  the captain pritcher whom he had made first colonel and then general  whose scope of activity he had made galaxywide .   the now general pritcher who was  iron rebel though he began  completely loyal .  and yet with all that  not loyal because of benefits gained  not loyal out of gratitude  not loyal as a fair return     but loyal only through the artifice of conversion .   the mule was conscious of that strong unalterable surface layer of loyalty and love that colored every swirl and eddy of the emotionality of han pritcher     the layer he had himself implanted five years before .  far underneath there were the original traces of stubborn individuality  impatience of rule  idealism     but even he  himself  could scarcely detect them any longer .   the door behind him opened  and he turned .  the transparency of the wall faded to opacity  and the purple evening light gave way to the whitely blazing glow of atomic power .   han pritcher took the seat indicated .  there was neither bowing  nor kneeling nor the use of honorifics in private audiences with the mule .  the mule was merely  first citizen .   he was addressed as  sir .   you sat in his presence  and you could turn your back on him if it so happened that you did .   to han pritcher this was all evidence of the sure and confident power of the man .  he was warmly satisfied with it .   the mule said   your final report reached me yesterday .  i can t deny that i find it somewhat depressing  pritcher .    the general s eyebrows closed upon each other   yes  i imagine so     but i don t see to what other conclusions i could have come .  there just isn t any second foundation  sir .    arid the mule considered and then slowly shook his head  as he had done many a time before   there s the evidence of ebling mis .  there is always the evidence of ebling mis .    it was not a new story .  pritcher said without qualification   mis may have been the greatest psychologist of the foundation  but he was a baby compared to hari seldon .  at the time he was investigating seldon s works  he was under the artificial stimulation of your own brain control .  you may have pushed him too far .  he might have been wrong .  sir  he must have been wrong .    the mule sighed  his lugubrious face thrust forward on its thin stalk of a neck .   if only he had lived another minute .  he was on the point of telling me where the second foundation was .  he knew  i m telling you .  i need not have retreated .  i need not have waited and waited .  so much time lost .  five years gone for nothing .    pritcher could not have been censorious over the weak longing of his ruler  his controlled mental make up forbade that .  he was disturbed instead  vaguely uneasy .  he said   but what alternative explanation can there possibly be  sir .  five times i ve gone out .  you yourself have plotted the routes .  and i ve left no asteroid unturned .  it was three hundred years ago that hari seldon of the old empire supposedly established two foundations to act as nuclei of a new empire to replace the dying old one .  one hundred years after seldon  the first foundation     the one we know so well     was known through all the periphery .  one hundred fifty years after seldon     at the time of the last battle with the old empire     it was known throughout the galaxy .  and now it s three hundred years     and where should this mysterious second be .  in no eddy of the galactic stream has it been heard of .     ebling mis said it kept itself secret .  only secrecy can turn its weakness to strength .     secrecy as deep as this is past possibility without nonexistence as well .    the mule looked up  large eyes sharp and wary .   no .  it does exist .   a bony finger pointed sharply .   there is going to be a slight change in tactics .    pritcher frowned .   you plan to leave yourself .  i would scarcely advise it .     no  of course not .  you will have to go out once again     one last time .  but with another in joint command .    there was a silence  and pritcher s voice was hard   who  sir .     there s a young man here in kalgan .  bail channis .     i ve never heard of him  sir .     no  i imagine not .  but he s got an agile mind  he s ambitious     and he s not converted .    pritcher s long jaw trembled for a bare instant   i fail to see the advantage in that .     there is one  pritcher .  you re a resourceful and experienced man .  you have given me good service .  but you are converted .  your motivation is simply an enforced and helpless loyalty to myself .  when you lost your native motivations  you lost something  some subtle drive  that i cannot possibly replace .     i don t feel that  sir   said pritcher grimly .   i recall myself quite well as i was in the days when i was an enemy of yours .  i feel none the inferior .     naturally not   and the mule   s mouth twitched into a smile .   your judgment in this matter is scarcely objective .  this channis  now  is ambitious     for himself .  he is completely trustworthy     out of no loyalty but to himself .  he knows that it is on my coattails that he rides and he would do anything to increase my power that the ride might be long and far and that the destination might be glorious .  if he goes with you  there is just that added push behind his seeking     that push for himself .     then   said pritcher .  still insistent   why not remove my own conversion  if you think that will improve me .  i can scarcely be mistrusted  now .     that never  pritcher .  while you are within arm s reach  or blaster reach  of myself  you will remain firmly held in conversion .  if i were to release you this minute  i would be dead the next .    the general s nostrils flared .   i am hurt that you should think so .     i don t mean to hurt you  but it is impossible for you to realize what your feelings would be if free to form themselves along the lines of your natural motivation .  the human mind resents control .  the ordinary human hypnotist cannot hypnotize a person against his will for that reason .  i can  because i m not a hypnotist  and  believe me  pritcher  the resentment that you cannot show and do not even know you possess is something i wouldn t want to face .    pritcher s head bowed .  futility wrenched him and left him gray and haggard inside .  he said with an effort   but how can you trust this man .  i mean  completely     as you can trust me in my conversion .     well  i suppose i can t entirely .  that is why you must go with him .  you see  pritcher   and the mule buried himself in the large armchair against the soft back of which he looked like an angularly animated toothpick   if he should stumble on the second foundation     if it should occur to him that an arrangement with them might be more profitable than with me     you understand .    a profoundly satisfied light blazed in pritcher s eyes .   that is better  sir .     exactly .  but remember  he must have a free rein as far as possible .     certainly .     and  .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  pritcher .  the young man is handsome  pleasant and extremely charming .  don t let him fool you .  he s a dangerous and unscrupulous character .  don t get in his way unless you re prepared to meet him properly .  that s all .    the mule was alone again .  he let the lights die and the wall before him kicked to transparency again .  the sky was purple now  and the city was a smudge of light on the horizon .   what was it all for .  and if he were the master of all there was     what then .  would it really stop men like pritcher .  from being straight and tall  self confident  strong .  would bail channis lose his looks .  would he himself be other than he was .   he cursed his doubts .  what was he really after .   the cool  overhead warning light flickered .  he could follow the progress of the man who had entered the palace and  almost against his will  he felt the soft wash of emotional content touch the fibers of his brain .   he recognized the identity without an effort .  it was channis .  here the mule saw no uniformity  but the primitive diversity of a strong mind  untouched and unmolded except by the manifold disorganizations of the universe .  it writhed in floods and waves .  there was caution on the surface  a thin  smoothing effect  but with touches of cynical ribaldry in the hidden eddies of it .  and underneath there was the strong flow of self interest and self love  with a gush of cruel humor here and there  and a deep  still pool of ambition underlying all .   the mule felt that he could reach out and dam the current  wrench the pool from its basin and turn it in another course  dry up one flow and begin another .  but what of it .  if he could bend channis    curly head in the profoundest adoration  would that change his own grotesquerie that made him shun the day and love the night  that made him a recluse inside an empire that was unconditionally big .   the door behind him opened  and he turned .  the transparency of the wall faded to opacity  and the darkness gave way to the whitely blazing artifice of atomic power .   bail channis sat down lightly and said   this is a not quite unexpected honor  sir .    the mule rubbed his proboscis with all four fingers at once and sounded a bit irritable in his response .   why so  young man .     a hunch  i suppose .  unless i want to admit that i ve been listening to rumors .     rumors .  which one of the several dozen varieties are you referring to .     those that say a renewal of the galactic offensive is being planned .  it is a hope with me that such is true and that i might play an appropriate part .     then you think there is a second foundation .     why not .  it would make things so much more interesting .     and you find interest in it as well .     certainly .  in the very mystery of it .  what better subject could you find for conjecture .  the newspaper supplements are full of nothing else lately     which is probably significant .  the cosmos had one of its feature writers compose a weirdie about a world consisting of beings of pure mind     the second foundation  you see     who had developed mental force to energies large enough to compete with any known to physical science .  spaceships could be blasted light years away  planets could be turned out of their orbits      interesting .  yes .  but do you have any notions on the subject .  do you subscribe to this mind power notion .     galaxy  no .  do you think creatures like that would stay on their own planet .  no  sir .  i think the second foundation remains hidden because it is weaker than we think .     in that case  i can explain myself very easily .  how would you like to head an expedition to locate the second foundation .    for a moment channis seemed caught up by the sudden rush of events at just a little greater speed than he was prepared for .  his tongue had apparently skidded to a halt in a lengthening silence .   the mule said dryly   well .    channis corrugated his forehead .   certainly .  but where am i to go .  have you any information available .     general pritcher will be with you       then i m not to head it .     judge for yourself when i m done .  listen  you re not of the foundation .  you re a native of kalgan  aren t you .  yes .  well  then  your knowledge of the seldon plan may be vague .  when the first galactic empire was falling  hari seldon and a group of psychohistorians  analyzing the future course of history by mathematical tools no longer available in these degenerate times  set up two foundations  one at each end of the galaxy  in such a way that the economic and sociological forces that were slowly evolving  would make them serve as foci for the second empire .  hari seldon planned on a thousand years to accomplish that     and it would have taken thirty thousand without the foundations .  but he couldn t count on me .  i am a mutant and i am unpredictable by psychohistory which can only deal with the average reactions of numbers .  do you understand .     perfectly  sir .  but how does that involve me .     you ll understand shortly .  i intend to unite the galaxy now     and reach seldon s thousand year goal in three hundred .  one foundation     the world of physical scientists     is still flourishing  under me .  under the prosperity and order of the union  the atomic weapons they have developed are capable of dealing with anything in the galaxy     except perhaps the second foundation .  so i must know more about it .  general pritcher is of the definite opinion that it does not exist at all .  i know otherwise .    channis said delicately   how do you know  sir .    and the mule s words were suddenly liquid indignation   because minds under my control have been interfered with .  delicately .  subtly .  but not so subtly that i couldn t notice .  and these interferences are increasing  and hitting valuable men at important times .  do you wonder now that a certain discretion has kept me motionless these years .    that is your importance .  general pritcher is the best man left me  so he is no longer safe .  of course  he does not know that .  but you are unconverted and therefore not instantly detectable as a mule s man .  you may fool the second foundation longer than one of my own men would     perhaps just sufficiently longer .  do you understand .     um m m .  yes .  but pardon me  sir  if i question you .  how are these men of yours disturbed  so that i might detect change in general pritcher  in case any occurs .  are they unconverted again .  do they become disloyal .     no .  i told you it was subtle .  it s more disturbing than that  because its harder to detect and sometimes i have to wait before acting  uncertain whether a key man is being normally erratic or has been tampered with .  their loyalty is left intact  but initiative and ingenuity are rubbed out .  i m left with a perfectly normal person  apparently  but one completely useless .  in the last year  six have been so treated .  six of my best .   a corner of his mouth lifted .   they re in charge of training bases now     and my most earnest wishes go with them that no emergencies come up for them to decide upon .     suppose  sir  .  .  .  suppose it were not the second foundation .  what if it were another  such as yourself     another mutant .     the planning is too careful  too long range .  a single man would be in a greater hurry .  no  it is a world  and you are to be my weapon against it .    channis  eyes shone as he said   i m delighted at the chance .    but the mule caught the sudden emotional upwelling .  he said   yes  apparently it occurs to you  that you will perform a unique service  worthy of a unique reward     perhaps even that of being my successor .  quite so .  but there are unique punishments  too  you know .  my emotional gymnastics are not confined to the creation of loyalty alone .    and the little smile on his thin lips was grim  as channis leaped out of his seat in horror .   for just an instant  just one  flashing instant  channis had felt the pang of an overwhelming grief close over him .  it had slammed down with a physical pain that had blackened his mind unbearably  and then lifted .  now nothing was left but the strong wash of anger .   the mule said   anger won t help  .  .  .  yes  you re covering it up now  aren t you .  but i can see it .  so just remember     that sort of business can be made more intense and kept up .  i ve killed men by emotional control  and there s no death crueler .    he paused   that s all .    the mule was alone again .  he let the lights die and the wall before him kicked to transparency again .  the sky was black  and the rising body of the galactic lens was spreading its bespanglement across the velvet depths of space .   all that haze of nebula was a mass of stars so numerous that they melted one into the other and left nothing but a cloud of light .   and all to be his     and now but one last arrangement to make  and he could sleep .       first interlude  the executive council of the second foundation was in session .  to us they are merely voices .  neither the exact scene of the meeting nor the identity of those present are essential at the point .   nor  strictly speaking  can we even consider an exact reproduction of any part of the session     unless we wish to sacrifice completely even the minimum comprehensibility we have a right to expect .   we deal here with psychologists     and not merely psychologists .  let us say  rather  scientists with a psychological orientation .  that is  men whose fundamental conception of scientific philosophy is pointed in an entirely different direction from all of the orientations we know .  the  psychology  of scientists brought up among the axioms deduced from the observational habits of physical science has only the vaguest relationship to psychology .   which is about as far as i can go in explaining color to a blind man     with myself as blind as the audience .   the point being made is that the minds assembled understood thoroughly the workings of each other  not only by general theory but by the specific application over a long period of these theories to particular individuals .  speech as known to us was unnecessary .  a fragment of a sentence amounted almost to long winded redundancy .  a gesture  a grunt  the curve of a facial line     even a significantly timed pause yielded informational juice .   the liberty is taken  therefore  of freely translating a small portion of the conference into the extremely specific word combinations necessary to minds oriented from childhood to a physical science philosophy  even at the risk of losing the more delicate nuances .   there was one  voice  predominant  and that belonged to the individual known simply as the first speaker .   he said   it is apparently quite definite now as to what stopped the mule in his first mad rush .  i can t say that the matter reflects credit upon  .  .  .  well  upon the organization of the situation .  apparently  he almost located us  by means of the artificially heightened brain energy of what they call a  psychologist  on the first foundation .  this psychologist was killed just before he could communicate his discovery to the mule .  the events leading to that killing were completely fortuitous for all calculations below phase three .  suppose you take over .    it was the fifth speaker who was indicated by an inflection of the voice .  he said  in grim nuances   it is certain that the situation was mishandled .  we are  of course  highly vulnerable under mass attack  particularly an attack led by such a mental phenomenon as the mule .  shortly after he first achieved galactic eminence with the conquest of the first foundation  half a year after to be exact  he was on trantor .  within another half year he would have been here and the odds would have been stupendously against us        .   plus or minus   .     to be exact .  we have spent considerable time analyzing the forces that stopped him .  we know  of course  what was driving him on so in the first place .  the internal ramifications of his physical deformity and mental uniqueness are obvious to all of us .  however  it was only through penetration to phase three that we could determine     after the fact     tbe possibility of his anomalous action in the presence of another human being who had an honest affection for him .    and since such an anomalous action would depend upon the presence of such another human being at the appropriate time  to that extent the whole affair was fortuitous .  our agents are certain that it was a girl that killed the mule s psychologist     a girl for whom the mule felt trust out of sentiment  and whom he  therefore  did not control mentally     simply because she liked him .    since that event     and for those who want the details  a mathematical treatment of the subject has been drawn up for the central library     which warned us  we have held the mule off by unorthodox methods with which we daily risk seidon s entire scheme of history .  that is all .    the first speaker paused an instant to allow the individuals assembled to absorb the full implications .  he said   the situation is then highly unstable .  with seldon s original scheme bent to the fracture point     and i must emphasize that we have blundered badly in this whole matter  in our horrible lack of foresight     we are faced with an irreversible breakdown of the plan .  time is passing us by .  i think there is only one solution left us     and even that is risky .    we must allow the mule to find us     in a sense .    another pause  in which he gathered the reactions  then   i repeat     in a sense .           two men without the mule  the ship was in near readiness .  nothing lacked  but the destination .  the mule had suggested a return to trantor     the world that was the bulk of an incomparable galactic metropolis of the hugest empire mankind had ever known     the dead world that had been capital of all the stars .   pritcher disapproved .  it was an old path     sucked dry .   he found bail channis in the ship s navigation room .  the young man s curly hair was just sufficiently disheveled to allow a single curl to droop over the forehead     as if it had been carefully placed there     and even teeth showed in a smile that matched it .  vaguely  the stiff officer felt himself harden against the other .   channis  excitement was evident   pritcher  it s too far a coincidence .    the general said coldly   i   m not aware of the subject of conversation .     oh    well  then drag up a chair  old man  and let   s get into it .  i ve been going over your notes .  i find them excellent .     how  .  .  .  pleasant that you do .     but i   m wondering if you ve come to the conclusions i have .  have you ever tried analyzing the problem deductively .  i mean  it s all very well to comb the stars at random  and to have done all you did in five expeditions is quite a bit of star hopping .  that s obvious .  but have you calculated how long it would take to go through every known world at this rate .     yes .  several times   pritcher felt no urge to meet the young man halfway  but there was the importance of filching the other s mind     the other s uncontrolled  and hence  unpredictable  mind .    well  then  suppose we re analytical about it and try to decide just what we re looking for .     the second foundation   said pritcher  grimly .    a foundation of psychologists   corrected channis   who are is weak in physical science as the first foundation was weak in psychology .  well  you re from the first foundation  which i m not .  the implications are probably obvious to you .  we must find a world which rules by virtue of mental skills  and yet which is very backwards scientifically .     is that necessarily so .   questioned pritcher  quietly .   our own    union of worlds  isn t backwards scientifically  even though our ruler owes his strength to his mental powers .     because he has the skills of the first foundation to draw upon   came the slightly impatient answer   and that is the only such reservoir of knowledge in the galaxy .  the second foundation must live among the dry crumbs of the broken galactic empire .  there are no pickings there .     so then you postulate mental power sufficient to establish their rule over a group of worlds and physical helplessness as well .     comparative physical helplessness .  against the decadent neighboring areas  they are competent to defend themselves .  against the resurgent forces of the mule  with his background of a mature atomic economy  they cannot stand .  else  why is their location so well hidden  both at the start by the founder  hari seldon  and now by themselves .  your own first foundation made no secret of its existence and did not have it made for them  when they were an undefended single city on a lonely planet three hundred years ago .    the smooth lines of pritcher s dark face twitched sardonically .   and now that you ve finished your deep analysis  would you like a list of all the kingdoms  republics  planet states and dictatorships of one sort or another in that political wilderness out there that correspond to your description and to several factors besides .     all this has been considered then .   channis lost none of his brashness .    you won t find it here  naturally  but we have a completely worked out guide to the political units of the opposing periphery .  really  did you suppose the mule would work entirely hit and miss .     well  then  and the young man s voice rose in a burst of energy   what of the oligarchy of tazenda .    pritcher touched his ear thoughtfully   tazenda .  oh  i think i know it .  they re not in the periphery  are they .  it seems to me they re fully a third of the way towards the center of the galaxy .     yes .  what of that .     the records we have place the second foundation at the other end of the galaxy .  space knows it s the only thing we have to go on .  why talk of tazenda anyway .  its angular deviation from the first foundation radian is only about one hundred ten to one hundred twenty degrees anyway .  nowhere near one hundred eighty .     there s another point in the records .  the second foundation was established at  star s end .      no such region in the galaxy has ever been located .     because it was a local name  suppressed later for greater secrecy .  or maybe one invented for the purpose by seldon and his group .  yet there s some relationship between  star s end  and  tazenda     don t you think .     a vague similarity in sound .  insufficient .     have you ever been there .     no .     yet it is mentioned in your records .     where .  oh  yes  but that was merely to take on food and water .  there was certainly nothing remarkable about the world .     did you land at the ruling planet .  the center of government .     i couldn t possibly say .    channis brooded about it under the other s cold gaze .  then   would you look at the lens with me for a moment .     certainly .    the lens was perhaps the newest feature of the interstellar cruisers of the day .  actually  it was a complicated calculating machine which could throw on a screen a reproduction of the night sky as seen from any given point of the galaxy .   channis adjusted the co ordinate points and the wall lights of the pilot room were extinguished .  in the dim red light at the control board of the lens  channis  face glowed ruddily .  pritcher sat in the pilot seat  long legs crossed  face lost in the gloom .   slowly  as the induction period passed  the points of light brightened on the screen .  and then they were thick and bright with the generously populated star groupings of the galaxy s center .    this   explained channis   is the winter night sky as seen from trantor .  that is the important point that  as far as i know  has been neglected so far in your search .  all intelligent orientation must start from trantor as zero point .  trantor was the capital of the galactic empire .  even more so scientifically and culturally  than politically .  and  therefore  the significance of any descriptive name should stem  nine times out of ten  from a trantorian orientation .  you ll remember in this connection that  although seldon was from helicon  towards the periphery  his group worked on trantor itself .     what is it you re trying to show me .   pritcher s level voice plunged icily into the gathering enthusiasm of the other .    the map will explain it .  do you see the dark nebula .   the shadow of his arm fell upon the screen  which took on the bespanglement of the galaxy .  the pointing finger ended on a tiny patch of black that seemed a hole in the speckled fabric of light .   the stellagraphical records call it pelot s nebula .  watch it .  i m going to expand the image .    pritcher had watched the phenomenon of lens image expansion before but he still caught his breath .  it was like being at the visiplate of a spaceship storming through a horribly crowded galaxy without entering hyperspace .  the stars diverged towards them from a common center  flared outwards and tumbled off the edge of the screen .  single points became double  then globular .  hazy patches dissolved into myriad points .  and always that illusion of motion .   channis spoke through it all   you ll notice that we are moving along the direct line from trantor to pelot s nebula  so that in effect we are still looking at a stellar orientation equivalent to that of trantor .  there is probably a slight error because of the gravitic deviation of light that i haven t the math to calculate for  but i m sure it can t be significant .    the darkness was spreading over the screen .  as the rate of magnification slowed  the stars slipped off the four ends of the screen in a regretful leave taking .  at the rims of the growing nebula  the brilliant universe of stars shone abruptly in token for that light which was merely hidden behind the swirling unradiating atom fragments of sodium and calcium that filled cubic parsecs of space .   and channis pointed again   this has been called  the mouth  by the inhabitants of that region of space .  and that is significant because it is only from the trantorian orientation that it looks like a mouth .   what he indicated was a rift in the body of the nebula  shaped like a ragged  grinning mouth in profile  outlined by the glazing glory of the starlight with which it was filled .    follow the mouth .    said channis .   follow  the mouth  towards the gullet as it narrows down to a thin  splintering line of light .   again the screen expanded a trifle  until the nebula stretched away from  the mouth  to block off all the screen but that narrow trickle and channis  finger silently followed it down  to where it straggled to a halt  and then  as his finger continued moving onward  to a spot where one single star sparked lonesomely  and there his finger halted  for beyond that was blackness  unrelieved .     star s end    said the young man  simply .   the fabric of the nebula is thin there and the light of that one star finds its way through in just that one direction     to shine on trantor .     you re tying to tell me that     the voice of the mule s general died in suspicion .    i m not trying .  that is tazenda     star s end .    the lights went on .  the lens flicked off .  pritcher reached channis in three long strides   what made you think of this .    and channis leaned back in his chair with a queerly puzzled expression on his face .   it was accidental .  i d like to take intellectual credit for this  but it was only accidental .  in any case  however it happens  it fits .  according to our references  tazenda is an oligarchy .  it rules twenty seven inhabited planets .  it is not advanced scientifically .  and most of all  it is an obscure world that has adhered to a strict neutrality in the local politics of that stellar region  and is not expansionist .  i think we ought to see it .     have you informed the mule of this .     no .  nor shall we .  we re in space now  about to make the first hop .    pritcher  in sudden horror  sprang to the visiplate .  cold space met his eyes when he adjusted it .  he gazed fixedly at the view  then turned .  automatically  his hand reached for the hard  comfortable curve of the butt of his blaster .    by whose order .     by my order  general     it was the first time channis had ever used the other s title     while i was engaging you here .  you probably felt no acceleration  because it came at the moment i was expanding the field of the lens and you undoubtedly imagined it to be an illusion of the apparent star motion .     why .  just what are you doing .  what was the point of your nonsense about tazenda  then .     that was no nonsense .  i was completely serious .  we re going there .  we left today because we were scheduled to leave three days from now .  general  you don t believe there is a second foundation  and i do .  you are merely following the mule s orders without faith  i recognize a serious danger .  the second foundation has now had five years to prepare .  how they ve prepared  i don t know  but what if they have agents on kalgan .  if i carry about in my mind the knowledge of the whereabouts of the second foundation  they may discover that .  my life might be no longer safe  and i have a great affection for my life .  even on a thin and remote possibility such as that  i would rather play safe .  so no one knows of tazenda but you  and you found out only after we were out in space .  and even so  there is the question of the crew .   channis was smiling again  ironically  in obviously complete control of the situation .   pritcher s hand fell away from his blaster  and for a moment a vague discomfort pierced him .  what kept him from action .  what deadened him .  there was a time when he was a rebellious and unpromoted captain of the first foundation s commercial empire  when it would have been himself rather than channis who would have taken prompt and daring action such as that .  was the mule right .  was his controlled mind so concerned with obedience as to lose initiative .  he felt a thickening despondency drive him down into a strange lassitude .   he said   well done .  however  you will consult me in the future before making decisions of this nature .    the flickering signal caught his attention .    that s the engine room   said channis  casually .   they warmed up on five minutes  notice and i asked them to let me know if there was any trouble .  want to hold the fort .    pritcher nodded mutely  and cogitated in the sudden loneliness on the evils of approaching fifty .  the visiplate was sparsely starred .  the main body of the galaxy misted one end .  what if he were free of the mule s influence     but he recoiled in horror at the thought .   chief engineer huxlani looked sharply at the young  ununiformed man who carried himself with the assurance of a fleet officer and seemed to be in a position of authority .  huxlani  as a regular fleet man from the days his chin had dripped milk  generally confused authority with specific insignia .   but the mule had appointed this man  and the mule was  of course  the last word .  the only word for that matter .  not even subconsciously did he question that .  emotional control went deep .   he handed channis the little oval object without a word .   channis hefted it  and smiled engagingly .    you re a foundation man  aren t you  chief .     yes  sir .  i served in the foundation fleet eighteen years before the first citizen took over .     foundation training in engineering .     qualified technician  first class     central school on anacreon .     good enough .  and you found this on the communication circuit  where i asked you to look .     yes  sir .     does it belong there .     no  sir .     then what is it .     a hypertracer  sir .     that s not enough .  i m not a foundation man .  what is it .     it s a device to allow the ship to be traced through hyperspace .     in other words we can be followed anywhere .     yes  sir .     all right .  it s a recent invention  isn t it .  it was developed by one of the research institutes set up by the first citizen  wasn t it .     i believe so  sir .     and its workings are a government secret .  right .     i  believe so  sir .     yet here it is .  intriguing .    channis tossed the hypertracer methodically from hand to hand for a few seconds .  then  sharply  he held it out   take it  then  and put it back exactly where you found it and exactly how you found it .  understand .  and then forget this incident .  entirely .    the chief choked down his near automatic salute  turned sharply and left .   the ship bounded through the galaxy  its path a wide spaced dotted line through the stars .  the dots  referred to  were the scant stretches of ten to sixty light seconds spent in normal space and between them stretched the hundred and up light year gaps that represented the  hops  through hyperspace .   bail channis sat at the control panel of the lens and felt again the involuntary surge of near worship at the contemplation of it .   he was not a foundation man and the interplay of forces at the twist of a knob or the breaking of a contact was not second nature to him .   not that the lens ought quite to bore even a foundation man .  within its unbelievably compact body were enough electronic circuits to pin  point accurately a hundred million separate stars in exact relationship to each other .  and as if that were not a feat in itself  it was further capable of translating any given portion of the galactic field along any of the three spatial axes or to rotate any portion of the field about a center .   it was because of that  that the lens had performed a near revolution in interstellar travel .  in the younger days of interstellar travel  the calculation of each  hop  through hyperspace meant any amount of work from a day to a week     and the larger portion of such work was the more or less precise calculation of  ship s position  on the galactic scale of reference .  essentially that meant the accurate observation of at least three widely spaced stars  the position of which  with reference to the arbitrary galactic triple zero  were known .   and it is the word  known   that is the catch .  to any who know the star field well from one certain reference point  stars are as individual as people .  jump ten parsecs  however  and not even your own sun is recognizable .  it may not even be visible .   the answer was  of course  spectroscopic analysis .  for centuries  the main object of interstellar engineering was the analysis of the  light signature  of more and more stars in greater and greater detail .  with this  and the growing precision of the  hop  itself  standard routes of travel through the galaxy were adopted and interstellar travel became less of an art and more of a science .   and yet  even under the foundation with improved calculating machines and a new method of mechanically scanning the star field for a known  light signature   it sometimes took days to locate three stars and then calculate position in regions not previously familiar to the pilot .   it was the lens that changed all that .  for one thing it required only a single known star .  for another  even a space tyro such as channis could operate it .   the nearest sizable star at the moment was vincetori  according to  hop  calculations  and on the visiplate now  a bright star was centered .  channis hoped that it was vincetori .   the field screen of the lens was thrown directly next that of the visiplate and with careful fingers  channis punched out the co ordinates of vincetori .  he closed a relay  and the star field sprang to bright view .  in it  too  a bright star was centered  but otherwise there seemed no relationship .  he adjusted the lens along the z axis and expanded the field to where the photometer showed both centered stars to be of equal brightness .   channis looked for a second star  sizably bright  on the visiplate and found one on the field screen to correspond .  slowly  he rotated the screen to similar angular deflection .  he twisted his mouth and rejected the result with a grimace .  again he rotated and another bright star was brought into position  and a third .  and then he grinned .  that did it .  perhaps a specialist with trained relationship perception might have clicked first try  but he d settle for three .   that was the adjustment .  in the final step  the two fields overlapped and merged into a sea of not quite rightness .  most of the stars were close doubles .  but the fine adjustment did not take long .  the double stars melted together  one field remained  and the  ship s position  could now be read directly off the dials .  the entire procedure had taken less than half an hour .   channis found han pritcher in his private quarters .  the general was quite apparently preparing for bed .  he looked up .    news .     not particularly .  we   ll be at tazenda in another hop .     i know .     i don t want to bother you if you re turning in  but have you looked through the film we picked up in cil .    han pritcher cast a disparaging look at the article in question  where it lay in its black case upon his low bookshelf   yes .     and what do you think .     i think that if there was ever any science to history  it has been quite lost in this region of the galaxy .    channis grinned broadly   i know what you mean .  rather barren  isn t it .     not if you enjoy personal chronicles of rulers .  probably unreachable  i should say  in both directions .  where history concerns mainly personalities  the drawings become either black or white according to the interests of the writer .  i find it all remarkably useless .     but there is talk about tazenda .  that s the point i tried to make when i gave you the film .  it s the only one i could find that even mentioned them .     all right .  they have good rulers and bad .  they ve conquered a few planets  won some battles  lost a few .  there is nothing distinctive about them .  i don t think much of your theory  channis .     but you ve missed a few points .  didn t you notice that they never formed coalitions .  they always remained completely outside the politics of this corner of the star swarm .  as you say  they conquered a few planets  but then they stopped     and that without any startling defeat of consequence .  it s just as if they spread out enough to protect themselves  but not enough to attract attention .     very well   came the unemotional response .   i have no objection to landing .  at the worst     a little lost time .     oh  no .  at the worst     complete defeat .  if it is the second foundation .  remember it would be a world of space knows how many mules .     what do you plan to do .     land on some minor subject planet .  find out as much as we can about tazenda first  then improvise from that .     all right .  no objection .  if you don t mind now  i would like the light out .    channis left with a wave of his hand .   and in the darkness of a tiny room in an island of driving metal lost in the vastness of space  general han pritcher remained awake  following the thoughts that led him through such fantastic reaches .   if everything he had so painfully decided were true     and how all the facts were beginning to fit     then tazenda was the second foundation .  there was no way out .  but how .  how .   could it be tazenda .  an ordinary world .  one without distinction .  a slum lost amid the wreckage of an empire .  a splinter among the fragments .  he remembered  as from a distance  the mule s shriveled face and his thin voice as he used to speak of the old foundation psychologist  ebling mis  the one man who had     maybe     learned the secret of the second foundation .   pritcher recalled the tension of the mule s words   it was as if astonishment had overwhelmed mis .  it was as though something about the second foundation had surpassed all his expectations  had driven in a direction completely different from what he might have assumed .  if i could only have read his thoughts rather than his emotions .  yet the emotions were plain     and above everything else was this vast surprise .    surprise was the keynote .  something supremely astonishing .  and now came this boy  this grinning youngster  glibly joyful about tazenda and its undistinguished subnormality .  and he had to be right .  he had to .  otherwise  nothing made sense .   pritcher s last conscious thought had a touch of grimness .  that hypertracer along the etheric tube was still there .  he had checked it one hour back  with channis well out of the way .       second interlude  it was a casual meeting in the anteroom of the council chamber     just a few moments before passing into the chamber to take up the business of the day     and the few thoughts flashed back and forth quickly .    so the mule is on his way .     that s what i hear  too .  risky .  mighty risky .     not if affairs adhere to the functions set up .     the mule is not an ordinary man     and it is difficult to manipulate his chosen instruments without detection by him .  the controlled minds are difficult to touch .  they say he s caught on to a few cases .     yes  i don t see how that can be avoided .     uncontrolled minds are easier .  but so few are in positions of authority under him      they entered the chamber .  others of the second foundation followed them .          two men and a peasant  rossem is one of those marginal worlds usually neglected in galactic history and scarcely ever obtruding itself upon the notice of men of the myriad happier planets .   in the latter days of the galactic empire  a few political prisoners had inhabited its wastes  while an observatory and a small naval garrison served to keep it from complete desertion .  later  in the evil days of strife  even before the time of hari seldon  the weaker sort of men  tired of the periodic decades of insecurity and danger  weary of sacked planets and a ghostly succession of ephemeral emperors making their way to the purple for a few wicked  fruitless years     these men fled the populated centers and sought shelter in the barren nooks of the galaxy .   along the chilly wastes of rossem  villages huddled .  its sun was a small ruddy niggard that clutched its dribble of heat to itself  while snow beat thinly down for nine months of the year .  the tough native grain lay dormant in the soil those snow filled months  then grew and ripened in almost panic speed  when the sun s reluctant radiation brought the temperature to nearly fifty .   small  goatlike animals cropped the grasslands  kicking the thin snow aside with tiny  tri hooved feet .   the men of rossem had  thus  their bread and their milk     and when they could spare an animal     even their meat .  the darkly ominous forests that gnarled their way over half of the equatorial region of the planet supplied a tough  fine grained wood for housing .  this wood  together with certain furs and minerals  was even worth exporting  and the ships of the empire came at times and brought in exchange farm machinery  atomic heaters  even televisor sets .  the last was not really incongruous  for the long winter imposed a lonely hibernation upon the peasant .   imperial history flowed past the peasants of rossem .  the trading ships might bring news in impatient spurts  occasionally new fugitives would arrive     at one time  a relatively large group arrived in a body and remained     and these usually had news of the galaxy .   it was then that the rossemites learned of sweeping battles and decimated populations or of tyrannical emperors and rebellious viceroys .  and they would sigh and shake their heads  and draw their fur collars closer about their bearded faces as they sat about the village square in the weak sun and philosophized on the evil of men .   then after a while  no trading ships arrived at all  and life grew harder .  supplies of foreign  soft food  of tobacco  of machinery stopped .  vague word from scraps gathered on the televisor brought increasingly disturbing news .  and finally it spread that trantor had been sacked .  the great capital world of all the galaxy  the splendid  storied  unapproachable and incomparable home of the emperors had been despoiled and ruined and brought to utter destruction .   it was something inconceivable  and to many of the peasants of rossem  scratching away at their fields  it might well seem that the end of the galaxy was at hand .   and then one day not unlike other days a ship arrived again .  the old men of each village nodded wisely and lifted their old eyelids to whisper that thus it had been in their father s time     but it wasn t  quite .   this ship was not an imperial ship .  the glowing spaceship and sun of the empire was missing from its prow .  it was a stubby affair made of scraps of older ships     and the men within called themselves soldiers of tazenda .   the peasants were confused .  they had not heard of tazenda  but they greeted the soldiers nevertheless in the traditional fashion of hospitality .  the newcomers inquired closely as to the nature of the planet  the number of its inhabitants  the number of its cities     a word mistaken by the peasants to mean  villages  to the confusion of all concerned     its type of economy and so on .   other ships came and proclamations were issued all over the world that tazenda was now the ruling world  that tax collecting stations would be established girdling the equator     the inhabited region     that percentages of grain and furs according to certain numerical formulae would be collected annually .   the rossemites had blinked solemnly  uncertain of the word  taxes .   when collection time came  many had paid  or had stood by in confusion while the uniformed  other wordlings loaded the harvested corn and the pelts on to the broad ground cars .   here and there indignant peasants banded together and brought out ancient hunting weapons     but of this nothing ever came .  grumblingly they had disbanded when the men of tazenda came and with dismay watched their hard struggle for existence become harder .   but a new equilibrium was reached .  the tazendian governor lived dourly in the village of gentri  from which all rossemites were barred .  he and the officials under him were dim otherworld beings that rarely impinged on the rossemite ken .  the tax farmers  rossemites in the employ of tazenda  came periodically  but they were creatures of custom now     and the peasant had learned how to hide his grain and drive his cattle into the forest  and refrain from having his hut appear too ostentatiously prosperous .  then with a dull  uncomprehending expression he would greet all sharp questioning as to his assets by merely pointing at what they could see .   even that grew less  and taxes decreased  almost as if tazenda wearied of extorting pennies from such a world .   trading sprang up and perhaps tazenda found that more profitable .  the men of rossem no longer received in exchange the polished creations of the empire  but even tazendian machines and tazendian food was better than the native stuff .  and there were clothes for the women of other than gray home spun  which was a very important thing .   so once again  galactic history glided past peacefully enough  and the peasants scrabbied life out of the hard soil .   narovi blew into his beard as he stepped out of his cottage .   the first snows were sifting across the hard ground and the sky was a dull  overcast pink .  he squinted carefully upward and decided that no real storm was in sight .  he could travel to gentri without much trouble and get rid of his surplus grain in return for enough canned foods to last the winter .   he roared back through the door  which he opened a crack for the purpose   has the car been fed its fuel  yunker .    a voice shouted from within  and then narovi s oldest son  his short  red beard not yet completely outgrown its boyish sparseness  joined him .    the car   he said  sullenly   is fueled and rides well  but for the bad condition of the axles .  for that i am of no blame .  i have told you it needs expert repairs .    the old man stepped back and surveyed his son through lowering eyebrows  then thrust his hairy chin outward   and is the fault mine .  where and in what manner may i achieve expert repairs .  has the harvest then been anything but scanty for five years .  have my herds escaped the pest .  have the pelts climbed of themselves       narovi .   the well known voice from within stopped him in mid word .  he grumbled   well  well     and now your mother must insert herself into the affairs of a father and his son .  bring out the car  and see to it that the storage trailers are securely attached .    he pounded his gloved hands together  and looked upward again .  the dimly ruddy clouds were gathering and the gray sky that showed in the rifts bore no warmth .  the sun was hidden .   he was at the point of looking away  when his dropping eyes caught and his finger almost automatically rose on high while his mouth fell open in a shout  in complete disregard of the cold air .    wife   he called vigorously   old woman     come here .    an indignant head appeared at a window .  the woman s eyes followed his finger  gaped .  with a cry  she dashed down the wooden stairs  snatching up an old wrap and a square of linen as she went .  she emerged with the linen wrapped insecurely over her head and ears  and the wrap dangling from her shoulders .   she snuffled   it is a ship from outer space .    and narovi remarked impatiently   and what else could it be .  we have visitors  old woman  visitors .    the ship was sinking slowly to a landing on the bare frozen field in the northern portions of narovi s farm .    but what shall we do .   gasped the woman .   can we offer these people hospitality .  is the dirt floor of our hovel to be theirs and the pickings of last week s hoecake .     shall they then go to our neighbors .   narovi purpled past the crimson induced by the cold and his arms in their sleek fur covering lunged out and seized the woman s brawny shoulders .    wife of my soul   he purred   you will take the two chairs from our room downstairs  you will see that a fat youngling is slaughtered and roasted with tubers  you will bake a fresh hoecake .  i go now to greet these men of power from outer space  .  .  .  and  .  .  .  and     he paused  placed his great cap awry  and scratched hesitantly .   yes  i shall bring my jug of brewed grain as well .  hearty drink is pleasant .    the woman s mouth had flapped idly during this speech .  nothing came out .  and when that stage passed  it was only a discordant screech that issued .   narovi lifted a finger   old woman  what was it the village elders said a se nnight since .  eh .  stir your memory .  the elders went from farm to farm     themselves .  imagine the importance of it .      to ask us that should any ships from outer space land  they were to be informed immediately on the orders of the governor .    and now shall i not seize the opportunity to win into the good graces of those in power .  regard that ship .  have you ever seen its like .  these men from the outer worlds are rich  great .  the governor himself sends such urgent messages concerning them that the elders walk from farm to farm in the cooling weather .  perhaps the message is sent throughout all rossem that these men are greatly desired by the lords of tazenda     and it is on my farm that they are landing .    he fairly hopped for anxiety   the proper hospitality now     the mention of my name to the governor     and what may not be ours .    his wife was suddenly aware of the cold biting through her thin house clothing .  she leaped towards the door  shouting over her shoulders   leave then quickly .    but she was speaking to a man who was even then racing towards the segment of the horizon against which the ship sank .   neither the cold of the world  nor its bleak  empty spaces worried general han pritcher .  nor the poverty of their surroundings  nor the perspiring peasant himself .   what did bother him was the question of the wisdom of their tactics .  he and channis were alone here .   the ship  left in space  could take care of itself in ordinary circumstances  but still  he felt unsafe .  it was channis  of course  who was responsible for this move .  he looked across at the young man and caught him winking cheerfully at the gap in the furred partition  in which a woman s peeping eyes and gaping mouth momentarily appeared .   channis  at least  seemed completely at ease .  that fact pritcher savored with a vinegary satisfaction .  his game had not much longer to proceed exactly as he wished it .  yet  meanwhile their wrist ultrawave sender receivers were their only connection with the ship .   and then the peasant host smiled enormously and bobbed his head several times and said in a voice oily with respect   noble lords  i crave leave to tell you that my eldest son     a good  worthy lad whom my poverty prevents from educating as his wisdom deserves     has informed me that the elders will arrive soon .  i trust your stay here has been as pleasant as my humble means     for i am poverty stricken  though a hard working  honest  and humble farmer  as anyone here will tell you     could afford .     elders .   said channis  lightly .   the chief men of the region here .     so they are  noble lords  and honest  worthy men all of them  for our entire village is known throughout rossem as a just and righteous spot     though living is hard and the returns of the fields and forests meager .  perhaps you will mention to the elders  noble lords  of my respect and honor for travelers and it may happen that they will request a new motor wagon for our household as the old one can scarcely creep and upon the remnant of it depends our livelihood .    he looked humbly eager and han pritcher nodded with thee properly aloof condescension required of the role of  noble  lords  bestowed upon them .    a report of your hospitality shall reach the ears of your elders .    pritcher seized the next moments of isolation to speak to the apparently half sleeping channis .    i am not particularly fond of this meeting of the elders   he said .   have you any thoughts on the subject .    channis seemed surprised .   no .  what worries you .     it seems we have better things to do than to become conspicuous here .    channis spoke hastily  in a low monotoned voice   it may be necessary to risk becoming conspicuous in our next moves .  we won t find the type of men we want  pritcher  by simply reaching out a hand into a dark bag and groping .  men who rule by tricks of the mind need not necessarily be men in obvious power .  in the first place  the psychologists of the second foundation are probably a very small minority of the total population  just as on your own first foundation  the technicians and scientists formed a minority .  the ordinary inhabitants are probably just that     very ordinary .  the psychologists may even be well hidden  and the men in the apparently ruling position  may honestly think they are the true masters .  our solution to that problem may be found here on this frozen lump of a planet .     i don t follow that at all .     why  see here  it s obvious enough .  tazenda is probably a huge world of millions or hundreds of millions .  how could we identify the psychologists among them and be able to report truly to the mule that we have located the second foundation .  but here  on this tiny peasant world and subject planet  an the tazendian rulers  our host informs us  are concentrated in their chief village of gentri .  there may be only a few hundred of them there  pritcher  and among them must be one or more of the men of the second foundation .  we will go there eventually  but let us see the elders first     it s a logical step on the way .    they drew apart easily  as their black bearded host tumbled into the room again  obviously agitated .    noble lords  the elders are arriving .  i crave leave to beg you once more to mention a word  perhaps  on my behalf     he almost bent double in a paroxysm of fawning .    we shall certainly remember you   said channis .   are these your elders .    they apparently were .  there were three .   one approached .  he bowed with a dignified respect and said   we are honored .  transportation has been provided  respected sirs  and we hope for the pleasure of your company at our meeting hall .        third interlude  the first speaker gazed wistfully at the night sky .  wispy clouds scudded across the faint stargleams .  space looked actively hostile .  it was cold and awful at best but now it contained that strange creature  the mule  and the very content seemed to darken and thicken it into ominous threat .   the meeting was over .  it had not been long .  there had been the doubts and questionings inspired by the difficult mathematical problem of dealing with a mental mutant of uncertain makeup .  all the extreme permutations had had to be considered .   were they even yet certain .  somewhere in this region of space     within reaching distance as galactic spaces go     was the mule .  what would he do .   it was easy enough to handle his men .  they reacted     and were reacting     according to plan .   but what of the mule himself .          two men and the elders  the elders of this particular region of rossem were not exactly what one might have expected .  they were not a mere extrapolation of the peasantry  older  more authoritative  less friendly .   not at all .   the dignity that had marked them at first meeting had grown in impression till it had reached the mark of being their predominant characteristic .   they sat about their oval table like so many grave and slow moving thinkers .  most were a trifle past their physical prime  though the few who possessed beards wore them short and neatly arranged .  still  enough appeared younger than forty to make it quite obvious that  elders  was a term of respect rather than entirely a literal description of age .   the two from outer space were at the head of the table and in the solemn silence that accompanied a rather frugal meal that seemed ceremonious rather than nourishing  absorbed the new  contrasting atmosphere .   after the meal and after one or two respectful remarks     too short and simple to be called speeches     had been made by those of the elders apparently held most in esteem  an informality forced itself upon the assembly .   it was as if the dignity of greeting foreign personages had finally given way to the amiable rustic qualities of curiosity and friendliness .   they crowded around the two strangers and the flood of questions came .   they asked if it were difficult to handle a spaceship  how many men were required for the job  if better motors could be made for their ground cars  if it was true that it rarely snowed on other worlds as was said to be the case with tazenda  how many people lived on their world  if it was as large as tazenda  if it was far away  how their clothes were woven and what gave them the metallic shimmer  why they did not wear furs  if they shaved every day  what sort of stone that was in pritcher s ring     the list stretched out .   and almost always the questions were addressed to pritcher as though  as the elder  they automatically invested him with the greater authority .  pritcher found himself forced to answer at greater and greater length .  it was like an immersion in a crowd of children .  their questions were those of utter and disarming wonder .  their eagerness to know was completely irresistible and would not be denied .   pritcher explained that spaceships were not difficult to handle and that crews varied with the size  from one to many  that the motors of their ground cars were unknown in detail to him but could doubtless be improved  that the climates of worlds varied almost infinitely  that many hundreds of millions lived on his world but that it was far smaller and more insignificant than the great empire of tazenda  that their clothes were woven of silicone plastics in which metallic luster was artificially produced by proper orientation of the surface molecules  and that they could be artificially heated so that furs were unnecessary  that they shaved every day  that the stone in his ring was an amethyst .  the list stretched out .  he found himself thawing to these naive provincials against his will .   and always as he answered there was a rapid chatter among the elders  as though they debated the information gained .  it was difficult to follow these inner discussions of theirs for they lapsed into their own accented version of the universal galactic language that  through long separation from the currents of living speech  had become archaic .   almost  one might say  their curt comments among themselves hovered on the edge of understanding  but just managed to elude the clutching tendrils of comprehension .   until finally channis interrupted to say   good sirs  you must answer us for a while  for we are strangers and would be very much interested to know all we can of tazenda .    and what happened then was that a great silence fell and each of the hitherto voluble elders grew silent .  their hands  which had been moving in such rapid and delicate accompaniment to their words as though to give them greater scope and varied shades of meaning  fell suddenly limp .  they stared furtively at one another  apparently quite willing each to let the other have all the floor .   pritcher interposed quickly   my companion asks this in friendliness  for the fame of tazenda fills the galaxy and we  of course  shall inform the governor of the loyalty and love of the elders of rossem .    no sigh of relief was heard but faces brightened .  an elder stroked his beard with thumb and forefinger  straightening its slight curl with a gentle pressure  and said   we are faithful servants of the lords of tazenda .    pritcher s annoyance at channis  bald question subsided .  it was apparent  at least  that the age that he had felt creeping over him of late had not yet deprived him of his own capacity for making smooth the blunders of others .   he continued   we do not know  in our far part of the universe  much of the past history of the lords of tazenda .  we presume they have ruled benevolently here for a long time .    the same elder who spoke before  answered .  in a soft  automatic way he had become spokesman .  he said   not the grandfather of the oldest can recall a time in which the lords were absent .     it has been a time of peace .     it has been a time of peace .   he hesitated .   the governor is a strong and powerful lord who would not hesitate to punish traitors .  none of us are traitors  of course .     he has punished some in the past  i imagine  as they deserve .    again hesitation   none here have ever been traitors  or our fathers or our fathers  fathers .  but on other worlds  there have been such  and death followed for them quickly .  it is not good to think of for we are humble men who are poor farmers and not concerned with matters of politics .    the anxiety in his voice  the universal concern in the eyes of all of them was obvious .   pritcher said smoothly   could you inform us as to how we can arrange an audience with your governor .    and instantly an element of sudden bewilderment entered the situation .   for after a long moment  the elder said   why  did you not know .  the governor will be here tomorrow .  he has expected you .  it has been a great honor for us .  we  .  .  .  we hope earnestly that you will report to him satisfactorily as to our loyalty to him .    pritcher s smile scarcely twitched .   expected us .    the elder looked wonderingly from one to the other .   why  .  .  .  it is now a week since we have been waiting for you .    their quarters were undoubtedly luxurious for the world .  pritcher had lived in worse .  channis showed nothing but indifference to externals .   but there was an element of tension between them of a different nature than hitherto .  pritcher  felt the time approaching for a definite decision and yet there was still the desirability of additional waiting .  to see the governor first would be to increase the gamble to dangerous dimensions and yet to win that gamble might multi double the winnings .  he felt a surge of anger at the slight crease between channis  eyebrows  the delicate uncertainty with which the young man s lower lip presented itself to an upper tooth .  he detested the useless play acting and yearned for an end to it .   he said   we seem to be anticipated .     yes   said channis  simply .    just that .  you have no contribution of greater pith to make .  we come here and find that the governor expects us .  presumably we shall find from the governor that tazenda itself expects us .  of what value then is our entire mission .    channis looked up  without endeavoring to conceal the weary note in his voice   to expect us is one thing  to know who we are and what we came for  is another .     do you expect to conceal these things from men of the second foundation .     perhaps .  why not .  are you ready to throw your hand in .  suppose our ship was detected in space .  is it unusual for a realm to maintain frontier observation posts .  even if we were ordinary strangers  we would be of interest .     sufficient interest for a governor to come to us rather than the reverse .    channis shrugged   we   ll have to meet that problem later .  let us see what this governor is like .    pritcher bared his teeth in a bloodless kind of scowl .  the situation was becoming ridiculous .   channis proceeded with an artificial animation   at least we know one thing .  tazenda is the second foundation or a million shreds of evidence are unanimously pointing the wrong way .  how do you interpret the obvious terror in which these natives hold tazenda .  i see no signs of political domination .  their groups of elders apparently meet freely and without interference of any sort .  the taxation they speak of doesn t seem at all extensive to me or efficiently carried through .  the natives speak much of poverty but seem sturdy and well fed .  the houses are uncouth and their villages rude  but are obviously adequate for the purpose .    in fact  the world fascinates me .  i have never seen a more forbidding one  yet i am convinced there is no suffering among the population and that their uncomplicated lives manage to contain a well balanced happiness lacking in the sophisticated populations of the advanced centers .     are you an admirer of peasant virtues  then .     the stars forbid .   channis seemed amused at the idea .   i merely point out the significance of all this .  apparently  tazenda is an efficient administrator     efficient in a sense far different from the efficiency of the old empire or of the first foundation  or even of our own union .  all these have brought mechanical efficiency to their subjects at the cost of more intangible values .  tazenda brings happiness and sufficiency .  don t you see that the whole orientation of their domination is different .  it is not physical  but psychological .     really .   pritcher  allowed himself irony .   and the terror with which the elders spoke of the punishment of treason by these kind hearted psychologist administrators .  how does that suit your thesis .     were they the objects of the punishment .  they speak of punishment only of others .  it is as if knowledge of punishment has been so well implanted in them that punishment itself need never be used .  the proper mental attitudes are so inserted into their minds that i am certain that not a tazendian soldier exists on the planet .  don t you see all this .     i   ll see perhaps   said pritcher  coldly   when i see the governor .  and what  by the way  if our mentalities are handled .    channis replied with brutal contempt   you should be accustomed to that .    pritcher whitened perceptibly  and  with an effort  turned away .  they spoke to one another no more that day .   it was in the silent windlessness of the frigid night  as he listened to the soft  sleeping motions of the other  that pritcher silently adjusted his wrist transmitter to the ultrawave region for which channis  was unadjustable and  with noiseless touches of his fingernail  contacted the ship .   the answer came in little periods of noiseless vibration that barely lifted themselves above the sensory threshold .   twice pritcher asked   any communications at all yet .    twice the answer came   none .  we wait always .    he got out of bed .  it was cold in the room and he pulled the furry blanket around him as he sat in the chair and stared out at the crowding stars so different in the brightness and complexity of their arrangement from the even fog of the galactic lens that dominated the night sky of his native periphery .   somewhere there between the stars was the answer to the complications that overwhelmed him  and he felt the yearning for that solution to arrive and end things .   for a moment he wondered again if the mule were right     if conversion had robbed him of the firm sharp edge of self reliance .  or was it simply age and the fluctuations of these last years .   he didn t really care .   he was tired .   the governor of rossem arrived with minor ostentation .  his only companion was the uniformed man at the controls of the ground car .   the ground car itself was of lush design but to pritcher it appeared inefficient .  it turned clumsily  more than once it apparently balked at what might have been a too rapid change of gears .  it was obvious at once from its design that it ran on chemical  and not on atomic  fuel .   the tazendian governor stepped softly on to the thin layer of snow and advanced between two lines of respectful elders .  he did not look at them but entered quickly .  they followed after him .   from the quarters assigned to them  the two men of the mule s union watched .  he     the governor     was thickset  rather stocky  short  unimpressive .   but what of that .   pritcher cursed himself for a failure of nerve .  his face  to be sure  remained icily calm .  there was no humiliation before channis     but he knew very well that his blood pressure had heightened and his throat had become dry .   it was not a case of physical fear .  he was not one of those dull witted  unimaginative men of nerveless meat who were too stupid ever to be afraid     but physical fear he could account for and discount .   but this was different .  it was the other fear .   he glanced quickly at channis .  the young man glanced idly at the nails of one hand and poked leisurely at some trifling unevenness .   something inside pritcher became vastly indignant .  what had channis to fear of mental handling .   pritcher caught a mental breath and tried to think back .  how had he been before the mule had converted him from the die hard democrat that he was .  it was hard to remember .  he could not place himself mentally .  he could not break the clinging wires that bound him emotionally to the mule .  intellectually  he could remember that he had once tried to assassinate the mule but not for all the straining he could endure  could he remember his emotions at the time .  that might be the self defense of his own mind  however  for at the intuitive thought of what those emotions might have been     not realizing the details  but merely comprehending the drift of it     his stomach grew queasy .   what if the governor tampered with his mind .   what if the insubstantial mental tendrils of a second foundationer insinuated itself down the emotional crevices of his makeup and pulled them apart and rejoined them .   there had been no sensation the first time .  there had been no pain  no mental jar     not even a feeling of discontinuity .  he had always loved the mule .  if there had ever been a time long before     as long before as five short years     when he had thought he hadn t loved him  that he had hated him     that was just a horrid illusion .  the thought of that illusion embarrassed him .   but there had been no pain .   would meeting the governor duplicate that .  would all that had gone before     all his service for the mule     all his life s orientation     join the hazy  other life dream that held the word  democracy .  the mule also a dream  and only to tazenda  his loyalty     sharply  he turned away .   there was that strong desire to retch .   and then channis  voice clashed on his ear   i think this is it  general .    pritcher turned again .  an elder had opened the door silently and stood with a dignified and calm respect upon the threshold .   he said   his excellency  governor of rossem  in the name of the lords of tazenda  is pleased to present his permission for an audience and request your appearance before him .     sure thing   and channis tightened his belt with a jerk and adjusted a rossemian hood over his head .   pritcher s jaw set .  this was the beginning of the real gamble .   the governor of rossem was not of formidable appearance .  for one thing  he was bareheaded  and his thinning hair  light brown  tending to gray  lent him mildness .  his bony eye ridges lowered at them  and his eyes  set in a fine network of surrounding wrinkles  seemed calculating  but his fresh cropped chin was soft and small and  by the universal convention of followers of the pseudoscience of reading character by facial bony structure  seemed  weak .    pritcher  avoided the eyes and watched the chin .  he didn t know whether that would be effective     if anything would be .   the governor s voice was high pitched  indifferent   welcome to tazenda .  we greet you in peace .  you have eaten .    his hand     long fingers  gnarled veins     waved almost regally at the u shaped table .   they bowed and sat down .  the governor sat at the outer side of the base of the u  they on the inner  along both arms sat the double row of silent elders .   the governor spoke in short  abrupt sentences     praising the food as tazendian importations     and it had indeed a quality different if  somehow  not so much better  than the rougher food of the elders     disparaging rossemian weather  referring with an attempt at casualness to the intricacies of space travel .   channis talked little .  pritcher not at all .   then it was over .  the small  stewed fruits were finished  the napkins used and discarded  and the governor leaned back .   his small eyes sparkled .    i have inquired as to your ship .  naturally  i would like to see that it receives due care and overhaul .  i am told its whereabouts are unknown .     true .   channis replied lightly .   we have left it in space .  it is a large ship  suitable for long journeys in sometimes hostile regions  and we felt that landing it here might give rise to doubts as to our peaceful intentions .  we preferred to land alone  unarmed .     a friendly act   commented the governor  without conviction .   a large ship  you say .     not a vessel of war  excellency .     ha  hum .  where is it you come from .     a small world of the santanni sector  your excellency .  it may be you are not aware of its existence for it lacks importance .  we are interested in establishing trade relationships .     trade  eh .  and what have you to sell .     machines of all sorts  excellency .  in return  food  wood  ores   ha  hum .   the governor seemed doubtful .   i know little these matters .  perhaps mutual profit may be arranged .  perhaps  after i have examined your credentials at length     for much information will be required by my government before matters may proceed  you understand     and after i have looked over your ship  it would be advisable for you to proceed to tazenda .    there was no answer to that  and the governor s attitude iced perceptibly .    it is necessary that i see your ship  however .    channis said distantly   the ship  unfortunately  is undergoing repairs at the moment .  if your excellency would not object giving us forty eight hours  it will be at your service .     i am not accustomed to waiting .    for the first time  pritcher met the glare of the other  eye to eye  and his breath exploded softly inside him .  for a moment  he had the sensation of drowning  but then his eyes tore away .   channis did not waver .  he said   the ship cannot be landed for forty eight hours  excellency .  we are here and unarmed .  can you doubt our honest intentions .    there was a long silence  and then the governor said gruffly   tell me of the world from which you come .    that was all .  it passed with that .  there was no more unpleasantness .  the governor  having fulfilled his official duty  apparently lost interest and the audience died a dull death .   and when it was all over  pritcher found himself back in their quarters and took stock of himself .   carefully     holding his breath     he  felt  his emotions .  certainly he seemed no different to himself  but would he feel any difference .  had he felt different after the mule s conversion .  had not everything seemed natural .  as it should have been .   he experimented .   with cold purpose  he shouted inside the silent caverns of his mind  and the shout was   the second foundation must be discovered and destroyed .    and the emotion that accompanied it was honest hate .  there was not as much as a hesitation involved in it .   and then it was in his mind to substitute the word  mule  for the phrase  second foundation  and his breath caught at the mere emotion and his tongue clogged .   so far  good .   but had he been handled otherwise     more subtly .  had tiny changes been made .  changes that he couldn t detect because their very existence warped his judgment .   there was no way to tell .   but he still felt absolute loyalty to the mule .  if that were unchanged  nothing else really mattered .   he turned his mind to action again .  channis was busy at his end of the room .  pritcher s thumbnail idled at his wrist communicator .   and then at the response that came he felt a wave of relief surge over him and leave him weak .   the quiet muscles of his face did not betray him  but inside he was shouting with joy     and when channis turned to face him  he knew that the farce was about over .       fourth interlude  the two speakers passed each other on the road and one stopped the other .    i have word from the first speaker .    there was a half apprehensive flicker in the other s eyes .   intersection point .     yes .  may we live to see the dawn .           one man and the mule  there was no sign in any of channis  actions that he was aware of any subtle change in the attitude of pritcher  and in their relations to each other .  he leaned back on the hard wooden bench and spread eagled his feet out in front of him .    what did you make of the governor .    pritcher shrugged   nothing at all .  he certainly seemed no mental genius to me .  a very poor specimen of the second foundation  if that s what he was supposed to be .     i don t think he was  you know .  i m not sure what to make of it .  suppose you were a second foundationer   channis grew thoughtful   what would you do .  suppose you had an idea of our purpose here .  how would you handle us .     conversion  of course .     like the mule .   channis looked up  sharply .   would we know if they had converted us .  i wonder    and what if they were simply psychologists  but very clever ones .     in that case  i d have us killed rather quickly .     and our ship .  no .   channis wagged a forefinger .   we re playing a bluff  pritcher  old man .  it can only be a bluff .  even if they have emotional control down pat  we     you and i     are only fronts .  it s the mule they must fight  and they re being just as careful of us as we are of them .  i m assuming that they know who we are .    pritcher  stared coldly   what do you intend doing .     wait .   the word was bitten off .   let them come to us .  they re worried  maybe about the ship  but probably about the mule .  they bluffed with the governor .  it didn t work .  we stayed pat .  the next person they ll send will be a second foundationer  and he   ll propose a deal of some sort .     and then .     and then we make the deal .     i don t think so .     because you think it will double cross the mule .  it won t .     no  the mule could handle your double crosses  any you could invent .  but i still don t think so .     because you think then we couldn t double cross the foundationers .     perhaps not .  but that   s not the reason .    channis let his glance drop to what the other held in his fist  and said grimly   you mean that s the reason .    pritcher cradled his blaster   that s right .  you are under arrest .     why .     for treason to the first citizen of the union .    channis  lips hardened upon one another   what s going on .     treason .  as i said .  and correction of the matter  on my part .     your proof .  or evidence  assumptions  daydreams .  are you mad .     no .  are you .  do you think the mule sends out unweaned youngsters on ridiculous swashbuckling missions for nothing .  it was queer to me at the time .  but i wasted time in doubting myself .  why should he send you .  because you smile and dress well .  because you re twenty eight .     perhaps because i can be trusted .  or aren t you in the market for logical reasons .     or perhaps because you can t be trusted .  which is logical enough  as it turns out .     are we matching paradoxes  or is this all a word game to see who can say the least in the most words .    and the blaster advanced  with pritcher after it .  he stood erect before the younger man   stand up .    channis did so  in no particular hurry  and felt the muzzle of the blaster touch his belt with no shrinking of the stomach muscles .   pritcher said   what the mule wanted was to find the second foundation .  he had failed and i had failed  and the secret that neither of us can find is a well hidden one .  so there was one outstanding possibility left     and that was to find a seeker who ready knew the hiding place .     is that i .     apparently it was .  i didn t know then  of course  but though my mind must be slowing  it still points in the right direction .  how easily we found star s end .  how miraculously you examined the correct field region of the lens from among an infinite number of possibilties .  and having done so  how nicely we observe just the correct point for observation .  you clumsy fool .  did you so underestimate me that no combination of impossible fortuties struck you as being too much for me to swallow .     you mean i ve been too successful .     too successful by half for any loyal man .     because the standards of success you set me were so low .    and the blaster prodded  though in the face that confront channis only the cold glitter of the eyes betrayed the growing anger   because you are in the pay of the second foundation .     pay .      infinite contempt .   prove that .     or under the mental influence .     without the mule s knowledge .  ridiculous .     with the mule s knowledge .  exactly my point  my you dullard .  with the mule s knowledge .  do you suppose else that you would be given a ship to play with .  you led us to the second foundation as you were supposed to do .     i thresh a kernel of something or other out of this immensity of chaff .  may i ask why i m supposed to be doing all this .  if were a traitor  why should i lead you to the second foundation .  why not hither and yon through the galaxy  skipping gaily  finding no more than you ever did .     for the sake of the ship .  and because the men of the second foundation quite obviously need atomic warfare for self defense .     you ll have to do better than that .  one ship won t mean thing to them  and if they think they ll learn science from it a build atomic power plants next year  they are very  very simple second foundationers  indeed .  on the order of simplicity as yourself  i should say .     you will have the opportunity to explain that to the mule .     we re going back to kalgan .     on the contrary .  we re staying here .  and the mule will join us in fifteen minutes     more or less .  do you think he hasn t followed us  my sharp witted  nimble minded lump of self admiration .  you have played the decoy well in reverse .  you may not have led our victims to us  but you have certainly led us to our victims .     may i sit down   said channis   and explain something to you in picture drawings .  please .     you will remain standing .    at that  i can say it as well standing .  you think the mule followed us because of the hypertracer on the communication circuit .    the blaster might have wavered .  channis wouldn t have sworn to it .  he said   you don t look surprised .  but i don t waste time doubting that you feel surprised .  yes  i knew about it .  and now  having shown you that i knew of something you didn t think i did  i ll tell you something you don t know  that i know you don t .     you allow yourself too many preliminaries  channis .  i should think your sense of invention was more smoothly greased .    there s on invention to this .  there have been traitors  of course  or enemy agents  if you prefer that term .  but the mule knew of that in a rather curious way .  it seems  you see  that some of his converted men had been tampered with .    the blaster did waver that time .  unmistakably .    i emphasize that  pritcher .  it was why he needed me .  i was an unconverted man .  didn t he emphasize to you that he needed an unconverted .  whether he gave you the real reason or not .     try something else  channis .  if i were against the mule  i d know it .   quietly  rapidly  pritcher was feeling his mind .  it felt the same .  it felt the same .  obviously the man was lying .    you mean you feel loyal to the mule .  perhaps .  loyalty wasn t tampered with .  too easily detectable  the mule said .  but how do you feel mentally .  sluggish .  since you started this trip  have you always felt normal .  or have you felt strange sometimes  as though you weren t quite yourself .  what are you trying to do  bore a hole through me without touching the trigger .    pritcher withdrew his blaster half an inch   what are you trying to say .     i say that you ve been tampered with .  you ve been handled .  you didn t see the mule install that hypertracer .  you didn t see anyone do it .  you just found it there  and assumed it was the mule  and ever since you ve been assuming he was following us .  sure  the wrist receiver you re wearing contacts the ship on a wave length mine isn t good for .  do you think i didn t know that .   he was speaking quickly now  angrily .  his cloak of indifference had dissolved into savagery .   but it s not the mule that s coming toward us from out there .  it s not the mule .     who  if not .     well  who do you suppose .  i found that hypertracer  the day we left .  but i didn t think it was the mule .  he had no reason for indirection at that point .  don t you see the nonsense of it .  if i were a traitor and he knew that  i could be converted as easily as you were  and he would have the secret of the location of the second foundation out of my mind without sending me half across the galaxy .  can you keep a secret from the mule .  and if i didn t know  then i couldn t lead him to it .  so why send me in either case .    obviously  that hypertracer must have been put there by an agent of the second foundation .  that s who s coming towards us now .  and would you have been fooled if your precious mind hadn t been tampered with .  what kind of normality have you that you imagine immense folly to be wisdom .  me bring a ship to the second foundation .  what would they do with a ship .    it s you they want  pritcher .  you know more about the union than anyone but the mule  and you re not dangerous to them while he is .  that   s why they put the direction of search into my mind .  of course  it was completely impossible for me to find tazenda by random searchings of the lens .  i knew that .  but i knew there was the second foundation after us  and i knew they engineered it .  why not play their game .  it was a battle of bluffs .  they wanted us and i wanted their location     and space take the one that couldn t outbluff the other .    but it s we that will lose as long as you hold that blaster on me .  and it obviously isn t your idea .  it s theirs .  give me the blaster  pritcher .  i know it seems wrong to you  but it isn t your mind speaking  it s the second foundation within you .  give me the blaster  pritcher  and we   ll face what s coming now  together .    pritcher  faced a growing confusion in horror .  plausibility .  could he be so wrong .  why this eternal doubt of himself .  why wasn t he sure .  what made channis sound so plausible .   plausibility .   or was it his own tortured mind fighting the invasion of the alien .   was he split in two .   hazily  he saw channis standing before him  hand outstretched     and suddenly  he knew he was going to give him the blaster .   and as the muscles of his arm were on the point of contracting in the proper manner to do so  the door opened  not hastily  behind him     and he turned .   there are perhaps men in the galaxy who can be confused for one another even by men at their peaceful leisure .  correspondingly  there may be conditions of mind when even unlikely pairs may be mis recognized .  but the mule rises above any combination of the two factors .   not all pritcher s agony of mind prevented the instantaneous mental flood of cool vigor that engulfed him .   physically  the mule could not dominate any situation .  nor did he dominate this one .   he was rather a ridiculous figure in his layers of clothing that thickened him past his normality without allowing him to reach normal dimensions even so .  his face was muffled and the usually dominant beak covered what was left in a cold red prominence .   probably as a vision of rescue  no greater incongruity could exist .   he said   keep your blaster  pritcher .    then he turned to channis  who had shrugged and seated himself   the emotional context here seems rather confusing and considerably in conflict .  what s this about someone other than myself following you .    pritcher intervened sharply   was a hypertracer placed upon our ship by your orders  sir .    the mule turned cool eyes upon him   certainly .  is it very likely that any organization in the galaxy other than the union of worlds would have access to it .     he said       well  he s here  general .  indirect quotation is not necessary .  have you been saying anything  channis .     yes .  but mistakes apparently  sir .  it has been my opinion that the tracer was put there by someone in the pay of the second foundation and that we had been led here for some purpose of theirs  which i was prepared to counter .  i was under the further impression that the general was more or less in their hands .     you sound as if you think so no longer .     i m afraid not .  or it would not have been you at the door .     well  then  let us thresh this out .   the mule peeled off the outer layers of padded  and electrically heated clothing .   do you mind if i sit down as well .  now     we are safe here and perfectly free of any danger of intrusion .  no native of this lump of ice will have any desire to approach this place .  i assure you of that   and there was a grim earnestness about his insistence upon his powers .   channis showed his disgust .   why privacy .  is someone going to serve tea and bring out the dancing girls .     scarcely .  what was this theory of yours  young man .  a second foundationer was tracing you with a device which no one but i have and     how did you say you found this place .     apparently  sir  it seems obvious  in order to account for known facts  that certain notions have been put into my head       by these same second foundationers .     no one else  i imagine .     then it did not occur to you that if a second foundationer could force  or entice  or inveigle you into going to the second foundation for purposes of his own     and i assume you imagined he used methods similar to mine  though  mind you  i can implant only emotions  not ideas     it did not occur to you that if he could do that there was little necessity to put a hypertracer on you .   and channis looked up sharply and met his sovereign s large eyes with sudden startle .  pritcher grunted and a visible relaxation showed itself in his shoulders .    no   said channis   that hadn t occurred to me .     or that if they were obliged to trace you  they couldn t feel capable of directing you  and that  undirected  you could have precious little chance of finding your way here as you did .  did that occur to you .     that  neither .     why not .  has your intellectual level receded to a so much greater than probable degree .     the only answer is a question  sir .  are you joining general pritcher in accusing me of being a traitor .     you have a defense in case i am .     only the one i presented to the general .  if i were a traitor and knew the whereabouts of the second foundation  you could convert me and learn the knowledge directly .  if you felt it necessary to trace me  then i hadn t the knowledge beforehand and wasn t a traitor .  so i answer your paradox with another .     then your conclusion .     that i am not a traitor .     to which i must agree  since your argument is irrefutable .     then may i ask you why you had us secretly followed .     because to all the facts there is a third explanation .  both you and pritcher explained some facts in your own individual ways  but not all .  i     if you can spare me the time     will explain all .  and in a rather short time  so there is little danger of boredom .  sit down  pritcher  and give me your blaster .  there is no danger of attack on us any longer .  none from in here and none from out there .  none in fact even from the second foundation .  thanks to you  channis .    the room was lit in the usual rossemian fashion of electrically heated wire .  a single bulb was suspended from the ceiling and in its dim yellow glow  the three cast their individual shadows .   the mule said   since i felt it necessary to trace channis  it was obvious i expect to gain something thereby .  since he went to the second foundation with a startling speed and directness  we can reasonably assume that that was what i was expecting to happen .  since i did not gain the knowledge from him directly  something must have been preventing me .  those are the facts .  channis  of course  knows the answer .  so do i .  do you see it  pritcher .    and pritcher said doggedly   no  sir .     then i   ll explain .  only one kind of man can both know the location of the second foundation and prevent me from learning it .  channis  i m afraid you re a second foundationer yourself .    and channis  elbows rested on his knees as he leaned forward  and through stiff and angry lips said   what is your direct evidence .  deduction has proven wrong twice today .     there is direct evidence  too  channis .  it was easy enough .  i told you that my men had been tampered with .  the tamperer must have been  obviously  someone who was a  unconverted  and b  fairly close to the center of things .  the field was large but not entirely unlimited .  you were too successful  channis .  people liked you too much .  you got along too well .  i wondered      and then i summoned you to take over this expedition and it didn t set you back .  i watched your emotions .  it didn t bother you .  you overplayed the confidence there  channis .  no man of real competence could have avoided a dash of uncertainty at a job like that .  since your mind did avoid it  it was either a foolish one or a controlled one .   it was easy to test the alternatives .  i seized your mind at a moment of relaxation and filled it with grief for an instant and then removed it .  you were angry afterwards with such accomplished art that i could have sworn it was a natural reaction  but for that which went first .  for when i wrenched at your emotions  for just one instant  for one tiny instant before you could catch yourself  your mind resisted .  it was all i needed to know .    no one could have resisted me  even for that tiny instant  without control similar to mine .    channis  voice was low and bitter   well  then .  now what .     and now you die     as a second foundationer .  quite necessary  as i believe you realize .    and once again channis stared into the muzzle of a blaster .  a muzzle guided this time by a mind  not like pritcher s capable of offhand twisting to suit himself  but by one as mature as his own and as resistant to force as his own .   and the period of time allotted him for a correction of events was small .   what followed thereafter is difficult to describe by one with the normal complement of senses and the normal incapacity for emotional control .   essentially  this is what channis realized in the tiny space of time involved in the pushing of the mule s thumb upon the trigger contact .   the mule s current emotional makeup was one of a hard and polished determination  unmisted by hesitation in the least .  had channis been sufficiently interested afterward to calculate the time involved from the determination to shoot to the arrival of the disintegrating energies  he might have realized that his leeway was about one fifth of a second .   that was barely time .   what the mule realized in that same tiny space of time was that the emotional potential of channis  brain had surged suddenly upwards without his own mind feeling any impact and that  simultaneously  a flood of pure  thrilling hatred cascaded upon him from an unexpected direction .   it was that new emotional element that jerked his thumb off the contact .  nothing else could have done it  and almost together with his change of action  came complete realization of the new situation .   it was a tableau that endured far less than the significance adhering to it should require from a dramatic standpoint .  there was the mule  thumb off the blaster  staring intently upon channis there was channis taut  not quite daring to breathe yet .  and there was pritcher  convulsed in his chair  every muscle at a spasmodic breaking point  every tendon writhing in an effort to hurl forward  his face twisted at last out of schooled woodenness into an unrecognizable death mask of horrid hate  and his eyes only and entirely and supremely upon the mule .   only a word or two passed between channis and the mule     only a word or two and that utterly revealing stream of emotional consciousness that remains forever the true interplay of understanding between such as they .  for the sake of our own limits  it is necessary to translate into words what went on  then  and thenceforward .   channis said  tensely   you   re between two fires  first citizen .  you can t control two minds simultaneously  not when one of them is mine     so you have your choice .  pritcher  is free of your conversion now .  i ve snapped the bonds .  he s the old pritcher  the one who tried to kill you once  the one who thinks you re the enemy of all that is free and right and holy  and he s the one besides who knows that you ve debased him to helpless adulation for five years .  i m holding him back now by suppressing his will  but if you kill me  that ends  and in considerably less time than you could shift your blaster or even your will     he will kill you .    the mule quite plainly realized that .  he did not move .   channis continued   if you turn to place him under control  to kill him  to do anything  you won t ever be quick enough to turn again to stop me .    the mule still did not move .  only a soft sigh of realization .    so   said channis   throw down the blaster  and let us be on even terms again  and you can have pritcher back .     i made a mistake   said the mule  finally .   it was wrong to have a third party present when i confronted you .  it introduced one variable too many .  it is a mistake that must be paid for  i suppose .    he dropped the blaster carelessly  and kicked it to the other end of the room .  simultaneously  pritcher crumpled into profound sleep .    he   ll be normal when he awakes   said the mule  indifferently .   the entire exchange from the time the mule s thumb had begun pressing the trigger contact to the time he dropped the blaster had occupied just under a second and a half of time .   but just beneath the borders of consciousness  for a time just above the borders of detection  channis caught a fugitive emotional gleam in the mule s mind .  and it was still one of sure and confident triumph .          one man  the mule     and another  two men  apparently relaxed and entirely at ease  poles apart physically     with every nerve that served as emotional detector quivering tensely .   the mule  for the first time in long years  had insufficient surety of his own way .  channis knew that  though he could protect himself for the moment  it was an effort     and that the attack upon him was none such for his opponent .  in a test of endurance  channis knew he would lose .   but it was deadly to think of that .  to give away to the mule an emotional weakness would be to hand him a weapon .  there was already that glimpse of something     a winner s something     in the mule s mind .   to gain time     why did the others delay .  was that the source of the mule s confidence .  what did his opponent know that he didn t .  the mind he watched told nothing .  if only he could read ideas .  and yet     channis braked his own mental whirling roughly .  there was only that  to gain time     channis said   since it is decided  and not denied by myself after our little duel over pritcher  that i am a second foundationer  suppose you tell me why i came to tazenda .     oh  no   and the mule laughed  with high pitched confidence   i am not pritcher .  i need make no explanations to you .  you had what you thought were reasons .  whatever they were  your actions suited me  and so i inquire no further .     yet there must be such gaps in your conception of the story .  is tazenda the second foundation you expected to find .  pritcher spoke much of your other attempt at finding it  and of your psychologist tool  ebling mis .  he babbled a bit sometimes under my  .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  slight encouragement .  think back on ebling mis  first citizen .     why should i .   confidence .   channis felt that confidence edge out into the open  as if with the passage of time  any anxiety the mule might be having was increasingly vanishing .   he said  firmly restraining the rush of desperation   you lack curiosity  then .  pritcher told me of mis  vast surprise at something .  there was his terribly drastic urging for speed  for a rapid warning of the second foundation .  why .  why .  ebling mis died .  the second foundation was not warned .  and yet the second foundation exists .    the mule smiled in real pleasure  and with a sudden and surprising dash of cruelty that channis felt advance and suddenly withdraw   but apparently the second foundation was warned .  else how and why did one bail channis arrive on kalgan to handle my men and to assume the rather thankless task of outwitting me .  the warning came too late  that is all .     then   and channis allowed pity to drench outward from him   you don t even know what the second foundation is  or anything of the deeper meaning of all that has been going on .    to gain time .   the mule felt the other s pity  and his eyes narrowed with instant hostility .  he rubbed his nose in his familiar four fingered gesture  and snapped   amuse yourself  then .  what of the second foundation .    channis spoke deliberately  in words rather than in emotional symbology .  he said   from what i have heard  it was the mystery that surrounded the second foundation that most puzzled mis .  hari seldon founded his two units so differently .  the first foundation was a splurge that in two centuries dazzled half the galaxy .  and the second was an abyss that was dark .    you won t understand why that was  unless you can once again feel the intellectual atmosphere of the days of the dying empire .  it was a time of absolutes  of the great final generalities  at least in thought .  it was a sign of decaying culture  of course  that dams had been built against the further development of ideas .  it was his revolt against these dams that made seldon famous .  it was that one last spark of youthful creation in him that lit the empire in a sunset glow and dimly foreshadowed the rising sun of the second empire .     very dramatic .  so what .     so he created his foundations according to the laws of psychohistory  but who knew better than he that even those laws were relative .  he never created a finished product .  finished products are for decadent minds .  his was an evolving mechanism and the second foundation was the instrument of that evolution .  we  first citizen of your temporary union of worlds  we are the guardians of seldon s plan .  only we .     are you trying to talk yourself into courage   inquired the mule  contemptuously   or are you trying to impress me .  for the second foundation  seldon s plan  the second empire all impresses me not the least  nor touches any spring of compassion  sympathy  responsibility  nor any other source of emotional aid you may be trying to tap in me .  and in any case  poor fool  speak of the second foundation in the past tense  for it is destroyed .    channis felt the emotional potential that pressed upon his mind rise in intensity as the mule rose from his chair and approached .  he fought back furiously  but something crept relentlessly on within him  battering and bending his mind back     and back .   he felt the wall behind him  and the mule faced him  skinny arms akimbo  lips smiling terribly beneath that mountain of nose .   the mule said   your game is through  channis .  the game of all of you of all the men of what used to be the second foundation .  used to be .  used to be .    what were you sitting here waiting for all this time  with your babble to pritcher  when you might have struck him down and taken the blaster from him without the least effort of physical force .  you were waiting for me  weren t you  waiting to greet me in a situation that would not too arouse my suspicions .    too bad for you that i needed no arousal .  i knew you .  i knew you well  channis of the second foundation .    but what are you waiting for now .  you still throw words at me desperately  as though the mere sound of your voice would freeze me to my seat .  and all the while you speak  something in your mind is waiting and waiting and is still waiting .  but no one is coming .  none of those you expect     none of your allies .  you are alone here  channis  and you will remain alone .  do you know why .    it is because your second foundation miscalculated me to the very dregs of the end .  i knew their plan early .  they thought i would follow you here and be proper meat for their cooking .  you were to be a decoy indeed     a decoy for a poor  foolish weakling mutant  so hot on the trail of empire that he would fall blindly into an obvious pit .  but am i their prisoner .    i wonder if it occurred to them that i   d scarcely be here without my fleet     against the artillery of any unit of which they are entirely and pitifully helpless .  did it occur to them that i would not pause for discussion or wait for events .    my ships were launched against tazenda twelve hours ago and they are quite  quite through with their mission .  tazenda is laid in ruins  its centers of population are wiped out .  there was no resistance .  the second foundation no longer exists  channis     and i  the queer  ugly weakling  am the ruler of the galaxy .    channis could do nothing but shake his head feebly .   no    no       yes    yes     mimicked the mule .   and if you are the last one alive  and you may be  that will not be for long either .    and then there followed a short  pregnant pause  and channis almost howled with the sudden pain of that tearing penetration of the innermost tissues of his mind .   the mule drew back and muttered   not enough .  you do not pass the test after all .  your despair is pretense .  your fear is not the broad overwhelming that adheres to the destruction of an ideal  but the puny seeping fear of personal destruction .    and the mule   s weak hand seized channis by the throat in a puny grip that channis was somehow unable to break .    you are my insurance  channis .  you are my director and safeguard against any underestimation i may make .   the mule s eyes bore down upon him .  insistent    demanding      have i calculated rightly  channis .  have i outwitted your men of the second foundation .  tazenda is destroyed  channis  tremendously destroyed  so why is your despair pretense .  where is the reality .  i must have reality and truth .  talk  channis talk .  have i penetrated then  not deeply enough .  does the danger still exist .  talk  channis .  where have i done wrong .    channis felt the words drag out of his mouth .  they did not come willingly .  he clenched his teeth against them .  he bit his tongue .  he tensed every muscle of his throat .   and they came out     gasping     pulled out by force and tearing his throat and tongue and teeth on the way .    truth   he squeaked   truth       yes  truth .  what is left to be done .     seldon founded second foundation here .  here  as i said .  i told no lie .  the psychologists arrived and took control of the native population .     of tazenda .   the mule plunged deeply into the flooding torture of the other s emotional upwellings     tearing at them brutally .   it is tazenda i have destroyed .  you know what i want .  give it to me .     not tazenda .  i said second foundationers might not be those apparently in power  tazenda is the figurehead     the words were almost unrecognizable  forming themselves against every atom of will of the second foundationer   rossem    rossem    rossem is the world      the mule loosed his grip and channis dropped into a huddle of pain and torture .    and you thought to fool me .   said the mule  softly .    you were fooled .   it was the last dying shred of resistance in channis .    but not long enough for you and yours .  i am in communication with my fleet .  and after tazenda can come rossem .  but first      channis felt the excruciating darkness rise against him  and the automatic lift of his arm to his tortured eyes could not ward it off .  it was a darkness that throttled  and as he felt his tom  wounded mind reeling backwards  backwards into the everlasting black     there was that final picture of the triumphant mule     laughing matchstick     that long  fleshy nose quivering with laughter .   the sound faded away .  the darkness embraced him lovingly .   it ended with a cracking sensation that was like the jagged glare of a lightning flash  and channis came slowly to earth while sight returned painfully in blurry transmission through tear drenched eyes .   his head ached unbearably  and it was only with a stab of agony that he could bring up a hand to it .   obviously  he was alive .  softly  like feathers caught up in an eddy of air that had passed  his thoughts steadied and drifted to rest .  he felt comfort suck in     from outside .  slowly  torturedly  he bent his neck     and relief was a sharp pang .   for the door was open  and the first speaker stood just inside the threshold .  he tried to speak  to shout  to warn     but his tongue froze and he knew that a part of the mule s mighty mind still held him and clamped all speech within him .   he bent his neck once more .  the mule was still in the room .  he was angry and hot eyed .  he laughed no longer  but his teeth were bared in a ferocious smile .   channis felt the first speaker s mental influence moving gently over his mind with a healing touch and then there was the numbing sensation as it came into contact with the mule s defense for an instant of struggle and withdrew .   the mule said gratingly  with a fury that was grotesque in his meagre body   then another comes to greet me .   his agile mind reached its tendrils out of the room    out    out      you are alone   he said .   and the first speaker interrupted with an acquiescence   i am thoroughly alone .  it is necessary that i be alone  since it was i who miscalculated your future five years ago .  there would be a certain satisfaction to me in correcting that matter without aid .  unfortunately  i did not count on the strength of your field of emotional repulsion that surrounded this place .  it took me long to penetrate .  i congratulate you upon the skill with which it was constructed .     thank you for nothing   came the hostile rejoinder .   bandy no compliments with me .  have you come to add your brain splinter to that of yonder cracked pillar of your realm .    the first speaker smiled   why  the man you call bail channis performed his mission well  the more so since he was not your mental equal by far .  i can see  of course  that you have mistreated him  yet it may be that we may restore him fully even yet .  he is a brave man  sir .  he volunteered for this mission although we were able to predict mathematically the huge chance of damage to his mind     a more fearful alternative than that of mere physical crippling .    channis  mind pulsed futilely with what he wanted to say and couldn t  the warning he wished to shout and was unable to .  he could only emit that continuous stream of fear    fear     the mule was calm .   you know  of course  of the destruction of tazenda .     i do .  the assault by your fleet was foreseen .    grimly   yes  so i suppose .  but not prevented  eh .     no  not prevented .   the first speaker s emotional symbology was plain .  it was almost a self horror  a complete self disgust   and the fault is much more mine than yours .  who could have imagined your powers five years ago .  we suspected from the start     from the moment you captured kalgan     that you had the powers of emotional control .  that was not too surprising  first citizen  as i can explain to you .    emotional contact such as you and i possess is not a very new development .  actually it is implicit in the human brain .  most humans can read emotion in a primitive manner by associating it pragmatically with facial expression  tone of voice and so on .  a good many animals possess the faculty to a higher degree  they use the sense of smell to a good extent and the emotions involved are  of course  less complex .    actually  humans are capable of much more  but the faculty of direct emotional contact tended to atrophy with the development of speech a million years back .  it has been the great advance of our second foundation that this forgotten sense has been restored to at least some of its potentialities .    but we are not born with its full use .  a million years of decay is a formidable obstacle  and we must educate the sense  exercise it as we exercise our muscles .  and there you have the main difference .  you were born with it .    so much we could calculate .  we could also calculate the effect of such a sense upon a person in a world of men who did not possess it .  the seeing man in the kingdom of the blind    we calculated the extent to which a megalomania would take control of you and we thought we were prepared .  but for two factors we were not prepared .    the first was the great extent of your sense .  we can induce emotional contact only when in eyeshot  which is why we are more helpless against physical weapons than you might think .  sight plays such an enormous part .  not so with you .  you are definitely known to have had men under control  and  further  to have had intimate emotional contact with them when out of sight and out of earshot .  that was discovered too late .    secondly  we did not know of your physical shortcomings  particularly the one that seemed so important to you  that you adopted the name of the mule .  we didn t foresee that you were not merely a mutant  but a sterile mutant and the added psychic distortion due to your inferiority complex passed us by .  we allowed only for a megalomania     not for an intensely psychopathic paranoia as well .    it is myself that bears the responsibility for having missed all that  for i was the leader of the second foundation when you captured kalgan .  when you destroyed the first foundation  we found out     but too late     and for that fault millions have died on tazenda .     and you will correct things now .   the mules thin lips curled  his mind pulsing with hate   what will you do .  fatten me .  restore me to a masculine vigor .  take away from my past the long childhood in an alien environment .  do you regret my sufferings .  do you regret my unhappiness .  i have no sorrow for what i did in my necessity .  let the galaxy protect itself as best it can  since it stirred not a whit for my protection when i needed it .    your emotions are  of course   said the first speaker   only the children of your background and are not to be condemned     merely changed .  the destruction of tazenda was unavoidable .  the alternative would have been a much greater destruction generally throughout the galaxy over a period of centuries .  we did our best in our limited way .  we withdrew as many men from tazenda as we could .  we decentralized the rest of the world .  unfortunately  our measures were of necessity far from adequate .  it left many millions to die     do you not regret that .     not at all     any more than i regret the hundred thousand that must die on rossem in not more than six hours .     on rossem .   said the first speaker  quickly .   he turned to channis who had forced himself into a half sitting posture  and his mind exerted its force .  channis  felt the duel of minds strain over him  and then there was a short snapping of the bond and the words came tumbling out of his mouth   sir  i have failed completely .  he forced it from me not ten minutes before your arrival .  i could not resist him and i offer no excuses .  he knows tazenda is not the second foundation .  he knows that rossem is .    and the bonds closed down upon him again .   the first speaker frowned   i see .  what is it you are planning to do .     do you really wonder .  do you really find it difficult to penetrate the obvious .  all this time that you have preached to me of the nature of emotional contact     all this time that you have been throwing words such as megalomania and paranoia at me  i have been working .  i have been in contact with my fleet and it has its orders .  in six hours  unless i should for some reason counteract my orders  they are to bombard all of rossem except this lone village and an area of a hundred square miles about it .  they are to do a thorough job and are then to land here .    you have six hours  and in six hours  you cannot beat down my mind  nor can you save the rest of rossem .    the mule spread his hands and laughed again while the first speaker seemed to find difficulty in absorbing this new state of affairs .   he said   the alternative .     why should there even be an alternative .  i can stand to gain no more by any alternative .  is it the lives of those on rossem i m to be chary of .  perhaps if you allow my ships to land and submit  all of you     all the men on the second foundation     to mental control sufficient to suit myself  i may countermand the bombardment orders .  it may be worthwhile to put so many men of high intelligence under my control .  but then again it would be a considerable effort and perhaps not worth it after all  so i m not particularly eager to have you agree to it .  what do you say  second foundationer .  what weapon have you against my mind which is as strong as yours at least and against my ships which are stronger than anything you have ever dreamed of possessing .     what have i .   repeated the first speaker  slowly   why nothing     except a little grain     such a little grain of knowledge that even yet you do not possess .     speak quickly   laughed the mule   speak inventively .  for squirm as you might  you won t squirm out of this .     poor mutant   said the first speaker   i have nothing to squirm out of .  ask yourself     why was bail channis sent to kalgan as a decoy     bail channis  who though young and brave is almost as much your mental inferior as is this sleeping officer of yours  this han pritcher .  why did not i go  or another of our leaders  who would be more your match .     perhaps   came the supremely confident reply   you were not sufficiently foolish  since perhaps none of you are my match .     the true reason is more logical .  you knew channis to be a second foundationer .  he lacked the capacity to hide that from you .  and you knew  too  that you were his superior  so you were not afraid to play his game and follow him as he wished you to in order to outwit him later .  had i gone to kalgan  you would have killed me for i would have been a real danger  or had i avoided death by concealing my identity  i would yet have failed in persuading you to follow me into space .  it was only known inferiority that lured you on .  and had you remained on kalgan  not all the force of the second foundation could have harmed you  surrounded as you were by your men  your machines  and your mental power .     my mental power is yet with me  squirmer   said the mule   and my men and machines are not far off .     truly so  but you are not on kalgan .  you are here in the kingdom of tazenda  logically presented to you as the second foundation     very logically presented .  it had to be so presented  for you are a wise man  first citizen  and would follow only logic .     correct  and it was a momentary victory for your side  but there was still time for me to worm the truth from your man  channis  and still wisdom in me to realize that such a truth might exist .     and on our side  oh  not quite sufficiently subtle one  was the realization that you might go that one step further and so bail channis was prepared for you .     that he most certainly was not  for i stripped his brain clean as any plucked chicken .  it quivered bare and open before me and when he said rossem was the second foundation  it was basic truth for i had ground him so flat and smooth that not the smidgeon of a deceit could have found refuge in any microscopic crevice .     true enough .  so much the better for our foresight .  for i have told you already that bail channis was a volunteer .  do you know what sort of a volunteer .  before he left our foundation for kalgan and you  he submitted to emotional surgery of a drastic nature .  do you think it was sufficient to deceive you .  do you think bail channis  mentally untouched  could possibly deceive you .  no  bail channis was himself deceived  of necessity and voluntarily .  down to the inmost core of his mind  bail channis honestly believes that rossem is the second foundation .    and for three years now  we of the second foundation have built up the appearance of that here in the kingdom of tazenda  in preparation and waiting for you .  and we have succeeded  have we not .  you penetrated to tazenda  and beyond that  to rossem     but past that  you could not go .    the mule was upon his feet   you dare tell me that rossem also  is not the second foundation .    channis  from the floor  felt his bonds burst for good  under a stream of mental force on the part of the first speaker and strained upright .  he let out one long  incredulous cry   you mean rossem is not the second foundation .    the memories of life  the knowledge of his mind     everything     whirled mistily about him in confusion .   the first speaker smiled   you see  first citizen  channis is as upset as you are .  of course  rossem is not the second foundation .  are we madmen then  to lead you  our greatest  most powerful  most dangerous enemy to our own world .  oh  no .    let your fleet bombard rossem  first citizen  if you must have it so .  let them destroy all they can .  for at most they can kill only channis and myself     and that will leave you in a situation improved not in the least .    for the second foundation s expedition to rossem which has been here for three years and has functioned  temporarily  as elders in this village  embarked yesterday and are returning to kalgan .  they will evade your fleet  of course  and they will arrive in kalgan at least a day before you can  which is why i tell you all this .  unless i countermand my orders  when you return  you will find a revolting empire  a disintegrated realm  and only the men with you in your fleet here will be loyal to you .  they will be hopelessly outnumbered .  and moreover  the men of the second foundation will be with your home fleet and will see to it that you reconvert no one .  your empire is done  mutant .    slowly  the mule bowed his head  as anger and despair cornered his mind completely   yes .  too late    too late    now i see it .     now you see it   agreed the first speaker   and now you don t .    in the despair of that moment  when the mule s mind lay open  the first speaker     ready for that moment and pre sure of its nature     entered quickly .  it required a rather insignificant fraction of a second to consummate the change completely .   the mule looked up and said   then i shall return to kalgan .    certainly .  how do you feel .     excellently well .   his brow puckered   who are you .     does it matter .     of course not .   he dismissed the matter  and touched pritcher s shoulder   wake up  pritcher  we re going home .    it was two hours later that bail channis felt strong enough to walk by himself .  he said   he won t ever remember .     never .  he retains his mental powers and his empire     but his motivations are now entirely different .  the notion of a second foundation is a blank to him  and he is a man of peace .  he will be a far happier man henceforward  too  for the few years of life left him by his maladjusted physique .  and then  after he is dead seldon s plan will go on     somehow .     and it is true   urged channis   it is true that rossem is not the second foundation .  i could swear     i tell you i know it is .  i am not mad .     you are not mad  channis  merely  as i have said  changed .  rossem is not the second foundation .  come .  we  too  will return home .        last interlude  bail channis sat in the small white tiled room and allowed his mind to relax .  he was content to live in the present .  there were the walls and the window and the grass outside .  they had no names .  they were just things .  there was a bed and a chair an books that developed themselves idly on the screen at the foot of his bed .  there was the nurse who brought him his food .   at first he had made efforts to piece together the scraps of things he had heard .  such as those two men talking together .   one had said   complete aphasia now .  it   s cleaned out  and i think without damage .  it will only be necessary to return the recording of his original brain wave makeup .    he remembered the sounds by rote  and for some reason they seemed peculiar sounds     as if they meant something .  but why bother .   better to watch the pretty changing colors on the screen at the foot of the thing he lay on .   and then someone entered and did things to him and for a long time  he slept .   and when that had passed  the bed was suddenly a bed and he knew he was in a hospital  and the words he remembered made sense .   he sat up   what s happening .    the first speaker was beside him   you re on the second foundation  and you have your mind back     your original mind .     yes .  yes .   channis came to the realization that he was himself  and there was incredible triumph and joy in that .    and now tell me   said the first speaker   do you know where the second foundation is now .    and the truth came flooding down in one enormous wave and channis did not answer .  like ebling mis before him  he was conscious of only one vast  numbing surprise .   until he finally nodded  and said   by the stars of the galaxy     now  i know .                 part ii  search by the foundation                  arcadia  darell  arkady novelist  born            f . e .   died           f . e .  although primarily a writer of fiction  arkady darell is best known for her biography of her grandmother  bayta darell .  based on first hand information  it has for centuries served as a primary source of information concerning the mule and his times .   .  .  .  like  unkeyed memories   her novel  time and time and over  is a stirring reflection of the brilliant kalganian society of the early interregnum  based  it is said  on a visit to kalgan in her youth .  .  .  .   encyclopedia galactica  arcadia darell declaimed firmly into the mouthpiece of her transcriber    the future of seldon s plan  by a .  darell  and then thought darkly that some day when she was a great writer  she would write all her masterpieces under the pseudonym of arkady .  just arkady .  no last name at all .    a .  darell  would be just the sort of thing that she would have to put on all her themes for her class in composition and rhetoric     so tasteless .  all the other kids had to do it  too  except for olynthus dam  because the class laughed so when he did it the first time  and  arcadia  was a little girls name  wished on her because her great grandmother had been called that  her parents just had no imagination at all .   now that she was two days past fourteen  you d think they d recognize the simple fact of adulthood and call her arkady .  her lips tightened as she thought of her father looking up from his book viewer just long enough to say   but if you re going to pretend you re nineteen  arcadia  what will you do when you re twenty five and all the boys think you re thirty .    from where she sprawled across the arms and into the hollow of her own special armchair  she could see the mirror on her dresser .  her foot was a little in the way because her house slipper kept twirling about her big toe  so she pulled it in and sat up with an unnatural straightness to her neck that she felt sure  somehow  lengthened it a full two inches into slim regality .   for a moment  she considered her face thoughtfully     too fat .  she opened her jaws half an inch behind closed lips  and caught the resultant trace of unnatural gauntness at every angle .  she licked her lips with a quick touch of tongue and let them pout a bit in moist softness .  then she let her eyelids droop in a weary  worldly way    oh  golly if only her cheeks weren t that silly pink .   she tried putting her fingers to the outer comers of her eye and tilting the lids a bit to get that mysterious exotic languor of the women of the inner star systems  but her hands were in the way and she couldn t see her face very well .   then she lifted her chin  caught herself at a half profile  and with her eyes a little strained from looking out the comer and her neck muscles faintly aching  she said  in a voice one octave below its natural pitch   really  father  if you think it makes a particle of difference to me what some silly old boys think you just      and then she remembered that she still had the transmitter open in her hand and said  drearily   oh  golly   and shut it off .   the faintly violet paper with the peach margin line on the left had upon it the following    the future of seldon s plan   really  father  if you think it makes a particle of difference to me what some silly old boys think you just   oh  golly .    she pulled the sheet out of the machine with annoyance and another clicked neatly into place .   but her face smoothed out of its vexation  nevertheless  and her wide  little mouth stretched into a self satisfied smile .  she sniffed at the paper delicately .  just right .  just that proper touch of elegance and charm .  and the penmanship was just the last word .   the machine had been delivered two days ago on her first adult birthday .  she had said   but father  everybody     just everybody in the class who has the slightest pretensions to being anybody has one .  nobody but some old drips would use hand machines      the salesman had said   there is no other model as compact on the one hand and as adaptable on the other .  it will spell and punctuate correctly according to the sense of the sentence .  naturally  it is a great aid to education since it encourages the user to employ careful enunciation and breathing in order to make sure of the correct spelling  to say nothing of demanding a proper and elegant delivery for correct punctuation .    even then her father had tried to get one geared for type print as if she were some dried up  old maid teacher .   but when it was delivered  it was the model she wanted     obtained perhaps with a little more wail and sniffle than quite went with the adulthood of fourteen     and copy was turned out in a charming and entirely feminine handwriting  with the most beautifully graceful capitals anyone ever saw .   even the phrase   oh  golly .   somehow breathed glamour when the transcriber was done with it .   but just the same she had to get it right  so she sat up straight in her chair  placed her first draft before her in businesslike fashion  and began again  crisply and clearly  her abdomen flat  her chest lifted  and her breathing carefully controlled .  she intoned  with dramatic fervor   the future of seldon s plan .    the foundation s past history is  i am sure  well known to all of us who have had the good fortune to be educated in our planet s efficient and well staffed school system .    there .  that would start things off right with miss erlking  that mean old hag .    that past history is largely the past history of the great plan of hari seldon .  the two are one .  but the question in the mind of most people today is whether this plan will continue in all its great wisdom  or whether it will be foully destroyed  or  perhaps  has been so destroyed already .    to understand this  it may be best to pass quickly over some of the highlights of the plan as it has been revealed to humanity thus far .    this part was easy because she had taken modern history the semester before .     in the days  nearly four centuries ago  when the first galactic empire was decaying into the paralysis that preceded final death  one man     the great hari seldon     foresaw the approaching end .  through the science of psychohistory  the intrissacies of whose mathematics has long since been forgotten    she paused in a trifle of doubt .  she was sure that  intricacies  was pronounced with soft c s but the spelling didn t look right .  oh  well  the machine couldn t very well be wrong      he and the men who worked with him are able to foretell the course of the great social and economic currents sweeping the galaxy at the time .  it was possible for them to realize that  left to itself  the empire would break up  and that thereafter there would be at least thirty thousand years of anarchic chaos prior to the establishment of a new empire .    it was too late to prevent the great fall  but it was still possible  at least  to cut short the intermediate period of chaos .  the plan was  therefore  evolved whereby only a single millennium would separate the second empire from the first .  we are completing the fourth century of that millennium  and many generations of men have lived and died while the plan has continued its inexorable workings .    hari seldon established two foundations at the opposite ends of the galaxy  in a manner and under such circumstances as would yield the best mathematical solution for his psychohistorical problem .  in one of these  our foundation  established here on terminus  there was concentrated the physical science of the empire  and through the possession of that science  the foundation was able to withstand the attacks of the barbarous kingdoms which had broken away and become independent  out at the hinge of the empire .    the foundation  indeed  was able to conquer in its turn these short lived kingdoms by means of the leadership of a series of wise and heroic men like salvor hardin and hober mallow who were able to interpret the plan intelligently and to guide our land through its   she had written  intricacies  here also  but decided not to risk it a second time .    complications .  all our planets still revere their memories although centuries have passed .    eventually  the foundation established a commercial system which controlled a large portion of the siwennian and anacreonian sectors of the galaxy  and even defeated the remnants of the old empire under its last great general  bel riose .  it seemed that nothing could now stop the workings of seldon s plan .  every crisis that seldon had planned had come at its appropriate time and had been solved  and with each solution the foundation had taken another giant stride toward second empire and peace .    and then    her breath came short at this point  and she hissed the word  between her teeth  but the transmitter simply wrote them calmly and gracefully .    with the last remnants of the dead first empire gone and with only ineffectual warlords ruling over the splinters and remnants of the decayed colossus    she got that phrase out of a thriller on the video last week  but old miss erlking never listened to anything but symphonies and lectures  so she d never know .    there came the mule .    this strange man was not allowed for in the plan .  he was a mutant  whose birth could not have been predicted .  he had strange and mysterious power of controlling and manipulating human emotions and in this manner could bend all men to his will .  with breath taking swiftness  he became a conqueror and empire builder  until  finally  he even defeated the foundation itself .    yet he never obtained universal dominion  since in his first overpowering lunge he was stopped by the wisdom and daring of a great woman   now there was that old problem again .  father would insist that she never bring up the fact that she was the grandchild of bayta darell .  everyone knew it and bayta was just about the greatest woman there ever was and she had stopped the mule singlehanded .    in a manner the true story of which is known in its entirety to very few .    there .  if she had to read it to the class  that last could he said in a dark voice  and someone would be sure to ask what the true story was  and then     well  and then she couldn t help tell the truth if they asked her  could she .  in her mind  she was already wordlessly whizzing through a hurt and eloquent explanation to a stern and questioning paternal parent .     after five years of restricted rule  another change took place  the reasons for which are not known  and the mule abandoned all plans for further conquest .  his last five years were those of an enlightened despot .    it is said by some that the change in the mule was brought about by the intervention of the second foundation .  however  no man has ever discovered the exact location of this other foundation  nor knows its exact function  so that theory remains unproven .    a whole generation has passed since the death of the mule .  what of the future  then  now that he has come and gone .  he interrupted seldon s plan and seemed to have burst it to fragments  yet as soon as he died  the foundation rose again  like a nova from the dead ashes of a dying star .    she had made that up herself .    once again  the planet terminus houses the center of a commercial federation almost as great and as rich as before the conquest  and even more peaceful and democratic .    is this planned .  is seldon s great dream still alive  and will a second galactic empire yet be formed six hundred years from now .  i  myself  believe so  because   this was the important part .  miss erlking always had those large  ugly red pencil scrawls that went   but this is only descriptive .  what are your personal reactions .  think .  express yourself .  penetrate your own soul .   penetrate your own soul .  a lot she knew about souls  with her lemon face that never smiled in its life      never at any time has the political situation been so favorable .  the old empire is completely dead and the period of the mule s rule put an end to the era of warlords that preceded him .  most of the surrounding portions of the galaxy are civilized and peaceful .    moreover the internal health of the foundation is better than ever before .  the despotic times of the pre conquest hereditary mayors have given way to the democratic elections of early times .  there are no longer dissident worlds of independent traders  no longer the injustices and dislocations that accompanied accumulations of great wealth in the hands of a few .    there is no reason  therefore  to fear failure  unless it is true that the second foundation itself presents a danger .  those who think so have no evidence to back their claim  but merely vague fears and superstitions .  i think that our confidence in ourselves  in our nation  and in hari seldon s great plan should drive from our hearts and minds all uncertainties and   hm m m .  this was awfully corny  but something like this was expected at the end .    so i say      that is as far as  the future of seldon s plan  got  at that moment  because there was the gentlest little tap on the window  and when arcadia shot up to a balance on one arm of the chair  she found herself confronted by a smiling face beyond the glass  its even symmetry of feature interestingly accentuated by the short  vertical fine of a finger before its lips .   with the slight pause necessary to assume an attitude of bepuzzlement  arcadia dismounted from the armchair  walked to the couch that fronted the wide window that held the apparition and  kneeling upon it  stared out thoughtfully .   the smile upon the man s face faded quickly .  while the fingers of one hand tightened whitely upon the sill  the other made a quick gesture .  arcadia obeyed calmly  and closed the latch that moved the lower third of the window smoothly into its socket in the wall  allowing the warm spring air to interfere with the conditioning within .    you can t get in   she said  with comfortable smugness .   the windows are all screened  and keyed only to people who belong here .  if you come in  all sorts of alarms will break loose .   a pause  then she added   you look sort of silly balancing on that ledge underneath the window .  if you re not careful  you ll fall and break your neck and a lot of valuable flowers .     in that case   said the man at the window  who had been thinking that very thing     with a slightly different arrangement of adjectives     will you shut off the screen and let me in .     no use in doing that   said arcadia .   you re probably thinking of a different house  because i m not the kind of girl who lets strange men into their  .  .  .  her bedroom this time of night .   her eyes  as she said it  took on a heavy lidded sultriness     or an unreasonable facsimile thereof .   all traces of humor whatever had disappeared from the young stranger s face .  he muttered   this is dr .  darell s house  isn t it .     why should i tell you .     oh  galaxy    good by       if you jump off  young man  i will personally give the alarm .    this was intended as a refined and sophisticated thrust of irony  since to arcadia s enlightened eyes  the intruder was an obviously mature thirty  at least     quite elderly  in fact .    quite a pause .  then  tightly  he said   well  now  look here  girlie  if you don t want me to stay  and don t want me to go  what do you want me to do .     you can come in  i suppose .  dr .  darell does live here .  i   ll shut off the screen now .    warily  after a searching look  the young man poked his hand through the window  then hunched himself up and through it .  he brushed at his knees with an angry  slapping gesture  and lifted a reddened face at her .    you re quite sure that your character and reputation won t suffer when they find me here  are you .     not as much as yours would  because just as soon as i hear footsteps outside  i ll just shout and yell and say you forced your way in here .     yes .   he replied with heavy courtesy   and how do you intend to explain the shut off protective screen .     poof .  that would be easy .  there wasn t any there in the first place .    the man s eyes were wide with chagrin .   that was a bluff .  how old are you  kid .     i consider that a very impertinent question  young man .  and i am not accustomed to being addressed as  kid .      i don t wonder .  you re probably the mule s grandmother in disguise .  do you mind if i leave now before you arrange a lynching party with myself as star performer .     you had better not leave     because my father s expecting you .    the man s look became a wary one  again .  an eyebrow shot up as he said  lightly   oh .  anyone with your father .     no .     anyone called on him lately .     only tradespeople     and you .     anything unusual happen at all .     only you .     forget me  will you .  no  don t forget me .  tell me  how did you know your father was expecting me .     oh  that was easy .  last week  he received a personal capsule  keyed to him personally  with a self oxidizing message  you know .  he threw the capsule shell into the trash disinto  and yesterday  he gave poli     that s our maid  you see     a month s vacation so she could visit her sister in terminus city  and this afternoon  he made up the bed in the spare room .  so i knew he expected somebody that i wasn t supposed to know anything about .  usually  he tells me everything .     really .  i m surprised he has to .  i should think you d know everything before he tells you .     i usually do .   then she laughed .  she was beginning to feel very much at ease .  the visitor was elderly  but very distinguished looking with curly brown hair and very blue eyes .  maybe she could meet somebody like that again  sometimes  when she was old herself .    and just how   he asked   did you know it was i he expected .     well  who else could it be .  he was expecting somebody in so secrety a way  if you know what i mean     and then you come gumping around trying to sneak through windows  instead of walking through the front door  the way you would if you had any sense .   she remembered a favorite line  and used it promptly .   men are so stupid .     pretty stuck on yourself  aren t you  kid .  i mean  miss .  you could be wrong  you know .  what if i told you that all this is a mystery to me and that as far as i know  your father is expecting someone else  not me .     oh  i don t think so .  i didn t ask you to come in  until after i saw you drop your briefcase .     my what .     your briefcase  young man .  i m not blind .  you didn t drop it by accident  because you looked down first  so as to make sure it would land right .  then you must have realized it would land just under the hedges and wouldn t be seen  so you dropped it and didn t look down afterwards .  now since you came to the window instead of the front door  it must mean that you were a little afraid to trust yourself in the house before investigating the place .  and after you had a little trouble with me  you took care of your briefcase before taking care of yourself  which means that you consider whatever your briefcase has in it to be more valuable than your own safety  and that means that as long as you re in here and the briefcase is out there and we know that it s out there  you re probably pretty helpless .    she paused for a much needed breath  and the man said  grittily   except that i think i ll choke you just about medium dead and get out of here  with the briefcase .     except  young man  that i happen to have a baseball bat under my bed  which i can reach in two seconds from where i m sitting  and i m very strong for a girl .    impasse .  finally  with a strained courtesy  the  young man  said   shall i introduce myself  since we re being so chummy .  i m pelleas anthor .  and your name .     i m arca    arkady darell .  pleased to meet you .     and now arkady  would you be a good little girl and call your father .    arcadia bridled .   i m not a little girl .  i think you re very rude     especially when you re asking a favor .    pelleas anthor sighed .   very well .  would you be a good  kind  dear  little old lady  just chock full of lavender  and call your father .     that s not what i meant either  but i   ll call him .  only not so i ll take my eyes off you  young man .   and she stamped on the floor .   there came the sound of hurrying footsteps in the hall  and the door was flung open .    arcadia     there was a tiny explosion of exhaled air  and dr .  darell said   who are you  sir .    pelleas sprang to his feet in what was quite obviously relief .   dr .  toran darell .  i am pelleas anthor .  you ve received word about me  i think .  at least  your daughter says you have .     my daughter says i have .   he bent a frowning glance at her which caromed harmlessly off the wide eyed and impenetrable web of innocence with which she met the accusation .   dr .  darell said  finally   i have been expecting you .  would you mind coming down with me  please .   and he stopped as his eye caught a flicker of motion  which arcadia caught simultaneously .   she scrambled toward her transcriber  but it was quite useless  since her father was standing right next to it .  he said  sweetly   you ve left it going all this time  arcadia .     father   she squeaked  in real anguish   it is very ungentlemanly to read another person s private correspondence  especially when it s talking correspondence .     ah   said her father   but  talking correspondence  with a strange man in your bedroom .  as a father  arcadia  i must protect you against evil .     oh  golly     it was nothing like that .    pelleas laughed suddenly   oh  but it was  dr .  darell .  the young lady was going to accuse me of all sorts of things  and i must insist that you read it  if only to clear my name .     oh     arcadia held back her tears with an effort .  her own father didn t even trust her .  and that darned transcriber    if that silly fool hadn t come gooping at the window  and making her forget to turn it off .  and now her father would be making long  gentle speeches about what young ladies aren t supposed to do .  there just wasn t anything they were supposed to do  it looked like  except choke and die  maybe .    arcadia   said her father  gently   it strikes me that a young lady      she knew it .  she knew it .       should not be quite so impertinent to men older than she is .    well  what did he want to come peeping around my window for .  a young lady has a right to privacy    now i ll have to do my whole darned composition over .     it s not up to you to question his propriety in coming to your window .  you should simply not have let him in .  you should have called me instantly     especially if you thought i was expecting him .    she said  peevishly   it s just as well if you didn t see him     stupid thing .  hell give the whole thing away if he keeps on going to windows  instead of doors .     arcadia  nobody wants your opinion on matters you know nothing of .     i do  too .  it s the second foundation  that s what it is .    there was a silence .  even arcadia felt a little nervous stirring in her abdomen .   dr .  darell said  softly   where have you heard this .     nowheres  but what else is there to be so secret about .  and you don t have to worry that i   ll tell anyone .     mr .  anthor   said dr .  darell   i must apologize for all this .     oh  that s all right   came anthor s rather hollow response .   it s not your fault if she s sold herself to the forces of darkness .  but do you mind if i ask her a question before we go .  miss arcadia       what do you want .     why do you think it is stupid to go to windows instead of to doors .     because you advertise what you re trying to hide  silly .  if i have a secret  i don t put tape over my mouth and let everyone know i have a secret .  i talk just as much as usual  only about something else .  didn t you ever read any of the sayings of salvor hardin .  he was our first mayor  you know .     yes  i know .     well  he used to say that only a he that wasn t ashamed of itself could possibly succeed .  he also said that nothing had to be true  but everything had to sound true .  well  when you come in through a window  it s a lie that s ashamed of itself and it doesn t sound true .     then what would you have done .     if i had wanted to see my father on top secret business  i would have made his acquaintance openly and seen him about all sorts of strictly legitimate things .  and then when everyone knew all about you and connected you with my father as a matter of course  you could be as top secret as you want and nobody would ever think of questioning it .    anthor looked at the girl strangely  then at dr .  darell .  he said   let s go .  i have a briefcase i want to pick up in the garden .  wait .  just one last question .  arcadia  you don t really have a baseball bat under your bed  do you .     no .  i don t .     hah .  i didn t think so .    dr .  darell stopped at the door .   arcadia   he said   when you rewrite your composition on the seldon plan  don t be unnecessarily mysterious about your grandmother .  there is no necessity to mention that part at all .    he and pelleas descended the stairs in silence .  then the visitor asked in a strained voice   do you mind  sir .  how old is she .     fourteen  day before yesterday .     fourteen .  great galaxy    tell me  has she ever said she expects to marry some day .     no  she hasn t .  not to me .    well  if she ever does  shoot him .  the one she s going to marry  i mean .   he stared earnestly into the older man s eyes .   i m serious .  life could hold no greater horror than living with what shell be like when she s twenty .  i don t mean to offend you  of course .     you don t offend me .  i think i know what you mean .    upstairs  the object of their tender analyses faced the transcriber with revolted weariness and said  dully   thefutureofseldonsplan .   the transcriber with infinite aplomb  translated that into elegantly  complicated script capitals as    the future of seldon s plan .           seldon s plan  mathematics the synthesis of the calculus of n variables and of n dimensional geometry is the basis of what seldon once called  my little algebra of humanity  .  .  .  .   encyclopedia galactica  consider a room .   the location of the room is not in question at the moment .  it is merely sufficient to say that in that room  more than anywhere  the second foundation existed .   it was a room which  through the centuries  had been the abode of pure science     yet it had none of the gadgets with which  through millennia of association  science has come to be considered equivalent .  it was a science  instead  which dealt with mathematical concepts only  in a manner similar to the speculation of ancient  ancient races in the primitive  prehistoric days before technology had come to be  before man had spread beyond a single  now unknown world .   for one thing  there was in that room     protected by a mental science as yet unassailable by the combined physical might of the rest of the galaxy     the prime radiant  which held in its vitals the seldon plan     complete .   for another  there was a man  too  in that room     the first speaker .   he was the twelfth in the line of chief guardians of the plan  and his title bore no deeper significance than the fact that at the gatherings of the leaders of the second foundation  he spoke first .   his predecessor had beaten the mule  but the wreckage of that gigantic struggle still littered the path of the plan    for twenty five years  he  and his administration  had been trying to force a galaxy of stubborn and stupid human beings back to the path    it was a terrible task .   the first speaker looked up at the opening door .  even while  in the loneliness of the room  he considered his quarter century of effort  which now so slowly and inevitably approached its climax  even while he had been so engaged  his mind had been considering the newcomer with a gentle expectation .  a youth  a student  one of those who might take over  eventually .   the young man stood uncertainly at the door  so that the first speaker had to walk to him and lead him in  with a friendly hand upon the shoulder .   the student smiled shyly  and the first speaker responded by saying   first  i must tell you why you are here .    they faced each other now  across the desk .  neither was speaking in any way that could be recognized as such by any man in the galaxy who was not himself a member of the second foundation .   speech  originally  was the device whereby man learned  imperfectly  to transmit the thoughts and emotions of his mind .  by setting up arbitrary sounds and combinations of sounds to represent certain mental nuances  be developed a method of communication     but one which in its clumsiness and thick thumbed inadequacy degenerated all the delicacy of the mind into gross and guttural signaling .   down    down    the results can be followed  and all the suffering that humanity ever knew can be traced to the one fact that no man in the history of the galaxy  until hari seldon  and very few men thereafter  could really understand one another .  every human being lived behind an impenetrable wall of choking mist within which no other but he existed .  occasionally there were the dim signals from deep within the cavern in which another man was located so that each might grope toward the other .  yet because they did not know one another  and could not understand one another  and dared not trust one another  and felt from infancy the terrors and insecurity of that ultimate isolation     there was the hunted fear of man for man  the savage rapacity of man toward man .   feet  for tens of thousands of years  had clogged and shuffled in the mud     and held down the minds which  for an equal time  had been fit for the companionship of the stars .   grimly  man had instinctively sought to circumvent the prison bars of ordinary speech .  semantics  symbolic logic  psychoanalysis     they had all been devices whereby speech could either be refined or by passed .   psychohistory had been the development of mental science  the final mathematicization thereof  rather  which had finally succeeded .  through the development of the mathematics necessary to understand the facts of neural physiology and the electrochemistry of the nervous system  which themselves had to be  had to be  traced down to nuclear forces  it first became possible to truly develop psychology .  and through the generalization of psychological knowledge from the individual to the group  sociology was also mathematicized .   the larger groups  the billions that occupied planets  the trillions that occupied sectors  the quadrillions that occupied the whole galaxy  became  not simply human beings  but gigantic forces amenable to statistical treatment     so that to hari seldon  the future became clear and inevitable  and the plan could be set up .   the same basic developments of mental science that had brought about the development of the seldon plan  thus made it also unnecessary for the first speaker to use words in addressing the student .   every reaction to a stimulus  however slight  was completely indicative of all the trifling changes  of all the flickering currents that went on in another s mind .  the first speaker could not sense the emotional content of the student s instinctively  as the mule would have been able to do     since the mule was a mutant with powers not ever likely to become completely comprehensible to any ordinary man  even a second foundationer     rather he deduced them  as the result of intensive training .   since  however  it is inherently impossible in a society based on speech to indicate truly the method of communication of second foundationers among themselves  the whole matter will be hereafter ignored .  the first speaker will be represented as speaking in ordinary fashion  and if the translation is not always entirely valid  it is at least the best that can be done under the circumstances .   it will be pretended therefore  that the first speaker did actually say   first  i must tell you why you are here   instead of smiling just so and lifting a finger exactly thus .   the first speaker said   you have studied mental science hard and well for most of your life .  you have absorbed all your teachers could give you .  it is time for you and a few others like yourself to begin your apprenticeship for speakerhood .    agitation from the other side of the desk .    no     now you must take this phlegmatically .  you had hoped you would qualify .  you had feared you would not .  actually  both hope and fear are weaknesses .  you knew you would qualify and you hesitate to admit the fact because such knowledge might stamp you as cocksure and therefore unfit .  nonsense .  the most hopelessly stupid man is he who is not aware that he is wise .  it is part of your qualification that you knew you would qualify .    relaxation on the other side of the desk .    exactly .  now you feel better and your guard is down .  you are fitter to concentrate and fitter to understand .  remember  to be truly effective  it is not necessary to hold the mind under a tight  controlling barrier which to the intelligent probe is as informative as a naked mentality .  rather  one should cultivate an innocence  an awareness of self  and an unself consciousness of self which leaves one nothing to hide .  my mind is open to you .  let this be so for both of us .    he went on .   it is not an easy thing to be a speaker .  it is not an easy thing to be a psychohistorian in the first place  and not even the best psychohistorian need necessarily qualify to be a speaker .  there is a distinction here .  a speaker must not only be aware of the mathematical intricacies of the seldon plan  he must have a sympathy for it and for its ends .  he must love the plan  to him it must be life and breath .  more than that it must even be as a living friend .    do you know what this is .    the first speaker s hand hovered gently over the black  shining cube in the middle of the desk .  it was featureless .    no  speaker  i do not .     you have heard of the prime radiant .     this .      astonishment .    you expected something more noble and awe inspiring .  well  that is natural .  it was created in the days of the empire  by men of seldon s time .  for nearly four hundred years  it has served our needs perfectly  without requiring repairs or adjustment .  and fortunately so  since none of the second foundation is qualified to handle it in any technical fashion .   he smiled gently .   those of the first foundation might be able to duplicate this  but they must never know  of course .    he depressed a lever on his side of the desk and the room was in darkness .  but only for a moment  since with a gradually livening flush  the two long walls of the room glowed to life .  first  a pearly white  unrelieved  then a trace of faint darkness here and there  and finally  the fine neatly printed equations in black  with an occasional red hairline that wavered through the darker forest like a staggering rillet .    come  my boy  step here before the wall .  you will not cast a shadow .  this light does not radiate from the radiant in an ordinary manner .  to tell you the truth  i do not know even faintly by what medium this effect is produced  but you will not cast a shadow .  i know that .    they stood together in the light .  each wall was thirty feet long  and ten high .  the writing was small and covered every inch .    this is not the whole plan   said the first speaker .   to get it all upon both walls  the individual equations would have to be reduced to microscopic size     but that is not necessary .  what you now see represents the main portions of the plan till now .  you have learned about this  have you not .     yes  speaker  i have .     do you recognize any portion .    a slow silence .  the student pointed a finger and as he did so  the line of equations marched down the wall  until the single series of functions he had thought of     one could scarcely consider the quick  generalized gesture of the finger to have been sufficiently precise     was at eye level .   the first speaker laughed softly   you will find the prime radiant to be attuned to your mind .  you may expect more surprises from the little gadget .  what were you about to say about the equation you have chosen .     it   faltered the student   is a rigellian integral  using a planetary distribution of a bias indicating the presence of two chief economic classes on the planet  or maybe a sector  plus an unstable emotional pattern .     and what does it signify .     it represents the limit of tension  since we have here      he pointed  and again the equations veered      a converging series .     good   said the first speaker .   and tell me  what do you think of all this .  a finished work of art  is it not .     definitely .     wrong .  it is not .   this  with sharpness .   it is the first lesson you must unlearn .  the seldon plan is neither complete nor correct .  instead  it is merely the best that could be done at the time .  over a dozen generations of men have pored over these equations  worked at them  taken them apart to the last decimal place  and put them together again .  they ve done more than that .  they ve watched nearly four hundred years pass and against the predictions and equations  they ve checked reality  and they have learned .    they have learned more than seldon ever knew  and if with the accumulated knowledge of the centuries we could repeat seldon s work  we could do a better job .  is that perfectly clear to you .    the student appeared a little shocked .    before you obtain your speakerhood   continued the first speaker   you yourself will have to make an original contribution to the plan .  it is not such great blasphemy .  every red mark you see on the wall is the contribution of a man among us who lived since seldon .  why  .  .  .  why     he looked upward   there .    the whole wall seemed to whirl down upon him .    this   he said   is mine .   a fine red line encircled two forking arrows and included six square feet of deductions along each path .  between the two were a series of equations in red .    it does not   said the speaker   seem to be much .  it is at a point in the plan which we will not reach yet for a time as long as that which has already passed .  it is at the period of coalescence  when the second empire that is to be is in the grip of rival personalities who will threaten to pull it apart if the fight is too even  or clamp it into rigidity  if the fight is too uneven .  both possibilities are considered here  followed  and the method of avoiding either indicated .    yet it is all a matter of probabilities and a third course can exist .  it is one of comparatively low likelihood     twelve point six four percent  to be exact     but even smaller chances have already come to pass and the plan is only forty percent complete .  this third probability consists of a possible compromise between two or more of the conflicting personalities being considered .  this  i showed  would first freeze the second empire into an unprofitable mold  and then  eventually  inflict more damage through civil wars than would have taken place had a compromise never been made in the first place .  fortunately  that could be prevented  too .  and that was my contribution .     if i may interrupt  speaker    how is a change made .     through the agency of the radiant .  you will find in your own case  for instance  that your mathematics will be checked rigorously by five different boards  and that you will be required to defend it against a concerted and merciless attack .  two years will then pass  and your development will be reviewed again .  it has happened more than once that a seemingly perfect piece of work has uncovered its fallacies only after an induction period of months or years .  sometimes  the contributor himself discovers the flaw .    if  after two years  another examination  not less detailed than the first  still passes it  and     better still     if in the interim the young scientist has brought to light additional details  subsidiary evidence  the contribution will be added to the plan .  it was the climax of my career  it will be the climax of yours .    the prime radiant can be adjusted to your mind  and all corrections and additions can be made through mental rapport .  there will be nothing to indicate that the correction or addition is yours .  in all the history of the plan there has been no personalization .  it is rather a creation of all of us together .  do you understand .     yes  speaker .     then  enough of that .   a stride to the prime radiant  and the walls were blank again save for the ordinary room lighting region along the upper borders .   sit down here at my desk  and let me talk to you .  it is enough for a psychohistorian  as such  to know his biostatistics and his neurochemical electromathematics .  some know nothing else and are fit only to be statistical technicians .  but a speaker must be able to discuss the plan without mathematics .  if not the plan itself  at least its philosophy and its aims .    first of all  what is the aim of the plan .  please tell me in your own words     and don t grope for fine sentiment .  you won t be judged on polish and suavity  i assure you .    it was the student s first chance at more than a bisyllable  and he hesitated before plunging into the expectant space cleared away for him .  he said  diffidently   as a result of what i have learned  i believe that it is the intention of the plan to establish a human civilization based on an orientation entirely different from anything that ever before existed .  an orientation which  according to the findings of psychohistory  could never spontaneously come into being       stop .   the first speaker was insistent .   you must not say  never .   that is a lazy slurring over of the facts .  actually  psychohistory predicts only probabilities .  a particular event may be infinitesimally probable  but the probability is always greater than zero .     yes  speaker .  the orientation desired  if i may correct myself  then  is well known to possess no significant probability of spontaneously coming to pass .     better .  what is the orientation .     it is that of a civilization based on mental science .  in all the known history of mankind  advances have been made primarily in physical technology  in the capacity of handling the inanimate world about man .  control of self and society has been left to chance or to the vague gropings of intuitive ethical systems based on inspiration and emotion .  as a result  no culture of greater stability than about fifty five percent has ever existed  and these only as the result of great human misery .     and why is the orientation we speak of a nonspontaneous one .     because a large minority of human beings are mentally equipped to take part in the advance of physical science  and all receive the crude and visible benefits thereof .  only an insignificant minority  however  are inherently able to lead man through the greater involvements of mental science  and the benefits derived therefrom  while longer lasting  are more subtle and less apparent .  furthermore  since such an orientation would lead to the development of a benevolent dictatorship of the mentally best     virtually a higher subdivision of man     it would be resented and could not be stable without the application of a force which would depress the rest of mankind to brute level .  such a development is repugnant to us and must be avoided .     what  then  is the solution .     the solution is the seldon plan .  conditions have been so arranged and so maintained that in a millennium from its beginnings     six hundred years from now  a second galactic empire will have been established in which mankind will be ready for the leadership of mental science .  in that same interval  the second foundation in its development  will have brought forth a group of psychologists ready to assume leadership .  or  as i have myself often thought  the first foundation supplies the physical framework of a single political unit  and the second foundation supplies the mental framework of a ready made ruling class .     i see .  fairly adequate .  do you think that any second empire  even if formed in the time set by seldon  would do as a fulfillment of his plan .     no  speaker  i do not .  there are several possible second empires that may be formed in the period of time stretching from nine hundred to seventeen hundred years after the inception of the plan  but only one of these is the second empire .     and in view of all this  why is it necessary that the existence of the second foundation be hidden     above all  from the first foundation .    the student probed for a hidden meaning to the question and failed to find it .  he was troubled in his answer   for the same reason that the details of the plan as a whole must be hidden from mankind in general .  the laws of psychohistory are statistical in nature and are rendered invalid if the actions of individual men are not random in nature .  if a sizable group of human beings learned of key details of the plan  their actions would be governed by that knowledge and would no longer be random in the meaning of the axioms of psychohistory .  in other words  they would no longer be perfectly predictable .  your pardon  speaker  but i feel that the answer is not satisfactory .     it is well that you do .  your answer is quite incomplete .  it is the second foundation itself which must be hidden  not simply the plan .  the second empire is not yet formed .  we have still a society which would resent a ruling class of psychologists  and which would fear its development and fight against it .  do you understand that .     yes  speaker  i do .  the point has never been stressed       don t minimize .  it has never been made     in the classroom  though you should be capable of deducing it yourself .  this and many other points we will make now and in the near future during your apprenticeship .  you will see me again in a week .  by that time  i would like to have comments from you as to a certain problem which i now set before you .  i don t want complete and rigorous mathematical treatment .  that would take a year for an expert  and not a week for you .  but i do want an indication as to trends and directions   you have here a fork in the plan at a period in time of about half a century ago .  the necessary details are included .  you will note that the path followed by the assumed reality diverges from all the plotted predictions  its probability being under one percent .  you will estimate for how long the divergence may continue before it becomes uncorrectable .  estimate also the probable end if uncorrected  and a reasonable method of correction .    the student flipped the viewer at random and looked stonily at the passages presented on the tiny  built in screen .   he said   why this particular problem  speaker .  it obviously has significance other than purely academic .     thank you  my boy .  you are as quick as i had expected .  the problem is not supposititious .  nearly half a century ago  the mule burst into galactic history and for ten years was the largest single fact in the universe .  he was unprovided for  uncalculated for .  he bent the plan seriously  but not fatally .    to stop him before he did become fatal  however  we were forced to take active part against him .  we revealed our existence  and infinitely worse  a portion of our power .  the first foundation has learned of us  and their actions are now predicated on that knowledge .  observe in the problem presented .  here .  and here .    naturally  you will not speak of this to anyone .    there was an appalled pause  as realization seeped into the student .  he said   then the seldon plan has failed .     not yet .  it merely may have failed .  the probabilities of success are still twenty one point four percent  as of the last assessment .           the conspirators  for dr .  darell and pelleas anthor  the evenings passed in friendly intercourse  the days in pleasant unimportance .  it might have been an ordinary visit .  dr .  darell introduced the young man as a cousin from across space  and interest was dulled by the clich   .   somehow  however  among the small talk  a name might be mentioned .  there would be an easy thoughtfulness .  dr .  darell might say   no   or he might say   yes .   a call on the open communi wave issued a casual invitation   want you to meet my cousin .    and arcadia s preparations proceeded in their own manner .  in fact  her actions might be considered the least straightforward of all .   for instance  she induced olynthus dam at school to donate to her a home built  self contained sound receiver by methods which indicated a future for her that promised peril to all males with whom she might come into contact .  to avoid details  she merely exhibited such an interest in olynthus  self publicized hobby     he had a home workshop combined with such a well modulated transfer of this interest to olynthus  own pudgy features  that the unfortunate youth found himself     discoursing at great and animated length upon the principles of the hyperwave motor     becoming dizzyingly aware of the great  absorbed eyes that rested so lightly upon his  and    forcing into her willing hands his own greatest creation  the aforesaid sound receiver .   arcadia cultivated olynthus in diminishing degree thereafter for just long enough to remove all suspicion that the sound receiver had been the cause of the friendship .  for months afterwards  olynthus felt the memory of that short period in his life over and over again with the tendrils of his mind  until finally  for lack of further addition  he gave up and let it slip away .   when the seventh evening came  and five men sat in the darell living room with food within and tobacco without  arcadia s desk upstairs was occupied by this quite unrecognizable home product of olynthus  ingenuity .   five men then .  dr .  darell  of course  with graying hair and meticulous clothing  looking somewhat older than his forty two years .  pelleas author  serious and quick eyed at the moment looking young and unsure of himself .  and the three new men  jole turbor  visicastor  bulky and plump lipped  dr .  elvett semic  professor emeritus of physics at the university  scrawny and wrinkled  his clothes only half filled  homir munn  librarian  lanky and terribly ill at ease .   dr .  darell spoke easily  in a normal  matter of fact tone   this gathering has been arranged  gentlemen  for a trifle more than merely social reasons .  you may have guessed this .  since you have been deliberately chosen because of your backgrounds  you may also guess the danger involved .  i won t minimize it  but i will point out that we are all condemned men  in any case .    you will notice that none of you have been invited with any attempt at secrecy .  none of you have been asked to come here unseen .  the windows are not adjusted to non insight .  no screen of any sort is about the room .  we have only to attract the attention of the enemy to be ruined  and the best way to attract that attention is to assume a false and theatrical secrecy .    hah  thought arcadia  bending over the voices coming     a bit screechily     out of the little box .     do you understand that .    elvett semic twitched his lower lip and bared his teeth in the screwup  wrinkled gesture that preceded his every sentence .   oh  get on with it .  tell us about the youngster .    dr .  darell said   pelleas anthor is his name .  he was a student of my old colleague  kleise  who died last year .  kleise sent me his brain pattern to the fifth sublevel  before he died  which pattern has been now checked against that of the man before you .  you know  of course  that a brain pattern cannot be duplicated that far  even by men of the science of psychology .  if you don t know that  you ll have to take my word for it .    turbor said  purse lipped   we might as well make a beginning somewheres .  we ll take your word for it  especially since you re the greatest electroneurologist in the galaxy now that kleise is dead .  at least  that is the way i ve described you in my visicast comment  and i even believe it myself .  how old are you  anthor .     twenty nine  mr .  turbor .     hm m m .  and are you an electroneurologist  too .  a great one .     just a student of the science .  but i work hard  and i ve had the benefit of kleise s training .    munn broke in .  he had a slight stammer at periods of tension .   i  .  .  .  i wish you d g  .  .  .  get started .  i think everyone s t  .  .  .  talking too much .    dr .  darell lifted an eyebrow in munn s direction .  you re right  homir .  take over  pelleas .     not for a while   said pelleas anthor  slowly   because before we can get started     although i appreciate mr .  munn s sentiment     i must request brain wave data .    darell frowned .   what is this  anthor .  what brain wave data do you refer to .     the patterns of all of you .  you have taken mine  dr .  darell .  i must take yours and those of the rest of you .  and i must take the measurements myself .    turbor said   there s no reason for him to trust us  darell .  the young man is within his rights .     thank you   said anthor .   if you   ll lead the way to your laboratory then  dr .  darell  well proceed .  i took the liberty this morning of checking your apparatus .    the science of electroencephalography was at once new and old .  it was old in the sense that the knowledge of the microcurrents generated by nerve cells of living beings belonged to that immense category of human knowledge whose origin was completely lost it was knowledge that stretched back as far as the earliest remnants of human history     and yet it was new  too .  the fact of the existence of microcurrents slumbered through the tens of thousands of years of galactic empire as one of those vivid and whimsical  but quite useless  items of human knowledge .  some had attempted to form classifications of waves into waking and sleeping  calm and excited  well and ill     but even the broadest conceptions had had their hordes of vitiating exceptions .   others had tried to show the existence of brain wave groups  analogous to the well known blood groups  and to show that external environment was the defining factor .  these were the race minded people who claimed that man could be divided into subspecies .  but such a philosophy could make no headway against the overwhelming ecumenical drive involved in the fact of galactic empire     one political unit covering twenty million stellar systems  involving all of man from the central world of trantor     now a gorgeous and impossible memory of the great past     to the loneliest asteroid on the periphery .   and then again  in a society given over  as that of the first empire was  to the physical sciences and inanimate technology  there was a vague but mighty sociological push away from the study of the mind .  it was less respectable because less immediately useful  and it was poorly financed since it was less profitable .   after the disintegration of the first empire  there came the fragmentation of organized science  back  back     past even the fundamentals of atomic power into the chemical power of coal and oil .  the one exception to this  of course  was the first foundation where the spark of science  revitalized and grown more intense was maintained and fed to flame .  yet there  too  it was the physical that ruled  and the brain  except for surgery  was neglected ground .   hari seldon was the first to express what afterwards came to be accepted as truth .    neural microcurrents   he once said   carry within them the spark of every varying impulse and response  conscious and unconscious .  the brain waves recorded on neatly squared paper in trembling peaks and troughs are the mirrors of the combined thought pulses of billions of cells .  theoretically  analysis should reveal the thoughts and emotions of the subject  to the last and least .  differences should be detected that are due not only to gross physical defects  inherited or acquired  but also to shifting states of emotion  to advancing education and experience  even to something as subtle as a change in the subject s philosophy of life .    but even seldon could approach no further than speculation .   and now for fifty years  the men of the first foundation had been tearing at that incredibly vast and complicated storehouse of new knowledge .  the approach  naturally  was made through new techniques     as  for example  the use of electrodes at skull sutures by a newly developed means which enabled contact to be made directly with the gray cells  without even the necessity of shaving a patch of skull .  and then there was a recording device which automatically recorded the brain wave data as an overall total  and as separate functions of six independent variables .   what was most significant  perhaps  was the growing respect in which encephalography and the encephalographer was held .  kleise  the greatest of them  sat at scientific conventions on an equal basis with the physicist .  dr .  darell  though no longer active in the science  was known for his brilliant advances in encephalographic analysis almost as much as for the fact that he was the son of bayta darell  the great heroine of the past generation .   and so now  dr .  darell sat in his own chair  with the delicate touch of the feathery electrodes scarcely hinting at pressure upon his skull  while the vacuum incased needles wavered to and fro .  his back was to the recorder     otherwise  as was well known  the sight of the moving curves induced an unconscious effort to control them  with noticeable results     but he knew that the central dial was expressing the strongly rhythmic and little varying sigma curve  which was to be expected of his own powerful and disciplined mind .  it would be strengthened and purified in the subsidiary dial dealing with the cerebellar wave .  there would be the sharp  near discontinuous leaps from the frontal lobe  and the subdued shakiness from the subsurface regions with its narrow range of frequencies     he knew his own brain wave pattern much as an artist might be perfectly aware of the color of his eyes .   pelleas anthor made no comment when darell rose from the reclining chair .  the young man abstracted the seven recordings  glanced at them with the quick  all embracing eyes of one who knows exactly what tiny facet of near nothingness is being looked for .    if you don t mind  dr .  semic .    semic s age yellowed face was serious .  electroencephalography was a science of his old age of which he knew little  an upstart that he faintly resented .  he knew that he was old and that his wave pattern would show it .  the wrinkles on his face showed it  the stoop in his walk  the shaking of his hand     but they spoke only of his body .  the brain wave patterns might show that his mind was old  too .  an embarrassing and unwarranted invasion of a man s last protecting stronghold  his own mind .   the electrodes were adjusted .  the process did not hurt  of course  from beginning to end .  there was just that tiny tingle  far below the threshold of sensation .   and then came turbor  who sat quietly and unemotionally through the fifteen minute process  and munn  who jerked at the first touch of the electrodes and then spent the session rolling his eyes as though he wished he could turn them backwards and watch through a hole in his occiput .    and now     said darell  when all was done .    and now   said anthor  apologetically   there is one more person in the house .    darell  frowning  said   my daughter .     yes .  i suggested that she stay home tonight  if you ll remember .     for encephalographical analysis .  what in the galaxy for .     i cannot proceed without it .    darell shrugged and climbed the stairs .  arcadia  amply warned  had the sound receiver off when he entered  then followed him down with mild obedience .  it was the first time in her life     except for the taking of her basic mind pattern as an infant  for identification and registration purposes     that she found herself under the electrodes .    may i see   she asked  when it was over  holding out her hand .   dr .  darell said   you would not understand  arcadia .  isn t it time for you to go to bed .     yes  father   she said  demurely .   good night  all .    she ran up the stairs and plumped into bed with a minimum of basic preparation .  with olynthus  sound receiver propped beside her pillow  she felt like a character out of a book film  and hugged every moment of it close to her chest in an ecstasy of  spy stuff .    the first words she heard were anthor s and they were   the analyses  gentlemen  are all satisfactory .  the child s as well .    child  she thought disgustedly  and bristled at anthor in the darkness .   anthor had opened his briefcase now  and out of it  he took several dozen brain wave records .  they were not originals .  nor had the briefcase been fitted with an ordinary lock .  had the key been held in any hand other than his own  the contents thereof would have silently and instantly oxidized to an indecipherable ash .  once removed from the briefcase  the records did so anyway after half an hour .   but during their short lifetime  anthor spoke quickly .   i have the records here of several minor government officials at anacreon .  this is a psychologist at locris university  this an industrialist at siwenna .  the rest are as you see .    they crowded closely .  to all but darell  they were so many quivers on parchment .  to darell  they shouted with a million tongues .   anthor pointed lightly   i call your attention  dr .  darell  to the plateau region among the secondary tauian waves in the frontal lobe  which is what all these records have in common .  would you use my analytical rule  sir  to check my statement .    the analytical rule might be considered a distant relation     as a skyscraper is to a shack     of that kindergarten toy  the logarithmic slide rule .  darell used it with the wristflip of long practice .  he made freehand drawings of the result and  as anthor stated  there were featureless plateaus in frontal lobe regions where strong swings should have been expected .    how would you interpret that  dr .  darell .   asked anthor .    i m not sure .  offhand  i don t see how it s possible .  even in cases of amnesia  there is suppression  but not removal .  drastic brain surgery  perhaps .     oh  something s been cut out   cried anthor  impatiently   yes .  not in the physical sense  however .  you know  the mule could have done just that .  he could have suppressed completely all capacity for a certain emotion or attitude of mind  and leave nothing but just such a flatness .  or else       or else the second foundation could have done it .  is that it .   asked turbor  with a slow smile .   there was no real need to answer that thoroughly rhetorical question .    what made you suspicious  mr .  anthor .   asked munn .    it wasn t i .  it was dr .  kleise .  he collected brain wave patterns much as the planetary police do  but along different lines .  he specialized in intellectuals  government officials and business leaders .  you see  it s quite obvious that if the second foundation is directing the historical course of the galaxy     of us     that they must do it subtly and in as minimal a fashion as possible .  if they work through minds  as they must  it is the minds of people with influence  culturally  industrially  or politically .  and with those he concerned himself .     yes   objected munn   but is there corroboration .  how do these people act     i mean the ones with the plateau .  maybe it s all a perfectly normal phenomenon .   he looked hopelessly at the others out of his  somehow  childlike blue eyes  but met no encouraging return .    i leave that to dr .  darell   said anthor .   ask him how many times he s seen this phenomenon in his general studies  or in reported cases in the literature over the past generation .  then ask him the chances of it being discovered in almost one out of every thousand cases among the categories dr .  kleise studied .     i suppose that there is no doubt   said darell  thoughtfully   that these are artificial mentalities .  they have been tampered with .  in a way  i have suspected this       i know that  dr .  darell   said author .   i also know you once worked with dr .  kleise .  i would like to know why you stopped .    there wasn t actually hostility in his question .  perhaps nothing more than caution  but  at any rate  it resulted in a long pause .  darell looked from one to another of his guests  then said brusquely   because there was no point to kleise s battle .  he was competing with an adversary too strong for him .  he was detecting what we     he and i     knew he would detect     that we were not our own masters .  and i didn t want to know .  i had my self respect .  i liked to think that our foundation was captain of its collective soul  that our forefathers had not quite fought and died for nothing .  i thought it would be most simple to turn my face away as long as i was not quite sure .  i didn t need my position since the government pension awarded to my mother s family in perpetuity would take care of my uncomplicated needs .  my home laboratory would suffice to keep boredom away  and life would some day end    then kleise died      semic showed his teeth and said   this fellow kleise  i don t know him .  how did he die .    anthor cut in   he died .  he thought he would .  he told me half a year before that he was getting too close      now we re too c  .  .  .  close  too  aren t we .   suggested munn  dry mouthed  as his adam s apple jiggled .    yes   said anthor  flatly   but we were  anyway     all of us .  it s why you ve all been chosen .  i m kleise s student .  dr .  darell was his colleague .  jole turbor has been denouncing our blind faith in the saving hand of the second foundation on the air  until the government shut him off     through the agency  i might mention  of a powerful financier whose brain shows what kleise used to call the tamper plateau .  homir munn has the largest home collection of muliana     if i may use the phrase to signify collected data concerning the mule     in existence  and has published some papers containing speculation on the nature and function of the second foundation .  dr .  semic has contributed as much as anyone to the mathematics of encephalographic analysis  though i don t believe he realized that his mathematics could be so applied .    semic opened his eyes wide and chuckled gaspingly   no  young fellow .  i was analyzing intranuclear motions     the n body problem  you know .  i m lost in encephalography .     then we know where we stand .  the government can  of course  do nothing about the matter .  whether the mayor or anyone in his administration is aware of the seriousness of the situation  i don t know .  but this i do know     we five have nothing to lose and stand to gain much .  with every increase in our knowledge  we can widen ourselves in safe directions .  we are but a beginning  you understand .     how widespread   put in turbor   is this second foundation infiltration .     i don t know .  there s a flat answer .  all the infiltrations we have discovered were on the outer fringes of the nation .  the capital world may yet be clean  though even that is not certain     else i would not have tested you .  you were particularly suspicious  dr .  darell  since you abandoned research with kleise .  kleise never forgave you  you know .  i thought that perhaps the second foundation had corrupted you  but kleise always insisted that you were a coward .  you ll forgive me  dr .  darell  if i explain this to make my own position clear .  i  personally  think i understand your attitude  and  if it was cowardice  i consider it venial .    darell drew a breath before replying .   i ran away .  call it what you wish .  i tried to maintain our friendship  however  yet he never wrote nor called me until the day he sent me your brainwave data  and that was scarcely a week before he died       if you don t mind   interrupted homir munn  with a flash of nervous eloquence   i d  .  .  .  don t see what you think you re doing .  we re a p  .  .  .  poor bunch of conspirators  if we re just going to talk and talk and t  .  .  .  talk .  and i don t see what else we can do  anyway .  this is v  .  .  .  very childish .  b  .  .  .  brain waves and mumbo jumbo and all that .  is there just one thing you intend to do .    pelleas author s eyes were bright   yes  there is .  we need more information on the second foundation .  it s the prime necessity .  the mule spent the first five years of his rule in just that quest for information and failed     or so we have all been led to believe .  but then he stopped looking .  why .  because he failed .  or because he succeeded .     m  .  .  .  more talk   said munn  bitterly .   how are we ever to know .     if you ll listen to me    the mule s capital was on kalgan .  kalgan was not part of the foundation s commercial sphere of influence before the mule and it is not part of it now .  kalgan is ruled  at the moment  by the man  stettin  unless there s another palace revolution by tomorrow .  stettin calls himself first citizen and considers himself the successor of the mule .  if there is any tradition in that world  it rests with the super humanity and greatness of the mule     a tradition almost superstitious in intensity .  as a result  the mule s old palace is maintained as a shrine .  no unauthorized person may enter  nothing within has ever been touched .     well .     well  why is that so .  at times like these  nothing happens without a reason .  what if it is not superstition only that makes the mule s palace inviolate .  what if the second foundation has so arranged matters .  in short what if the results of the mule s five year search are within       oh  p  .  .  .  poppycock .     why not .   demanded anthor .   throughout its history the second foundation has hidden itself and interfered in galactic affairs in minimal fashion only .  i know that to us it would seem more logical to destroy the palace or  at the least  to remove the data .  but you must consider the psychology of these master psychologists .  they are seldons  they are mules and they work by indirection  through the mind .  they would never destroy or remove when they could achieve their ends by creating a state of mind .  eh .    no immediate answer  and anthor continued   and you  munn  are just the one to get the information we need .     i .   it was an astounded yell .  munn looked from one to the other rapidly   i can t do such a thing .  i m no man of action  no hero of any teleview .  i m a librarian .  if i can help you that way  all right  and i ll risk the second foundation  but i m not going out into space on any qu  .  .  .  quixotic thing like that .     now  look   said anthor  patiently   dr .  darell and i have both agreed that you re the man .  it s the only way to do it naturally .  you say you re a librarian .  fine .  what is your main field of interest .  muliana .  you already have the greatest collection of material on the mule in the galaxy .  it is natural for you to want more  more natural for you than for anyone else .  you could request entrance to the kalgan palace without arousing suspicion of ulterior motives .  you might be refused but you would not be suspected .  what s more  you have a one man cruiser .  you re known to have visited foreign planets during your annual vacation .  you ve even been on kalgan before .  don t you understand that you need only act as you always have .     but i can t just say   w  .  .  .  won t you kindly let me in to your most sacred shrine  m  .  .  .  mr .  first citizen .        why not .     because  by the galaxy  he won t let me .     all right  then .  so he won t then you ll come home and we   ll think of something else .    munn looked about in helpless rebellion .  he felt himself being talked into something he hated .  no one offered to help him extricate himself .   so in the end two decisions were made in dr .  darell s house .  the first was a reluctant one of agreement on the part of munn to take off into space as soon as his summer vacation began .   the other was a highly unauthorized decision on the part of a thoroughly unofficial member of the gathering  made as she clicked off a sound receiver and composed herself for a belated sleep .  this second decision does not concern us just yet .           approaching crisis  a week had passed on the second foundation  and the first speaker was smiling once again upon the student .    you must have brought me interesting results  or you would not be so filled with anger .    the student put his hand upon the sheaf of calculating paper he had brought with him and said   are you sure that the problem is a factual one .     the premises are true .  i have distorted nothing .     then i must accept the results  and i do not want to .     naturally .  but what have your wants to do with it .  well  tell me what disturbs you so .  no  no  put your derivations to one side .  i will subject them to analysis afterward .  meanwhile  talk to me .  let me judge your understanding .     well  then  speaker    it becomes very apparent that a gross overall change in the basic psychology of the first foundation has taken place .  as long as they knew of the existence of a seldon plan  without knowing any of the details thereof  they were confident but uncertain .  they knew they would succeed  but they didn t know when or how .  there was  therefore  a continuous atmosphere of tension and strain     which was what seldon desired .  the first foundation  in other words  could be counted upon to work at maximum potential .     a doubtful metaphor   said the first speaker   but i understand you .     but now  speaker  they know of the existence of a second foundation in what amounts to detail  rather merely than as an ancient and vague statement of seldon s .  they have an inkling as to its function as the guardian of the plan .  they know that an agency exists which watches their every step and will not let them fall .  so they abandon their purposeful stride and allow themselves to be carried upon a litter .  another metaphor  i m afraid .     nevertheless  go on .     and that very abandonment of effort  that growing inertia  that lapse into softness and into a decadent and hedonistic culture  means the ruin of the plan .  they must be self propelled .     is that all .     no  there is more .  the majority reaction is as described .  but a great probability exists for a minority reaction .  knowledge of our guardianship and our control will rouse among a few  not complacence  but hostility .  this follows from korillov s theorem       yes  yes .  i know the theorem .     i m sorry  speaker .  it is difficult to avoid mathematics .  in any case  the effect is that not only is the foundation s effort diluted  but part of it is turned against us  actively against us .     and is that all .     there remains one other factor of which the probability is moderately low       very good .  what is that .     while the energies of the first foundation were directed only to empire  while their only enemies were huge and outmoded hulks that remained from the shambles of the past  they were obviously concerned only with the physical sciences .  with us forming a new  large part of their environment  a change in view may well be imposed on them .  they may try to become psychologists       that change   said the first speaker  coolly   has already taken place .    the student s lips compressed themselves into a pale line .   then all is over .  it is the basic incompatibility with the plan .  speaker  would i have known of this if i had lived     outside .    the first speaker spoke seriously   you feel humiliated  my young man  because  thinking you understood so much so well  you suddenly find that many very apparent things were unknown to you .  thinking you were one of the lords of the galaxy  you suddenly find that you stand near to destruction .  naturally  you will resent the ivory tower in which you lived  the seclusion in which you were educated  the theories on which you were reared .    i once had that feeling .  it is normal .  yet it was necessary that in your formative years you have no direct contact with the galaxy  that you remain here  where all knowledge is filtered to you  and your mind carefully sharpened .  we could have shown you this  .  .  .  this part failure of the plan earlier and spared you the shock now  but you would not have understood the significance properly  as you now will .  then you find no solution at all to the problem .    the student shook his head and said hopelessly   none .     well  it is not surprising .  listen to me  young man .  a course of action exists and has been followed for over a decade .  it is not a usual course  but one that we have been forced into against our will .  it involves low probabilities  dangerous assumptions    we have even been forced to deal with individual reactions at times  because that was the only possible way  and you know that psychostatistics by its very nature has no meaning when applied to less than planetary numbers .     are we succeeding .   gasped the student .    there s no way of telling yet .  we have kept the situation stable so far     but for the first time in the history of the plan  it is possible for the unexpected actions of a single individual to destroy it .  we have adjusted a minimum number of outsiders to a needful state of mind  we have our agents     but their paths are planned .  they dare not improvise .  that should be obvious to you .  and i will not conceal the worst     if we are discovered  here  on this world  it will not only be the plan that is destroyed  but ourselves  our physical selves .  so you see  our solution is not very good .     but the little you have described does not sound like a solution at all  but like a desperate guess .     no .  let us say  an intelligent guess .     when is the crisis  speaker .  when will we know whether we have succeeded or not .     well within the year  no doubt .    the student considered that  then nodded his head .  he shook hands with the speaker .   well  it s good to know .    he turned on his heel and left .   the first speaker looked out silently as the window gained transparency .  past the giant structures to the quite  crowding stars .   a year would pass quickly .  would any of them  any of seldon s heritage  be alive at its end .           stowaway  it was a little over a month before the summer could be said to have started .  started  that is  to the extent that homir munn had written his final financial report of the fiscal year  seen to it that the substitute librarian supplied by the government was sufficiently aware of the subtleties of the post     last year s man had been quite unsatisfactory     and arranged to have his little cruiser the unimara     named after a tender and mysterious episode of twenty years past     taken out of its winter cobwebbery .   he left terminus in a sullen distemper .  no one was at the port to see him off .  that would not have been natural since no one ever had in the past .  he knew very well that it was important to have this trip in no way different from any he had made in the past  yet he felt drenched in a vague resentment .  he  homir munn  was risking his neck in derring doery of the most outrageous sort  and yet he left alone .   at least  so he thought .   and it was because he thought wrongly  that the following day was one of confusion  both on the unimara and in dr .  darell s suburban home .   it hit dr .  darell s home first  in point of time  through the medium of poli  the maid  whose month s vacation was now quite a thing of the past .  she flew down the stairs in a flurry and stutter .   the good doctor met her and she tried vainly to put emotion into words but ended by thrusting a sheet of paper and a cubical object at him .   he took them unwillingly and said   what s wrong  poli .     she s gone  doctor .     who s gone .     arcadia .     what do you mean  gone .  gone where .  what are you talking about .    and she stamped her foot   i don t know .  she s gone  and there s a suitcase and some clothes gone with her and there s that letter .  why don t you read it  instead of just standing there .  oh  you men .    dr .  darell shrugged and opened the envelope .  the letter was not long  and except for the angular signature   arkady   was in the ornate and flowing handwriting of arcadia s transcriber .   dear father   it would have been simply too heartbreaking to say good by to you in person .  i might have cried like a little girl and you would have been ashamed of me .  so i m writing a letter instead to tell you how much iii miss you  even while i m having this perfectly wonderful summer vacation with uncle homir .  iii take good care of myself and it won t be long before i   m home again .  meanwhile  i m leaving you something that s all my own .  you can have it now .   your loving daughter   arkady .     he read it through several times with an expression that grew blanker each time .  he said stiffly   have you read this  poli .    poli was instantly on the defensive .   i certainly can t be blamed for that  doctor .  the envelope has  poli  written on the outside  and i had no way of telling there was a letter for you on the inside .  i m no snoop  doctor  and in the years i ve been with      darell held up a placating hand   very well  poli .  it s not important .  i just wanted to make sure you understood what had happened .    he was considering rapidly .  it was no use telling her to forget the matter .  with regard to the enemy   forget  was a meaningless word  and the advice  insofar as it made the matter more important  would have had an opposite effect .   he said instead   she s a queer little girl  you know .  very romantic .  ever since we arranged to have her go off on a space trip this summer  she s been quite excited .     and just why has no one told me about this space trip .     it was arranged while you were away  and we forgot it s nothing more complicated than that .    poli s original emotions now concentrated themselves into a single  overwhelming indignation   simple  is it .  the poor chick has gone off with one suitcase  without a decent stitch of clothes to her  and alone at that .  how long will she be away .     now i won t have you worrying about it  poli .  there will be plenty of clothes for her on the ship .  it s been all arranged .  will you tell mr .  anthor  that i want to see him .  oh  and first     is this the object that arcadia has left for me .   he turned it over in his hand .   poli tossed her head .   i m sure i don t know .  the letter was on top of it and that s every bit i can tell you .  forget to tell me  indeed .  if her mother were alive      darell  waved her away .   please call mr .  anthor .    anthor s viewpoint on the matter differed radically from that of arcadia s father .  he punctuated his initial remarks with clenched fists and tom hair  and from there  passed on to bitterness .    great space  what are you waiting for .  what are we both waiting for .  get the spaceport on the viewer and have them contact the unimara .     softly  pelleas  she s my daughter .     but it s not your galaxy .     now  wait .  she s an intelligent girl  pelleas  and she s thought this thing out carefully .  we had better follow her thoughts while this thing is fresh .  do you know what this thing is .     no .  why should it matter what it is .     because it s a sound receiver .     that thing .     it s homemade  but it will work .  i ve tested it .  don t you see .  it s her way of telling us that she s been a party to our conversations of policy .  she knows where homir munn is going and why .  she s decided it would be exciting to go along .     oh  great space   groaned the younger man .   another mind for the second foundation to pick .     except that there s no reason why the second foundation should  a priori  suspect a fourteen year old girl of being a danger     unless we do anything to attract attention to her  such as calling back a ship out of space for no reason other than to take her off .  do you forget with whom we re dealing .  how narrow the margin is that separates us from discovery .  how helpless we are thereafter .     but we can t have everything depend on an insane child .    she s not insane  and we have no choice .  she need not have written the letter  but she did it to keep us from going to the police after a lost child .  her letter suggests that we convert the entire matter into a friendly offer on the part of munn to take an old friend s daughter off for a short vacation .  and why not .  he s been my friend for nearly twenty years .  he s known her since she was three  when i brought her back from trantor .  it s a perfectiy natural thing  and  in fact  ought to decrease suspicion .  a spy does not carry a fourteen year old niece about with him .     so .  and what will munn do when he finds her .    dr .  darell heaved his eyebrows once .   i can t say     but i presume she   ll handle him .    but the house was somehow very lonely at night and dr .  darell found that the fate of the galaxy made remarkably little difference while his daughter s mad little life was in danger .   the excitement on the unimara  if involving fewer people  was considerably more intense .   in the luggage compartment  arcadia found herself  in the first place  aided by experience  and in the second  hampered by the reverse .   thus  she met the initial acceleration with equanimity and the more subtle nausea that accompanied the inside outness of the first jump through hyperspace with stoicism .  both had been experienced on space hops before  and she was tensed for them .  she knew also that luggage compartments were included in the ship s ventilation system and that they could even be bathed in wall light .  this last  however  she excluded as being too unconscionably unromantic .  she remained in the dark  as a conspirator should  breathing very softly  and listening to the little miscellany of noises that surrounded homir munn .   they were undistinguished noises  the kind made by a man alone .  the shuffling of shoes  the rustle of fabric against metal  the soughing of an upholstered chair seat retreating under weight  the sharp click of a control unit  or the soft slap of a palm over a photoelectric cell .   yet  eventually  it was the lack of experience that caught up with arcadia .  in the book films and on the videos  the stowaway seemed to have such an infinite capacity for obscurity .  of course  there was always the danger of dislodging something which would fall with a crash  or of sneezing     in videos you were almost sure to sneeze  it was an accepted matter .  she knew all this  and was careful .  there was also the realization that thirst and hunger might be encountered .  for this  she was prepared with ration cans out of the pantry .  but yet things remained that the films never mentioned  and it dawned upon arcadia with a shock that  despite the best intentions in the world  she could stay hidden in the closet for only a limited time .   and on a one man sports cruiser  such as the unimara  living space consisted  essentially  of a single room  so that there wasn t even the risky possibility of sneaking out of the compartment while munn was engaged elsewhere .   she waited frantically for the sounds of sleep to arise .  if only she knew whether he snored .  at least she knew where the bunk was and she could recognize the rolling protest of one when she heard it .  there was a long breath and then a yawn .  she waited through a gathering silence  punctuated by the bunk s soft protest against a changed position or a shifted leg .   the door of the luggage compartment opened easily at the pressure of her finger  and her craning neck     there was a definite human sound that broke off sharply .   arcadia solidified .  silence .  still silence .   she tried to poke her eyes outside the door without moving her head and failed .  the head followed the eyes .   homir munn was awake  of course     reading in bed  bathed in the soft  unspreading bed light  staring into the darkness with wide eyes  and groping one hand stealthily under the pillow .   arcadia s head moved sharply back of itself .  then  the light went out entirely and munn s voice said with shaky sharpness   i ve got a blaster  and i m shooting  by the galaxy      and arcadia wailed   it s only me .  don t shoot .    remarkable what a fragile flower romance is .  a gun with a nervous operator behind it can spoil the whole thing .   the light was back on     all over the ship     and munn was sitting up in bed .  the somewhat grizzled hair on his thin chest and the sparse one day growth on his chin lent him an entirely fallacious appearance of disreputability .   arcadia stepped out  yanking at her metallene jacket which was supposed to be guaranteed wrinkleproof .   after a wild moment in which he almost jumped out of bed  but remembered  and instead yanked the sheet up to his shoulders  munn gargled   w  .  .  .  wha  .  .  .  what      he was completely incomprehensible .   arcadia said meekly   would you excuse me for a minute .  i ve got to wash my hands .   she knew the geography of the vessel  and slipped away quickly .  when she returned  with her courage oozing back  homir munn was standing before her with a faded bathrobe on the outside and a brilliant fury on the inside .    what the black holes of space are you d  .  .  .  doing aboard this ship .  h  .  .  .  how did you get on here .  what do you th  .  .  .  think i m supposed to do with you .  what s going on here .    he might have asked questions indefinitely  but arcadia interrupted sweetly   i just wanted to come along  uncle homir .     why .  i m not going anywhere .     you re going to kalgan for information about the second foundation .    and munn let out a wild howl and collapsed completely .  for one horrified moment  arcadia thought he would have hysterics or beat his head against the wall .  he was still holding the blaster and her stomach grew ice cold as she watched it .    watch out    take it easy     was all she could think of to say .   but he struggled back to relative normality and threw the blaster on to the bunk with a force that should have set it off and blown a hole through the ship s hull .    how did you get on .   he asked slowly  as though gripping each word with his teeth very carefully to prevent it from trembling before letting it out .    it was easy .  i just came into the hangar with my suitcase  and said   mr .  munn s baggage .   and the man in charge just waved his thumb without even looking up .     i ll have to take you back  you know   said homir  and there was a sudden wild glee within him at the thought .  by space  this wasn t his fault .    you can t   said arcadia  calmly   it would attract attention .     what .     you know .  the whole purpose of your going to kalgan was because it was natural for you to go and ask for permission to look into the mule s records .  and you ve got to be so natural that you re to attract no attention at all .  if you go back with a girl stowaway  it might even get into the tele news reports .     where did you g  .  .  .  get those notions about kalgan .  these  .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  childish     he was far too flippant for conviction  of course  even to one who knew less than did arcadia .    i heard   she couldn t avoid pride completely   with a sound recorder .  i know all about it     so you ve got to let me come along .     what about your father .   he played a quick trump .   for all he knows  you re kidnapped  .  .  .  dead .     i left a note   she said  overtrumping   and he probably knows he mustn t make a fuss  or anything .  you ll probably get a space gram from him .    to munn the only explanation was sorcery  because the receiving signal sounded wildly two seconds after she finished .   she said   that s my father  i bet   and it was .   the message wasn t long and it was addressed to arcadia .  it said   thank you for your lovely present  which i m sure you put to good use .  have a good time .     you see   she said   that s instructions .    homir grew used to her .  after a while  he was glad she was there .  eventually  he wondered how he would have made it without her .  she prattied .  she was excited .  most of all  she was completely unconcerned .  she knew the second foundation was the enemy  yet it didn t bother her .  she knew that on kalgan  he was to deal with a hostile officialdom  but she could hardly wait .   maybe it came of being fourteen .   at any rate  the week long trip now meant conversation rather than introspection .  to be sure  it wasn t a very enlightening conversation  since it concerned  almost entirely  the girl s notions on the subject of how best to treat the lord of kalgan .  amusing and nonsensical  and yet delivered with weighty deliberation .   homir found himself actually capable of smiling as he listened and wondered out of just which gem of historical fiction she got her twisted notion of the great universe .   it was the evening before the last jump .  kalgan was a bright star in the scarcely twinkling emptiness of the outer reaches of the galaxy .  the ship s telescope made it a sparkling blob of barely perceptible diameter .   arcadia sat cross legged in the good chair .  she was wearing a pair of slacks and a none too roomy shirt that belonged to homir .  her own more feminine wardrobe had been washed and ironed for the landing .   she said   i m going to write historical novels  you know .   she was quite happy about the trip .  uncle homir didn t the least mind listening to her and it made conversation so much more pleasant when you could talk to a really intelligent person who was serious about what you said .   she continued   i ve read books and books about all the great men of foundation history .  you know  like seldon  hardin  mallow  devers and all the rest .  i ve even read most of what you ve written about the mule  except that it isn t much fun to read those parts where the foundation loses .  wouldn t you rather read a history where they skipped the silly  tragic parts .     yes  i would   munn assured her  gravely .   but it wouldn t be a fair history  would it  arkady .  you d never get academic respect  unless you give the whole story .     oh  poof .  who cares about academic respect .   she found him delightful .  he hadn t missed calling her arkady for days .   my novels are going to be interesting and are going to sell and be famous .  what s the use of writing books unless you sell them and become well known .  i don t want just some old professors to know me .  it s got to be everybody .    her eyes darkened with pleasure at the thought and she wriggled into a more comfortable position .   in fact  as soon as i can get father to let me  i m going to visit trantor  so s i can get background material on the first empire  you know .  i was born on trantor  did you know that .    he did  but he said   you were .   and put just the right amount of amazement into his voice .  he was rewarded with something between a beam and a simper .    uh huh .  my grandmother  .  .  .  you know  bayta darell  you ve heard of her  .  .  .  was on trantor once with my grandfather .  in fact  that s where they stopped the mule  when all the galaxy was at his feet  and my father and mother went there also when they were first married .  i was born there .  i even lived there till mother died  only i was just three then  and i don t remember much about it .  were you ever on trantor  uncle homir .     no  can t say i was .   he leaned back against the cold bulkhead and listened idly .  kalgan was very close  and he felt his uneasiness flooding back .    isn t it just the most romantic world .  my father says that under stannel v  it had more people than any ten worlds nowadays .  he says it was just one big world of metals     one big city     that was the capital of all the galaxy .  he s shown me pictures that he took on trantor .  it s all in ruins now  but it s still stupendous .  i d just love to see it again .  in fact  .  .  .  homir .     yes .     why don t we go there  when we re finished with kalgan .    some of the fright hurtled back into his face .   what .  now don t start on that .  this is business  not pleasure .  remember that .     but it is business  she squeaked .   there might be incredible amounts of information on trantor  don t you think so .     no  i don t he scrambled to his feet  now untangle yourself from the computer .  we ve got to make the last jump  and then you turn in .   one good thing about landing  anyway  he was about fed up with trying to sleep on an overcoat on the metal floor .   the calculations were not difficult .  the  space route handbook  was quite explicit on the foundation kalgan route .  there was the momentary twitch of the timeless passage through hyperspace and the final light year dropped away .   the sun of kalgan was a sun now     large  bright  and yellow white  invisible behind the portholes that had automatically closed on the sun lit side .   kalgan was only a night s sleep away .           lord  of all the worlds of the galaxy  kalgan undoubtedly had the most unique history .  that of the planet terminus  for instance  was that of an almost uninterrupted rise .  that of trantor  once capital of the galaxy  was that of an almost uninterrupted fall .  but kalgan     kalgan first gained fame as the pleasure world of the galaxy two centuries before the birth of hari seldon .  it was a pleasure world in the sense that it made an industry     and an immensely profitable one  at that     out of amusement .   and it was a stable industry .  it was the most stable industry in the galaxy .  when all the galaxy perished as a civilization  little by little  scarcely a feather s weight of catastrophe fell upon kalgan .  no matter how the economy and sociology of the neighboring sectors of the galaxy changed  there was always an elite  and it is always the characteristic of an elite that it possesses leisure as the great reward of its elite hood .   kalgan was at the service  therefore  successively     and successfully     of the effete and perfumed dandies of the imperial court with their sparkling and libidinous ladies  of the rough and raucous warlords who ruled in iron the worlds they had gained in blood  with their unbridled and lascivious wenches  of the plump and luxurious businessmen of the foundation  with their lush and flagitious mistresses .   it was quite undiscriminating  since they all had money .  and since kalgan serviced all and barred none  since its commodity was in unfailing demand  since it had the wisdom to interfere in no world s politics  to stand on no one s legitimacy  it prospered when nothing else did  and remained fat when all grew thin .   that is  until the mule .  then  somehow  it fell  too  before a conqueror who was impervious to amusement  or to anything but conquest .  to him all planets were alike  even kalgan .   so for a decade  kalgan found itself in the strange role of galactic metropolis  mistress of the greatest empire since the end of the galactic empire itself .   and then  with the death of the mule  as sudden as the zoom  came the drop .  the foundation broke away .  with it and after it  much of the rest of the mule s dominions .  fifty years later there was left only the bewildering memory of that short space of power  like an opium dream .  kalgan never quite recovered .  it could never return to the unconcerned pleasure world it had been  for the spell of power never quite releases its bold .  it lived instead under a succession of men whom the foundation called the lords of kalgan  but who styled themselves first citizen of the galaxy  in imitation of the mule s only title  and who maintained the fiction that they were conquerors too .   the current lord of kalgan had held that position for five months .  he had gained it originally by virtue of his position at the head of the kalganian navy  and through a lamentable lack of caution on the part of the previous lord .  yet no one on kalgan was quite stupid enough to go into the question of legitimacy too long or too closely .  these things happened  and are best accepted .   yet that sort of survival of the fittest in addition to putting a premium on bloodiness and evil  occasionally allowed capability to come to the fore as well .  lord stettin was competent enough and not easy to manage .   not easy for his eminence  the first minister  who  with fine impartiality  had served the last lord as well as the present  and who would  if he lived long enough  serve the next as honestly .   nor easy for the lady callia  who was stettin s more than friend  yet less than wife .   in lord stettin s private apartments the three were alone that evening .  the first citizen  bulky and glistening in the admiral s uniform that he affected  scowled from out the unupholstered chair in which he sat as stiffly as the plastic of which it was composed .  his first minister lev meirus  faced him with a far off unconcern  his long  nervous fingers stroking absently and rhythmically the deep line that curved from hooked nose along gaunt and sunken cheek to the point  nearly  of the gray bearded chin .  the lady callia disposed of herself gracefully on the deeply furred covering of a foamite couch  her full lips trembling a bit in an unheeded pout .    sir   said meirus     it was the only title adhering to a lord who was styled only first citizen   you lack a certain view of the continuity of history .  your own life  with its tremendous revolutions  leads you to think of the course of civilization as something equally amenable to sudden change .  but it is not .     the mule showed otherwise .     but who can follow in his footsteps .  he was more than man  remember .  and be  too  was not entirely successful .     poochie   whimpered the lady callia  suddenly  and then shrank into herself at the furious gesture from the first citizen .   lord stettin said  harshly   do not interrupt  callia .  meirus  i am tired of inaction .  my predecessor spent his life polishing the navy into a finely turned instrument that has not its equal in the galaxy .  and he died with the magnificent machine lying idle .  am i to continue that .  i  an admiral of the navy .    how long before the machine rusts .  at present  it is a drain on the treasury and returns nothing .  its officers long for dominion  its men for loot .  all kalgan desires the return of empire and glory .  are you capable of understanding that .     these are but words that you use  but i grasp your meaning .  dominion  loot  glory     pleasant when they are obtained  but the process of obtaining them is often risky and always unpleasant .  the first fine flush may not last .  and in all history  it has never been wise to attack the foundation .  even the mule would have been wiser to refrain      there were tears in the lady callia s blue  empty eyes .  of late  poochie scarcely saw her  and now  when he had promised the evening to her  this horrible  thin  gray man  who always looked through her rather than at her  had forced his way in .  and poochie let him .  she dared not say anything  was frightened even of the sob that forced its way out .   but stettin was speaking now in the voice she hated  hard and impatient .  he was saying   you re a slave to the far past .  the foundation is greater in volume and population  but they are loosely knit and will fall apart at a blow .  what holds them together these days is merely inertia  an inertia i am strong enough to smash .  you are hypnotized by the old days when only the foundation had atomic power .  they were able to dodge the last hammer blows of the dying empire and then faced only the unbrained anarchy of the warlords who would counter the foundation s atomic vessels only with hulks and relics .    but the mule  my dear meirus  has changed that .  he spread the knowledge  that the foundation had hoarded to itself  through half the galaxy and the monopoly in science is gone forever .  we can match them .     and the second foundation .   questioned meirus  coolly .    and the second foundation .   repeated stettin as coolly .   do you know its intentions .  it took ten years to stop the mule  if  indeed  it was the factor  which some doubt .  are you unaware that a good many of the foundation s psychologists and sociologists are of the opinion that the seldon plan has been completely disrupted since the days of the mule .  if the plan has gone  then a vacuum exists which i may fill as well as the next man .     our knowledge of these matters is not great enough to warrant the gamble .     our knowledge  perhaps  but we have a foundation visitor on the planet .  did you know that .  a homir munn     who  i understand  has written articles on the mule  and has expressed exactly that opinion  that the seldon plan no longer exists .    the first minister nodded   i have heard of him  or at least of his writings .  what does he desire .     he asks permission to enter the mule s palace .     indeed .  it would be wise to refuse .  it is never advisable to disturb the superstitions with which a planet is held .     i will consider that     and we will speak again .    meirus bowed himself out .   lady callia said tearfully   are you angry with me  poochie .   stettin turned on her savagely .   have i not told you before never to call me by that ridiculous name in the presence of others .     you used to like it .     well  i don t any more  and it is not to happen again .    he stared at her darkly .  it was a mystery to him that he tolerated her these days .  she was a soft  empty headed thing  comfortable to the touch  with a pliable affection that was a convenient facet to a hard life .  yet  even that affection was becoming wearisome .  she dreamed of marriage  of being first lady .   ridiculous .   she was all very well when he had been an admiral only     but now as first citizen and future conqueror  he needed more .  he needed heirs who could unite his future dominions  something the mule had never had  which was why his empire did not survive his strange nonhuman life .  he  stettin  needed someone of the great historic families of the foundation with whom he could fuse dynasties .   he wondered testily why he did not rid himself of callia now .  it would be no trouble .  she would whine a bit    he dismissed the thought .  she had her points  occasionally .   callia was cheering up now .  the influence of graybeard was gone and her poochie s granite face was softening now .  she lifted herself in a single  fluid motion and melted toward him .    you re not going to scold me  are you .     no .   he patted her absently .   now just sit quietly for a while  will you .  i want to think .     about the man from the foundation .     yes .     poochie .   this was a pause .    what .     poochie  the man has a little girl with him  you said .  remember .  could i see her when she comes .  i never       now what do you think i want him to bring his brat with him for .  is my audience room to be a grammar school .  enough of your nonsense  callia .     but i   ll take care of her  poochie .  you won t even have to bother with her .  it s just that i hardly ever see children  and you know how i love them .    he looked at her sardonically .  she never tired of this approach .  she loved children  i . e .  his children  i . e .  his legitimate children  i . e .  marriage .  he laughed .    this particular little piece   he said   is a great girl of fourteen or fifteen .  she s probably as tall as you are .    callia looked crushed .   well  could i  anyway .  she could tell me about the foundation .  i ve always wanted to go there  you know .  my grandfather was a foundation man .  won t you take me there  sometime  poochie .    stettin smiled at the thought .  perhaps he would  as conqueror .  the good nature that the thought supplied him with made itself felt in his words   i will  i will .  and you can see the girl and talk foundation to her all you want .  but not near me  understand .     i won t bother you  honestly .  i ll have her in my own rooms .   she was happy again .  it was not very often these days that she was allowed to have her way .  she put her arms about his neck and after the slightest hesitation  she felt its tendons relax and the large head come softly down upon her shoulder .           lady  arcadia felt triumphant .  how life had changed since pelleas anthor had stuck his silly face up against her window     and all because she had the vision and courage to do what needed to be done .   here she was on kalgan .  she had been to the great central theater     the largest in the galaxy     and seen in person some of the singing stars who were famous even in the distant foundation .  she had shopped all on her own along the flowered path  fashion center of the gayest world in space .  and she had made her own selections because homir just didn t know anything about it at all .  the saleswomen raised no objections at all to long  shiny dresses with those vertical sweeps that made her look so tall     and foundation money went a long  long way .  homir had given her a ten credit bill and when she changed it to kalganian  kalganids   it made a terribly thick sheaf .   she had even had her hair redone     sort of half short in back  with two glistening curls over each temple .  and it was treated so that it looked goldier than ever  it just shone .   but this  this was best of all .  to be sure  the palace of lord stettin wasn t as grand and lavish as the theaters  or as mysterious and historical as the old palace of the mule     of which  so far they had only glimpsed the lonely towers in their air flight across the planet     but  imagine  a real lord .  she was rapt in the glory of it .   and not only that .  she was actually face to face with his mistress .  arcadia capitalized the word in her mind  because she knew the role such women had played in history  knew their glamour and power .  in fact  she had often thought of being an all powerful and glittering creature  herself  but somehow mistresses weren t in fashion at the foundation just then and besides  her father probably wouldn t let her  if it came to that .   of course  the lady callia didn t quite come up to arcadia s notion of the part .  for one thing  she was rather plump  and didn t look at all wicked and dangerous .  just sort of faded and near sighted .  her voice was high  too  instead of throaty  and     callia said   would you like more tea  child .     i ll have another cup  thank you  your grace       or was it your highness .   arcadia continued with a connoisseur s condescension   those are lovely pearls you are wearing  my lady .    on the whole   my lady  seemed best .     oh .  do you think so .   callia seemed vaguely pleased .  she removed them and let them swing milkily to and fro .   would you like them .  you can have them  if you like .     oh  my    you really mean     she found them in her hand  then  repelling them mournfully  she said   father wouldn t like it .     he wouldn t like the pearls .  but they re quite nice pearls .     he wouldn t like my taking them  i mean .  you re not supposed to take expensive presents from other people  he says .     you aren t .  but  .  .  .  i mean  this was a present to me from poo  .  .  .  from the first citizen .  was that wrong  do you suppose .    arcadia reddened .   i didn t mean     but callia had tired of the subject .  she let the pearls slide to the ground and said   you were going to tell me about the foundation .  please do so right now .    and arcadia was suddenly at a loss .  what does one say about a world dull to tears .  to her  the foundation was a suburban town  a comfortable house  the annoying necessities of education  the uninteresting eternities of a quiet life .  she said  uncertainly   it s just like you view in the book films  i suppose .     oh  do you view book films .  they give me such a headache when i try .  but do you know i always love video stories about your traders     such big  savage men .  it s always so exciting .  is your friend  mr .  munn  one of them .  he doesn t seem nearly savage enough .  most of the traders had beards and big bass voices  and were so domineering with women     don t you think so .    arcadia smiled  glassily .   that s just part of history  my lady .  i mean  when the foundation was young  the traders were the pioneers pushing back the frontiers and bringing civilization to the rest of the galaxy .  we learned all about that in school .  but that time has passed .  we don t have traders any more  just corporations and things .     really .  what a shame .  then what does mr .  munn do .  i mean  if he s not a trader .     uncle homir s a librarian .    callia put a hand to her lips and tittered .   you mean he takes care of book films .  oh  my .  it seems like such a silly thing for a grown man to do .     he s a very good librarian  my lady .  it is an occupation that is very highly regarded at the foundation .   she put down the little  iridescent teacup upon the milky metaled table surface .   her hostess was all concern .   but my dear child .  i m sure i didn t mean to offend you .  he must be a very intelligent man .  i could see it in his eyes as soon as i looked at him .  they were so  .  .  .  so intelligent .  and he must be brave  too  to want to see the mule s palace .     brave .   arcadia s internal awareness twitched .  this was what she was waiting for .  intrigue .  intrigue .  with great indifference  she asked  staring idly at her thumbtip   why must one be brave to wish to see the mule s palace .     didn t you know .   her eyes were round  and her voice sank .   there s a curse on it .  when he died  the mule directed that no one ever enter it until the empire of the galaxy is established .  nobody on kalgan would dare even to enter the grounds .    arcadia absorbed that .   but that s superstition       don t say that   callia was distressed .   poochie always says that .  he says it s useful to say it isn t though  in order to maintain his hold over the people .  but i notice he s never gone in himself .  and neither did thallos  who was first citizen before poochie .   a thought struck her and she was all curiosity again   but why does mr .  munn want to see the palace .    and it was here that arcadia s careful plan could be put into action .  she knew well from the books she had read that a ruler s mistress was the real power behind the throne  that she was the very well spring of influence .  therefore  if uncle homir failed with lord stettin     and she was sure he would     she must retrieve that failure with lady callia .  to be sure  lady callia was something of a puzzle .  she didn t seem at all bright .  but  well  all history proved     she said   there s a reason  my lady     but will you keep it in confidence .     cross my heart   said callia  making the appropriate gesture on the soft  billowing whiteness of her breast .   arcadia s thoughts kept a sentence ahead of her words .   uncle homir is a great authority on the mule  you know .  he s written books and books about it  and he thinks that all of galactic history has been changed since the mule conquered the foundation .     oh  my .     he thinks the seldon plan      callia clapped her hands .   i know about the seldon plan .  the videos about the traders were always all about the seldon plan .  it was supposed to arrange to have the foundation win all the time .  science had something to do with it  though i could never quite see how .  i always get so restless when i have to listen to explanations .  but you go right ahead  my dear .  it s different when you explain .  you make everything seem so clear .    arcadia continued   well  don t you see then that when the foundation was defeated by the mule  the seldon plan didn t work and it hasn t worked since .  so who will form the second empire .     the second empire .     yes  one must be formed some day  but how .  that s the problem  you see .  and there s the second foundation .     the second foundation .   she was quite completely lost .    yes  they re the planners of history that are following in the footsteps of seldon .  they stopped the mule because he was premature  but now  they may be supporting kalgan .     why .     because kalgan may now offer the best chance of being the nucleus for a new empire .    dimly  lady callia seemed to grasp that .   you mean poochie is going to make a new empire .     we can t tell for sure .  uncle homir thinks so  but hell have to see the mule s records to find out .     it s all very complicated   said lady callia  doubtfully .   arcadia gave up .  she had done her best .   lord stettin was in a more or less savage humor .  the session with the milksop from the foundation had been quite unrewarding .  it had been worse  it had been embarrassing .  to be absolute ruler of twenty seven worlds  master of the galaxy s greatest military machine  owner of the universe s most vaulting ambition     and left to argue nonsense with an antiquarian .   damnation .   he was to violate the customs of kalgan  was he .  to allow the mule s palace to be ransacked so that a fool could write another book .  the cause of science .  the sacredness of knowledge .  great galaxy .  were these catchwords to be thrown in his face in all seriousness .  besides     and his flesh prickled slightly     there was the matter of the curse .  he didn t believe in it  no intelligent man could .  but if he was going to defy it  it would have to be for a better reason than any the fool had advanced .    what do you want .   he snapped  and lady callia cringed visibly in the doorway .    are you busy .     yes .  i am busy .     but there s nobody here  poochie .  couldn t i even speak to you for a minute .     oh  galaxy .  what do you want .  now hurry .    her words stumbled .   the little girl told me they were going into the mule s palace .  i thought we could go with her .  it must be gorgeous inside .     she told you that  did she .  well  she isn t and we aren t .  now go tend your own business .  i ve had about enough of you .     but  poochie  why not .  aren t you going to let them .  the little girl said that you were going to make an empire .     i don t care what she said    what was that .   he strode to callia  and caught her firmly above the elbow  so that his fingers sank deeply into the soft flesh   what did she tell you .     you re hurting me .  i can t remember what she said  if you re going to look at me like that .    he released her  and she stood there for a moment  rubbing vainly at the red marks .  she whimpered   the little girl made me promise not to tell .     that s too bad .  tell me .  now .     well  she said the seldon plan was changed and that there was another foundation somewheres that was arranging to have you make an empire .  that s all .  she said mr .  munn was a very important scientist and that the mule s palace would have proof of all that .  that s every bit of what she said .  are you angry .    but stettin did not answer .  he left the room  hurriedly  with callia s cowlike eyes staring mournfully after him .  two orders were sent out over the official seal of the first citizen before the hour was up .  one had the effect of sending five hundred ships of the line into space on what were officially to be termed as  war games .   the other had the effect of throwing a single man into confusion .   homir munn ceased his preparations to leave when that second order reached him .  it was  of course  official permission to enter the palace of the mule .  he read and reread it with anything but joy .   but arcadia was delighted .  she knew what had happened .   or  at any rate  she thought she did .           anxiety  poli placed the breakfast on the table  keeping one eye on the table news recorder which quietly disgorged the bulletins of the day .  it could be done easily enough without loss of efficiency  this one eye absent business .  since all items of food were sterilely packed in containers which served as discardable cooking units  her duties vis a vis breakfast consisted of nothing more than choosing the menu  placing the items on the table  and removing the residue thereafter .   she clacked her tongue at what she saw and moaned softly in retrospect .    oh  people are so wicked   she said  and darell merely hemmed in reply .   her voice took on the high pitched rasp which she automatically assumed when about to bewail the evil of the world .   now why do these terrible kalganese      she accented the second syilable and gave it a long  a       do like that .  you d think they d give a body peace .  but no  it s just trouble  trouble  all the time .    now look at that headline   mobs riot before foundation consulate .     oh  would i like to give them a piece of my mind  if i could .  that s the trouble with people  they just don t remember .  they just don t remember  dr .  darell     got no memory at all .  look at the last war after the mule died     of course i was just a little girl then     and oh  the fuss and trouble .  my own uncle was killed  him being just in his twenties and only two years married  with a baby girl .  i remember him even yet     blond hair he had  and a dimple in his chin .  i have a trimensional cube of him somewheres      and now his baby girl has a son of her own in the navy and most like if anything happens      and we had the bombardment patrols  and all the old men taking turns in the stratospheric defense     i could imagine what they would have been able to do if the kalganese had come that far .  my mother used to tell us children about the food rationing and the prices and taxes .  a body could hardly make ends meet      you d think if they had sense people would just never want to start it again  just have nothing to do with it .  and i suppose it s not people that do it  either  i suppose even kalganese would rather sit at home with their families and not go fooling around in ships and getting killed .  it s that awful man  stettin .  it s a wonder people like that are let live .  he kills the old man     what s his name     thallos  and now he s just spoiling to be boss of everything .    and why he wants to fight us  i don t know .  he s bound to lose     like they always do .  maybe it s all in the plan  but sometimes i m sure it must be a wicked plan to have so much fighting and killing in it  though to be sure i haven t a word to say about hari seldon  who i m sure knows much more about that than i do and perhaps i m a fool to question him .  and the other foundation is as much to blame .  they could stop kalgan now and make everything fine .  they ll do it anyway in the end  and you d think they d do it before there s any damage done .    dr .  darell looked up .   did you say something  poli .    poli s eyes opened wide  then narrowed angrily .   nothing  doctor  nothing at all .  i haven t got a word to say .  a body could as soon choke to death as say a word in this house .  it s jump here  and jump there  but just try to say a word     and she went off simmering .   her leaving made as little impression on darell as did her speaking .   kalgan .  nonsense .  a merely physical enemy .  those had always been beaten .   yet he could not divorce himself of the current foolish crisis .  seven days earlier  the mayor had asked him to be administrator of research and development .  he had promised an answer today .   well     he stirred uneasily .  why  himself .  yet could he refuse .  it would seem strange  and he dared not seem strange .  after all  what did he care about kalgan .  to him there was only one enemy .  always had been .   while his wife had lived  he was only too glad to shirk the task  to hide .  those long  quiet days on trantor  with the ruins of the past about them .  the silence of a wrecked world and the forgetfulness of it all .   but she had died .  less than five years  all told  it had been  and after that he knew that he could live only by fighting that vague and fearful enemy that deprived him of the dignity of manhood by controlling his destiny  that made life a miserable struggle against a foreordained end  that made all the universe a hateful and deadly chess game .   call it sublimation  he  himself did can it that     but the fight gave meaning to his life .   first to the university of santanni  where he had joined dr .  kleise .  it had been five years well spent .   and yet kleise was merely a gatherer of data .  he could not succeed in the real task     and when darell had felt that as certainty  he knew it was time to leave .   kleise may have worked in secret  yet he had to have men working for him and with him .  he had subjects whose brains he probed .  he had a university that backed him .  all these were weaknesses .   kleise could not understand that  and he  darell  could not explain that .  they parted enemies .  it was well  they had to .  he had to leave in surrender     in case someone watched .   where kleise worked with charts  darell worked with mathematical concepts in the recesses of his mind .  kleise worked with many  darell with none .  kleise in a university  darell in the quiet of a suburban house .   and he was almost there .   a second foundationer is not human as far as his cerebrum is concerned .  the cleverest physiologist  the most subtle neurochemist might detect nothing     yet the difference must be there .   and since the difference was one of the mind  it was there that it must be detectable .   given a man like the mule     and there was no doubt that the second foundationers had the mule s powers  whether inborn or acquired     with the power of detecting and controlling human emotions  deduce from that the electronic circuit required  and deduce from that the last details of the encephalograph on which it could not help but be betrayed .   and now kleise had returned into his life  in the person of his ardent young pupil  anthor .   folly .  folly .  with his graphs and charts of people who had been tampered with .  he had learned to detect that years ago  but of what use was it .  he wanted the arm  not the tool .  yet he had to agree to join anthor  since it was the quieter course .   just as now he would become administrator of research and development .  it was the quieter course .  and so he remained a conspiracy within a conspiracy .   the thought of arcadia teased him for a moment  and he shuddered away from it .  left to himself  it would never have happened .  left to himself  no one would ever have been endangered but himself .  left to himself     he felt the anger rising against the dead kleise  the living anthor  all the well meaning fools     well  she could take care of herself .  she was a very mature little girl .   she could take care of herself .   it was a whisper in his mind     yet could she .   at the moment  that dr .  darell told himself mournfully that she could  she was sitting in the coldly austere anteroom of the executive offices of the first citizen of the galaxy .  for half an hour she had been sitting there  her eyes sliding slowly about the walls .  there had been two armed guards at the door when she had entered with homir munn .  they hadn t been there the other times .   she was alone  now  yet she sensed the unfriendliness of the very furnishings of the room .  and for the first time .   now  why should that be .   homir was with lord stettin .  well  was that wrong .   it made her furious .  in similar situations in the book films and the videos  the hero foresaw the conclusion  was prepared for it when it came  and she     she just sat there .  anything could happen .  anything .  and she just sat there .   well  back again .  think it back .  maybe something would come .   for two weeks  homir had nearly lived inside the mule s palace .  he had taken her once  with stettin s permission .  it was large and gloomily massive  shrinking from the touch of life to lie sleeping within its ringing memories  answering the footsteps with a hollow boom or a savage clatter .  she hadn t liked it .   better the great  gay highways of the capital city  the theaters and spectacles of a world essentially poorer than the foundation  yet spending more of its wealth on display .   homir would return in the evening  awed      it s a dream world for me   he would whisper .   if i could only chip the palace down stone by stone  layer by layer of the aluminum sponge .  if i could carry it back to terminus    what a museum it would make .    he seemed to have lost that early reluctance .  he was eager  instead  glowing .  arcadia knew that by the one sure sign  he practically never stuttered throughout that period .   one time  he said   there are abstracts of the records of general pritcher       i know him .  he was the foundation renegade  who combed the galaxy for the second foundation  wasn t he .     not exactly a renegade  arkady .  the mule had converted him .     oh  it s the same thing .     galaxy  that combing you speak of was a hopeless task .  the original records of the seldon convention that established both foundations five hundred years ago  make only one reference to the second foundation .  they say if s located  at the other end of the galaxy at star s end .   that s all the mule and pritcher had to go on .  they had no method of recognizing the second foundation even if they found it .  what madness .    they have records      he was speaking to himself  but arcadia listened eagerly      which must cover nearly a thousand worlds  yet the number of worlds available for study must have been closer to a million .  and we are no better off      arcadia broke in anxiously   shhh h  in a tight hiss .   homir froze  and slowly recovered .   let s not talk   he mumbled .   and now homir was with lord stettin and arcadia waited outside alone and felt the blood squeezing out of her heart for no reason at all .  that was more frightening than anything else .  that there seemed no reason .   on the other side of the door  homir  too  was living in a sea of gelatin .  he was fighting  with furious intensity  to keep from stuttering and  of course  could scarcely speak two consecutive words clearly as a result .   lord stettin was in full uniform  six feet six  large jawed  and hard mouthed .  his balled  arrogant fists kept a powerful time to his sentences .    well  you have had two weeks  and you come to me with tales of nothing .  come  sir  tell me the worst .  is my navy to be cut to ribbons .  am i to fight the ghosts of the second foundation as well as the men of the first .     i  .  .  .  i repeat  my lord  i am no p  .  .  .  pre  .  .  .  predictor .  i  .  .  .  i am at a complete  .  .  .  loss .     or do you wish to go back to warn your countrymen .  to deep space with your play acting .  i want the truth or i   ll have it out of you along with half your guts .     i m t  .  .  .  telling only the truth  and i ll have you re  .  .  .  remember  my l  .  .  .  lord  that i am a citizen of the foundation .  y  .  .  .  you cannot touch me without harvesting m  .  .  .  m  .  .  .  more than you count on .    the lord of kalgan laughed uproariously .   a threat to frighten children .  a horror with which to beat back an idiot .  come  mr .  munn  i have been patient with you .  i have listened to you for twenty minutes while you detailed wearisome nonsense to me which must have cost you sleepless nights to compose .  it was wasted effort .  i know you are here not merely to rake through the mule s dead ashes and to warm over the cinders you findyou come here for more than you have admitted .  is that not true .    homir munn could no more have quenched the burning horror that grew in his eyes than  at that moment  he could have breathed .  lord stettin saw that  and clapped the foundation man upon his shoulder so that he and the chair he sat on reeled under the impact .    good .  now let us be frank .  you are investigating the seldon plan .  you know that it no longer holds .  you know  perhaps  that i am the inevitable winner now  i and my heirs .  well  man  what matters it who established the second empire  so long as it is established .  history plays no favorites  eh .  are you afraid to tell me .  you see that i know your mission .    munn said thickly   what is it y  .  .  .  you w  .  .  .  want .     your presence .  i would not wish the plan spoiled through overconfidence .  you understand more of these things than i do  you can detect small flaws that i might miss .  come  you will be rewarded in the end  you will have your fair glut of the loot .  what can you expect at the foundation .  to turn the tide of a perhaps inevitable defeat .  to lengthen the war .  or is it merely a patriotic desire to die for your country .     i  .  .  .  i     he finally spluttered into silence .  not a word would come .    you will stay   said the lord of kalgan  confidently .   you have no choice .  wait      an almost forgotten afterthought      i have information to the effect that your niece is of the family of bayta darell .    homir uttered a startled   yes .   he could not trust himself at this point to be capable of weaving anything but cold truth .    it is a family of note on the foundation .    homir nodded   to whom they would certainly b  .  .  .  brook no harm .     harm .  don t be a fool  man  i am meditating the reverse .  how old is she .     fourteen .     sol well  not even the second foundation  or hari seldon  himself  could stop time from passing or girls from becoming women .    with that  he turned on his heel and strode to a draped door which he threw open violently .   he thundered   what in space have you dragged your shivering carcass here for .    the lady callia blinked at him  and said in a small voice   i didn t know anyone was with you .     well  there is .  i ll speak to you later of this  but now i want to see your back  and quickly .    her footsteps were a fading scurry in the corridor .   stettin returned   she is a remnant of an interlude that has lasted too long .  it will end soon .  fourteen  you say .    homir stared at him with a brand new horror .   arcadia started at the noiseless opening of a door     jumping at the jangling sliver of movement it made in the comer of her eye .  the finger that crooked frantically at her met no response for long moments  and then  as if in response to the cautions enforced by the very sight of that white  trembling figure  she tiptoed her way across the floor .   their footsteps were a taut whisper in the corridor .  it was the lady callia  of course  who held her hand so tightly that it hurt  and for some reason  she did not mind following her .  of the lady callia  at least  she was not afraid .   now  why was that .   they were in a boudoir now  all pink fluff and spun sugar .  lady callia stood with her back against the door .   she said   this was our private way to me  .  .  .  to my room  you know  from his office .  his  you know .   and she pointed with a thumb  as though even the thought of him were grinding her soul to death with fear .    it s so lucky  .  .  .  it   s so lucky     her pupils had blackened out the blue with their size .    can you tell me     began arcadia timidly .   and callia was in frantic motion .   no  child  no .  there is no time .  take off your clothes .  please .  please .  i ll get you more  and they won t recognize you .    she was in the closet  throwing useless bits of flummery in reckless heaps upon the ground  looking madly for something a girl could wear without becoming a living invitation to dalliance .    here  this will do .  it will have to .  do you have money .  here  take it all     and this .   she was stripping her ears and fingers .   just go home     go home to your foundation .     but homir  .  .  .  my uncle .   she protested vainly through the muffling folds of the sweet smelling and luxurious spun metal being forced over her head .    he won t leave .  poochie will hold him forever  but you mustn t stay .  oh  dear  don t you understand .     no .   arcadia forced a standstill   i don t understand .    lady callia squeezed her hands tightly together .   you must go back to warn your people there will be war .  isn t that clear .   absolute terror seemed paradoxically to have lent a lucidity to her thoughts and words that was entirely out of character .   now come .    out another way .  past officials who stared after them  but saw no reason to stop one whom only the lord of kalgan could stop with impunity .  guards clicked heels and presented arms when they went through doors .   arcadia breathed only on occasion through the years the trip seemed to take     yet from the first crooking of the white finger to the time she stood at the outer gate  with people and noise and traffic in the distance was only twenty five minutes .   she looked back  with a sudden frightened pity .   i  .  .  .  i  .  .  .  don t know why you re doing this  my lady  but thanks    what s going to happen to uncle homir .     i don t know   wailed the other .   can t you leave .  go straight to the spaceport .  don t wait .  he may be looking for you this very minute .    and still arcadia lingered .  she would be leaving homir  and  belatedly  now that she felt the free air about her  she was suspicious .   but what do you care if he does .    lady callia bit her lower lip and muttered   i can t explain to a little girl like you .  it would be improper .  well  you ll be growing up and i  .  .  .  i met poochie when i was sixteen .  i can t have you about  you know .   there was a half ashamed hostility in her eyes .   the implications froze arcadia .  she whispered   what will he do to you when he finds out .    and she whimpered back   i don t know   and threw her arm to her head as she left at a half run  back along the wide way to the mansion of the lord of kalgan .   but for one eternal second  arcadia still did not move  for in that last moment before lady callia left  arcadia had seen something .  those frightened  frantic eyes had momentarily     flashingly     lit up with a cold amusement .   a vast  inhuman amusement .   it was much to see in such a quick flicker of a pair of eyes  but arcadia had no doubt of what she saw .   she was running now     running wildly     searching madly for an unoccupied public booth at which one could press a button for public conveyance .   she was not running from lord stettin  not from him or from all the human hounds he could place at her heels     not from all his twenty seven worlds rolled into a single gigantic phenomenon  hallooing at her shadow .   she was running from a single  frail woman who had helped her escape .  from a creature who had loaded her with money and jewels  who had risked her own life to save her .  from an entity she knew  certainly and finally  to be a woman of the second foundation .   an air taxi came to a soft clicking halt in the cradle .  the wind of its coming brushed against arcadia s face and stirred at the hair beneath the softly furred hood callia had given her .    where ll it be  lady .    she fought desperately to low pitch her voice to make it not that of a child .   how many spaceports in the city .     two .  which one ya want .     which is closer .    he stared at her   kalgan central  lady .     the other one  please .  i   ve got the money .   she had a twenty kalganid note in her hand .  the denomination of the note made little difference to her  but the taxi man grinned appreciatively .    anything ya say  lady .  sky line cabs take ya anywhere .    she cooled her cheek against the slightly musty upholstery .  the lights of the city moved leisurely below her .   what should she do .  what should she do .   it was in that moment that she knew she was a stupid  stupid little girl  away from her father  and frightened .  her eyes were full of tears  and deep down in her throat  there was a small  soundless cry that hurt her insides .   she wasn t afraid that lord stettin would catch her .  lady callia would see to that .  lady callia .  old  fat  stupid  but she held on to her lord  somehow .  oh  it was clear enough  now .  everything was clear .   that tea with callia at which she had been so smart .  clever little arcadia .  something inside arcadia choked and hated itself .  that tea had been maneuvered  and then stettin had probably been maneuvered so that homir was allowed to inspect the palace after all .  she  the foolish callia  has wanted it so  and arranged to have smart little arcadia supply a foolproof excuse  one which would arouse no suspicions in the minds of the victims  and yet involve a minimum of interference on her part .   then why was she free .  homir was a prisoner  of course     unless     unless she went back to the foundation as a decoy     a decoy to lead others into the hands of  .  .  .  of them .   so she couldn t return to the foundation      spaceport  lady .   the air taxi had come to a halt .  strange .  she hadn t even noticed .   what a dream world it was .    thanks   she pushed the bill at him without seeing anything and was stumbling out the door  then running across the springy pavement .   lights .  unconcerned men and women .  large gleaming bulletin boards  with the moving figures that followed every single spaceship that arrived and departed .   where was she going .  she didn t care .  she only knew that she wasn t going to the foundation .  anywhere else at all would suit .   oh  thank seldon  for that forgetful moment     that last split second when callia wearied of her act because she had to do only with a child and had let her amusement spring through .   and then something else occurred to arcadia  something that had been stirring and moving at the base of her brain ever since the flight began     something that forever killed the fourteen in her .   and she knew that she must escape .   that above all .  though they located every conspirator on the foundation  though they caught her own father  she could not dared not  risk a warning .  she could not risk her own life     not in the slightest     for the entire realm of terminus .  she was the most important person in the galaxy .  she was the only important person in the galaxy .   she knew that even as she stood before the ticket machine and wondered where to go .   because in all the galaxy  she and she alone  except for they  themselves  knew the location of the second foundation .           through the grid  trantor by the middle of the interregnum  trantor was a shadow .  in the midst of the colossal ruins  there lived a small community of farmers .  .  .  .   encyclopedia galactica  there is nothing  never has been anything  quite like a busy spaceport on the outskirts of a capital city of a populous planet .  there are the huge machines resting mightily in their cradles .  if you choose your time properly  there is the impressive sight of the sinking giant dropping to rest or  more hair raising still  the swiftening departure of a bubble of steel .  all processes involved are nearly noiseless .  the motive power is the silent surge of nucleons shifting into more compact arrangements  in terms of area  ninety five percent of the port has just been referred to .  square miles are reserved for the machines  and for the men who serve them and for the calculators that serve both .   only five percent of the port is given over to the floods of humanity to whom it is the way station to all the stars of the galaxy .  it is certain that very few of the anonymous many headed stop to consider the technological mesh that knits the spaceways .  perhaps some of them might itch occasionally at the thought of the thousands of tons represented by the sinking steel that looks so small off in the distance .  one of those cyclopean cylinders could  conceivably  miss the guiding beam and crash half a mile from its expected landing point     through the glassite roof of the immense waiting room perhaps     so that only a thin organic vapor and some powdered phosphates would be left behind to mark the passing of a thousand men .   it could never happen  however  with the safety devices in use  and only the badly neurotic would consider the possibility for more than a moment .   then what do they think about .  it is not just a crowd  you see .  it is a crowd with a purpose .  that purpose hovers over the field and thickens the atmosphere .  lines queue up  parents herd their children  baggage is maneuvered in precise masses     people are going somewheres .   consider then the complete psychic isolation of a single unit of this terribly intent mob that does not know where to go  yet at the same time feels more intensely than any of the others possibly can  the necessity of going somewheres  anywhere .  or almost anywhere .   even lacking telepathy or any of the crudely definite methods of mind touching mind  there is a sufficient clash in atmosphere  in intangible mood  to suffice for despair .   to suffice .  to overflow  and drench  and drown .   arcadia darell  dressed in borrowed clothes  standing on a borrowed planet in a borrowed situation of what seemed even to be a borrowed life  wanted earnestly the safety of the womb .  she didn t know that was what she wanted .  she only knew that the very openness of the open world was a great danger .  she wanted a closed spot somewhere     somewhere far     somewhere in an unexplored nook of the universe     where no one would ever look .   and there she was  age fourteen plus  weary enough for eighty plus  frightened enough for five minus .   what stranger of the hundreds that brushed past her     actually brushed past her  so that she could feel their touch     was a second foundationer .  what stranger could not help but instantly destroy her for her guilty knowledge     her unique knowledge     of knowing where the second foundation was .   and the voice that cut in on her was a thunderclap that iced the scream in her throat into a voiceless slash .    look  miss   it said  irritably   are you using the ticket machine or are you just standing there .    it was the first she realized that she was standing in front of a ticket machine .  you put a high denomination bill into the clipper which sank out of sight .  you pressed the button below your destination and a ticket came out together with the correct change as determined by an electronic scanning device that never made a mistake .  it was a very ordinary thing and there is no cause for anyone to stand before it for five minutes .   arcadia plunged a two hundred credit into the clipper  and was suddenly aware of the button labeled  trantor .   trantor  dead capital of the dead empire     the planet on which she was born .  she pressed it in a dream .  nothing happened  except that the red letters flicked on and off  reading     .           .           .        it was the amount she was short .  another two hundred credit .  the ticket was spit out towards her .  it came loose when she touched it  and the change tumbled out afterward .       she seized it and ran .  she felt the man behind her pressing close  anxious for his own chance at the machine  but she twisted out from before him and did not look behind .   yet there was nowhere to run .  they were all her enemies .   without quite realizing it  she was watching the gigantic  glowing signs that puffed into the air  steffani  anacreon  fermus    there was even one that ballooned  terminus  and she longed for it  but did not dare     for a trifling sum  she could have hired a notifier which could have been set for any destination she cared and which would  when placed in her purse  make itself heard only to her  fifteen minutes before take off time .  but such devices are for people who are reasonably secure  however  who can pause to think of them .   and then  attempting to look both ways simultaneously  she ran head on into a soft abdomen .  she felt the startled outbreath and grunt  and a hand come down on her arm .  she writhed desperately but lacked breath to do more than mew a bit in the back of her throat .   her captor held her firmly and waited .  slowly  he came into focus for her and she managed to look at him .  he was rather plump and rather short .  his hair was white and copious  being brushed back to give a pompadour effect that looked strangely incongruous above a round and ruddy face that shrieked its peasant origin .    what s the matter .   he said finally  with a frank and twinkling curiosity .   you look scared .     sorry   muttered arcadia in a frenzy .   i   ve got to go .  pardon me .    but he disregarded that entirely  and said   watch out  little girl .  you ll drop your ticket .   and he lifted it from her resistless white fingers and looked at it with every evidence of satisfaction .    i thought so   he said  and then bawled in bull like tones   mommuh .    a woman was instantly at his side  somewhat more short  somewhat more round  somewhat more ruddy .  she wound a finger about a stray gray lock to shove it beneath a well outmoded hat .    pappa   she said  reprovingly   why do you shout in a crowd like that .  people look at you like you were crazy .  do you think you are on the farm .    and she smiled sunnily at the unresponsive arcadia  and added   he has manners like a bear .   then  sharply   pappa  let go the little girl .  what are you doing .    but pappa simply waved the ticket at her .   look   he said   she s going to trantor .    mamma s face was a sudden beam   you re from trantor .  let go her arm  i say  pappa .   she turned the overstuffed valise she was carrying onto its side and forced arcadia to sit down with a gentle but unrelenting pressure .   sit down   she said   and rest your little feet .  it will be no ship yet for an hour and the benches are crowded with sleeping loafers .  you are from trantor .    arcadia drew a deep breath and gave in .  huskily  she said   i was born there .    and mamma clapped her hands gleefully   one month we ve been here and till now we met nobody from home .  this is very nice .  your parents     she looked about vaguely .    i m not with my parents   arcadia said  carefully .    all alone .  a little girl like you .   mamma was at once a blend of indignation and sympathy   how does that come to be .     mamma   pappa plucked at her sleeve   let me tell you .  there s something wrong .  i think she s frightened .   his voice  though obviously intended for a whisper was quite plainly audible to arcadia .   she was running     i was watching her     and not looking where she was going .  before i could step out of the way  she bumped into me .  and you know what .  i think she s in trouble .     so shut your mouth  pappa .  into you  anybody could bump .   but she joined arcadia on the valise  which creaked wearily under the added weight and put an arm about the girl s trembling shoulder .   you re running away from somebody  sweetheart .  don t be afraid to tell me .  iii help you .    arcadia looked across at the kind gray eyes of the woman and felt her lips quivering .  one part of her brain was telling her that here were people from trantor  with whom she could go  who could help her remain on that planet until she could decide what next to do  where next to go .  and another part of her brain  much the louder  was telling her in jumbled incoherence that she did not remember her mother  that she was weary to death of fighting the universe  that she wanted only to curl into a little hall with strong  gentle arms about her  that if her mother had lived  she might  .  .  .  she might     and for the first time that night  she was crying  crying like a little baby  and glad of it  clutching tightly at the old fashioned dress and dampening a corner of it thoroughly  while soft arms held her closely and a gentle hand stroked her curls .   pappa stood helplessly looking at the pair  fumbling futilely for a handkerchief which  when produced  was snatched from his hand .  mamma glared an admonition of quietness at him .  the crowds surged about the little group with the true indifference of disconnected crowds everywhere .  they were effectively alone .   finally  the weeping trickled to a halt  and arcadia smiled weakly as she dabbed at red eyes with the borrowed handkerchief .   golly   she whispered    shh .  shh .  don t talk   said mamma  fussily   just sit and rest for a while .  catch your breath .  then tell us what s wrong  and you ll see  we ll fix it up  and everything will be all right .    arcadia scrabbled what remained of her wits together .  she could not tell them the truth .  she could tell nobody the truth    and yet she was too worn to invent a useful lie .   she said  whisperingly   i m better  now .     good   said mamma .   now tell me why you   re in trouble .  you did nothing wrong .  of course  whatever you did  well help you  but tell us the truth .     for a friend from trantor  anything   added pappa  expansively   eh  mamma .     shut your mouth  pappa   was the response  without rancor .   arcadia was groping in her purse .  that  at least  was still hers  despite the rapid clothes changing forced upon her in lady callia s apartments .  she found what she was looking for and handed it to mamma .    these are my papers   she said  diffidently .  it was shiny  synthetic parchment which had been issued her by the foundation s ambassador on the day of her arrival and which had been countersigned by the appropriate kalganian official .  it was large  florid  and impressive .  mamma looked at it helplessly  and passed it to pappa who absorbed its contents with an impressive pursing of the lips .   he said   you re from the foundation .     yes .  but i was born in trantor .  see it says that       ah hah .  it looks all right to me .  you re named arcadia  eh .  that s a good trantorian name .  but where s your uncle .  it says here you came in the company of homir munn  uncle .     he s been arrested   said arcadia  drearily .    arrested .       from the two of them at once .   what for .   asked mamma .   he did something .    she shook her head .   i don t know .  we were just on a visit .  uncle homir had business with lord stettin but     she needed no effort to act a shudder .  it was there .   pappa was impressed .   with lord stettin .  mm m m  your uncle must be a big man .     i don t know what it was all about  but lord stettin wanted me to stay     she was recalling the last words of lady callia  which had been acted out for her benefit .  since callia  as she now knew  was an expert  the story could do for a second time .   she paused  and mamma said interestedly   and why you .     i m not sure .  he  .  .  .  he wanted to have dinner with me all alone  but i said no  because i wanted uncle homir along .  he looked at me funny and kept holding my shoulder .    pappa s mouth was a little open  but mamma was suddenly red and angry .   how old are you  arcadia .     fourteen and a half  almost .    mamma drew a sharp breath and said   that such people should be let live .  the dogs in the streets are better .  you re running from him  dear  is not .    arcadia nodded .   mamma said   pappa  go right to information and find out exactly when the ship to trantor comes to berth .  hurry .    but pappa took one step and stopped .  loud metallic words were booming overhead  and five thousand pairs of eyes looked startledly upwards .    men and women   it said  with sharp force .   the airport is being searched for a dangerous fugitive  and it is now surrounded .  no one can enter and no one can leave .  the search will  however  be conducted with great speed and no ships will reach or leave berth during the interval  so you will not miss your ship .  i repeat  no one will miss his ship .  the grid will descend .  none of you will move outside your square until the grid is removed  as otherwise we will be forced to use our neuronic whips .    during the minute or less in which the voice dominated the vast dome of the spaceport s waiting room  arcadia could not have moved if all the evil in the galaxy had concentrated itself into a ball and hurled itself at her .   they could mean only her .  it was not even necessary to formulate that idea as a specific thought .  but why     callia had engineered her escape .  and callia was of the second foundation .  why  then  the search now .  had callia failed .  could callia fail .  or was this part of the plan  the intricacies of which escaped her .   for a vertiginous moment  she wanted to jump up and shout that she gave up  that she would go with them  that  .  .  .  that     but mamma s hand was on her wrist .   quick .   quick .  well go to the lady s room before they start .    arcadia did not understand .  she merely followed blindly .  they oozed through the crowd  frozen as it was into clumps  with the voice still booming through its last words .   the grid was descending now  and pappa  openmouthed  watched it come down .  he had heard of it and read of it  but had never actually been the object of it .  it glimmered in the air  simply a series of cross hatched and tight radiation beams that set the air aglow in a harmless network of flashing light .   it always was so arranged as to descend slowly from above in order that it might represent a falling net with all the terrific psychological implications of entrapment .   it was at waist level now  ten feet between glowing lines in each direction .  in his own hundred square feet  pappa found himself alone  yet the adjoining squares were crowded .  he felt himself conspicuously isolated but knew that to move into the greater anonymity of a group would have meant crossing one of those glowing lines  stirring an alarm  and bringing down the neuronic whip .   he waited .   he could make out over the heads of the eerily quiet and waiting mob  the far off stir that was the line of policemen covering the vast floor area  lighted square by lighted square .   it was a long time before a uniform stepped into his square and carefully noted its co ordinates into an official notebook .    papers .    pappa handed them over  and they were flipped through in expert fashion .    you re preem palver  native of trantor  on kalgan for a month  returning to trantor .  answer  yes or no .     yes  yes .     what s your business on kalgan .     i m trading representative of our farm co operative .  i ve been negotiating terms with the department of agriculture on kalgan .    um m m .  your wife is with you .  where is she .  she is mentioned in your papers .     please .  my wife is in the     he pointed .    hanto   roared the policeman .  another uniform joined him .   the first one said  dryly   another dame in the can  by the galaxy .  the place must be busting with them .  write down her name .   he indicated the entry in the papers which gave it .    anyone else with you .     my niece .     she s not mentioned in the papers .     she came separately .     where is she .  never mind  i know .  write down the niece s name  too  hanto .  what s her name .  write down arcadia palver .  you stay right here  palver .  we ll take care of the women before we leave .    pappa waited interminably .  and then  long  long after  mamma was marching toward him  arcadia s hand firmly in hers  the two policemen trailing behind her .   they entered pappa s square  and one said   is this noisy old woman your wife .     yes  sir   said pappa  placatingly .    then you d better tell her she s liable to get into trouble if she talks the way she does to the first citizen s police .   he straightened his shoulders angrily .   is this your niece .     yes  sir .     i want her papers .    looking straight at her husband  mamma slightly  but no less firmly  shook her head .   a short pause  and pappa said with a weak smile   i don t think i can do that .     what do you mean you can t do that .   the policeman thrust out a hard palm .   hand it over .     diplomatic immunity   said pappa  softly .    what do you mean .     i said i was trading representative of my farm co operative .  i m accredited to the kalganian government as an official foreign representative and my papers prove it .  i showed them to you and now i don t want to be bothered any more .    for a moment  the policeman was taken aback .   i got to see your papers .  it s orders .     you go away   broke in mamma  suddenly .   when we want you  we ll send for you  you  .  .  .  you bum .    the policeman s lips tightened .   keep your eye on them  hanto .  i ll get the lieutenant .     break a leg .   called mamma after him .  someone laughed  and then choked it off suddenly .   the search was approaching its end .  the crowd was growing dangerously restless .  forty five minutes had elapsed since the grid had started falling and that is too long for best effects .  lieutenant dirige threaded his way hastily  therefore  toward the dense center of the mob .    is this the girl .   he asked wearily .  he looked at her and she obviously fitted the description .  all this for a child .   he said   her papers  if you please .    pappa began   i have already explained       i know what you have explained  and i m sorry   said the lieutenant   but i have my orders  and i can t help them .  if you care to make a protest later  you may .  meanwhile  if necessary  i must use force .    there was a pause  and the lieutenant waited patiently .   then pappa said  huskily   give me your papers  arcadia .    arcadia shook her head in panic  but pappa nodded his head .   don t be afraid .  give them to me .    helplessly she reached out and let the documents change hands .  pappa fumbled them open and looked carefully through them  then handed them over .  the lieutenant in his turn looked through them carefully .  for a long moment  he raised his eyes to rest them on arcadia  and then he closed the booklet with a sharp snap .    all in order   he said .   all right  men .    he left  and in two minutes  scarcely more  the grid was gone  and the voice above signified a back to normal .  the noise of the crowd  suddenly released  rose high .   arcadia said   how  .  .  .  how      pappa said   sh h .  don t say a word .  let s better go to the ship .  it should be in the berth soon .    they were on the ship .  they had a private stateroom and a table to themselves in the dining room .  two light years already separated them from kalgan  and arcadia finally dared to broach the subject again .   she said   but they were after me  mr .  palver  and they must have had my description and all the details .  why did he let me go .    and pappa smiled broadly over his roast beef .   well  arcadia  child  it was easy .  when you ve been dealing with agents and buyers and competing co operatives  you learn some of the tricks .  i ve had twenty years or more to learn them in .  you see  child  when the lieutenant opened your papers  he found a five hundred credit bill inside  folded up small .  simple  no .     i   ll pay you back    honest  i ve got lots of money .     well   pappa s broad face broke into an embarrassed smile  as he waved it away .   for a country woman      arcadia desisted .   but what if he d taken the money and turned me in anyway .  and accused me of bribery .     and give up five hundred credits .  i know these people better than you do  girl .    but arcadia knew that he did not know people better .  not these people .  in her bed that night  she considered carefully  and knew that no bribe would have stopped a police lieutenant in the matter of catching her unless that had been planned .  they didn t want to catch her  yet had made every motion of doing so  nevertheless .   why .  to make sure she left .  and for trantor .  were the obtuse and soft hearted couple she was with now only a pair of tools in the hands of the second foundation  as helpless as she herself .   they must be .   or were they .   it was all so useless .  how could she fight them .  whatever she did  it might only be what those terrible omnipotents wanted her to do .   yet she had to outwit them .  had to .  had to .  had to .  .           beginning of war  for reason or reasons unknown to members of the galaxy at the time of the era under discussion  intergalactic standard time defines its fundamental unit  the second  as the time in which light travels         kilometers .         seconds are arbitrarily set equal to one intergalactic standard day  and     of these days to one intergalactic standard year .   why         .     or        .     or     .   tradition  says the historian  begging the question .  because of certain and various mysterious numerical relationships  say the mystics  cultists  numerologists  metaphysicists .  because the original home planet of humanity had certain natural periods of rotation and revolution from which those relationships could be derived  say a very few .   no one really knew .   nevertheless  the date on which the foundation cruiser  the hober mallow met the kalganian squadron  headed by the fearless  and  upon refusing to allow a search party to board  was blasted into smoldering wreckage was            g . e .  that is  it was the    th day of the       nd year of the galactic era which dated from the accession of the first emperor of the traditional kamble dynasty .  it was also          a . s .      dating from the birth of seldon     or          y . f .      dating from the establishment of the foundation .  on kalgan it was         f . c .      dating from the establishment of the first citizenship by the mule .  in each case  of course  for convenience  the year was so arranged as to yield the same day number regardless of the actual day upon which the era began .   and  in addition  to all the millions of worlds of the galaxy  there were millions of local times  based on the motions of their own particular heavenly neighbors .   but whichever you choose                            or anything     it was this day which historians later pointed to when they spoke of the start of the stettinian war .   yet to dr .  darell  it was none of these at all .  it was simply and quite precisely the thirty second day since arcadia had left terminus .   what it cost darell to maintain stolidity through these days was not obvious to everyone .   but elvett semic thought he could guess .  he was an old man and fond of saying that his neuronic sheaths had calcified to the point where his thinking processes were stiff and unwieldy .  he invited and almost welcomed the universal underestimation of his decaying powers by being the first to laugh at them .  but his eyes were none the less seeing for being faded  his mind none the less experienced and wise  for being no longer agile .   he merely twisted his pinched lips and said   why don t you do something about it .    the sound was a physical jar to darell  under which he winced .  he said  gruffly   where were we .    semic regarded him with grave eyes .   you d better do something about the girl .   his sparse  yellow teeth showed in a mouth that was open in inquiry .   but darell replied coldly   the question is  can you get a symes molff resonator in the range required .    well  i said i could and you weren t listening       i m sorry  elvett .  it s like this .  what we re doing now can be more important to everyone in the galaxy than the question of whether arcadia is safe .  at least  to everyone but arcadia and myself  and i m willing to go along with the majority .  how big would the resonator be .    semic looked doubtful   i don t know .  you can find it somewheres in the catalogues .     about how big .  a ton .  a pound .  a block long .     oh  i thought you meant exactly .  it s a little jigger .   he indicated the first joint of his thumb .   about that .     all right  can you do something like this .   he sketched rapidly on the pad he held in his lap  then passed it over to the old physicist  who peered at it doubtfully  then chuckled .    y know  the brain gets calcified when you get as old as i am .  what are you trying to do .    darell hesitated .  he longed desperately  at the moment  for the physical knowledge locked in the other s brain  so that he need not put his thought into words .  but the longing was useless  and he explained .   semic was shaking his head .   you d need hyper relays .  the only things that would work fast enough .  a thundering lot of them .     but it can be built .     well  sure .     can you get all the parts .  i mean  without causing comment .  in line with your general work .    semic lifted his upper lip .   can t get fifty hyper relays .  i wouldn t use that many in my whole life .     we re on a defense project  now .  can t you think of something harmless that would use them .  we ve got the money .     hm m m .  maybe i can think of something .     how small can you make the whole gadget .     hyper relays can be had micro size  .  .  .  wiring  .  .  .  tubes     space  you ve got a few hundred circuits there .     i know .  how big .    semic indicated with his hands .    too big   said darell .   i ve got to swing it from my belt   slowly  he was crumpling his sketch into a tight ball .  when it was a hard  yellow grape  he dropped it into the ash tray and it was gone with the tiny white flare of molecular decomposition .   he said   who s at your door .    semic leaned over his desk to the little milky screen above the door signal .  he said   the young fellow  anthor .  someone with him  too .    darell scraped his chair back .   nothing about this  semic  to the others yet .  it s deadly knowledge  if they find out  and two lives are enough to risk .    pelleas anthor was a pulsing vortex of activity in semic s office  which  somehow  managed to partake of the age of its occupant .  in the slow turgor of the quiet room  the loose  summery sleeves of anthor s tunic seemed still a quiver with the outer breezes .   he said   dr .  darell  dr .  semic     orum dirige .    the other man was tall .  a long straight nose that lent his thin face a saturnine appearance .  dr .  darell held out a hand .   anthor smiled slightly .   police lieutenant dirige   he amplified .  then  significantly   of kalgan .    and darell turned to stare with force at the young man .   police lieutenant dirige of kalgan   he repeated  distinctly .   and you bring him here .  why .     because he was the last man on kalgan to see your daughter .  hold  man .    anthor s look of triumph was suddenly one of concern  and he was between the two  struggling violently with darell .  slowly  and not gently  he forced the older man back into the chair .    what are you trying to do .   anthor brushed a lock of brown hair from his forehead  tossed a hip lightly upon the desk  and swung a leg  thoughtfully .   i thought i was bringing you good news .    darell addressed the policeman directly   what does he mean by calling you the last man to see my daughter .  is my daughter dead .  please tell me without preliminary .   his face was white with apprehension .   lieutenant dirige said expressionlessly      last man on kalgan  was the phrase .  she s not on kalgan now .  i have no knowledge past that .     here   broke in anthor   let me put it straight .  sorry if i overplayed the drama a bit  doc .  you re so inhuman about this  i forget you have feelings .  in the first place  lieutenant dirige is one of us .  he was born on kalgan  but his father was a foundation man brought to that planet in the service of the mule .  i answer for the lieutenant s loyalty to the foundation .    now i was in touch with him the day after we stopped getting the daily report from munn       why .   broke in darell  fiercely .   i thought it was quite decided that we were not to make a move in the matter .  you were risking their lives and ours .     because   was the equally fierce retort   i ve been involved in this game for longer than you .  because i know of certain contacts on kalgan of which you know nothing .  because i act from deeper knowledge  do you understand .     i think you re completely mad .     will you listen .    a pause  and darell s eyes dropped .   anthor s lips quirked into a half smile   all right  doc .  give me a few minutes .  tell him  dirige .    dirige spoke easily   as far as i know  dr .  darell  your daughter is at trantor .  at least  she had a ticket to trantor at the eastern spaceport .  she was with a trading representative from that planet who claimed she was his niece .  your daughter seems to have a queer collection of relatives  doctor .  that was the second uncle she had in a period of two weeks  eh .  the trantorian even tried to bribe me     probably thinks that s why they got away .   he smiled grimly at the thought .    how was she .     unharmed  as far as i could see .  frightened .  i don t blame her for that .  the whole department was after her .  i still don t know why .    darell drew a breath for what seemed the first time in several minutes .  he was conscious of the trembling of his hands and controlled them with an effort .   then she s all right .  this trading representative  who was he .  go back to him .  what part does he play in it .     i don t know .  do you know anything about trantor .     i lived there once .     it s an agricultural world  now .  exports animal fodder and grains  mostly .  high quality .  they sell them all over the galaxy .  there are a dozen or two farm co operatives on the planet and each has its representatives overseas .  shrewd sons of guns  too    i knew this one s record .  he d been on kalgan before  usually with his wife .  perfectly honest .  perfectly harmless .     um m m   said anthor .   arcadia was born in trantor  wasn t she  doc .    darell nodded .    it hangs together  you see .  she wanted to go away     quickly and far     and trantor would suggest itself .  don t you think so .    darell said   why not back here .     perhaps she was being pursued and felt that she had to double off in a new angle  eh .    dr .  darell lacked the heart to question further .  well  then  let her be safe on trantor  or as safe as one could be anywhere in this dark and horrible galaxy .  he groped toward the door  felt anthor s light touch on his sleeve  and stopped  but did not turn .    mind if i go home with you  doc .     you re welcome   was the automatic response .   by evening  the exteriormost reaches of dr .  darell s personality  the ones that made immediate contact with other people had solidified once more .  he had refused to eat his evening meal and had  instead  with feverish insistence  returned to the inchwise advance into the intricate mathematics of encephalographic analysis .   it was not till nearly midnight  that he entered the living room again .   pelleas anthor was still there  twiddling at the controls of the video .  the footsteps behind him caused him to glance over his shoulder .    hi .  aren t you in bed yet .  i ve been spending hours on the video  trying to get something other than bulletins .  it seems the f . s .  hober mallow is delayed in course and hasn t been heard from    really .  what do they suspect .     what do you think .  kalganian skulduggery .  there are reports that kalganian vessels were sighted in the general space sector in which the hober mallow was last heard from .    darell shrugged  and anthor rubbed his forehead doubtfully .    look doc   he said   why don t you go to trantor .     why should i .     because  you re no good to us here .  you re not yourself .  you can t be .  and you could accomplish a purpose by going to trantor  too .  the old imperial library with the complete records of the proceedings of the seldon commission are there       no .  the library has been picked clean and it hasn t helped anyone .     it helped ebling mis once .     how do you know .  yes  he said he found the second foundation  and my mother killed him five seconds later as the only way to keep him from unwittingly revealing its location to the mule .  but in doing so  she also  you realize  made it impossible ever to tell whether mis really did know the location .  after all  no one else has ever been able to deduce the truth from those records .     ebling mis  if you ll remember  was working under the driving impetus of the mule s mind .     i know that  too  but mis  mind was  by that very token  in an abnormal state .  do you and i know anything about the properties of a mind under the emotional control of another  about its abilities and shortcomings .  in any case  i will not go to trantor .    anthor frowned   well  why the vehemence .  i merely suggested it as     well  by space  i don t understand you .  you look ten years older .  you re obviously having a hellish time of it .  you re not doing anything of value here .  if i were you  i d go and get the girl .     exactly .  it s what i want to do  too .  that s why i won t do it .  look  anthor  and try to understand .  you re playing     we re both playing     with something completely beyond our powers to fight .  in cold blood  if you have any  you know that  whatever you may think in your moments of quixoticism .    for fifty years  we ve known that the second foundation is the real descendent and pupil of seldonian mathematics .  what that means  and you know that  too  is that nothing in the galaxy happens which does not play a part in their reckoning .  to us  all life is a series of accidents  to be met with by improvisations to them  all life is purposive and should be met by precalculation .    but they have their weakness .  their work is statistical and only the mass action of humanity is truly inevitable .  now how i play a part  as an individual  in the foreseen course of history  i don t know .  perhaps i have no definite part  since the plan leaves individuals to indeterminacy and free will .  but i am important and they     they  you understand     may at least have calculated my probable reaction .  so i distrust  my impulses  my desires  my probable reactions .    i would rather present them with an improbable reaction .  i will stay here  despite the fact that i yearn very desperately to leave .   no .  because i yearn very desperately to leave .    the younger man smiled sourly .   you don t know your own mind as well as they might .  suppose that     knowing you     they might count on what you think  merely think  is the improbable reaction  simply by knowing in advance what your line of reasoning would be .     in that case  there is no escape .  for if i follow the reasoning you have just outlined and go to trantor  they may have foreseen that  too .  there is an endless cycle of double double double double crosses .  no matter how far i follow that cycle  i can only either go or stay .  the intricate act of luring my daughter halfway across the galaxy cannot be meant to make me stay where i am  since i would most certainly have stayed if they had done nothing .  it can only be to make me move  and so i will stay .    and besides  anthor  not everything bears the breath of the second foundation  not all events are the results of their puppeting .  they may have had nothing to do with arcadia s leave taking  and she may be safe on trantor when all the rest of us are dead .     no   said anthor  sharply   now you are off the track .     you have an alternative interpretation .     i have     if you   ll listen .     oh  go ahead .  i don t lack patience .     well  then     how well do you know your own daughter .     how well can any individual know any other .  obviously  my knowledge is inadequate .     so is mine on that basis  perhaps even more so     but at least  i viewed her with fresh eyes .  item one  she is a ferocious little romantic  the only child of an ivory tower academician  growing up in an unreal world of video and book film adventure .  she lives in a weird self constructed fantasy of espionage and intrigue .  item two  she s intelligent about it  intelligent enough to outwit us  at any rate .  she planned carefully to overhear our first conference and succeeded .  she planned carefully to go to kalgan with munn and succeeded .  item three  she has an unholy hero worship of her grandmother     your mother     who defeated the mule .    i m right so far  i think .  all right  then .  now  unlike you  i ve received a complete report from lieutenant dirige and  in addition  my sources of information on kalgan are rather complete  and all sources check .  we know  for instance  that homir munn  in conference with the lord of kalgan was refused admission to the mule s palace  and that this refusal was suddenly abrogated after arcadia had spoken to lady callia  the first citizen s very good friend .    darell interrupted .   and how do you know all this .     for one thing  munn was interviewed by dirige as part of the police campaign to locate arcadia .  naturally  we have a complete transcript of the questions and answers .    and take lady callia herself .  it is rumored that she has lost stettin s interest  but the rumor isn t borne out by facts .  she not only remains unreplaced  is not only able to mediate the lord s refusal to munn into an acceptance  but can even engineer arcadia s escape openly .  why  a dozen of the soldiers about stettin s executive mansion testified that they were seen together on the last evening .  yet she remains unpunished .  this despite the fact that arcadia was searched for with every appearance of diligence .     but what is your conclusion from all this torrent of ill connection .     that arcadia s escape was arranged .     as i said .     with this addition .  that arcadia must have known it was arranged  that arcadia  the bright little girl who saw cabals everywhere  saw this one and followed your own type of reasoning .  they wanted her to return to the foundation  and so she went to trantor  instead .  but why trantor .     well  why .     because that is where bayta  her idolized grandmother  escaped when she was in flight .  consciously or unconsciously  arcadia imitated that .  i wonder  then  if arcadia was fleeing the same enemy .     the mule .   asked darell with polite sarcasm .    of course not .  i mean  by the enemy  a mentality that she could not fight .  she was running from the second foundation  or such influence thereof as could be found on kalgan .     what influence is this you speak of .     do you expect kalgan to be immune from that ubiquitous menace .  we both have come to the conclusion  somehow  that arcadia s escape was arranged .  right .  she was searched for and found  but deliberately allowed to slip away by dirige .  by dirige  do you understand .  but how was that .  because he was our man .  but how did they know that .  were they counting on him to be a traitor .  eh  doc .     now you re saying that they honestly meant to recapture her .  frankly  you re tiring me a bit  anthor .  finish your say  i want to go to bed .     my say is quickly finished .   anthor reached for a small group of photo records in his inner pocket .  it was the familiar wigglings of the encephalograph .   dirige s brainwaves   anthor said  casually   taken since he returned .    it was quite visible to darell s naked eye  and his face was gray when he looked up .   he is controlled .     exactly .  he allowed arcadia to escape not because he was our man but because he was the second foundation s .     even after he knew she was going to trantor  and not to terminus .    anthor shrugged .   he had been geared to let her go .  there was no way he could modify that .  he was only a tool  you see .  it was just that arcadia followed the least probable course  and is probably safe .  or at least safe until such time as the second foundation can modify the plans to take into account this changed state of affairs      he paused .  the little signal light on the video set was flashing .  on an independent circuit  it signified the presence of emergency news .  darell saw it  too  and with the mechanical movement of long habit turned on the video .  they broke in upon the middle of a sentence but before its completion  they knew that the hober mallow  or the wreck thereof  had been found and that  for the first time in nearly half a century  the foundation was again at war .   anthor s jaw was set in a hard line .   all right  doc  you heard that .  kalgan has attacked  and kalgan is under the control of the second foundation .  will you follow your daughter s lead and move to trantor .     no .  i will risk it .  here .     dr .  darell .  you are not as intelligent as your daughter .  i wonder how far you can be trusted .   his long level stare held darell for a moment  and then without a word  he left .   and darell was left in uncertainty and     almost     despair .   unheeded  the video was a medley of excited sight sound  as it described in nervous detail the first hour of the war between kalgan and the foundation .           war  the mayor of the foundation brushed futilely at the picket fence of hair that rimmed his skull .  he sighed .   the years that we have wasted  the chances we have thrown away .  i make no recriminations  dr .  darell  but we deserve defeat .    darell said  quietly   i see no reason for lack of confidence in events  sir .     lack of confidence .  lack of confidence .  by the galaxy  dr .  darell  on what would you base any other attitude .  come here      he half led half forced darell toward the limpid ovoid cradled gracefully on its tiny force field support .  at a touch of the mayor s hand  it glowed within     an accurate three dimensional model of the galactic double spiral .    in yellow   said the mayor  excitedly   we have that region of space under foundation control  in red  that under kalgan .    what darell saw was a crimson sphere resting within a stretching yellow fist that surrounded it on all sides but that toward the center of the galaxy .    galactography   said the mayor   is our greatest enemy .  our admirals make no secret of our almost hopeless  strategic position .  observe .  the enemy has inner lines of communication .  he is concentrated  can meet us on all sides with equal ease .  he can defend himself with minimum force .    we are expanded .  the average distance between inhabited systems within the foundation is nearly three times that within kalgan .  to go from santanni to locris  for instance  is a voyage of twenty five hundred parsecs for us  but only eight hundred parsecs for them  if we remain within our respective territories      darell said   i understand all that  sir .     and you do not understand that it may mean defeat .     there is more than distance to war .  i say we cannot lose .  it is quite impossible .     and why do you say that .     because of my own interpretation of the seldon plan .     oh   the mayor s lips twisted  and the hands behind his back flapped one within the other   then you rely  too  on the mystical help of the second foundation .     no .  merely on the help of inevitability     and of courage and persistence .    and yet behind his easy confidence  he wondered     what if     well    what if anthor were right  and kalgan were a direct tool of the mental wizards .  what if it was their purpose to defeat and destroy the foundation .  no .  it made no sense .   and yet     he smiled bitterly .  always the same .  always that peering and peering through the opaque granite which  to the enemy  was so transparent .   nor were the galactographic verities of the situation lost upon stettin .   the lord of kalgan stood before a twin of the galactic model which the mayor and darell had inspected .  except that where the mayor frowned  stettin smiled .   his admiral s uniform glistered imposingly upon his massive figure .  the crimson sash of the order of the mule awarded him by the former first citizen whom six months later he had replaced somewhat forcefully  spanned his chest diagonally from right shoulder to waist .  the silver star with double comets and swords sparkled brilliantly upon his left shoulder .   he addressed the six men of his general staff whose uniforms were only less grandiloquent than his own  and his first minister as well  thin and gray     a darkling cobweb  lost in the brightness .   stettin said   i think the decisions are clear .  we can afford to wait .  to them  every day of delay will be another blow at their morale .  if they attempt to defend all portions of their realm  they will be spread thin and we can strike through in two simultaneous thrusts here and here .   he indicated the directions on the galactic model     two lances of pure white shooting through the yellow fist from the red ball it inclosed  cutting terminus off on either side in a tight arc .   in such a manner  we cut their fleet into three parts which can be defeated in detail .  if they concentrate  they give up two thirds of their dominions voluntarily and will probably risk rebellion .    the first minister s thin voice alone seeped through the hush that followed .   in six months   he said   the foundation will grow six months stronger .  their resources are greater  as we all know  their navy is numerically stronger  their manpower is virtually inexhaustible .  perhaps a quick thrust would be safer .    his was easily the least influential voice in the room .  lord stettin smiled and made a flat gesture with his hand .   the six months     or a year  if necessary     will cost us nothing .  the men of the foundation cannot prepare  they are ideologically incapable of it .  it is in their very philosophy to believe that the second foundation will save them .  but not this time  eh .    the men in the room stirred uneasily .    you lack confidence  i believe   said stettin  frigidly .   is it necessary once again to describe the reports of our agents in foundation territory  or to repeat the findings of mr .  homir munn  the foundation agent now in our  .  .  .  uh  .  .  .  service .  let us adjourn  gentlemen .    stettin returned to his private chambers with a fixed smile still on his face .  he sometimes wondered about this homir munn .  a queer water spined fellow who certainly did not bear out his early promise .  and yet he crawled with interesting information that carried conviction with it     particularly when callia was present .   his smile broadened .  that fat fool had her uses  after all .  at least  she got more with her wheedling out of munn than he could  and with less trouble .  why not give her to munn .  he frowned .  callia .  she and her stupid jealousy .  space .  if he still had the darell girl  why hadn t he ground her skull to powder for that .   he couldn t quite put his finger on the reason .   maybe because she got along with munn .  and he needed munn .  it was munn  for instance  who had demonstrated that  at least in the belief of the mule  there was no second foundation .  his admirals needed that assurance .   he would have liked to make the proofs public  but it was better to let the foundation believe in their nonexistent help .  was it actually callia who had pointed that out .  that s right .  she had said     oh  nonsense .  she couldn t have said anything .   and yet     he shook his head to clear it and passed on .           ghost of a world  trantor was a world in dregs and rebirth .  set like a faded jewel in the midst of the bewildering crowd of suns at the center of the galaxy     in the heaps and clusters of stars piled high with aimless prodigality     it alternately dreamed of past and future .   time had been when the insubstantial ribbons of control had stretched out from its metal coating to the very edges of stardom .  it had been a single city  housing four hundred billion administrators  the mightiest capital that had ever been .   until the decay of the empire eventually reached it and in the great sack of a century ago  its drooping powers had been bent back upon themselves and broken forever .  in the blasting ruin of death  the metal shell that circled the planet wrinkled and crumpled into an aching mock of its own grandeur .   the survivors tore up the metal plating and sold it to other planets for seed and cattle .  the soil was uncovered once more and the planet returned to its beginnings .  in the spreading areas of primitive agriculture  it forgot its intricate and colossal past .   or would have but for the still mighty shards that heaped their massive ruins toward the sky in bitter and dignified silence .   arcadia watched the metal rim of the horizon with a stirring of the heart .  the village in which the palvers lived was but a huddle of houses to her     small and primitive .  the fields that surrounded it were golden yellow  wheat ciogged tracts .   but there  just past the reaching point was the memory of the past  still glowing in unrusted splendor  and burning with fire where the sun of trantor caught it in gleaming highlights .  she had been there once during the months since she had arrived at trantor .  she had climbed onto the smooth  unjointed pavement and ventured into the silent dust streaked structures  where the light entered through the jags of broken walls and partitions .   it had been solidified heartache .  it had been blasphemy .   she had left  clangingly     running until her feet pounded softly on earth once more .   and then she could only look back longingly .  she dared not disturb that mighty brooding once more .   somewhere on this world  she knew  she had been born     near the old imperial library  which was the veriest trantor of trantor .  it was the sacred of the sacred  the holy of holies .  of all the world  it alone had survived the great sack and for a century it had remained complete and untouched  defiant of the universe .   there hari seldon and his group had woven their unimaginable web .  there ebling mis pierced the secret  and sat numbed in his vast surprise  until he was killed to prevent the secret from going further .   there at the imperial library  her grandparents had lived for ten years  until the mule died  and they could return to the reborn foundation .   there at the imperial library  her own father returned with his bride to find the second foundation once again  but failed .  there  she had been born and there her mother had died .   she would have liked to visit the library  but preem palver shook his round head .   it s thousands of miles  arkady  and there s so much to do here .  besides  it s not good to bother there .  you know  it s a shrine      but arcadia knew that he had no desire to visit the library  that it was a case of the mule s palace over again .  there was this superstitious fear on the part of the pygmies of the present for the relies of the giants of the past .   yet it would have been horrible to feel a grudge against the funny little man for that .  she had been on trantor now for nearly three months and in all that time  he and she     pappa and mamma     had been wonderful to her     and what was her return .  why  to involve them in the common ruin .  had she warned them that she was marked for destruction  perhaps .  no .  she let them assume the deadly role of protectors .   her conscience panged unbearably     yet what choice had she .   she stepped reluctantly down the stairs to breakfast .  the voices reached her .   preem palver had tucked the napkin down his shirt collar with a twist of his plump neck and had reached for his poached eggs with an uninhibited satisfaction .    i was down in the city yesterday  mamma   he said  wielding his fork and nearly drowning the words with a capacious mouthful .    and what is down in the city  pappa .   asked mamma indifferently  sitting down  looking sharply about the table  and rising again for the salt .    ah  not so good .  a ship came in from out kalgan way with newspapers from there .  it s war there .     war .  so .  well  let them break their heads  if they have no more sense inside .  did your pay check come yet .  pappa  i m telling you again .  you warn old man cosker this isn t the only cooperative in the world .  it s bad enough they pay you what i m ashamed to tell my friends  but at least on time they could be .     time  shmime   said pappa  irritably .   look  don t make me silly talk at breakfast  it should choke me each bite in the throat   and he wreaked havoc among the buttered toast as he said it .  he added  somewhat more moderately   the fighting is between kalgan and the foundation  and for two months  they ve been at it .    his hands lunged at one another in mock representation of a space fight .    um m m .  and what s doing .     bad for the foundation .  well  you saw kalgan  all soldiers .  they were ready .  the foundation was not  and so     poof .    and suddenly  mamma laid down her fork and hissed   fool .     huh .     dumb head .  your big mouth is always moving and wagging .    she was pointing quickly and when pappa looked over his shoulder  there was arcadia  frozen in the doorway .   she said   the foundation is at war .    pappa looked helplessly at mamma  then nodded .    and they re losing .    again the nod .   arcadia felt the unbearable catch in her throat  and slowly approached the table .   is it over .   she whispered .    over .   repeated pappa  with false heartiness .   who said it was over .  in war  lots of things can happen .  and  .  .  .  and       sit down  darling   said mamma  soothingly .   no one should talk before breakfast .  you re not in a healthy condition with no food in the stomach .    but arcadia ignored her .   are the kalganians on terminus .     no   said pappa  seriously .   the news is from last week  and terminus is still fighting .  this is honest .  i m telling the truth .  and the foundation is still strong .  do you want me to get you the newspapers .     yes .    she read them over what she could eat of her breakfast and her eyes blurred as she read .  santanni and korell were gone     without a fight .  a squadron of the foundation s navy had been trapped in the sparsely sunned ifni sector and wiped out to almost the last ship .   and now the foundation was back to the four kingdom core     the original realm which had been built up under salvor hardin  the first mayor .  but still it fought     and still there might be a chance and whatever happened  she must inform her father .  she must somehow reach his ear .  she must .   but how .  with a war in the way .   she asked pappa after breakfast   are you going out on a new mission soon  mr .  palver .    pappa was on the large chair on the front lawn  sunning himself .  a fat cigar smoldered between his plump fingers and he looked like a beatific pug dog .    a mission .   he repeated  lazily .   who knows .  it s a nice vacation and my leave isn t up .  why talk about new missions .  you re restless  arkady .     me .  no  i like it here .  you re very good to me  you and mrs .  palver .    he waved his hand at her  brushing away her words .   arcadia said   i was thinking about the war .     but don t think about it .  what can you do .  if it s something you can t help  why hurt yourself over it .     but i was thinking that the foundation has lost most of its farming worlds .  they re probably rationing food there .    pappa looked uncomfortable .   don t worry .  it ll be all right .    she scarcely listened .   i wish i could carry food to them  that s what .  you know after the mule died  and the foundation rebelled  terminus was just about isolated for a time and general han pritcher  who succeeded the mule for a while was laying siege to it .  food was running awfully low and my father says that his father told him that they only had dry amino acid concentrates that tasted terrible .  why  one egg cost two hundred credits .  and then they broke the siege just in time and food ships came through from santanni .  it must have been an awful time .  probably it s happening all over  now .    there was a pause  and then arcadia said   you know  i ll bet the foundation would be willing to pay smuggler s prices for food now .  double and triple and more .  gee  if any co operative  f r instance  here on trantor took over the job  they might lose some ships  but  i ll bet they d be war millionaires before it was over .  the foundation traders in the old days used to do that all the time .  there d be a war  so they d sell whatever was needed bad and take their chances .  golly  they used to make as much as two million dollars out of one trip     profit .  that was just out of what they could carry on one ship  too .    pappa stirred .  his cigar had gone out  unnoticed .   a deal for food  huh .  hm m m    but the foundation is so far away .     oh  i know .  i guess you couldn t do it from here .  if you took a regular liner you probably couldn t get closer than massena or smushyk  and after that you d have to hire a small scoutship or something to slip you through the lines .    pappa s hand brushed at his hair  as he calculated .   two weeks later  arrangements for the mission were completed .  mamma railed for most of the time    first  at the incurable obstinacy with which he courted suicide .  then  at the incredible obstinacy with which he refused to allow her to accompany him .   pappa said   mamma  why do you act like an old lady .  i can t take you .  it s a man s work .  what do you think a war is .  fun .  child s play .     then why do you go .  are you a man  you old fool     with a leg and half an arm in the grave .  let some of the young ones go     not a fat bald head like you .     i m not a bald head   retorted pappa  with dignity .   i got yet lots of hair .  and why should it not be me that gets the commission .  why  a young fellow .  listen  this could mean millions .    she knew that and she subsided .   arcadia saw him once before he left .   she said   are you going to terminus .     why not .  you say yourself they need bread and rice and potatoes .  well  i ll make a deal with them  and they ll get it .     well  then     just one thing  if you re going to terminus  could you  .  .  .  would you see my father .    and pappa s face crinkled and seemed to melt into sympathy   oh     and i have to wait for you to tell me .  sure  i ll see him .  i ll tell him you re safe and everything s o . k .   and when the war is over  i ll bring you back .     thanks .  i ll tell you how to find him .  his name is dr .  toran darell and he lives in stanmark .  that s just outside terminus city  and you can get a little commuting plane that goes there .  we   re at    channel drive .     wait  and i   ll write it down .     no  no   arcadia s arm shot out .   you mustn t write anything down .  you must remember     and find him without anybody s help .    pappa looked puzzled .  then he shrugged his shoulders .   all right  then .  it s    channel drive in stanmark  outside terminus city  and you commute there by plane .  all right .     one other thing .     yes .     would you tell him something from me .     sure .     i want to whisper it to you .    he leaned his plump cheek toward her  and the little whispered sound passed from one to the other .   pappa s eyes were round .   that s what you want me to say .  but it doesn t make sense .     he ll know what you mean .  just say i sent it and that i said he would know what it means .  and you say it exactly the way i told you .  no different .  you won t forget it .     how can i forget it .  five little words .  look       no  no .   she hopped up and down in the intensity of her feelings .   don t repeat it .  don t ever repeat it to anyone .  forget all about it except to my father .  promise me .    pappa shrugged again .   i promise .  all right .     all right   she said  mournfully  and as he passed down the drive to where the air taxi waited to take him to the spaceport  she wondered if she had signed his death warrant .  she wondered if she would ever see him again .   she scarcely dared to walk into the house again to face the good  kind mamma .  maybe when it was all over  she had better kill herself for what she had done to them .           end of war  quoriston  battle of fought on            f . e .  between the forces of the foundation and those of lord stettin of kalgan  it was the last battle of consequence during the interregnum  .  .  .  .   encyclopedia galactica  jole turbor  in his new role of war correspondent  found his bulk incased in a naval uniform  and rather liked it .  he enjoyed being back on the air  and some of the fierce helplessness of the futile fight against the second foundation left him in the excitement of another sort of fight with substantial ships and ordinary men .   to be sure  the foundation s fight had not been remarkable for victories  but it was still possible to be philosophic about the matter .  after six months  the hard core of the foundation was untouched  and the hard core of the fleet was still in being .  with the new additions since the start of the war  it was almost as strong numerically  and stronger technically  than before the defeat at ifni .   and meanwhile  planetary defenses were being strengthened  the armed forces better trained  administrative efficiency was having some of the water squeezed out of it     and much of the kalganian s conquering fleet was being wallowed down through the necessity of occupying the  conquered  territory .   at the moment  turbor was with the third fleet in the outer reaches of the anacreonian sector .  in line with his policy of making this a  little man s war   he was interviewing fennel leemor  engineer third class  volunteer .    tell us a little about yourself  sailor   said turbor .    ain t much to tell   leemor shuffled his feet and allowed a faint  bashful smile to cover his face  as though he could see all the millions that undoubtedly could see him at the moment .  i   m a locrian .  got a job in an air car factory  section head and good pay .  i m married  got two kids  both girls .  say  i couldn t say hello to them  could i     in case they re listening .     go ahead  sailor .  the video is all yours .     gosh  thanks .   he burbled   hello  milla  in case you re listening  i m fine .  is sunni all right .  and tomma .  i think of you all the time and maybe i ll be back on furlough after we get back to port .  i got your food parcel but i m sending it back .  we get our regular mess  but they say the civilians are a little tight .  i guess that s all .     i ll look her up next time i m on locris  sailor  and make sure she s not short of food .  o . k .  .    the young man smiled broadly and nodded his head .   thank you  mr .  turbor .  i   d appreciate that .     all right .  suppose you tell us  then    you re a volunteer  aren t you .     sure am .  if anyone picks a fight with me  i don t have to wait for anyone to drag me in .  i joined up the day i heard about the hober mallow .     that s a fine spirit .  have you seen much action .  i notice  you re wearing two battle stars .     ptah .   the sailor spat .   those weren t battles  they were chases .  the kalganians don t fight  unless they have odds of five to one or better in their favor .  even then they just edge in and try to cut us up ship by ship .  cousin of mine was at ifni and he was on a ship that got away  the old ebling mis .  he says it was the same there .  they had their main fleet against just a wing division of ours  and down to where we only had five ships left  they kept stalking instead of fighting .  we got twice as many of their ships at that fight .     then you think we re going to win the war .    sure bet  now that we aren t retreating .  even if things got too bad  that s when i d expect the second foundation to step in .  we still got the seldon plan     and they know it  too .    turbor s lips curled a bit .   you re counting on the second foundation  then .    the answer came with honest surprise .   well  doesn t everyone .    junior officer tippellum stepped into turbor s room after the visicast .  he shoved a cigarette at the correspondent and knocked his cap back to a perilous balance on the occiput .    we picked up a prisoner   he said .    yes .     little crazy fellow .  claims to be a neutral     diplomatic immunity  no less .  i don t think they know what to do with him .  his name s palvro  palver  something like that  and he says he s from trantor .  don t know what in space he s doing in a war zone .    but turbor had swung to a sitting position on his bunk and the nap he had been about to take was forgotten .  he remembered quite well his last interview with darell  the day after war had been declared and he was shoving off .    preem palver   he said .  it was a statement .   tippellum paused and let the smoke trickle out the sides of his mouth .   yeah   he said   how in space did you know .     never mind .  can i see him .     space  i can t say .  the old man has him in his own room for questioning .  everyone figures he s a spy .     you tell the old man that i know him  if he s who he claims he is .  i   ii take the responsibility .    captain dixyl on the flagship of the third fleet watched unremittingly at the grand detector .  no ship could avoid being a source of subatomic radiation     not even if it were lying an inert mass     and each focal point of such radiation was a little sparkle in the three dimensional field .   each one of the foundation s ships were accounted for and no sparkle was left over  now that the little spy who claimed to be a neutral had been picked up .  for a while  that outside ship had created a stir in the captain s quarters .  the tactics might have needed changing on short notice .  as it was      are you sure you have it .   he asked .   commander cenn nodded .   i will take my squadron through hyperspace  radius     .    parsecs  theta      .    degrees  phi     .    degrees .  return to origin at      .  total absence    .    hours .     right .  now we are going to count on pin point return as regards both space and time .  understand .     yes  captain .   he looked at his wrist watch   my ships will be ready by      .     good   said captain dixyl .   the kalganian squadron was not within detector range now  but they would be soon .  there was independent information to that effect .  without cenn s squadron the foundation forces would be badly outnumbered  but the captain was quite confident .  quite confident .   preem palver looked sadly about him .  first at the tall  skinny admiral  then at the others  everyone in uniform  and now at this last one  big and stout  with his collar open and no tie     not like the rest     who said he wanted to speak to him .   jole turbor was saying   i am perfectly aware  admiral  of the serious possibilities involved here  but i tell you that if i can be allowed to speak to him for a few minutes  i may be able to settle the current uncertainty .     is there any reason why you can t question him before me .    turbor pursed his lips and looked stubborn .   admiral   he said   while i have been attached to your ships  the third fleet has received an excellent press .  you may station men outside the door  if you like  and you may return in five minutes .  but  meanwhile  humor me a bit  and your public relations will not suffer .  do you understand me .    he did .   then turbor in the isolation that followed  turned to palver  and said   quickly     what is the name of the girl you abducted .    and palver could simply stare round eyed  and shake his head .    no nonsense   said turbor .   if you do not answer  you will be a spy and spies are blasted without trial in war time .     arcadia darell .   gasped palver .    well .  all right  then .  is she safe .    palver nodded .    you had better be sure of that  or it won t be well for you .     she is in good health  perfectly safe   said palver  palely .   the admiral returned   well .     the man  sir  is not a spy .  you may believe what he tells you .  i vouch for him .     that so .   the admiral frowned .   then he represents an agricultural co operative on trantor that wants to make a trade treaty with terminus for the delivery of grains and potatoes .  well  all right  but he can t leave now .     why not .   asked palver  quickly .    because we re in the middle of a battle .  after it is over     assuming we re still alive     we ll take you to terminus .    the kalganian fleet that spanned through space detected the foundation ships from an incredible distance and were themselves detected .  like little fireflies in each other s grand detectors  they closed in across the emptiness .   and the foundation s admiral frowned and said   this must be their main push .  look at the numbers .   then   they won t stand up before us  though  not if cenn s detachment can be counted on .    commander cenn had left hours before     at the first detection of the coming enemy .  there was no way of altering the plan now .  it worked or it didn t  but the admiral felt quite comfortable .  as did the officers .  as did the men .   again watch the fireflies .   like a deadly ballet dance  in precise formations  they sparked .   the foundation fleet edged slowly backwards .  hours passed and the fleet veered slowly off  teasing the advancing enemy slightly off course  then more so .   in the minds of the dictators of the battle plan  there was a certain volume of space that must be occupied by the kalganian ships .  out from that volume crept the foundationers  into it slipped the kalganians .  those that passed out again were attacked  suddenly and fiercely .  those that stayed within were not touched .   it all depended on the reluctance of the ships of lord stettin to take the initiative themselves     on their willingness to remain where none attacked .   captain dixyl stared frigidly at his wrist watch .  it was        we ve got twenty minutes   he said .   the lieutenant at his side nodded tensely   it looks all right so far  captain .  we ve got more than ninety percent of them boxed .  if we can keep them that way       yes .  if      the foundation ships were drifting forward again     very slowly .  not quick enough to urge a kalganian retreat and just quickly enough to discourage a kalganian advance .  they preferred to wait .   and the minutes passed .   at       the admiral s buzzer sounded in seventy five ships of the foundation s line  and they built up to a maximum acceleration towards the front plane of the kalganian fleet  itself three hundred strong .  kalganian shields flared into action  and the vast energy beams flicked out .  every one of the three hundred concentrated in the same direction  towards their mad attackers who bore down relentlessly  uncaringly and     at       fifty ships under commander cenn appeared from nowhere  in one single bound through hyperspace to a calculated spot at a calculated time     and were spaced in tearing fury at the unprepared kalganian rear .   the trap worked perfectly .   the kalganians still had numbers on their side  but they were in no mood to count .  their first effort was to escape and the formation once broken was only the more vulnerable  as the enemy ships bumbled into one another s path .   after a while  it took on the proportions of a rat hunt .   of three hundred kalganian ships  the core and pride of their fleet  some sixty or less  many in a state of near hopeless disrepair  reached kalgan once more .  the foundation loss was eight ships out of a total of one hundred twenty five .   preem palver landed on terminus at the height of the celebration .  he found the furore distracting  but before he left the planet  he had accomplished two things  and received one request .   the two things accomplished were     the conclusion of an agreement whereby palver s co operative was to deliver twenty shiploads of certain foodstuffs per month for the next year at a war price  without  thanks to the recent battle  a corresponding war risk  and    the transfer to dr .  darell of arcadia s five short words .   for a startled moment  darell had stared wide eyed at him  and then he had made his request .  it was to carry an answer back to arcadia .  palver liked it  it was a simple answer and made sense .  it was   come back now .  there won t be any danger .    lord stettin was in raging frustration .  to watch his every weapon break in his hands  to feel the firm fabric of his military might part like the rotten thread it suddenly turned out to be     would have turned phlegmaticism itself into flowing lava .  and yet he was helpless  and knew it .   he hadn t really slept well in weeks .  he hadn t shaved in three days .  he had canceled all audiences .  his admirals were left to themselves and none knew better than the lord of kalgan that very little time and no further defeats need elapse before he would have to contend with internal rebellion .   lev meirus  first minister  was no help .  he stood there  calm and indecently old  with his thin  nervous finger stroking  as always  the wrinkled line from nose to chin .    well   shouted stettin at him   contribute something .  we stand here defeated  do you understand .  defeated .  and why .  i don t know why .  there you have it .  i don t know why .  do you know why .     i think so   said meirus  calmly .    treason .   the word came out softly  and other words followed as softly .   you ve known of treason  and you ve kept quiet .  you served the fool i ejected from the first citizenship and you think you can serve whatever foul rat replaces me .  if you have acted so  i will extract your entrails for it and burn them before your living eyes .    meirus was unmoved .   i have tried to fill you with my own doubts  not once  but many times .  i have dinned it in your ears and you have preferred the advice of others because it stuffed your ego better .  matters have turned out not as i feared  but even worse .  if you do not care to listen now  say so  sir  and i shall leave  and  in due course  deal with your successor  whose first act  no doubt  will be to sign a treaty of peace .    stettin stared at him red eyed  enormous fists slowly clenching and unclenching .   speak  you gray slug .  speak .     i have told you often  sir  that you are not the mule .  you may control ships and guns but you cannot control the minds of your subjects .  are you aware  sir  of who it is you are fighting .  you fight the foundation  which is never defeated     the foundation  which is protected by the seldon plan     the foundation  which is destined to form a new empire .     there is no plan .  no longer .  munn has said so .     then munn is wrong .  and if he were right  what then .  you and i  sir  are not the people .  the men and women of kalgan and its subject worlds believe utterly and deeply in the seldon plan as do all the inhabitants of this end of the galaxy .  nearly four hundred years of history teach the fact that the foundation cannot be beaten .  neither the kingdoms nor the warlords nor the old galactic empire itself could do it .     the mule did it .     exactly  and he was beyond calculation     and you are not .  what is worse  the people know that you are not .  so your ships go into battle fearing defeat in some unknown way .  the insubstantial fabric of the plan hangs over them so that they are cautious and look before they attack and wonder a little too much .  while on the other side  that same insubstantial fabric fills the enemy with confidence  removes fear  maintains morale in the face of early defeats .  why not .  the foundation has always been defeated at first and has always won in the end .    and your own morale  sir .  you stand everywhere on enemy territory .  your own dominions have not been invaded  are still not in danger of invasion     yet you are defeated .  you don t believe in the possibility  even  of victory  because you know there is none .    stoop  then  or you will be beaten to your knees .  stoop voluntarily  and you may save a remnant .  you have depended on metal and power and they have sustained you as far as they could .  you have ignored mind and morale and they have failed you .  now  take my advice .  you have the foundation man  homir munn .  release him .  send him back to terminus and he will carry your peace offers .    stettin s teeth ground behind his pale  set lips .  but what choice had he .   on the first day of the new year  homir munn left kalgan again .  more than six months had passed since he had left terminus and in the interim  a war had raged and faded .   he had come alone  but he left escorted .  he had come a simple man of private life  he left the unappointed but nevertheless  actual  ambassador of peace .   and what had most changed was his early concern over the second foundation .  he laughed at the thought of that  and pictured in luxuriant detail the final revelation to dr .  darell  to that energetic  young competent  anthor  to all of them     he knew .  he  homir munn  finally knew the truth .            i know  .  .  .    the last two months of the stettinian war did not lag for homir .  in his unusual office as mediator extraordinary  he found himself the center of interstellar affairs  a role he could not help but find pleasing .   there were no further major battles     a few accidental skirmishes that could scarcely count     and the terms of the treaty were hammered out with little necessity for concessions on the part of the foundation .  stettin retained his office  but scarcely anything else .  his navy was dismantled  his possessions outside the home system itself made autonomous and allowed to vote for return to previous status  full independence or confederation within the foundation  as they chose .   the war was formally ended on an asteroid in terminus  own stellar system  site of the foundation s oldest naval base .  lev meirus signed for kalgan  and homir was an interested spectator .   throughout all that period he did not see dr .  darell  nor any of the others .  but it scarcely mattered .  his news would keep     and  as always  he smiled at the thought .   dr .  darell returned to terminus some weeks after vk day  and that same evening  his house served as the meeting place for the five men who  ten months earlier  had laid their first plans .   they lingered over dinner and then over wine as though hesitating to return again to the old subject .   it was jole turbor  who  peering steadily into the purple depths of the wineglass with one eye  muttered  rather than said   well  homir  you are a man of affairs now  i see .  you handled matters well .     i .   munn laughed loudly and joyously .  for some reason  he had not stuttered in months .   i hadn t a thing to do with it .  it was arcadia .  by the by  darell  how is she .  she s coming back from trantor  i heard .     you heard correctly   said darell  quietly .   her ship should dock within the week .   he looked  with veiled eyes  at the others  but there were only confused  amorphous exclamations of pleasure .  nothing else .   turbor said   then it s over  really .  who would have predicted all this ten months ago .  munn s been to kalgan and back .  arcadia s been to kalgan and trantor and is coming back .  we ve had a war and won it  by space .  they tell you that the vast sweeps of history can be predicted  but doesn t it seem conceivable that all that has just happened  with its absolute confusion to those of us who lived through it  couldn t possibly have been predicted .     nonsense   said anthor  acidly .   what makes you so triumphant  anyway .  you talk as though we have really won a war  when actually we have won nothing but a petty brawl which has served only to distract our minds from the real enemy .    there was an uncomfortable silence  in which only homir munn s slight smile struck a discordant note .   and anthor struck the arm of his chair with a balled and furyfilled fist   yes  i refer to the second foundation .  there is no mention of it and  if i judge correctly  every effort to have no thought of it .  is it because this fallacious atmosphere of victory that palls over this world of idiots is so attractive that you feel you must participate .  turn somersaults then  handspring your way into a wall  pound one another s back and throw confetti out the window .  do whatever you please  only get it out of your system     and when you are quite done and you are yourselves again  return and let us discuss that problem which exists now precisely as it did ten months ago when you sat here with eyes cocked over your shoulders for fear of you knew not what .  do you really think that the mind masters of the second foundation are less to be feared because you have beat down a foolish wielder of spaceships .    he paused  red faced and panting .   munn said quietly   will you hear me speak now  anthor .  or do you prefer to continue your role as ranting conspirator .     have your say  homir   said darell   but let s all of us refrain from over picturesqueness of language .  it s a very good thing in its place  but at present  it bores me .    homir munn leaned back in his armchair and carefully refilled his glass from the decanter at his elbow .    i was sent to kalgan   he said   to find out what i could from the records contained in the mule s palace .  i spent several months doing so .  i seek no credit for that accomplishment .  as i have indicated  it was arcadia whose ingenuous intermeddling obtained the entry for me .  nevertheless  the fact remains that to my original knowledge of the mule s life and times  which  i submit  was not small  i have added the fruits of much labor among primary evidence which has been available to no one else .    i am  therefore  in a unique position to estimate the true danger of the second foundation  much more so than is our excitable friend here .     and   grated anthor   what is your estimate of that danger .     why  zero .    a short pause  and elvett semic asked with an air of surprised disbelief   you mean zero danger .     certainly .  friends  there is no second foundation .    anthor s eyelids closed slowly and he sat there  face pale and expressionless .   munn continued  aftention centering and loving it   and what is more  there was never one .     on what   asked darell   do you base this surprising conclusion .     i deny   said munn   that it is surprising .  you all know the story of the mule s search for the second foundation .  but what do you know of the intensity of that search     of the single mindedness of it .  he had tremendous resources at his disposal and he spared none of it .  he was single minded     and yet he failed .  no second foundation was found .     one could scarcely expect it to be found   pointed out turbor  restlessly .   it had means of protecting itself against inquiring minds .     even when the mind that is inquiring is the mule s mutant mentality .  i think not .  but come  you do not expect me to give you the gist of fifty volumes of reports in five minutes .  all of it  by the terms of the peace treaty will be part of the seldon historical museum eventually  and you will all be free to be as leisurely in your analysis as i have been .  you will find his conclusion plainly stated  however  and that i have already expressed .  there is not  and has never been  any second foundation .    semic interposed   well  what stopped the mule  then .     great galaxy  what do you suppose stopped him .  death did  as it will stop all of us .  the greatest superstition of the age is that the mule was somehow stopped in an all conquering career by some mysterious entities superior even to himself .  it is the result of looking at everything in wrong focus .    certainly no one in the galaxy can help knowing that the mule was a freak  physical as well as mental .  he died in his thirties because his ill adjusted body could no longer struggle its creaking machinery along .  for several years before his death he was an invalid .  his best health was never more than an ordinary man s feebleness .  all right  then .  he conquered the galaxy and  in the ordinary course of nature  proceeded to die .  it s a wonder he proceeded as long and as well as he did .  friends  it s down in the very clearest print .  you have only to have patience .  you have only to try to look at all facts in new focus .    darell said  thoughtfully   good  let us try that munn .  it would be an interesting attempt and  if nothing else  would help oil our thoughts .  these tampered men     the records of which anthor brought to us nearly a year ago  what of them .  help us to see them in focus .     easily .  how old a science is encephalographic analysis .  or  put it another way  how well developed is the study of neuronic pathways .     we are at the beginning in this respect .  granted   said darell .    right .  how certain can we be then as to the interpretation of what i ve heard anthor and yourself call the tamper plateau .  you have your theories  but how certain can you be .  certain enough to consider it a firm basis for the existence of a mighty force for which all other evidence is negative .  it s always easy to explain the unknown by postulating a superhuman and arbitrary will .    it s a very human phenomenon .  there have been cases all through galactic history where isolated planetary systems have reverted to savagery  and what have we learned there .  in every case  such savages attribute the to them incomprehensible forces of nature     storms  pestilences  droughts     to sentient beings more powerful and more arbitrary than men .    it is called anthropomorphism  i believe  and in this respect  we are savages and indulge in it .  knowing little of mental science  we blame anything we don t know on supermen     those of the second foundation in this case  based on the hint thrown us by seldon .     oh   broke in anthor   then you do remember seldon .  i thought you had forgotten .  seldon did say there was a second foundation .  get that in focus .    and are you aware then of all seldon s purposes .  do you know what necessities were involved in his calculations .  the second foundation may have been a very necessary scarecrow  with a highly specific end in view .  how did we defeat kalgan  for instance .  what were you saying in your last series of articles  turbor .    turbor stirred his bulk .   yes  i see what  you re driving at .  i was on kalgan towards the end  darell  and it was quite obvious that morale on the planet was incredibly bad .  i looked through their news records and     well .  they expected to be beaten .  actually  they were completely unmanned by the thought that eventually the second foundation would take a hand  on the side of the first  naturally .     quite right   said munn .   i was there all through the war .  i told stettin there was no second foundation and he believed me .  he felt safe .  but there was no way of making the people suddenly disbelieve what they had believed all their lives  so that the myth eventually served a very useful purpose in seldon s cosmic chess game .    but anthor s eyes opened  quite suddenly  and fixed themselves sardonically on munn s countenance .   i say you lie .    homir turned pale   i don t see that i have to accept  much less answer  an accusation of that nature .     i say it without any intention of personal offense .  you cannot help lying  you don t realize that you are .  but you lie just the same .    semic laid his withered hand on the young man s sleeve .   take a breath  young fella .    anthor shook him off  none too gently  and said   i m out of patience with all of you .  i haven t seen this man more than half a dozen times in my life  yet i find the change in him unbelievable .  the rest of you have known him for years  yet pass it by .  it is enough to drive one mad .  do you call this man you ve been listening to homir munn .  he is not the homir munn i knew .    a medley of shock  above which munn s voice cried   you claim me to be an impostor .     perhaps not in the ordinary sense   shouted anthor above the din   but an impostor nonetheless .  quiet  everyone .  i demand to be heard .    he frowned them ferociously into obedience .   do any of you remember homir munn as i do     the introverted librarian who never talked without obvious embarrassment  the man of tense and nervous voice  who stuttered out his uncertain sentences .  does this man sound like him .  he s fluent  he s confident  he s fun of theories  and  by space  he doesn t stutter .  is he the same person .    even munn looked confused  and pelleas anthor drove on .   well  shall we test him .     how .   asked darell .    you ask how .  there is the obvious way .  you have his encephalographic record of ten months ago  haven t you .  run one again  and compare .    he pointed at the frowning librarian  and said violently   i dare him to refuse to subject himself to analysis .     i don t object   said munn  defiantly .   i am the man i always was .     can you know .   said anthor with contempt .   i   ll go further .  i trust no one here .  i want everyone to undergo analysis .  there has been a war .  munn has been on kalgan  turbor has been on board ship and all over the war areas .  darell and semic have been absent  too     i have no idea where .  only i have remained here in seclusion and safety  and i no longer trust any of the rest of you .  and to play fair  i   ll submit to testing as well .  are we agreed then .  or do i leave now and go my own way .    turbor shrugged and said   i have no objection .     i have already said i don t   said munn .   semic moved a hand in silent assent  and anthor waited for darell .  finally  darell nodded his head .    take me first   said anthor .   the needles traced their delicate way across the cross hatchings as the young neurologist sat frozen in the reclining seat  with lidded eyes brooding heavily .  from the files  darell removed the folder containing anthor s old encephalographic record .  he showed them to anthor .    that s your own signature  isn t it .     yes  yes .  it s my record .  make the comparison .    the scanner threw old and new on to the screen .  all six curves in each recording were there  and in the darkness  munn s voice sounded in harsh clarity .   well  now  look there .  there s a change .     those are the primary waves of the frontal lobe .  it doesn t mean a thing  homir .  those additional jags you re pointing to are just anger .  it s the others that count .    he touched a control knob and the six pairs melted into one another and coincided .  the deeper amplitude of primaries alone introduced doubling .    satisfied .   asked anthor .   darell nodded curtly and took the seat himself .  semic followed him and turbor followed him .  silently the curves were collected  silently they were compared .   munn was the last to take his seat .  for a moment  he hesitated  then  with a touch of desperation in his voice  he said   well now  look  i m coming in last and i m under tension .  i expect due allowance to be made for that .     there will be   darell assured him .   no conscious emotion of yours will affect more than the primaries and they are not important .    it might have been hours  in the utter silence that followed  and then in the darkness of the comparison  anthor said huskily   sure  sure  it s only the onset of a complex .  isn t that what he told us .  no such thing as tampering  it s all a silly anthropomorphic notion     but look at it .  a coincidence i suppose .     what s the matter .   shrieked munn .   darell s hand was tight on the librarian s shoulder .   quiet  munn     you ve been handled  you ve been adjusted by them .    then the light went on  and munn was looking about him with broken eyes  making a horrible attempt to smile .    you can t be serious  surely .  there is a purpose to this .  you re testing me .    but darell only shook his head .   no  no  homir .  it s true .    the librarian s eyes were filled with tears  suddenly .   i don t feel any different .  i can t believe it .   with sudden conviction   you are all in this .  it s a conspiracy .    darell attempted a soothing gesture  and his hand was struck aside .  munn snarled   you re planning to kill me .  by space  you re planning to kill me .    with a lunge  anthor was upon him .  there was the sharp crack of bone against bone  and homir was limp and flaccid with that look of fear frozen on his face .   anthor rose shakily  and said   we d better tie and gag him .  later  we can decide what to do .   he brushed his long hair back .   turbor said   how did you guess there was something wrong with him .    anthor turned sardonically upon him .   it wasn t difficult .  you see  i happen to know where the second foundation really is .    successive shocks have a decreasing effect     it was with actual mildness that semic asked   are you sure .  i mean we   ve just gone through this sort of business with munn      this isn t quite the same   returned anthor .   darell  the day the war started  i spoke to you most seriously .  i tried to have you leave terminus .  i would have told you then what i will tell you now  if i had been able to trust you .     you mean you have known the answer for half a year .   smiled darell .    i have known it from the time i learned that arcadia had left for trantor .    and darell started to his feet in sudden consternation .   what had arcadia to do with it .  what are you implying .     absolutely nothing that is not plain on the face of all the events we know so well .  arcadia goes to kalgan and flees in terror to the very center of the galaxy  rather than return home .  lieutenant dirige  our best agent on kalgan is tampered with .  homir munn goes to kalgan and he is tampered with .  the mule conquered the galaxy  but  queerly enough  he made kalgan his headquarters  and it occurs to me to wonder if he was conqueror or  perhaps  tool .  at every turn  we meet with kalgan  kalgan     nothing but kalgan  the world that somehow survived untouched all the struggles of the warlords for over a century .     your conclusion  then .     is obvious   anthor s eyes were intense .   the second foundation is on kalgan .    turbor interrupted .   i was on kalgan  anthor .  i was there last week .  if there was any second foundation on it  i m mad .  personally  i think you re mad .    the young man whirled on him savagely .   then you re a fat fool .  what do you expect the second foundation to be .  a grammar school .  do you think that radiant fields in tight beams spell out    second foundation  in green and purple along the incoming spaceship routes .  listen to me  turbor .  wherever they are  they form a tight oligarchy .  they must be as well hidden on the world on which they exist  as the world itself is in the galaxy as a whole .    turbor s jaw muscles writhed .   i don t like your attitude  anthor .     that certainly disturbs me   was the sarcastic response .   take a look about you here on terminus .  we   re at the center     the core     the origin of the first foundation with all its knowledge of physical science .  well  how many of the population are physical scientists .  can you operate an energy transmitting station .  what do you know of the operation of a hyperatomic motor .  eh .  the number of real scientists on terminus     even on terminus     can be numbered at less than one percent of the population .    and what then of the second foundation where secrecy must be preserved .  there will still be less of the cognoscenti  and these will be hidden even from their own world .     say   said semic  carefully .   we just licked kalgan       so we did .  so we did   said anthor  sardonically .   oh  we celebrate that victory .  the cities are still illuminated  they are still shooting off fireworks  they are still shouting over the televisors .  but now  now  when the search is on once more for the second foundation  where is the last place well look  where is the last place anyone will look .  right .   kalgan .    we haven t hurt them  you know  not really .  we ve destroyed some ships  killed a few thousands  torn away their empire  taken over some of their commercial and economic power     but that all means nothing .  i ll wager that not one member of the real ruling class of kalgan is in the least discomfited .  on the contrary  they are now safe from curiosity .  but not from my curiosity .  what do you say  darell .    darell shrugged his shoulders .   interesting .  i   m trying to fit it in with a message i received from arcadia a few months since .     oh  a message .   asked anthor .   and what was it .     well  i m not certain .  five short words .  but its interesting .     look   broke in semic  with a worried interest   there s something i don t understand .     what s that .    semic chose his words carefully  his old upper lip lifting with each word as if to let them out singly and reluctantly .   well  now  homir munn was saying just a while ago that hari seldon was faking when he said that he had established a second foundation .  now you re saying that it s not so  that seldon wasn t faking  eh .     right  he wasn t faking .  seldon said he had established a second foundation and so he had .     all right  then  but he said something else  too .  he said he established the two foundations at opposite ends of the galaxy .  now  young man  was that a fake     because kalgan isn t at the opposite end of the galaxy .    anthor seemed annoyed   that s a minor point .  that part may well have been a cover up to protect them .  but after all  think    what real use would it serve to have the mind masters at the opposite end of the galaxy .  what is their function .  to help preserve the plan .  who are the main card players of the plan .  we  the first foundation .  where can they best observe us  then  and serve their own ends .  at the opposite end of the galaxy .  ridiculous .  they re within fifty parsecs  actually  which is much more sensible .     i like that argument   said darell .   it makes sense .  look here  munn s been conscious for some time and i propose we loose him .  he can t do any harm  really .    anthor looked rebellious  but homir was nodding vigorously .  five seconds later he was rubbing his wrists just as vigorously .    how do you feel .   asked darell .    rotten   said munn  sulkily   but never mind .  there s something i want to ask this bright young thing here .  i ve heard what he s had to say  and i   d just like permission to wonder what we do next .    there was a queer and incongruous silence .   munn smiled bitterly .   well  suppose kalgan is the second foundation .  who on kalgan are they .  how are you going to find them .  how are you going to tackle them if you find them  eh .     ah   said darell   i can answer that  strangely enough .  shall i tell you what semic and i have been doing this past half year .  it may give you another reason  anthor  why i was anxious to remain on terminus all this time .     in the first place   he went on   i ve been working on encephalographic analysis with more purpose than any of you may suspect .  detecting second foundation minds is a little more subtle than simply finding a tamper plateau     and i did not actually succeed .  but i came close enough .    do you know  any of you  how emotional control works .  it s been a popular subject with fiction writers since the time of the mule and much nonsense has been written  spoken  and recorded about it .  for the most part  it has been treated as something mysterious and occult .  of course  it isn t .  that the brain is the source of a myriad  tiny electromagnetic fields  everyone knows .  every fleeting emotion varies those fields in more or less intricate fashion  and everyone should know that  too .    now it is possible to conceive a mind which can sense these changing fields and even resonate with them .  that is  a special organ of the cerebrum can exist which can take on whatever field pattern it may detect .  exactly how it would do this  i have no idea  but that doesn t matter .  if i were blind  for instance  i could still learn the significance of photons and energy quanta and it could be reasonable to me that the absorption of a photon of such energy could create chemical changes in some organ of the body such that its presence would be detectable .  but  of course  i would not be able  thereby  to understand color .    do all of you follow .    there was a firm nod from anthor  a doubtful nod from the others .    such a hypothetical mind resonating organ  by adjusting itself to the fields emitted by other minds could perform what is popularly known as  reading emotion    or even  reading minds     which is actually something even more subtle .  it is but an easy step from that to imagining a similar organ which could actually force an adjustment on another mind .  it could orient with its stronger field the weaker one of another mind     much as a strong magnet will orient the atomic dipoles in a bar of steel and leave it magnetized thereafter .    i solved the mathematics of second foundationism in the sense that i evolved a function that would predict the necessary combination of neuronic paths that would allow for the formation of an organ such as i have just described     but  unfortunately  the function is too complicated to solve by any of the mathematical tools at present known .  that is too bad  because it means that i can never detect a mind worker by his encephalographic pattern alone .    but i could do something else .  i could  with semic s help  construct what i shall describe as a mental static device .  it is not beyond the ability of modem science to create an energy source that will duplicate an encephalograph type pattern of electromagnetic field .  moreover  it can be made to shift at complete random  creating  as far as this particular mind sense is concerned  a sort of  noise  or  static  which masks other minds with which it may be in contact .    do you still follow .    semic chuckled .  he had helped create blindly  but he had guessed  and guessed correctly .  the old man had a trick or two left     anthor said   i think i do .     the device   continued darell   is a fairly easy one to produce  and i had all the resources of the foundation under my control as it came under the heading of war research .  and now the mayor s offices and the legislative assemblies are surrounded with mental static .  so are most of our key factories .  so is this building .  eventually  any place we wish can be made absolutely safe from the second foundation or from any future mule .  and that s it .    he ended quite simply with a flat palmed gesture of the hand .   turbor seemed stunned .   then it s all over .  great seldon  it s all over .     well   said darell   not exactly .     how  not exactly .  is there something more .     yes  we haven t located the second foundation yet .     what   roared anthor   are you trying to say       yes  i am .  kalgan is not the second foundation .     how do you know .     it s easy   grunted darell .   you see i happen to know where the second foundation really is .            the answer that satisfied  turbor laughed suddenly     laughed in huge  windy gusts that bounced ringingly off the walls and died in gasps .  he shook his head  weakly  and said   great galaxy  this goes on all night .  one after another  we put up our straw men to be knocked down .  we have fun  but we don t get anywhere .  space .  maybe all planets are the second foundation .  maybe they have no planet  just key men spread on all the planets .  and what does it matter  since darell says we have the perfect defense .    darell smiled without humor .   the perfect defense is not enough  turbor .  even my mental static device is only something that keeps us in the same place .  we cannot remain forever with our fists doubled  frantically staring in all directions for the unknown enemy .  we must know not only how to win  but whom to defeat .  and there is a specific world on which the enemy exists .     get to the point   said anthor  wearily .   what s your information .     arcadia   said darell   sent me a message  and until i got it  i never saw the obvious .  i probably would never have seen the obvious .  yet it was a simple message that went   a circle has no end .     do you see .     no   said anthor  stubbornly  and he spoke  quite obviously  for the others .    a circle has no end   repeated munn  thoughtfully  and his forehead furrowed .    well   said darell  impatiently   it was clear to me    what is the one absolute fact we know about the second foundation  eh .  i ll tell you .  we know that hari seldon located it at the opposite end of the galaxy .  homir munn theorized that seldon lied about the existence of the foundation .  pelleas anthor theorized that seldon had told the truth that far  but lied about the location of the foundation .  but i tell you that hari seldon lied in no particular  that he told the absolute truth .    but  what is the other end .  the galaxy is a flat  lens shaped object .  a cross section along the flatness of it is a circle  and a circle had no end     as arcadia realized .  we     we  the first foundation     are located on terminus at the rim of that circle .  we are at an end of the galaxy  by definition .  now follow the rim of that circle and find the other end .  follow it  follow it  follow it  and you will find no other end .  you will merely come back to your starting point      and there you will find the second foundation .     there .   repeated anthor .   do you mean here .     yes  i mean here .   cried darell  energetically .   why  where else could it possibly be .  you said yourself that if the second foundationers were the guardians of the seldon plan  it was unlikely that they could be located at the so called other end of the galaxy  where they would be as isolated as they could conceivably be .  you thought that fifty parsecs distance was more sensible .  i tell you that that is also too far .  that no distance at all is more sensible .  and where would they be safest .  who would look for them here .  oh  it s the old principle of the most obvious place being the least suspicious .    why was poor ebling mis so surprised and unmanned by his discovery of the location of the second foundation .  there he was  looking for it desperately in order to warn it of the coming of the mule  only to find that the mule had already captured both foundations at a stroke .  and why did the mule himself fail .  in his search .  why not .  if one is searching for an unconquerable menace  one would scarcely look among the enemies already conquered .  so the mind masters  in their own leisurely time  could lay their plans to stop the mule  and succeeded in stopping him .    oh  it is maddeningly simple .  for here we are with our plots and our schemes  thinking that we are keeping our secrecy     when all the time we are in the very heart and core of our enemy s stronghold .  it s humorous .    anthor did not remove the skepticism from his face   you honestly believe this theory  dr .  darell .     i honestly believe it .     then any of our neighbors  any man we pass in the street might be a second foundation superman  with his mind watching yours and feeling the pulse of its thoughts .     exactly .     and we have been permitted to proceed all this time  without molestation .     without molestation .  who told you we were not molested .  you  yourself  showed that munn has been tampered with .  what makes you think that we sent him to kalgan in the first place entirely of our own volition     or that arcadia overheard us and followed him on her own volition .  hah .  we have been molested without pause  probably .  and after all  why should they do more than they have .  it is far more to their benefit to mislead us  than merely to stop us .    anthor buried himself in meditation and emerged therefrom with a dissatisfied expression .   well  then  i don t like it .  your mental static isn t worth a thought .  we can t stay in the house forever and as soon as we leave  we re lost  with what we now think we know .  unless you can build a little machine for every inhabitant in the galaxy .     yes  but we re not quite helpless  anthor .  these men of the second foundation have a special sense which we lack .  it is their strength and also their weakness .  for instance  is there any weapon of attack that will be effective against a normal  sighted man which is useless against a blind man .     sure   said munn  promptly .   a light in the eyes .     exactly   said darell .   a good  strong blinding light .     well  what of it .   asked turbor .    but the analogy is clear .  i have a mind static device .  it sets up an artificial electromagnetic pattern  which to the mind of a man of the second foundation would be like a beam of light to us .  but the mind static device is kaleidoscopic .  it shifts quickly and continuously  faster than the receiving mind can follow .  all right then  consider it a flickering light  the kind that would give you a headache  if continued long enough .  now intensify that light or that electromagnetic field until it is blinding     and it will become a pain  an unendurable pain .  but only to those with the proper sense  not to the unsensed .     really .   said anthor  with the beginnings of enthusiasm .   have you tried this .     on whom .  of course  i haven t tried it .  but it will work .     well  where do you have the controls for the field that surrounds the house .  id like to see this thing .     here .   darell reached into his jacket pocket .  it was a small thing  scarcely bulging his pocket .  he tossed the black  knob studded cylinder to the other .   anthor inspected it carefully and shrugged his shoulders .   it doesn t make me any smarter to look at it .  look darell  what mustn t i touch .  i don t want to turn off the house defense by accident  you know .     you won t   said darell  indifferently .   that control is locked in place .   he flicked at a toggle switch that didn t move .    and what s this knob .     that one varies rate of shift of pattern .  here     this one varies the intensity .  it s that which i ve been referring to .     may i     asked anthor  with his finger on the intensity knob .  the others were crowding close .    why not .   shrugged dareli .   it won t affect us .    slowly  almost wincingly  anthor turned the knob  first in one direction  then in another .  turbor was gritting his teeth  while munn blinked his eyes rapidly .  it was as though they were keening their inadequate sensory equipment to locate this impulse which could not affect them .   finally  anthor shrugged and tossed the control box back into darell s lap .   well  i suppose we can take your word for it .  but it s certainly hard to imagine that anything was happening when i turned the knob .     but naturally  pelleas anthor   said darell  with a tight smile .   the one i gave you was a dummy .  you see i have another .   he tossed his jacket aside and seized a duplicate of the control box that anthor had been investigating  which swung from his belt .    you see   said darell  and in one gesture turned the intensity knob to maximum .   and with an unearthly shriek  pelleas anthor sank to the floor .  he rolled in his agony  whitened  gripping fingers clutching and tearing futilely at his hair .   munn lifted his feet hastily to prevent contact with the squirming body  and his eyes were twin depths of horror .  semic and turbor were a pair of plaster casts  stiff and white .   darell  somber  turned the knob back once more .  and anthor twitched feebly once or twice and lay still .  he was alive  his breath racking his body .    lift him on to the couch   said darell  grasping the young man s head .   help me here .    turbor reached for the feet .  they might have been lifting a sack of flour .  then  after long minutes  the breathing grew quieter  and anthor s eyelids fluttered and lifted .  his face was a horrid yellow  his hair and body was soaked in perspiration  and his voice  when he spoke  was cracked and unrecognizable .    don t   he muttered   don t .  don t do that again .  you don t know    you don t know    oh h h .   it was a long  trembling moan .    we won t do it again   said darell   if you will tell us the truth .  you are a member of the second foundation .     let me have some water   pleaded anthor .    get some  turbor   said darell   and bring the whiskey bottle .    he repeated the question after pouring a jigger of whiskey and two glasses of water into anthor .  something seemed to relax in the young man      yes   he said  wearily .   i am a member of the second foundation .     which   continued darell   is located on terminus     here .     yes  yes .  you are right in every particular  dr .  darell .     good .  now explain what s been happening this past half year .  tell us .     i would like to sleep   whispered anthor .    later .  speak now .    a tremulous sigh .  then words  low and hurried .  the others bent over him to catch the sound   the situation was growing dangerous .  we knew that terminus and its physical scientists were becoming interested in brain wave patterns and that the times were ripe for the development of something like the mind static device .  and there was growing enmity toward the second foundation .  we had to stop it without ruining seidon s plan .    we  .  .  .  we tried to control the movement .  we tried to join it .  it would turn suspicion and efforts away from us .  we saw to it that kalgan declared war as a further distraction .  that s why i sent munn to kalgan .  stettin s supposed mistress was one of us .  she saw to it that munn made the proper moves       callia is     cried munn  but darell waved him silent .   anthor continued  unaware of any interruption   arcadia followed .  we hadn t counted on that     can t foresee everything     so callia maneuvered her to trantor to prevent interference .  that s all .  except that we lost .     you tried to get me to go to trantor  didn t you .   asked darell .   anthor nodded   had to get you out of the way .  the growing triumph in your mind was clear enough .  you were solving the problems of the mind static device .     why didn t you put me under control .     couldn t  .  .  .  couldn t .  had my orders .  we were working according to a plan .  if i improvised  i would have thrown everything off .  plan only predicts probabilities  .  .  .  you know that  .  .  .  like seldon s plan .   he was talking in anguished pants  and almost incoherently .  his head twisted from side to side in a restless fever .   we worked with individuals  .  .  .  not groups  .  .  .  very low probabilities involved  .  .  .  lost out .  besides  .  .  .  if control you  .  .  .  someone else invent device  .  .  .  no use  .  .  .  had to control times  .  .  .  more subtle  .  .  .  first speaker s own plan  .  .  .  don t know all angles  .  .  .  except  .  .  .  didn t work a a a     he ran down .   darell shook him roughly   you can t sleep yet .  how many of you are there .     huh .  whatjasay  .  .  .  oh  .  .  .  not many  .  .  .  be surprised fifty  .  .  .  don t need more .     all here on terminus .     five  .  .  .  six out in space  .  .  .  like callia  .  .  .  got to sleep .    he stirred himself suddenly as though to one giant effort  and his expressions gained in clarity .  it was a last attempt at self justification  at moderating his defeat .    almost got you at the end .  would have turned off defenses and seized you .  would have seen who was master .  but you gave me dummy controls  .  .  .  suspected me all along      and finally he was asleep .   turbor said  in awed tones   how long did you suspect him  darell .     ever since he first came here   was the quiet response .   he came from kleise  he said .  but i knew kleise  and i knew on what terms we parted .  he was a fanatic on the subject of the second foundation and i had deserted him .  my own purposes were reasonable  since i thought it best and safest to pursue my own notions by myself .  but i couldn t tell kleise that  and he wouldn t have listened if i had .  to him  i was a coward and a traitor  perhaps even an agent of the second foundation .  he was an unforgiving man and from that time almost to the day of his death he had no dealings with me .  then  suddenly  in his last few weeks of life  he writes me     as an old friend     to greet his best and most promising pupil as a co worker and begin again the old investigation .    it was out of character .  how could he possibly do such a thing without being under outside influence  and i began to wonder if the only purpose might not be to introduce into my confidence a real agent of the second foundation .  well  it was so      he sighed and closed his own eyes for a moment .   semic put in hesitantly   what will we do with all of them  .  .  .  these second foundation fellas .     i don t know   said darell  sadly .   we could exile them  i suppose .  there s zoranel  for instance .  they can be placed there and the planet saturated with mind static .  the sexes can be separated  or  better still  they can be sterilized     and in fifty years  the second foundation will be a thing of the past .  or perhaps a quiet death for all of them would be kinder .     do you suppose   said turbor   we could learn the use of this sense of theirs .  or are they born with it  like the mule .     i don t know .  i think it is developed through long training  since there are indications from encephalography that the potentialities of it are latent in the human mind .  but what do you want that sense for .  it hasn t helped them .    he frowned .   though he said nothing  his thoughts were shouting .   it had been too easy     too easy .  they had fallen  these invincibles  fallen like book villains  and he didn t like it .   galaxy .  when can a man know he is not a puppet .  how can a man know he is not a puppet .   arcadia was coming home  and his thoughts shuddered away from that which he must face in the end .   she was home for a week  then two  and he could not loose the tight check upon those thoughts .  how could he .  she had changed from child to young woman in her absence  by some strange alchemy .  she was his link to life  his fink to a bittersweet marriage that scarcely outlasted his honeymoon .   and then  late one evening  he said as casually as he could   arcadia  what made you decide that terminus contained both foundations .    they had been to the theater  in the best seats with private trimensional viewers for each  her dress was new for the occasion  and she was happy .   she stared at him for a moment  then tossed it off .   oh  i don t know  father .  it just came to me .    a layer of ice thickened about dr .  darell s heart .    think   he said  intensely .   this is important .  what made you decide both foundations were on terminus .    she frowned slightly .   well  there was lady callia .  i knew she was a second foundationer .  anthor said so  too .     but she was on kalgan   insisted darell .   what made you decide on terminus .    and now arcadia waited for several minutes before she answered .  what had made her decide .  what had made her decide .   she had the horrible sensation of something slipping just beyond her grasp .   she said   she knew about things     lady callia did     and must have had her information from terminus .  doesn t that sound right  father .   but he just shook his head at her .    father   she cried   i knew .  the more i thought  the surer i was .  it just made sense .    there was that lost look in her father s eyes   it s no good  arcadia .  its no good .  intuition is suspicious when concerned with the second foundation .  you see that  don t you .  it might have been intuition     and it might have been control .     control .  you mean they changed me .  oh  no .  no  they couldn t .   she was backing away from him .   but didn t anthor say i was right .  he admitted it .  he admitted everything .  and you ve found the whole bunch right here on trantor .  didn t you .  didn t you .   she was breathing quickly .    i know  but    arcadia  will you let me make an encephalographic analysis of your brain .    she shook her head violently   no  no .  i m too scared .     of me  arcadia .  there s nothing to be afraid of .  but we must know .  you see that  don t you .    she interrupted him only once  after that .  she clutched at his arm just before the last switch was thrown .   what if i am different  father .  what will you have to do .     i won t have to do anything  arcadia .  if you re different  well leave .  well go back to trantor  you and i  and  .  .  .  and we won t care about anything else in the galaxy .    never in darell s life had an analysis proceeded so slowly  cost him so much  and when it was over  arcadia huddled down and dared not look .  then she heard him laugh and that was information enough .  she jumped up and threw herself into his opened arms .   he was babbling wildly as they squeezed one another   the house is under maximum mind static and your brain waves are normal .  we really have trapped them  arcadia  and we can go back to living .     father   she gasped   can we let them give us medals now .     how did you know i   d asked to be left out of it .   he held her at arm s mind  you know everything .  all right  you can have your medal on a platform  with speeches .     and father .     yes .     can you call me arkady from now on .     but    very well  arkady .    slowly the magnitude of the victory was soaking into him and saturating him .  the foundation     the first foundation     now the only foundation     was absolute master of the galaxy .  no further barrier stood between themselves and the second empire     the final fulfillment of seldon s plan .   they had only to reach for it     thanks to             the answer that was true  an unlocated room on an unlocated world .   and a man whose plan had worked .   the first speaker looked up at the student   fifty men and women   he said .   fifty martyrs .  they knew it meant death or permanent imprisonment and they could not even be oriented to prevent weakening     since orientation might have been detected .  yet they did not weaken .  they brought the plan through  because they loved the greater plan .     might they have been fewer .   asked the student  doubtfully .   the first speaker slowly shook his head   it was the lower limit .  less could not possibly have carried conviction .  in fact  pure objectivism would have demanded seventy five to leave margin for error .  never mind .  have you studied the course of action as worked out by the speakers  council fifteen years ago .     yes  speaker .     and compared it with actual developments .     yes  speaker .   then  after a pause      i was quite amazed  speaker .     i know .  there is always amazement .  if you knew how many men labored for how many months     years  in fact     to bring about the polish of perfection  you would be less amazed .  now tell me what happened     in words .  i want your translation of the mathematics .     yes  speaker .   the young man marshaled his thoughts .   essentially  it was necessary for the men of the first foundation to be thoroughly convinced that they had located and destroyed the second foundation .  in that way  there would be reversion to the intended original .  to all intents  terminus would once again know nothing about us  include us in none of their calculations .  we are hidden once more  and safe     at the cost of fifty men .     and the purpose of the kalganian war .     to show the foundation that they could beat a physical enemy     to wipe out the damage done to their self esteem and self assuredness by the mule .     there you are insufficient in your analysis .  remember  the population of terminus regarded us with distinct ambivalence .  they hated and envied our supposed superiority  yet they relied on us implicitly for protection .  if we had been  destroyed  before the kalganian war  it would have meant panic throughout the foundation .  they would then never have had the courage to stand up against stettin  when he then attacked  and he would have .  only in the full flush of victory could the  destruction  have taken place with minimum ill effects .  even waiting a year  thereafter  might have meant a too great cooling off spirit for success .    the student nodded .   i see .  then the course of history will proceed without deviation in the direction indicated by the plan .     unless   pointed out the first speaker   further accidents  unforeseen and individual  occur .     and for that   said the student   we still exist .  except    except    one facet of the present state of affairs worries me  speaker .  the first foundation is left with the mind static device     a powerful weapon against us .  that  at least  is not as it was before .     a good point .  but they have no one to use it against .  it has become a sterile device  just as without the spur of our own menace against them  encephalographic analysis will become a sterile science .  other varieties of knowledge will once again bring more important and immediate returns .  so this first generation of mental scientists among the first foundation will also be the last     and  in a century  mind static will be a nearly forgotten item of the past .     well     the student was calculating mentally .   i suppose you re right .    but what i want you most to realize  young man  for the sake of your future in the council is the consideration given to the tiny intermeshings that were forced into our plan of the last decade and a half simply because we dealt with individuals .  there was the manner in which anthor had to create suspicion against himself in such a way that it would mature at the right time  but that was relatively simple .    there was the manner in which the atmosphere was so manipulated that to no one on terminus would it occur  prematurely  that terminus itself might be the center they were seeking .  that knowledge had to be supplied to the young girl  arcadia  who would be heeded by no one but her own father .  she had to be sent to trantor  thereafter  to make certain that there would be no premature contact with her father .  those two were the two poles of a hyperatomic motor  each being inactive without the other .  and the switch had to be thrown     contact had to be made     at just the right moment .  i saw to that .    and the final battle had to be handled properly .  the foundation s fleet had to be soaked in self confidence  while the fleet of kalgan made ready to run .  i saw to that  also .    said the student   it seems to me  speaker  that you  .  .  .  i mean  all of us  .  .  .  were counting on dr .  darell not suspecting that arcadia was our tool .  according to my check on the calculations  there was something like a thirty percent probability that he would so suspect .  what would have happened then .     we had taken care of that .  what have you been taught about tamper plateaus .  what are they .  certainly not evidence of the introduction of an emotional bias .  that can be done without any chance of possible detection by the most refined conceivable encephalographic analysis .  a consequence of leffert s theorem  you know .  it is the removal  the cutting out  of previous emotional bias  that shows .  it must show .    and  of course  anthor made certain that darell knew all about tamper plateaus .    however    when can an individual be placed under control without showing it .  where there is no previous emotional bias to remove .  in other words  when the individual is a new born infant with a blank slate of a mind .  arcadia darell was such an infant here on trantor fifteen years ago  when the first line was drawn into the structure of the plan .  she will never know that she has been controlled  and will be all the better for it  since her control involved the development of a precocious and intelligent personality .    the first speaker laughed shortly   in a sense  it is the irony of it all that is most amazing .  for four hundred years  so many men have been blinded by seldon s words  the other end of the galaxy .   they have brought their own peculiar  physical science thought to the problem  measuring off the other end with protractors and rulers  ending up eventually either at a point in the periphery one hundred eighty degrees around the rim of the galaxy  or back at the original point .    yet our very greatest danger lay in the fact that there was a possible solution based on physical modes of thought .  the galaxy  you know  is not simply a flat ovoid of any sort  nor is the periphery a closed curve .  actually  it is a double spiral  with at least eighty percent of the inhabited planets on the main arm .  terminus is the extreme outer end of the spiral arm  and we are at the other     since  what is the opposite end of a spiral .  why  the center .    but that is trifling .  it is an accidental and irrelevant solution .  the solution could have been reached immediately  if the questioners had but remembered that hari seldon was a social scientist not a physical scientist and adjusted their thought processes accordingly .  what could  opposite ends    mean to a social scientist .  opposite ends on the map .  of course not .  that s the mechanical interpretation only .    the first foundation was at the periphery  where the original empire was weakest  where its civilizing influence was least  where its wealth and culture were most nearly absent .  and where is the social opposite end of the galaxy .  why  at the place where the original empire was strongest  where its civilizing influence was most  where its wealth and culture were most strongly present .    here .  at the center .  at trantor  capital of the empire of seldon s time .    and it is so inevitable .  hari seldon left the second foundation behind him to maintain  improve  and extend his work that has been known  or guessed at  for fifty years .  but where could that best be done .  at trantor  where seldon s group had worked  and where the data of decades had been accumulated .  and it was the purpose of the second foundation to protect the plan against enemies .  that  too  was known .  and where was the source of greatest danger to terminus and the plan .    here .  here at trantor  where the empire dying though it was  could  for three centuries  still destroy the foundation  if it could only have decided to do so .    then when trantor fell and was sacked and utterly destroyed  a short century ago  we were naturally able to protect our headquarters  and  on all the planet  the imperial library and the grounds about it remained untouched .  this was well known to the galaxy  but even that apparently overwhelming hint passed them by .    it was here at trantor that ebling mis discovered us  and here that we saw to it that he did not survive the discovery .  to do so  it was necessary to arrange to have a normal foundation girl defeat the tremendous mutant powers of the mule .  surely  such a phenomenon might have attracted suspicion to the planet on which it happened    it was here that we first studied the mule and planned his ultimate defeat .  it was here that arcadia was born and the train of events begun that led to the great return to the seldon plan .    and all those flaws in our secrecy  those gaping holes  remained unnoticed because seldon had spoken of  the other end    in his way  and they had interpreted it in their way .    the first speaker had long since stopped speaking to the student .  it was an exposition to himself  really  as he stood before the window  looking up at the incredible blaze of the firmament  at the huge galaxy that was now safe forever .    hari seldon called trantor   star s end      he whispered   and why not that bit of poetic imagery .  all the universe was once guided from this rock  all the apron strings of the stars led here .   all roads lead to trantor   says the old proverb   and that is where all stars end .     ten months earlier  the first speaker had viewed those same crowding stars     nowhere as crowded as at the center of that huge cluster of matter man calls the galaxy     with misgivings  but now there was a somber satisfaction on the round and ruddy face of preem palver     first speaker .
