    index to characters                 tales from dickens             charles dickens  charles john huffham dickens  the master story teller  was born in landport  england  february         .  his father was a clerk in one of the offices of the navy  and he was one of eight children .   when he was four years old  his father moved to the town of chatham  near the old city of rochester .  round about are chalk hills  green lanes  forests and marshes  and amid such scenes the little charles s genius first began to show itself .   he did not like the rougher sports of his school fellows and preferred to amuse himself in his own way  or to wander about with his older sister  fanny  whom he especially loved .  they loved to watch the stars together  and there was one particular star which they used to pretend was their own .  people called him a  very queer small boy  because he was always thinking or reading instead of playing .  the children of the neighborhood would gather around him to listen while he told them stories or sang comic songs to them  and when he was only eight years old he taught them to act in plays which he invented .  he was fond of reading books of travel  and most of all he loved the arabian nights and robinson crusoe .   he had a great affection for chatham and rochester  and after he began to write stories that were printed  he often used to put these places into them .  it was at chatham that poor little david in the story  david copperfield  lay down to sleep when he was running away from london to find his aunt  miss betsy trotwood .  it was to rochester that mr .  pickwick in pickwick papers  rode with jingle .  rochester was really the  cloisterham  where the wicked choir master  john jasper  killed his nephew  in the mystery of edwin drood .  and it was in those very marshes near by  that magwitch  the escaped convict in great expectations  so frightened little pip .  it is easy to see that the young charles dickens noted carefully and remembered everything he saw  and this habit was of great use to him all his life .   these happy years were not to last long .  when he was nine years old  his father became poor and the family was obliged to move to london  where it lived in a shabby house in a poor suburb .  before another year had passed  his father was put into prison for debt  the same prison in which little dorrit  in the story of that name  grew up .  a very bitter period followed for the solitary ten year old boy  a time in which  he long afterward wrote   but for the mercy of god  he might easily have become  for any care that was taken of him  a little robber or a little vagabond .   the earlier history of david in david copperfield is really and truly a history of the real charles dickens in london .  he was left to the city streets  or to earn a hard and scanty living in a dirty warehouse  by pasting labels on pots of blacking .  all of this wretched experience he has written in david copperfield  and the sad scenes of the debtors  prison he has put into pickwick papers and into little dorrit .  even mrs .  pipchin  of whom he told in dombey and son  and mr .  micawber in david copperfield  were real people whom he knew in these years of poverty and despair .  dickens s life at this time was so miserable that always afterward he dreaded to speak of it  and never could bear even to walk in the street where the blacking warehouse of his boyhood had stood .   better days  however  came at last .  he was able to begin school again  and though the head master was ignorant and brutal  just such a one as mr .  creakle in david copperfield  yet dickens profited by such teaching as he received .   after two or three years of school  he found employment as clerk in a lawyer s office .  this did not content him and he made up his mind to learn to write shorthand so as to become a reporter  in the houses of parliament  for a newspaper .  this was by no means an easy task .  but dickens had great strength of will and a determination to do well whatever he did at all  and he succeeded  just as david copperfield did in the story .   and like the latter  too  about this time dickens fell in love .  he did not marry on this occasion  as did david  but how much he was in love one may see by the story of david s dora .   the theater had always a great attraction for dickens .  throughout his life he loved to act in plays got up and often written  too  by himself and his friends .  some of his early experiences of this kind he has told in the adventures of nicholas nickleby at mr .  crummles s theater .  but his acting was for his own amusement  and it is doubtful if he ever thought seriously of adopting the stage as a profession .  if he did  his success as a reporter soon determined him otherwise .   when he was twenty one he saw his first printed sketch in a monthly magazine .  he had dropped it into a letter box with mingled hope and fear  and read it now through tears of joy and pride .  he followed this with others as successful  signed  boz   the child nickname of one of his younger brothers .  this was his beginning .  he was soon on the road to a comfortable fortune  and when at length pickwick papers appeared  dickens s fame was assured .  this was his first long story .  it became  almost at once  the most popular book of its day  perhaps  indeed  the most popular book ever published in england .  soon after the appearance of its first chapters  dickens married miss catherine hogarth  daughter of the editor of one of the london newspapers  who had helped him in his career .   many have tried to explain the marvelous popularity of pickwick papers .  certainly its honest fun  its merriment  its quaintness  good humor and charity appealed to every reader .  more than all  it made people acquainted with a new company of characters  none of whom had ever existed  or could ever exist  and yet whose manners and appearance were pictured so really that they seemed to be actual persons whom one might meet and laugh with anywhere .   with such a success  and the money it brought him  dickens had leisure to begin the wonderful series of stories which endeared him to the whole english speaking world  and made him the most famous author of his day .  oliver twist came first  and it was followed by nicholas nickleby and the old curiosity shop .   in the first two of these stories one may see most clearly the principle that underlay almost all of dickens s work .  he was never content merely to tell an interesting story .  he wrote with a purpose .  in oliver twist that purpose was  first  to better the poorhouse system  and second  to show that even in the lowest and wickedest paths of life  the life wherein lived fagin with his pupils in crime and bill sikes the brutal burglar  there could yet be found  as in the case of poor nancy  real kindness and sacrifice .  in nicholas nickleby the purpose was to show what terrible wrongs were done to children in country schools  numbers of which at that time were managed by men almost as cruel and inhuman as was squeers in the story .  it is good to learn that  as a result of this novel  an end was made of many such boys  schools .  true artist as he was  dickens seldom wrote without having in his mind the thought of showing some defect in the law  or some wrong condition of affairs which might be righted .  no one could read pickwick papers or little dorrit without realizing how much wrong and misery was caused by the law which made it possible to throw a man into prison for debt .  nor can one read bleak house without seeing that the legal system which robbed quaint miss flite of her mind and kept poor richard carstone from his fortune till the fortune itself had disappeared  was a very wrong legal system indeed .  often  too  dickens s stories are  in a sense  sermons against very human sins .  in the old curiosity shop it is the sin of gambling which brings about the death of little nell .  in great expectations it is the sin of pride which pip has to fight .  in martin chuzzlewit the evil and folly of selfishness is what dickens had in mind .   with his increasing wealth  dickens had  of course  changed his manner of life .  he lived part of the time in the country near london  in brighton  in dover  and in france and italy .  he liked best  however  a little english watering place called broadstairs  a tiny fishing village  built on a cliff  with the sea rolling and dashing beneath it .  in such a place he felt that he could write best  but he greatly missed his london friends .  he used to say that being without them was  like losing his arms and legs .    the first great grief of his life came to him at this time  in the death of his wife s sister  mary hogarth  a gentle  lovable girl of seventeen .  no sorrow ever touched him as this did .   after she died   he wrote years afterward   i dreamed of her every night for many weeks  and always with a kind of quiet happiness  so that i never lay down at night without a hope of the vision coming back .   hers was the character he drew in little nell in the old curiosity shop .  when he came to the part of the story which tells of little nell s death  he could scarcely write the chapter .  when he ended it he said   it seems as though dear mary died but yesterday .    when he was less than thirty  dickens was invited to visit scotland  and there he received his first great national tribute .  a public banquet was given him in edinburgh  and he was much sought after and entertained .  up to this time he had never seen the united states  he decided now to visit this country and meet his american readers face to face .   he landed at boston accompanied by his wife  in       and visited many of the greater cities of the eastern states .  everywhere he was counted the guest of the nation  and the four months of his stay were one continual welcome .  unfortunately  however  dickens had taken a dislike to american ways  and this dislike appeared in many things he wrote after his return to england .  the pictures he drew of american life in martin chuzzlewit were both unjust and untrue  and made him for a time lose a large part of the good opinion which american readers had had for him .  dickens soon came to regret the writing of these chapters  and when  twenty five years later  he visited the united states a second time  he did all in his power to show his kindly feeling  and america admired and loved him so much that it gradually forgot the incident in the great pleasure with which it read his stories .   dickens was a very active man  and his life was simple and full of work and exercise .  he rose early and almost every day might have been seen tramping for miles along the country roads  or riding horseback with his dogs racing after him .  he liked best to wander along the cliffs or across the downs by the sea .  when he was in london he often walked the streets half the night  thinking out his stories  or searching for the odd characters which he put in them .  this natural activity and restlessness even led him sometimes to make political speeches  and finally to the establishment of a new london newspaper  the daily news  of which he was the first editor .  before this  he had started a weekly journal  in which several of his stories had appeared  but it had not been very successful .  it was not long before he withdrew also from this second venture .   in the meantime he had met with both joy and sorrow .  several children had been born to him .  his much loved sister  his father  and his own little daughter  the youngest of his family  had died .  these sorrows made him throw himself into his work with greater earnestness .  he even found leisure to organize a theatrical company  in which he himself acted with a number of other famous writers of the time   which gave several plays for the benefit of charity .  one of these was performed before queen victoria .   people have often wondered how dickens found time to accomplish so many different things .  one of the secrets of this  no doubt  was his love of order .  he was the most systematic of men .  everything he did  went like clockwork   and he prided himself on his punctuality .  he could not work in a room unless everything in it was in its proper place .  as a consequence of this habit of regularity  he never wasted time .   the work of editorship was very pleasant to dickens  and scarcely three years after his leaving the daily news he began the publication of a new magazine which he called household words .  his aim was to make it cheerful  useful and at the same time cheap  so that the poor could afford to buy it as well as the rich .  his own story  hard times  first appeared in this  with the earliest work of more than one writer who later became celebrated .  dickens loved to encourage young writers  and would just as quickly accept a good story or poem from an unknown author as from the most famous .   it was while engaged in this work that dickens wrote the best one of all his tales  david copperfield  the one which is in so large a part the history of his own early life .   this book brought dickens to the height of his career .  he was now both famous and rich .  he bought a house on gad s hill  a place near chatham  where he had spent the happiest part of his childhood  and settled down to a life of comfort and labor .  when he was a little boy his father had pointed out this fine house to him  and told him he might even come to live there some day  if he were very persevering and worked hard .  and so  indeed  it had proved .   perhaps it is in connection with this house on gad s hill that the world oftenest remembers dickens now .  everyone  old and young throughout the neighborhood  liked him .  children  dogs and horses were his friends .  his hand was open for charity  and he was always the champion of the poor  the helpless and the outcast .  everyone  he thought  had some good in him  and in all he met he was on the lookout to find it .  the great purpose underneath all his writings was after all to teach that every man and woman  however degraded  has his or her better side .  so earnest was he in this that he was not pleased at all when a person praised one of his stories  unless the other showed that he had grasped the lesson that lay beneath it .  the text of dickens s whole life and work is best expressed in his own words   i hope to do some solid good  and i mean to be as cheery and pleasant as i can .   the wrongs and sufferings of the young especially appealed to him  and perhaps the most beautiful speech he ever made was one asking for money for the support of the london hospital for sick children .  he spoke often in behalf of workingmen  and once he spoke for the benefit of a company of poor actors  when  unknown to him  a little child of his own was lying dead at home .   with such a tender heart for all the world  he was more than an affectionate father to his own children  and gave much thought to their happiness and education .  in order that they should properly learn of their own country  he went to the labor of preparing a child s history of england for them  and at another time he wrote out the story of the gospels  to help them in their study of the new testament .  as the years went by  his letters to his oldest son told of his own work and plans .  when his youngest son sailed away to live in australia  he wrote   poor plorn is gone .  it was a hard parting at the last .  he seemed to me to become once more my youngest and favorite child as the day drew near  and i did not think i could have been so shaken .    when he moved to gad s hill it seemed as though dickens had gained almost all of the things men strive most for .  but he was not to be happy there  nor  perhaps  was he ever again to be really happy anywhere .  he and his wife were very different in all their tastes and habits  and had never loved each other as well as people should when they marry .  perhaps  after all  it would have been better if in his youth he had married his dora  the one whom he had pictured in the love story of david copperfield and his child wife .  but  however this may be  dickens and his wife had not lived happily together  and now decided to part  and from that time  though they wrote to each other  he never saw her again .  it is sad to reflect that he who has painted so beautifully for others the joys and sorrows of perfect love and home  was himself destined to know neither .   the years that followed this separation were years of constant labor for dickens .  his restlessness  perhaps also his lack of happiness  drove him to work without rest .  he wrote to a friend   i am quite confident i should rust  break and die if i spared myself .  much better to die doing .   the idea of giving public readings from his stories suggested itself to him  and he was soon engaged in preparation .   i must do something   he wrote   or i shall wear my heart away .   that heart his physician had declared out of order  and this effort was destined to wear it away in quite another sense  though for some time dickens felt no ill effects .   he gave readings  not only in england  but also in scotland and ireland  and everywhere he met with enormous success .  the first series was hardly over  when he was at work on a new story  and this was scarcely completed when he was planning more readings .  the strain of several seasons of such work told on his health .  a serious illness followed  and afterward he was troubled with an increasing lameness  the first real warning of the end .   in spite of his weakness  he decided on another trip to america  and here  in       he began a series of readings which left him in a far worse condition .  often at the close of an evening he would become so faint that he would have to lie down .  he was unable to sleep and his appetite entirely failed him .  yet his wonderful determination and energy made him able to complete the task .  a great banquet of farewell was given to him in new york and he returned to england bearing the admiration and love of the whole american people .   before leaving england he had promised to give one other course of readings there  and this promise  after a summer s quiet at home  he attempted to fulfil .  but he was too ill .  he found himself for the first time in his life feeling  as he said   giddy  jarred  shaken  faint  uncertain of voice and sight  and tread and touch  and dull of spirit .   he was obliged to discontinue the course and to rest .   this summer of       the last summer of his life  was a contented and even a happy one .  at home  at first in london  and later in the house on gad s hill  surrounded by his children and by the friends he loved best  dickens lived quietly  working at his last story which his death was to leave for ever unfinished  the mystery of edwin drood .  he attempted one more series of readings  and with their close bade farewell for ever to his english audience .   he was seen in public but a few times more  once at the last dinner party he ever attended  to meet the prince of wales and the king of the belgians  and once when the queen invited him to buckingham palace .  soon after  the end came .   one day as he entered the house at gad s hill  he seemed tired and silent .  as he sat down to dinner all present noticed that he looked very ill .  they begged him to lie down .   yes  on the ground   he said  these were the last words he ever uttered  and as he spoke he slipped down upon the floor .   he never fully recovered consciousness  and next day  june          charles dickens breathed his last .  five days later he was laid to rest in westminster abbey  where are buried so many of the greatest of england s dead .  for days  thousands came to visit the spot  and rich and poor alike looked upon his grave with tears .   hallie erminie rives .                the old curiosity shop  published       scene  london and neighboring towns  time        characters   little nell  an orphan girl  mr .  trent her aged grandfather proprietor of  the old curiosity shop    the stranger  mr .  trent s brother  christopher nubbles little nell s friend and protector known as  kit   quilp a dwarf  mrs .  quilp his wife  mrs .  jarley proprietress of  jarley s waxwork   brass a dishonest lawyer  sally brass his sister  dick swiveller brass s clerk             the old curiosity shop  i  little nell  in a narrow side street in london there once stood a shabby building called the old curiosity shop  because all sorts of curious things were kept for sale there  such as rusty swords  china figures  quaint carvings and old fashioned furniture .   a little old man named trent owned the shop  and he looked as old as anything in it .  he was thin and bent  with long gray hair and bright blue eyes  and his face was wrinkled and full of care .  he had an orphan grandchild who lived with him  a pretty little golden haired girl whom every one called little nell  who kept the shop clean and neat and cooked the meals just as a grown woman would have done .  she slept in a back room in a bed so small it might almost have been a fairy s .  she lived a very lonely life  but she kept a cheerful face and did not complain .   she had only one protector besides her grandfather  and that was a big  awkward boy named christopher nubbles  called kit for short .  he had a very large mouth and a turned up nose  and when he spoke he had a habit of standing sidewise and twisting his head back over his shoulder .  everything he did seemed funny  and little nell laughed at him all the while  though she loved him almost as much as she did her grandfather .  he ran errands for them  and in the long winter evenings she used to teach him to read and write .   kit liked to be taught and even liked to be laughed at  and always ended by laughing himself  with his mouth wide open and his eyes shut .  he was the best natured lad in the world  and would have given his life to make little nell happy .   she was not as happy as she seemed to her grandfather s eyes .  there was some mystery about the old man that she could not understand .  almost every night he left her to go to bed all alone in the shop  and went away and did not come back till sunrise  when the door bell woke her and she let him in .   and  too  he always talked of the great fortune she was to have sometime  if only some mysterious plan he was working on turned out right  the carriages and fine frocks and jewels .  but the plan seemed always to go wrong  and the poor old man grew sadder and sadder as he grew more feeble .   often at night little nell sat at the upper window  watching for him  crying  and fearing that he might die or lose his mind  she never knew that kit used to stand in the shadow of an archway opposite and watch to see that no harm came to her  till she vanished and he knew she had gone to bed .   what troubled little nell most of all was a strange visitor her grandfather used to have .  this was a hideous man named quilp  with the body of a dwarf and the head of a giant .  his black eyes were sharp and cunning  his face was always covered with a stubby beard and he had a cruel smile that made him look like a panting dog .  he had grizzled  tangled hair  crooked finger nails  and wore a dirty handkerchief tied around his neck  instead of a collar .  he used to bring money to her grandfather  and little nell more than once saw him look at her and at the contents of the shop in a gloating way that made her shiver .   indeed  everybody who ever met quilp was afraid of him  and most afraid of all was his wife .  he had a habit of drinking scalding tea and of eating boiled eggs  shell and all  that quite terrified her .  besides  he treated the poor woman cruelly .  sometimes  for instance  when she displeased him  he made her sit bolt upright in a chair all night  without moving or going to bed  while he sat smoking and making faces at her .   little nell often had to carry messages from her grandfather to the dwarf  and came to know that he had somehow fallen into quilp s power .   the fact was that the old man had been borrowing money from the dwarf for a long time  and had spent it on the great plan  which he had thought sure to succeed  and he now owed the other much more than all the shop and everything in it was worth .   quilp had loaned the money because he thought when the wonderful plan succeeded he would make the grandfather give him back very much more than he had loaned him .  but when the old man continually wanted to borrow more money and yet paid none back  the dwarf grew suspicious and tried hard to find out what the great plan was .  to do this he used to question little nell and try to persuade her to tell how her grandfather passed the time .   she would never tell him anything  but one day  when she had brought a message to his house  the dwarf hid in a closet and listened while the child told his wife how her grandfather  every night after quilp had brought him money  went out and did not come home till daybreak  and always sadly then .  you see  little nell was in such trouble that she had to tell somebody about it and ask advice  and the dwarf s wife had always been very kind to her .   when quilp heard the story he guessed the secret  that her grandfather  hoping to win more for little nell  had gambled away all the money .  he was full of rage and sent word that he would loan no more .   the old man was in great grief at this .  his mind had not been strong for a long time  or this foolish and wrong plan would never have misled him  and now  at the thought that he would have no more chance to win the fortune for his grandchild  he fell ill .  the child did her best to comfort him  but he told her that if quilp deserted them they would be no better than beggars .    let us be beggars then  and be happy   said little nell  putting her arms around his neck .   i would rather beg than live as we do now .  if you are sorrowful now  let me know it .  if you are weaker  let me be your nurse .  it breaks my heart to see you so and not to know why .  let us leave this place and sleep in the fields in the country and never think of money again  and i will beg for us both .    neither had heard the dwarf  who had stolen into the shop behind them .  little nell shrieked when she saw him  and her grandfather sent her into her own room .    so that is the way all the money i have loaned you has gone .   sneered quilp .   your precious scheme to make a fortune was the gaming table .    the old man cried out at this  trembling  that he had done it all for little nell  that he had never staked a single penny for himself  or without praying that it might win for her good .  he told how he had begun gambling months before  knowing he must soon die  hoping thus to leave her enough to live on  how  after losing all his own savings  he had borrowed and lost all that  too .  and he begged the dwarf to loan him a little more so that he might tempt luck again .   any one but quilp would have pitied the poor old man  but not he .  he refused  and thinking of a lie which would make the other yet more miserable  he told him as he left that it was kit who had told him where the money was going .   the first kit knew of this was that night when little nell came to tell him her grandfather was very ill  and that he raved continually against kit so that he must never come to the shop again .  kit was stupefied at this  but there was no help for it  so little nell went sorrowfully back alone .   the old curiosity shop belonged to the dwarf now and he at once moved into the parlor .  he took little nell s own bed for himself and she had to sleep on a pallet on the floor up stairs .  she was busy nursing her grandfather  for he was very ill for some time  and she scarcely ever came down because she was so afraid of the dwarf .   quilp was waiting for the old man to die  thinking that then he would have the shop for his own  and meantime he did a hundred disagreeable things  such as filling the house with strong tobacco smoke from a big pipe he used all the time and driving every one away who came to ask how the sick man was .  he even drove off kit when he came below the window to beg little nell to come and bring her grandfather to live at his own mother s house .   the old man would certainly have died if little nell had not nursed him so faithfully  all alone  till he grew better and at length was able to sit up .   but it was a bitter thing to live as they did  and one day little nell begged her grandfather to come away with her  to wander anywhere in the world  only so it was under god s sky and away from every one that pursued them  and he agreed .   so that night they dressed and stole down stairs very quietly in order not to waken the dwarf who was snoring frightfully in the back room  and went through the shop to the front door .  the bolts were rusty and creaked loudly  and  worst of all  they found the key was not in the lock .  little nell had to take off her shoes and creep into the back room to get it out of the dwarf s pocket .   she was terribly frightened at the sight of quilp  for he was having a bad dream  and was hanging so far out of bed that he was almost standing on his head  his ugly mouth was wide open  and his breath came in a sort of growl .  but she found the key at last  and they unlocked the door and came safely into the dark street .   the old man did not know where to go  but little nell took his hand and led him gently away .   ii  the wanderers  it was a bright june morning .  they walked through many city streets  then through more scattered suburbs  and at last came to the open country .  that night they slept at a cottage where the people were kind to them  and all the next day they walked on and on .   at sunset they stopped to rest in a churchyard  where two men were sitting patching a punch and judy show booth  while the figures of punch  the doctor  the executioner and the devil were lying on the grass waiting to be mended .   the men were mending the dolls very badly  so little nell took a needle and sewed them all neatly .  they were delighted at this  and took the pair to the inn where they were to show the punch and judy  and there they found them a place to sleep in an empty loft .   the next day the wanderers went on with the showmen .  whenever they came to a village  the booth was pitched and the show took place  and they never left a town without a pack of ragged children at their heels .  the punch and judy show grew tiresome  but the company seemed better than none .  little nell was weary with walking  but she tried to hide it from her grandfather .   the inn at which they lodged the next night was full of showmen with trained dogs  conjurers and others  hurrying to a town where there was to be a fair with horse races  to which the punch and judy partners were bound  and little nell began to distrust their company .   to tell the truth  the others believed the child and the old man were running away from their friends  and that a reward might be obtained for giving them up .  the way in which the men watched them frightened little nell  and when they reached the scene of the fair she had determined to escape .   it was the second day of the races before a chance came  and then  while the showmen s backs were turned  they slipped away in the crowd to the open fields again .   these alarms and the exposure had begun to affect the old man .  he seemed to understand that he was not wholly in his right mind .  he was full of the fear that he would be taken from her and chained in a dungeon  and little nell had great trouble in cheering him .   at evening when they were both worn out  they came to a village where stood a cottage with the sign school in big letters in its window .  the pale old schoolmaster sat smoking in the garden .  he was a sad  solitary man  and loved little nell when he first saw her  because she was like a favorite pupil he once had .  he made them sleep in the school room that night  and he begged them to stay longer next day  but little nell was anxious to get as far as possible from london and from the dwarf  who she was all the time in fear might find them .  so they bade the schoolmaster good by and walked on .   another day s journey left them so exhausted they could scarcely keep moving .  they had almost reached another village when they came to a tiny painted house on wheels with horses to draw it .  at its door sat a stout lady wearing a large bonnet  taking tea with a big drum for a table .   the lady  as it happened  had seen them at the fair  and had wondered then to see them in company with a punch and judy show .  noticing how tired they were  she gave them tea and then took them into the wagon with her to help them on their way .   the inside of the wagon was like a cozy room .  it had a little bed in one end  and a kitchen in the other  and had two curtained windows .  as the wheels rattled on the old man fell asleep  and the stout lady made little nell sit by her and talk .  in the wagon was a big canvas sign that read                                   jarley s waxwork     one hundred figures     the full size of life     now exhibited within                                i am mrs .  jarley   the woman said   and my waxwork is gone to the next town  where it is to be exhibited .   she thought little nell and her grandfather were in the show business  too  and when she found they were not  that they had no home  and did not even know where they were going  she held up her hands in astonishment .   but it was easy to see that they were not ordinary beggars  and she was kind hearted and wanted to help them .  so  after much thought  she asked little nell if they would take a situation with her .  she explained that the child s duty would be to point out the wax figures to the visitors and tell their names  while her grandfather could help dust them .   they accepted this offer very thankfully  for almost all the money they had brought was now spent   and when the wagon arrived at the place of exhibition and the waxwork had been set up  mrs .  jarley put a long wand in little nell s hand and taught her to point out each figure and describe it    this  ladies and gentlemen   little nell learned to say   is jasper packlemerton  who murdered fourteen wives by tickling the soles of their feet   or   this is queen elizabeth s maid of honor  who died from pricking her finger while sewing on sunday .    she was quick to learn and soon became a great favorite with the visitors .  mrs .  jarley was kind  and but for the fact that her grandfather s mind failed more and more every day little nell would have been quite happy .   one evening the two walked into the country beyond the town and a sudden thunder storm arose .  they took shelter at an inn on the highroad  and while they waited there some rough men began a noisy game of cards behind a screen .   the talk and the chink of the money roused the old man s failing senses .  he imagined himself still gambling to win the old fortune for little nell .  he made her give him the money she had earned from the waxwork  joined the gamblers and in a few hours had lost it all .  his insanity had made him forget the presence of the child he so loved  and when the game was done it was too late to leave the inn that night .   little nell had now only one piece of money left  a gold piece sewed in her dress .  this she had to change into silver and to pay a part for their lodging .  when she was abed she could not sleep for fear of the wicked men she had seen gambling .   when at last she fell asleep she waked suddenly to see a figure in the room .  she was too frightened to scream  and lay very still and trembled .  the robber searched her clothing  took the rest of the money and went out .  she was dreadfully afraid he might return to harm her .  if she could get to her grandfather  she thought  she would be safe .   she opened the door softly  and in the moonlight saw the figure entering the old man s room .  she caught a view of his face and then she knew that the figure was her own grandfather  and that  crazed by the gambling scene  he himself had robbed her .   all that night little nell lay and cried .  she knew  to be sure  that her grandfather was not a thief and that he did not know what he was doing when he stole her money  but she knew  too  that if people found out he was crazy they would take him away from her and shut him up where she could not be with him  and of this she could not bear to think .   the next day  when they had gone back to the waxwork  she was in even greater terror for fear he should rob mrs .  jarley  their benefactress .  so  to lessen the chance of this  each day she gave him every penny she earned .  this  she soon knew  he gambled away  for often he was out all night  and even seemed to shun her  so she was sad and took many long walks alone through the fields .   one evening it happened that she passed a meadow where  beside a hedge  a fire was burning  with three men sitting and lying around it .  she was in the shadow and they did not see her .  one  she saw  was her grandfather  and the others were the gamblers with whom he had played at the inn on the night of the storm .   little nell crept close .  they were tempting the poor daft old man to steal the money from mrs .  jarley s strong box  and while she listened he consented .   she ran home in terrible grief .  she tried to sleep  but could not .  at last she could bear it no longer .  she went to the old man s room and wakened him .    i have had a dreadful dream   she told him   a dream of an old gray haired man like you robbing people of their gold .  i can not stay .  i can not leave you here .  we must go .    to the crazy old man she seemed an angel .  he dressed himself in fear  and with her little basket on her arm she led him out of the house  on  away from the town  into the country  far away from mrs .  jarley  who had been so kind to them  and from the new home they had found .   they climbed a high hill just as the sun was rising  and far behind them little nell caught a last view of the village .  as she looked back and thought how contented they had been there at first  and of the further wandering that lay before them now  poor little nell burst into tears .   but at length she bravely dried her tears lest they sadden her grandfather  and they went on .  when the sun grew warm they fell asleep on the bank of the canal  and when they awoke in the afternoon some rough canal men took them aboard their dirty craft as far as the next town .   the men were well meaning enough and meant the travelers no harm  but after a while they began to drink and quarreled and fought among themselves  and little nell sat all night  wet with the rain  and sang to them to quiet them .   the place to which they finally came was a town of wretched workmen who toiled all day in iron furnaces for little wages  and were almost as miserable and hungry as the wanderers themselves .  no one gave them anything  and they lived for three days with only two penny loaves to eat  for all their money was now gone   and slept at night in the ashes of some poor laborer s hut .   the fourth day they dragged themselves into the country again .  little nell s shoes were worn through to the bare ground  her feet were bleeding  her limbs ached and she was deadly faint .  they begged  but no one would help them .   the child s strength was almost gone  when they met a traveler who was reading in a book as he walked along .  he looked up as they came near .  it was the kind old schoolmaster in whose school they had slept before they met mrs .  jarley in her house on wheels .  when she saw him little nell shrieked and fell unconscious at his feet .   the schoolmaster carried her to an inn near by  where she was put to bed and doctored under his care  for she was very weak .  she told him all the story of their wanderings  and he heard it with astonishment and wonder to find such a great heart and heroism in a child .   he had been appointed schoolmaster  he told her  in another town  to which he was then on his way  and he declared they should go with him and he would care for them .  he hired a farm wagon to carry little nell  and he and the old man walked beside it  and so they came to their new place .   next door to the school house was the church .  a very old woman  nearly a hundred years old  had lived in a tenement near by to keep the keys and open the church for services .  the old woman was now dead  and the schoolmaster went to the clergyman and asked that her place be given to the grandfather  so that he and little nell could live in the house next to his own dwelling .   the child sewed the tattered curtains and mended the worn carpet and the schoolmaster trimmed the long grass and trained the ivy before the door .  in the evening a bright fire was kindled and they all three took their supper together  and then the schoolmaster said a prayer before they went gladly to bed .   they were very happy in this new home .  the old man lost the insane thirst for gaming and the mad look faded from his eyes  but poor little nell grew paler and more fragile every day .  the long days of hunger and nights of exposure had sowed the seeds of illness .   the whole village soon grew to love her .  many came to visit her and the schoolmaster read to her each day  so that she was content even when she could no longer walk abroad as she had always done .   as she lay looking out at the peaceful churchyard  where so many whose lives were over lay sleeping  it seemed to her that the painful past was only an ugly vision .  and at night she often dreamed of the roof opening and a column of bright faces  rising far into the sky  looking down on her asleep .  the quiet spot outside remained the same  save that the air was full of music and a sound of angels  wings .   so the weeks passed into winter  and though she came soon to know that she was not long for earth  she thought of death without regret and of heaven with joy .   iii  the search  it is not to be supposed  of course  that the flight of little nell and her grandfather from the old curiosity shop was not noticed .  all the time  while they were wandering about homeless and wretched  more than one went searching everywhere for them without success .   one of these was quilp  the ugly dwarf .  he had loaned the grandfather more money than the shop would bring  and he made up his mind now that the old man had a secret hoard somewhere  which might be his if he could find it .  he soon learned that if kit knew anything about it he would not tell  so he and his lawyer  a sleek  oily rascal named brass  made many plans for finding them .  but for a long time quilp could get no trace .   another who tried to find them was a curious lodger who roomed in brass s house .  he seemed to have plenty of money but was very eccentric .  nobody knew even his name and so they called him the stranger .   he kept in his room a big box like trunk  in which was a silver stove that he used to cook his meals .  the stove had a lot of little openings .  in one he would put an egg  in another some coffee  in another a piece of meat and in the fourth some water .  then he would light a lamp that stood under it  and in five minutes the egg would be cooked  the coffee boiled and the meat done  all ready to eat .   he was the queerest sort of boarder .  the strangest habit he had was this  he seemed to be very fond of punch and judy shows  and whenever he heard one on the street he would run out without his hat  make the showmen perform in front of the house and then invite them to his rooms  where he would question them for a long time .  this habit used to puzzle both brass and quilp  the dwarf  and they never could guess why he did it .   the truth was  the mysterious stranger was a long missing brother of little nell s grandfather .  a misunderstanding had come between them many years before when both were young men .  the younger had become a traveler in many countries and had never seen his brother since .  but he dreamed often of the days when they had been children and at last he forgot the thing that had driven them apart .  he had come back now to england  a rich man  to find the other had vanished with little nell  his grandchild .  he had soon learned the story of their misfortune and how the fear of quilp had driven them away .  after much inquiry he had discovered they had been seen with a punch and judy show and now he was trying to find the showmen .  and finally  in this way  he did find the very same pair the wanderers had met .   he learned from them all they could tell him  that the child and the old man had disappeared at the fair  and that since then  so they had heard  a pair resembling them had been seen with the jarley waxwork exhibition .  the stranger easily discovered where mrs .  jarley was  and determined to set out to her at once .  but he remembered that his brother  little nell s grandfather  could not be expected to know him after all the years he had been gone  and as for little nell herself  she had never seen him  and he was afraid if they heard a strange man had come for them they would take fright and run away again .  so he tried to find some one they had loved to go with him to show that he intended only kindness .   he was not long in hearing of kit  who had found a situation as footman  and he gained his employer s leave to take the lad with him .  when kit learned that the stranger had discovered where little nell was he was overjoyed  but he knew he himself was not the one to go  because before they disappeared she had told him he must never come to the old curiosity shop again and that her grandfather blamed him as the cause of their misfortune .  but kit promised the stranger that his mother should go in his place  and went to tell her at once .   kit found his mother was at church  but the matter was so urgent that he went straight to the pew and brought her out  which caused even the minister to pause in his sermon and made all the congregation look surprised .  kit took her home  packed her box and bundled her into the coach which the stranger brought  and away they went to find the wanderers .   now quilp had all along suspected that kit and his mother knew something of their whereabouts  and he had made it his business to watch either one or the other .  the dwarf  in fact  was in the church when kit came for his mother  and he followed .  when she left with the stranger he took another coach and pursued  feeling certain he was on the right track .   but they were all too late .  when the stranger found mrs .  jarley next day she could only tell him that little nell and her grandfather had disappeared again  and he had to return with kit s mother  much discouraged  to london .   the part kit had played in this made the dwarf hate him  if possible  more than ever  and he agreed to pay brass  his rascally lawyer  to ruin the lad by making a false charge of theft against him .   one day  when kit came to brass s house to see the stranger  who lodged up stairs  the lawyer cunningly hid a five pound note in the lad s hat and as soon as he left ran after him  seized him in the street and accused him of taking it from his office desk .   kit was arrested  and the note  of course  was found on his person .  the evidence seemed so strong that the poor fellow was quickly tried  found guilty and sentenced to prison for a long time .   all might have gone wrong but for a little maid servant of brass s  whom the lawyer had starved and mistreated for years .  he used to keep her locked in the moldy cellar and gave her so little to eat that she would creep into the office at night  she had found a key that fitted the door  to pick up the bits of bread that dick swiveller  brass s clerk  had left when he ate his luncheon .   one night  while this little drudge was prowling about above stairs  she overheard brass telling his sister  sally  who was his partner and colder and crueler and more wicked even than he was   the trick he was going to play .  after kit was arrested she ran away from brass s house and told her story to kit s employer  who had all along believed in his innocence .   brass in the meantime had gone to quilp to get his reward for this evil deed  but the terrible dwarf now only laughed at him and pretended to remember nothing at all about the bargain .   this so enraged the lawyer that  when he was brought face to face with the little maid s evidence and found that he himself was caught  he made full confession of the part quilp had played  and told the whole story to revenge himself on the dwarf .   officers were sent at once to arrest quilp at a dingy dwelling on a wharf in the river where he often slept with the object of terrifying his wife by his long absences .  here he had set up the battered figurehead of a wrecked ship and  imagining that its face resembled that of kit whom he so fiendishly hated  he used to amuse himself by screwing gimlets into its breast  sticking forks into its eyes and beating it with a poker .   a few minutes before the officers arrived the dwarf received warning from sally brass  but he had no time to get away .  when he heard the knocking on the gates and knew that the law he had so long defied was at last upon him  he fell into a panic and did not know which way to turn .  he tried to cover the light of the fire  but only succeeded in upsetting the stove .  then he ran out of the house on to the dock in the darkness .   it was a black  foggy night  and he could not see a foot before him .  he thought he could climb over the wall to the next wharf and so escape  but in his fright he missed his way and fell over the edge of the platform into the swift flowing river .   he screamed in terror  but the water filled his throat and the knocking on the gates was so loud that no one heard him .  the water swept him close to a ship  but its keel was smooth and slippery and there was nothing to cling to .  he had been so wicked that he was afraid to die and he fought desperately  but the rapid tide smothered his cries and dragged him down  to death .   the waves threw his drowned body finally on the edge of a dismal swamp  in the red glare of the blazing ruin which the overturned stove that night made of the building in which he had framed his evil plots .  and this was the end of quilp  the dwarf .   as for kit  he found himself all at once not only free  but a hero .  his employer came to the jail to tell him that he was free and that everyone knew now of his innocence  and they made him eat and drink  and everybody shook hands with him .  then he was put into a coach and they drove straight home  where his mother was waiting to kiss him and cry over him with joy .   and last  but by no means least of all his new good fortune  he learned then that the stranger who had been searching so long for little nell and her grandfather had found certainly where they were and that kit was to go with him and his employer at once and bring them back again to london .   they started the next day  and on the long road they talked much of little nell and the strange chance by which the lost had been found .  a gentleman who lived in the village to which they were now bound  who had himself been kind to the child and to the old man whom the new schoolmaster had brought with him  had written of the pair to kit s employer  and the letter had been the lost clue  so long sought  to their hiding place .   snow began falling as the daylight wore away  and the coach wheels made no noise .  all night and all the next day  they rode  and it was midnight before they came to the town where the two wanderers had taken refuge .   the village was very still  and the air was frosty and cold .  only a single light was to be seen  coming from a window beside a church .  this was the house which the stranger knew sheltered those they sought  but both he and kit felt a strange fear as they saw that light  the only one in the whole village .   they left the driver to take the horses to the inn and approached the building afoot .  they went quite close and looked through the window .  in the room an old man bent low over a fire crooning to himself  and kit  seeing that it was his old master  opened the door  ran in  knelt by him and caught his hand .   the old grandfather did not recognize kit .  he believed him a spirit  as he thought many spirits had talked to him that day .  he was much changed  and it seemed as if some great blow or grief had crazed him .  he had a dress of little nell s in his hand and smoothed and patted it as he muttered that she had been asleep  asleep a long time now  and was marble cold and would not wake .    her little homely dress .   he said .   and see here  these shoes  how worn they are .  you see where her feet went bare upon the ground .  they told me afterward that the stones had cut and bruised them .  she never told me that .  no  no  god bless her .  and i have remembered since how she walked behind me  that i might not see how lame she was  but yet she had my hand in hers and seemed to lead me still .    so he muttered on  and the cheeks of the others were wet with tears  for they had begun to understand the sad truth .   kit could not speak  but the stranger did   you speak of little nell   he said .   do you remember  long ago  another child  too  who loved you when you were a child yourself .  say that you had a brother  long forgotten  who now at last came back to you to be what you were then to him .  give me but one word  dear brother  to say you know me  and life will still be precious to us again .    the old man shook his head  for grief had killed all memory .  pushing them aside  he went into the next room  calling little nell s name softly as he went .   they followed .  kit sobbed as they entered  for there on her bed little nell lay dead .   dear  gentle  patient  noble nell .  the schoolmaster told them of her last hours .  they had read and talked to her a while  and then she had sunk peacefully to sleep .  they knew by what she said in her dreams that they were of her wanderings  and of the people who had helped them  for often she whispered   god bless you .   and she spoke once of beautiful music that was in the air .   opening her eyes at last  she begged that they would kiss her once again .  that done  she turned to the old man with a lovely smile on her face  such  he said  as he had never seen  and threw both arms about his neck .  they did not know at first that she was dead .   they laid little nell to rest the next day in the churchyard where she had so often sat .  the old man never realized quite what had happened .  he thought she would come back to him some day  and that then they would go away together .  he used to sit beside her grave and watch for her each afternoon .   one day he did not return at the usual hour and they went to look for him .  he was lying dead upon the stone .   they buried him beside the child he had loved  and there in the churchyard where they had often talked together they both lie side by side .   none of those who had known little nell ever forgot her story .  after the death of the old man  his brother  the stranger who had sought them so long  traveled in the footsteps of the two wanderers to search out and reward all who had been kind to them  mrs .  jarley of the waxwork  the punch and judy showmen  he found them all .  even the rough canal boatmen were not forgotten .   kit s story got abroad and he found himself with hosts of friends  who gave him a good position and secured his mother from want .  so that his greatest misfortune turned out  after all  to be his greatest good .   the little maid whose evidence cleared kit of the terrible charge against him lived to marry dick swiveller  the clerk of brass  the lawyer  while meek mrs .  quilp  after her husband s drowning  married a clever young man and lived a pleasant life on the dead dwarf s money .   the fate of the others  whose wickedness has been a part of this story  was not so pleasant .  the two gamblers who tempted the old man to steal mrs .  jarley s strong box were detected in another crime and sent to jail .  brass became a convict  condemned to walk on a treadmill  chained to a long line of other evil men  and dragging wherever he went a heavy iron ball .  after he was released he joined his wicked sister  sally  and the two sank lower and lower till they might even be seen on dark nights on narrow london streets searching in refuse boxes for bits of food  like twin spirits of wickedness and crime .   when kit had grown to be a man and had children of his own  he often took them to the spot where stood what had been the old curiosity shop and told them over and over the story of little nell .  and he always ended by saying that if they were good like her they might go some time where they could see and know her as he had done when he was a boy .              the adventures of oliver twist  published       scene  london and neighboring towns  time       to       characters

 the artful dodger  a youthful pickpocket             oliver twist  i  how oliver came to london and what he found there  oliver twist was the son of a poor lady who was found lying in the street one day in an english village  almost starved and very ill .  she had walked a long way  for her shoes were worn to pieces  but where she came from or where she was going nobody knew .  as she had no money  she was taken to the poorhouse  where she died the next day without even telling her name  leaving behind her only a gold locket  which was around her neck  and a baby .   the locket fell into the hands of the mistress of the poorhouse  who was named mrs .  bumble .  it contained the dead mother s wedding ring  and  as mrs .  bumble was a dishonest woman  she hid both locket and ring  intending sometime to sell them .   the baby was left  with no one to care for it  to grow up at the poorhouse with the other wretched orphan children  who wore calico dresses all alike and had little to eat and many whippings .   mr .  bumble  the master of the poorhouse  was a pompous  self important bully who browbeat every one weaker than himself and scolded and cuffed the paupers to his heart s content .  it was he who named the baby  oliver twist .   he used to name all the babies as they came along  by the letters of the alphabet .  the one before oliver was named swubble  then came oliver with a t  the next would be unwin  the next vilkins  and so on down to z .  then he would begin the alphabet all over again .   little oliver  the baby  grew without any idea of who he was .  when he was a year old he was sent to the poor farm where an old woman took care of orphan children for a very small sum apiece each week .  this money  which was paid by the town  was hardly enough to buy them food  but nevertheless the old woman took good care to save the bigger share for herself .   he lived there till he was a pale  handsome boy of nine years  and then he was taken to the workhouse  where  with many other boys of his own age or older  he had to work hard all day picking oakum .   the boys had nothing but thin gruel for their meals  with an onion twice a week and half a roll on sundays .  they ate in a great stone hall  in one end of which stood the big copper of gruel which mr .  bumble ladled out .  each boy got only one helping  and the bowls never needed washing  because  when the meal was through  there was not a drop of gruel left in them .  after each meal they all sat staring at the copper and sucking their fingers  but nobody dared ask for more .   one day they felt so terribly hungry that one of the biggest boys said unless he got another helping of gruel he was afraid he would have to eat the boy who slept next him .  the little boys all believed this and cast lots to see who should ask for more .  it fell to oliver twist .   so that night after supper  though he was dreadfully frightened  oliver rose and went up to the end of the room and said to mr .  bumble   please  sir  i want some more .    mr .  bumble was so surprised he turned pale .   what .   he gasped .    please  sir   said oliver again   i want some more .    mr .  bumble picked up the ladle and struck oliver on the head with it  then he pounced on him and shook him .  when he was tired shaking him  he dragged him away and shut him up in a dark room  where he stayed a whole week  and was only taken out once a day to be whipped .  then  to make an example of him  a notice was pasted on the gate of the workhouse offering a reward to anybody who would take poor oliver away and do what he liked with him .   the first one who came by was a middle aged chimney sweep  who wanted a boy to climb up the insides of chimneys and clean out the soot .  this was a dangerous thing to do  for sometimes the boys who did it got burned or choked with the smoke  and when oliver found what they were going to do with him and looked at the man s cruel face  he burst out crying  so that a kind hearted magistrate interfered and would not let the chimney sweep have him .   mr .  bumble finally gave him to the village undertaker  and there he had to mind the shop and do all the chores .  he slept under the counter among piles of empty coffins .  the undertaker s wife beat him often  and whenever he was not at work he had to attend funerals  which was by no means amusing  so that he found life no better than it had been at the workhouse .  the undertaker had an apprentice  too  who kicked him whenever he came near .   all this wretchedness oliver bore as well as he could  without complaining .  but one day the cowardly apprentice began to say unkind things of oliver s dead mother  and this he could not stand .  his anger made him stronger even than his tormentor  though the latter was more than a head taller and much older  and he sprang upon him  caught him by the throat and  after shaking him till his teeth rattled  knocked him flat on the floor .   the big bully screamed for help and cried that he was being murdered  so that the undertaker and his wife came running in .  oliver told them what the apprentice had said  but that made no difference .  the undertaker sent for mr .  bumble  and between them they flogged him till he could hardly stand and sent him to bed without anything to eat .   till then oliver had not shed a tear  but now  alone in the dark  he felt so miserable that he cried for a long time .   there was nothing to do  he thought at last  but to run away .  so he tied up his few belongings in a handkerchief and  waiting till the first beam of sunrise  he unbarred the door and ran away as fast as he could  through the town into the country .   he hid behind hedges whenever he saw anybody  for fear the undertaker or mr .  bumble were after him  and before long he found a road that he knew led to london .  oliver had never seen a city  but he thought where there were so many people there would certainly be something for a boy to do to earn his living  so he trudged stoutly on and before nightfall had walked twenty miles .  he begged a crust of bread at a cottage and slept under a hayrick .  the next day and night he was so very hungry and cold that when morning came again he could scarcely walk at all .   he sat down finally at the edge of a village  wondering whether he was going to die  when he saw coming along the queerest looking boy .  he was about oliver s age  with a snub nose  bow legs and little sharp eyes .  his face was very dirty and he wore a man s coat  whose ragged tails came to his heels .   the boy saw oliver s plight and asked him what the matter was  mixing his words with such a lot of strange slang that oliver could hardly understand him .  when oliver explained that he had been walking a number of days and was very hungry  the other took him to a shop near by  bought him some bread and ham  and watched him eat it with great attention  asking him many questions  whether he had any money or knew any place in london where he could stay .  oliver answered no .    don t fret about that   said the other .   i know a  spectable old genelman as lives there wot ll give you lodgings for nothing if i interduce you .    oliver did not think his new host looked very respectable himself  but he thought it might be as well for him to know the old gentleman  particularly as he had nowhere else to go .  so they set off .   it was night when they reached london  and it was so big and crowded that oliver kept close to his guide .  he noticed  however  that the streets they passed through were narrow and dirty and the houses old and hideously filthy .  the people  too  seemed low and wretched .   he was just wondering if he had not better run away when the boy pushed open a door  drew oliver inside  up a broken stairway and into a back room .   here  frying some sausages over a stove  was a shriveled old jew in a greasy flannel gown .  he was very ugly and his matted red hair hung down over his villainous face .  in a corner stood a clothes horse on which hung hundreds of silk handkerchiefs  and four or five boys  as dirty and oddly dressed as the one who had brought oliver  sat about a table smoking pipes like rough  grown men .   oliver s guide introduced him to the jew  whose name was fagin  and the boys crowded around him  putting their hands into his pockets  which he thought a queer joke .  fagin grinned horribly as he shook hands with him and told him he was very welcome  which did not tend to reassure him  and then the sausages were passed around .  the jew gave oliver a glass of something to drink  and as soon as he drank it he became very sleepy and knew nothing more till the following morning .   the next few days oliver saw much to wonder at .  when he woke up  fagin was sorting over a great box full of watches  which he hid away when he saw oliver was looking .  every day the boy who had brought him there  whom they called  the artful dodger   came in and gave the jew some pocketbooks and handkerchiefs .  oliver thought he must have made the pocketbooks  only they did not look new  and some seemed to have money in them .  he noticed  too  that whenever the artful dodger came home empty handed fagin seemed angry and cuffed and kicked him and sent him to bed supperless  but when he brought home a good number everything was very jolly .   whenever there was nothing else to do  the old jew played a very curious game with the boys .  this was the way they played it   fagin would put a snuff box in one pocket  a watch in another and a handkerchief in a third  then he would walk about the room just as any old gentleman would walk about the street  stopping now and then  as if he were looking into shop windows .  all the time the boys followed him closely  sometimes treading on his toes or stumbling against him  and when this happened one of them would slip a hand into his pocket and take out either the watch or the snuff box or the handkerchief .  if the jew felt a hand in his pocket he cried out which it was  and then the game began all over again .  at last fagin made oliver try if he could take something out of his pocket without his knowing it  and when oliver succeeded he patted his head and seemed well pleased .   but oliver grew very tired of the dirty room and the same game .  he longed for the open air and begged to be allowed to go out  so one day the jew put him in charge of the artful dodger and they went upon the streets  oliver wondering where in the world he was going to be taught to make pocketbooks .   he was on the point of asking  when the artful dodger signed to him to be silent  and slunk behind an old gentleman who was reading a book in front of a book stall .  you can imagine oliver s horror when he saw him thrust his hand into the old gentleman s pocket  draw out a silk handkerchief and run off at full speed .   in an instant oliver understood the mystery of the handkerchiefs  the watches  the purses and the curious game he had learned at fagin s .  he knew then that the artful dodger was a pickpocket .  he was so frightened that for a minute he lost his wits and ran off as fast as he could go .   just then the old gentleman found his handkerchief was gone and  seeing oliver running away  shouted  stop thief .   which frightened the poor boy even more and made him run all the faster .  everybody joined the chase  and before he had gone far a burly fellow overtook oliver and knocked him down .   a policeman was at hand and he was dragged  more dead than alive  to the police court  followed by the angry old gentleman .   the moment the latter saw the boy s face  however  he could not believe it was the face of a thief  and refused to appear against him  but the magistrate was in a bad humor and was about to sentence oliver to prison  anyway  when the owner of the book stall came hurrying in .  he had seen the theft and knew oliver was not guilty  so the magistrate was obliged to let him go .   but the terror and the blow he had received had been too much for oliver .  he fell down in a faint  and the old gentleman  whose name was mr .  brownlow  overcome with pity  put him into a coach and drove him to his own home  determined  if the boy had no parents  to adopt him as his own son .   ii  oliver s adventures  while oliver was resting in such good hands  very strange things were occurring in the house of fagin .  when the artful dodger told him of the arrest the jew was full of anger .  he had intended to make a clever thief of oliver and compel him to bring him many stolen things  now he had not only failed in this and lost the boy s help  but he was also afraid that oliver would tell all about the wicked practices he had seen and show the officers where he had lived .  this he thought was likely to happen at any time  unless he could get the boy into his power again .   something had occurred  too  meantime  that made fagin almost crazy with rage at losing him .  it was this  a wicked man  so wicked that he was afraid of thunder  who went by the name of monks  had come to him and told him he would pay a large sum of money if he could succeed in making oliver a thief and so ruin his reputation and his good name .   it was plain enough that for some reason the man hated oliver  but  cunning as fagin was  he would never have guessed why .  for monks was really oliver s older half brother .   a little while before this story began  oliver s father had been obliged to go on a trip to a foreign country  where he died very suddenly .  but before he died he made a will  in which he left all his fortune to be divided between the baby oliver and his mother .  he left only a small sum to his older son  because he knew that he was wicked  and did not deserve any .  the will declared oliver should have the money only on condition that he never stain his name with any act of meanness  dishonor  cowardice or wrong .  if he did do this  then half the money was to go to the older son .  the dying man also wrote a letter to oliver s mother  telling her that he had made the will and that he was dying  but the older son  who was with him when he died  found the letter and destroyed it .   so oliver s poor mother  knowing nothing of all this  when his father did not come back  thought at last that he had deserted her  and in her shame stole away from her home  poor and ill clad  to die finally in the poorhouse .   the older brother  who had taken the name of monks  hunted and hunted for them  because he hated oliver on account of their father s will  and wanted to do him all the harm he could .  he discovered that they had been taken into the poorhouse  and went there  but this was after oliver had run away .  he found  however  to his satisfaction  that the boy knew nothing about his parentage or his real name  and monks made up his mind to prevent his ever learning .   there was only one person who could have told oliver  and that one was mrs .  bumble .  she knew through the locket she had kept  which had belonged to oliver s mother and which contained the dead woman s wedding ring with her name engraved inside it .  when mrs .  bumble heard that a man named monks was searching for news of oliver  she thought it a capital chance to make some money .  she went  therefore  to monks s house and sold the locket and ring to him .  these  monks thought  were the only proofs in the world that could ever show oliver who he was  and to make it impossible for him ever to see them  he dropped them through a trap door in his house down into the river  where they could never be found .   but monks did not give up searching for oliver  and at last  on the very day that oliver was arrested  he saw him coming from fagin s house with the artful dodger .   from his wonderful resemblance to their dead father  he guessed at once that oliver was the half brother whose very name he hated .  knowing the other now to be in london  monks was afraid that by some accident he might yet find out what a fortune had been willed him .  if he could only make oliver dishonest  monks reflected  half their father s fortune would become his own .  with this thought in mind he had gone to fagin and had made him his offer of money to make the boy a thief .   fagin  of course  had agreed  and now  to find his victim was out of his power made the jew grind his teeth with rage .   all these things made fagin determined to gain possession of oliver again  and to do this he got the help of two others  a young woman named nancy and her lover  a brutal robber named bill sikes .  these two discovered that oliver was at mr .  brownlow s house  and lay in wait to kidnap him if he ever came out .   the chance they waited for occurred before many days .  mr .  brownlow sent oliver to take some money to the very book stall in front of which the artful dodger had stolen the handkerchief  and oliver went without dreaming of any danger .   suddenly a young woman in a cap and apron screamed out behind him very loudly   oh  my dear little brother .   and threw her arms tight around him .   oh  my gracious  i ve found him .   she cried .   come home directly  you naughty boy .  for shame  to treat your poor mother so .    oliver struggled  but to no purpose .  nancy  for it was she  told the people that crowded about them that it was her little brother  who had run away from home and nearly broken his mother s heart  and that she wanted to take him back .   oliver insisted that he didn t know her at all and hadn t any sister  but just then bill sikes appeared  as he had planned  and said the young woman was telling the truth and that oliver was a little rascal and a liar .  the people were all convinced at this  and when sikes struck oliver and seized him by the collar they said   serves him right .   and so oliver found himself dragged away from mr .  brownlow to the filthy house where lived fagin .   the wily old jew was overjoyed to see them .  he smiled such a fiendish smile that oliver screamed for help as loud as he could  and at this fagin picked up a great jagged club to beat him with .   now  nancy had been very wicked all her life  but in spite of this there was a little good in her .  she had already begun to repent having helped steal the boy  and now his plight touched her heart .  she seized the club and threw it into the fire  and so saved him the beating for that time .   for many days oliver was kept a prisoner .  he was free to wander about the mildewed old house  but every outer door was locked and every window had closed iron shutters .  all the light came in through small round holes at the top  which made the rooms gloomy and full of shadows .  spiderwebs were over all the walls  and often the mice would go scampering across the floor .  there was only one window to look out of  and that was in a back garret  but it had iron bars and looked out only on to the housetops .   he found only one book to read  this was a history of the lives of great criminals and was full of stories of secret thefts and murders .  for the old jew  having tortured his mind by loneliness and gloom  had left the volume in his way  hoping it would instil into his soul the poison that would blacken it for ever .   but oliver s blood ran cold as he read  and he pushed the book away in horror  and  falling on his knees  prayed that he might be spared from such deeds and rescued from that terrible place .   he was still on his knees when nancy came in and told him he must get ready at once to go on a journey with bill sikes .  she had been crying and her face was bruised as though she had been beaten .  oliver saw she was very sorry for him  and  indeed  she told him she would help him if she could  but that there was no use trying to escape now  because they were watched all the time  and if he got away sikes would certainly kill her .   nancy took him to the house where sikes lived  and the next morning the latter started out  making oliver go with him .  sikes had a loaded pistol in his overcoat pocket  and he showed this to oliver and told him if he spoke to anybody on the road or tried to get away he would shoot him with it .   they walked a long way out of london  once or twice riding in carts which were going in their direction .  whenever this happened sikes kept his hand in the pocket where the pistol was  so that oliver was afraid to appeal for help .  late at night they came to an old deserted mansion in the country  and in the basement of this  where a fire had been kindled  they joined two other men whom oliver had seen more than once in fagin s house in london .   the journey had been cold and long and oliver was very hungry  but he could scarcely eat the supper that was given him for fear of what they intended to do with him in that lonely spot .  he was so tired  however  that he finally went fast asleep and knew nothing more till two o clock in the morning  when sikes woke him roughly and bade him come with them .   it was foggy and cold and dark outside .  sikes and one of the others each took one of oliver s hands  and so they walked a quarter of a mile to where was a fine house with a high wall around it .  they made him climb over the wall with them  and  pulling him along  crept toward the house .   it was not till now that oliver knew what they intended  that they were going to rob the house and make him help them  so that he  too  would be a burglar .  his limbs began to tremble and he sank to his knees  begging them to have mercy and to let him run away and die in the fields rather than to make him steal .  but sikes drew his pistol with a frightful oath and dragged him on .   in the back of the house was a window  which was not fastened  because it was much too small for a man to get through .  but oliver was so little that he could do it easily .  with the pistol in his hand  sikes put oliver through the window  gave him a lantern and bade him go and unlock the front door for them .    illustration   the artful dodger  introducing oliver twist to fagin  see page      oliver had made up his mind that as soon as he got beyond the range of sikes s pistol he would scream and wake everybody in the house  but just then there was a sound from inside  and sikes called to him to come back .   suddenly there was a loud shout from the top of the stairs  a flash  a report  and oliver staggered back with a terrible pain in his arm and with everything swimming before his eyes .   he heard cries and the loud ringing of a bell and felt sikes drag him backward through the window .  he felt himself being carried along rapidly  and then a cold sensation crept over his heart and he knew no more .   iii  how everything turned out right for oliver in the end  after a long  long time oliver came to himself .  the morning was breaking .  he tried to rise and found that his arm was wounded and his clothes wet with blood .   he was so dizzy he could hardly stand  but it was freezing cold  and he knew if he stayed there he must die .  so he staggered on till he came to a road where  a little way off  he saw a house .  there  he thought  he might get help .  but when he came closer he saw that it was the very house the men had tried to rob that night .  fear came over him then  and he would have run away  but he was too weak .   he had just strength left to push open the gate  totter across the lawn and knock at the door  then he sank in a faint on the steps .   in the house lived a lady named mrs .  maylie  just as kind hearted as was mr .  brownlow who had rescued oliver at the police station  and with her lived a beautiful girl whom she had adopted  named rose .  the servants  when they came to the door  made sure oliver was one of the robbers  and sent at once for policemen to take him in charge  but miss rose  the moment she saw what a good face the boy had and how little he looked like a thief  made them put him to bed and send at once for the doctor .   when the good doctor arrived and saw oliver  who was still unconscious  he thought miss rose was right  and when the boy had come to himself and told them how he had suffered  he was certain of it .  they were both sorry the policemen had been sent for  because the doctor was sure they would not believe oliver s story  especially as he had been arrested once before .  he would have taken him away  but he was too sick to be moved .   so when the officers came the doctor told them that the boy had been accidentally shot and had come to the house for assistance  when the servants had mistaken him for one of the burglars .  this was not exactly the truth  but it seemed necessary to deceive the policemen if oliver was to be saved .  of course  the servant that had fired the pistol was not able to swear that he had hit anybody at all  so the officers had to go away without arresting anybody .   after this oliver was ill for a long time  but he was carefully nursed  especially by miss rose  who grew as fond of him as if she had been his sister .  as soon as he grew better she wrote a letter for him to mr .  brownlow  the old gentleman who had rescued him from the police station  but to oliver s grief she found that he had gone to the west indies .   thus the time passed till oliver was quite well  and then miss rose  first carefully instructing the servant who went with them not to lose sight of him for a moment for fear of his old enemies  took him with her for a visit to london .   meantime there had been a dreadful scene in fagin s house when bill sikes got back to london and told the old jew that the robbery had failed and that oliver was lost again .  they were more afraid than ever that they would be caught and sent to prison .  fagin swore at sikes  and monks cursed fagin  and between them all they determined that oliver must either be captured or killed .   while they were plotting afresh nancy  who had been feeling sorrier and sorrier for what she had done  overheard them  and so found out that monks was oliver s half brother and why he so hated him  and she made up her mind to save the boy from his last and greatest danger .   so one evening  when she was alone with him  she gave sikes some laudanum in a glass of liquor  and when he was asleep she slipped away  found miss rose and told her all about it .  bad as nancy was  however  she was not willing to betray fagin or bill sikes  so she only told her of monks .   miss rose was greatly astonished  for she had never heard of him before  but she pitied nancy because she had tried to help oliver  and  of course  she herself wanted very much to help him discover who he was and who his parents had been .  she thanked nancy and begged her to come to see her again .  nancy was afraid to do this  because bill sikes watched her so closely  but she promised that on the next sunday at midnight she would be on a certain bridge where miss rose might see her .  then nancy hurried back before sikes should wake up .   miss rose was in trouble now  for there was no one in london with her then who could help her .  but the same afternoon  whom should oliver see at a distance  walking into his house  but mr .  brownlow .  he came back in great joy to tell miss rose  and she concluded that the old gentleman would be the very one to aid her .  she took oliver to the house  and  sure enough  there was the boy s old benefactor .   very glad  indeed  he was to hear what she told him .  for the old gentleman  when oliver had disappeared with the money he had given him to take to the bookseller  had been reluctant to think the boy he had befriended was  after all  a liar and a thief .  he had advertised for him  but the only result had been a call from mr .  bumble  who told him terrible tales of oliver s wickedness .  to find now  after all this time  that oliver had not run away  and that mr .  bumble s tales were lying ones  was a joyful surprise to mr .  brownlow .   after he had heard the whole  and when oliver had gone into the garden  miss rose told him of nancy s visit and of the man monks who still pursued the boy to do him harm .   it was fortunate that she had come to mr .  brownlow  for  as it happened  he knew a great deal about monks and his evil life .  years before the old gentleman himself had been a friend of oliver s father .  he knew all about his death in a foreign country  and had watched his older son s career of shame with sorrow .  the very trip he had made to the west indies had acquainted him with a crime monks had committed there  from which he had fled to england .  but  while mr .  brownlow knew of the curious will oliver s father had made  what had become of the baby to which the latter referred he had never known .  now  from the story miss rose told him  he was assured that oliver was  indeed  this baby half brother of monks .   but it was one thing to know this and quite another to enable oliver to prove it .  the old gentleman was quick to see that they must get possession of monks and frighten him into confessing the fact  whose only proofs had been lost when he threw the locket and ring into the river .  mr .  brownlow  for this reason  agreed with miss rose that they should both meet nancy on the bridge on the coming sunday to hear all she had been able to find out .   they said not a word of this to oliver  and when sunday night came they drove to the spot where nancy had promised to meet them .  she had kept her word .  she was there before them  and mr .  brownlow heard her story over again from her own lips .   but some one else was there  too  hidden behind a pillar  where he could hear every word she said  and this listener was a spy of fagin s .   nancy had cried so much and acted so strangely that the old jew had grown suspicious and had set some one to watch her .  and who do you suppose this spy was .  no other than the cowardly apprentice who had bullied oliver until he ran away from the undertaker s house .  the apprentice had finally run away  too  had come to london and begun a wicked life .  he was too big a coward to rob any one but little children who had been sent to the shop to buy something  so fagin had given him spying work to do  and in this  being by nature a sneak  he proved very successful .   the spy lay hid till he had heard all nancy said  then he slipped out and ran as fast as his legs would carry him back to fagin .  the latter sent for bill sikes  knowing him to be the most brutal and bloodthirsty ruffian of all  and told him what nancy had done .   the knowledge  as the jew expected  turned sikes into a demon .  he rushed to where nancy lived .  she had returned and was asleep on her couch  but she woke as he entered  and saw by his face that he meant to murder her .  through all her evil career nancy had been true to sikes and would not have betrayed him .  but he would not listen now  though she pleaded with him pitifully to come with her to some foreign country  as miss rose had begged her to do   where they might both lead better lives .  fury had made him mad .  as she clung to his knees  he seized a heavy club and struck her down .   so poor nancy died  with only time for a feeble prayer to god for mercy .   of all bad deeds that sikes had ever done  that was the worst .  the sun shone through the window and lit the room where nancy lay .  he tried to shut it out  but he could not .  he grew suddenly afraid .  horror came upon him .  he crept out of the room  locked the door behind him  and plunged into the crowded street .   he walked for miles and miles  here and there  without purpose .  whichever way he went he could not rid himself of that horror .  when night came he crawled into a disused shed  but he could not sleep .  whenever he closed his eyes he seemed to see nancy s eyes looking at him .  he got up and wandered on again  desperately lonely for some one to talk to .   he heard a man telling another about the murder as he read the account in a newspaper  and knew that he must hide .  he hastened then to a den he knew in a house beside the river  dirty and dismal and the haunt of thieves .  some of his old companions were there  but even they shrank from him .   he had been seen to enter the place  however  and in a few minutes the street was full of people  all yelling for his capture .  he barred the doors and windows  but they began to break down the shutters with sledge hammers .   he ran to the roof with a rope  thinking to let himself down on the side next the river and so escape .  here he fastened one end of the rope to the chimney  and  making a loop in the other end  put it over his head .   just at that instant he imagined he saw nancy s eyes again looking at him .  he staggered back in terror  missed his footing  and fell over the edge of the roof .  he had not had time to draw the noose down under his arms  so that it slipped up around his neck  and there he hung  dead  with a broken neck .   meanwhile mr .  brownlow had acted very quickly  so that monks had got no warning .  he had had men watching for the latter and now  having found out all he wanted to know  he had him seized in the street  put into a coach and driven to his office  where he brought him face to face with oliver .   the old gentleman told monks he could do one of two things  either he could confess before witnesses the whole infamous plot he had framed against oliver  and so restore to him his rights and name  or else he could refuse  in which case he would at once be arrested and sent to prison .  seeing that mr .  brownlow knew all about the part he had played  monks  to save himself  made a full confession  how he had planned to keep his half brother from his inheritance .  and he also confessed what no one there had guessed  that miss rose  who had been adopted in her infancy  was really the sister of oliver s dead mother  his aunt  indeed .  this was the happiest of all oliver s surprises that day  for he had learned to love miss rose very dearly .   monks thus bought his own freedom  and cheap enough he probably thought it  for before he had finished his story  word came that fagin the jew had been captured by the police and was to be tried without delay for his life .   oliver no longer had anything to fear  and came into possession of his true name and his fortune .  mr .  brownlow adopted him as his own son  and moved to the village where oliver had been cared for in the family of miss rose  and where they all lived happily ever afterward .   the company of thieves was broken up with fagin s arrest .  fagin himself was found guilty  and died on the gallows shrieking with fear .  monks sailed for america  where he was soon detected in crime and died in prison .   the wicked apprentice  who had been the real cause of poor nancy s murder  was so frightened at the fate of fagin that he reformed and became a spy for the police  and by his aid the artful dodger  who continued to pick pockets  soon found himself in jail .   as for mr .  and mrs .  bumble  they  of course  lost their positions  and sank from bad to worse till they finally became paupers and were sent to the very same poorhouse where they had tortured little oliver twist .              barnaby rudge  published       scene  london and the country  time       to

every one believed the gardener had murdered both  and the police searched for him a long time  but he was never found .   on the same day this cruel murder was discovered  a baby was born to mrs .  rudge  the wife of the steward  a pretty boy  though with a birth mark on the wrist as red as blood  and a strange look of terror on the baby face .  he was named barnaby  and his mother loved him all the more because it was soon seen he was weak minded  and could never be in his right senses .  she herself  poor woman .  seemed never able to forget the horror of that day .   geoffrey haredale  the brother and heir of the murdered man  took up his abode at the warren and adopted the little emma  his niece  as his own daughter .  he was kind to mrs .  rudge also .  not only did he let her live rent free in a house he owned  but he did many a kind deed secretly for her half witted son as he grew older .   barnaby rudge grew up a strange  weird creature .  his hair was long and red and hung in disorder about his shoulders .  his skin was pale  his eyes bright and his clothes he trimmed most curiously with bits of gaudy lace and bright ribbons and glass toys .  he wore a cluster of broken peacock feathers in his hat and girded at his side was the broken hilt of an old sword without a blade .  but strangest of all was a little wicker basket he always carried on his back .  when he set this down and opened it  there hopped out a tame raven who would cock its head on one side and say hoarsely and very knowingly    hello .  hello .  hello .  what s the matter here .  keep up your spirits .  never say die .  i m a devil  i m a devil  i m a devil .  hurrah .    then it would whistle or make a noise like the drawing of a cork out of a bottle  repeated a great many times  and flap its wings against its sides as if it were bursting with laughter .  this raven was named grip and was barnaby s constant companion .  the neighbors used to say it was one hundred and twenty years old  for ravens live a very long time   and some said it knew altogether too much to be only a bird .  but barnaby would hear nothing said against it  and  next to his mother  loved it better than anything in the world .   barnaby knew that folks called him half witted  but he cared little for that .  sometimes he would laugh at what they said .    why   he would say   how much better to be silly than as wise as you .  you don t see shadowy people like those that live in sleep  not you .  nor eyes in the knotted panes of glass  nor swift ghosts when it blows hard  nor do you hear voices in the air  nor see men stalking in the sky  not you .  i lead a merrier life than you with all your cleverness .  you re the dull men .  we re the bright ones .  ha  ha .  i ll not change with you  not i .    haredale  who had been so kind to barnaby s mother  was a burly  stern man who had few acquaintances and lived much alone .  when first he came to live at the warren an enemy of his  sir john chester  had circulated suspicious rumors about him  so that some came half to believe he himself had had something to do with his brother s murder .   these whispers so affected haredale that as time passed he grew gloomy and morose and lived in seclusion  thinking only how he could solve the mystery of the murder  and loving more and more the little emma as she grew into a beautiful girl .  he neglected the warren so that the property looked quite desolate and ruined  and at length superstitious people in the neighborhood came to mutter that it was haunted by the ghost of rudge  the steward  whose body had been found in the pond .   the old bell ringer of the near by church even said he had seen this ghost once  when he went  late one night  to wind the church clock .  but of course others  who knew there were no such things as ghosts  only smiled at these stories .   sir john chester  who so hated haredale  was just as smooth and smiling and elegant as the other was rough .  haredale had been sir john s drudge and scapegoat at school and the latter had always despised him .  and as the years went by sir john came to hate him .   his own son edward had fallen in love with emma  haredale s niece  and she loved him in return .  sir john had been all his life utterly selfish and without conscience .  he had little money and was much in debt and wanted his son to marry an heiress  so that he himself could continue his life of pleasure .  edward  however  gave his father to understand that he would never give up his love for emma .  sir john believed that if haredale chose  he could make his niece dislike edward  and because he did not  sir john hated haredale the more bitterly .   emma had a close friend named dolly varden  the daughter of a locksmith .  dolly was a pretty  dimpled  roguish little flirt  as rosy and sparkling and fresh as an apple  and she had a great many lovers .   one of these was her father s apprentice  who lived in the same house .  his name was simon tappertit  a conceited  bragging  empty headed young man with a great opinion of his own good looks .  when he looked at his thin legs  which he admired exceedingly  he could not see how it was that dolly could help worshiping him .   tappertit had ambitions of his own and thought himself a great man who was kept down by a tyrannical master  though the good natured locksmith was the kindest man in london .  he had formed a society of apprentices whose toast was   death to all masters  life to all apprentices  and love to all fair damsels .   he was their leader .  he had made them all keys to fit their masters  doors  and at night  when they were supposed to be asleep in bed  they would steal out to meet in a dirty cellar owned by an old blind man  where they kept a skull and cross bones and signed high sounding oaths with a pen dipped in blood  and did other silly things .  the object of the society was to hurt  annoy  wrong and pick quarrels with such of their masters as happened not to please them .  with such cheap fooleries tappertit had convinced himself that he was fit to be a great general .   but with all his smirking  dolly varden only laughed at him .  to tell the truth  she was very fond of young joe willet  whose father kept the maypole inn  very near the warren where her friend emma haredale lived .  joe was a good  brave fellow  and was head over ears in love with dolly  but dolly was a coquette  and never let him know how much she cared for him .  joe was not contented at home  for his father seemed to think him a child and did not treat him according to his years  so that but for leaving dolly varden he would long ago have run away to seek his fortune .   both joe and dolly knew how edward chester loved emma haredale  and they used sometimes to carry notes from one to the other  since the hatred of sir john for emma s uncle often prevented the lovers from meeting .   sir john found this out  and bribed a hostler at the maypole inn to spy for him and prevent  if he could  these letters passing .  the hostler was an uncouth  drunken giant that people called maypole hugh  as strong as an ox  and cruel and cunning .  hugh watched carefully  and from time to time would go to sir john s house in london and report what he had seen .   ii  the mysterious stranger and who he was  about this time residents in the neighborhood of the warren and the maypole inn began to tell tales of a mysterious man who roamed about the country side .   he was seen often and by many persons  always at night  skulking in the shadow or riding furiously on a horse .  he was fierce and haggard and discourteous to travelers  wore a slouch hat which he never took off  and generally kept the lower part of his face muffled in a handkerchief .  he always went alone .  some said he slept in church yards  others that he never slept at all  and still others that he was a wicked man who had sold his soul to the evil one .   one night he rested at the maypole inn  and a little while after he had gone  varden the locksmith  dolly s father  as he drove home  found edward chester lying in the road  having been wounded and robbed of his money .  barnaby rudge had seen the attack and was bending over him .  he had been too frightened to give aid  but from his description varden knew the robber was the stranger who had stopped at the inn .   the honest locksmith took edward into his chaise  drove him to barnaby s house  which was near by  and left him in care of mrs .  rudge  where a doctor soon dressed the wound  which was not serious .   next day mr .  varden came to see how the wounded man was .  as he sat talking with mrs .  rudge a tapping came at the window .  she went to the door .  the locksmith heard her cry out  and sprang forward to find standing there  to his astonishment  the robber of the night before .  he grasped at him  but the woman threw herself before him  clasped his arm and besought him  for her life s sake  not to pursue the man .   the locksmith had known barnaby s mother all his life  but so strange was her action now  especially since she refused to answer any question  begging him to ask her nothing  that he almost wondered if she herself could be in league with a crime doer .  her apparent agony touched him  however  and  raising no alarm  he went home in great puzzle of mind .   he would have been far more disturbed if he had known the whole truth .  for the mysterious stranger he had seen  who by night had haunted the neighborhood  was none other than mrs .  rudge s husband  barnaby s father  the steward who everybody believed had been murdered with his master  and whose body had been found in the pond .   rudge himself had committed that wicked deed .  he had killed both master and gardener  and to cover the crime had put his own clothes  his watch and ring on the latter s body and sunk it in the pond .  when  on the night of the murder  he told his wife what he had done  she had shrunk fearfully from him  declaring that  although being his wife she would not give him up to justice  yet she would never own him or shelter him .  he had fled then with the money he had stolen  and that night  while she lay sick with horror  barnaby had been born with his poor crazed brain  the look of terror in his baby face and the birth mark of blood on his wrist .   for many years the guilty wretch had wandered the earth  but he could not escape the knowledge of his deed .  and at last his conscience had driven him back to the scene of his crime  friendless  penniless  fearful of the sunlight  slinking by night like a ghost about the house in which he had murdered his master  and hounding his miserable wife for money with which to buy food and drink .  the poor woman had kept her terrible secret  giving him every coin she could save  striving so that barnaby  unhappily born as he was  should never know the shame of having his father suffer death on the gallows .  when rudge had come to her house that day he had thought her alone  and she had saved him from capture only by begging the locksmith to stay his hand .   after his hairbreadth escape from varden  rudge hid himself in a narrow street .  when the next dawn came  as he searched for some dark den in which he might lie sheltered till another night  he saw simon tappertit issuing with his noisy apprentice crew from the cellar in which they held their meetings .  he entered its door  made friends with the villainous blind man who kept it and there established his headquarters .   once more  one night after the wounded edward had been taken to his own home  rudge hunted out his trembling wife and demanded money  threatening to bring harm to barnaby if she refused him  and she gave him all she had .   but this time dread of him made her desperate .  when morning came she went to haredale and told him that she and her son could no longer live on his bounty .  the next day  with barnaby  who carried on his back his beloved raven  grip  she left the house afoot  telling no one where they were going lest her husband find her out  and pushed far into the country to find a home in some obscure village .  and though rudge  the murderer  and the blind man  who was much more crafty and cunning than many men with eyesight  searched for them everywhere  it was a long time before they found any trace .   perhaps joe and dolly varden missed poor cheery barnaby more than did any one else .  but several events occurred soon after this that gave them other things to think of .   maypole hugh  the savage hostler  had continued his spying work for edward s father  and sir john determined it was high time to break off his son s attachment for emma haredale .   one day dolly was carrying a letter from emma at the warren to edward  and as she passed through the fields  hugh attacked her  throwing his arms around her and pretending to make coarse love to her .  she was dreadfully frightened and screamed as loud as she could .  joe  as it happened  was walking within sound of her voice  and ran like the wind to her aid .   in another moment hugh had leaped the hedge and disappeared and dolly was sobbing in her rescuer s arms .  she was afraid to tell joe who had frightened her  for fear the hostler would take his revenge by harming him  so she only said she had been attacked by a man whom she had never seen .   in her scare she had forgotten all about the letter she had carried  and now she discovered it was gone .  it was nowhere to be found .   this  of course  was because hugh had stolen it .  it was to get the letter that he had frightened her  and he was soon on his way to carry it to sir john .  dolly did not guess this .  she wrote to emma telling her of the mishap  and this note joe  to whom she intrusted it  knowing no reason to distrust the hostler  gave to hugh to deliver .  so sir john got both missives in the end .   emma haredale  not understanding why edward returned no answer to her letter  was hurt  and thought him cold .  sir john  seizing his opportunity  told her one day  pretending sorrow while he did so  that his son  naturally fickle  had fallen in love with some one else  to whom he was soon to be married .   emma  not dreaming the father of the man she loved could be such a false liar  believed him  and when edward wrote her  speaking of his poverty and telling her he was going to leave england to try to better his prospects  she thought his manly letter only an excuse to part from her .   proud  though heartbroken  she did not answer it  and so  thanks to his father s selfish scheming  edward sailed away to the west indies  hopeless and despairing .   another left england at the same time whose going meant far more to dolly varden .  this was joe .  his father  the innkeeper  had been restraining him more and more  until his treatment had become the jest of the country side  and joe had chafed to the point of rebellion at the gibes that continually met him .  one day  at the jeer of an old enemy of his  his wrath boiled over .  he sprang upon him and thrashed him soundly in the inn before the assembled guests .  then  knowing his father would never forgive him  he went to his own room and barricaded the door .  that night joe let himself down from his window and before daylight was in london .   he went first to the locksmith s house to tell dolly he had run away and that he loved her  but dolly being a flirt  only laughed .  to tell the truth  she was so very fond of joe that she didn t like to show him how sorry she was .  so the poor fellow went away thinking she cared very little  though as soon as he was out of sight she nearly cried her eyes out   and enlisted as a soldier .  that same night joe started from london to fight in the war in america .  and it was a long time before either he or edward chester was heard of again .   iii  barnaby gets into trouble  five years went by  and edward chester remained in the west indies and prospered .  for five years joe willet fought in the war in america .  and for five years barnaby rudge with his mother and grip  the raven  lived unmolested in their little village and were happy .   at the end of the five years three things happened at about the same time  edward started back to england from the west indies with a fair fortune in his pocket  joe was sent back from america with one arm gone  and barnaby and his mother left their village home again  secretly  and set out for london  hoping to lose themselves in its hugeness .  the wily blind man  the companion now of rudge  the murderer  had found them out .   he came one day and made mrs .  rudge give him all the money she had been able to lay by in these five years except a single gold piece .  he told her he would return in a week for more and that if she had not got it then  he would entice barnaby away to join in the evil life of his father .  so she left the village the very next morning  and she and barnaby trudged afoot all the weary way to the great city .   though they knew nothing of it  there was great excitement in london .  lord george gordon  a well meaning but crack brained nobleman  led astray by flatterers till he believed he had a god given mission to drive all catholics out of england  had  sometime before this  begun to hold meetings and to stir up the people with the cry of  no popery .    he declared that the religion of the country was in danger of being overthrown and that the pope of rome was plotting to make his religion supreme .  and this idea he talked wherever he went .  he was a slender  sallow man who dressed in severe black and wore his hair smoothly combed  and his bright  restless eyes and his look of uncertainty made it clear that he was no man to lead  but was rather himself the misled dupe of others .   one of these schemers who ruled him was his secretary  gashford  a man of ugly face  with beetling brows and great flapped ears .  he had been a thief and a scoundrel all his life  and had wormed himself into lord george s confidence by flattery .  he easily fooled his master into believing that the rabble who flocked to hear him  and the idle loungers who yelled themselves hoarse at what he said  were crowds of honest citizens who believed as he did  and were ready to follow his leadership .  gashford had added to his followers even dennis  the hangman of london  and the foolish nobleman not knowing the ruffian s true calling  thought him a man to trust .   for many weeks this banding together of all the lawless ragamuffins of london had gone on  till one had only to shout  no popery .   on any street corner to draw together a crowd bent on mischief .  respectable people grew afraid and kept to their houses  and criminals and street vagabonds grew bolder and bolder .   as may be guessed  simon tappertit  the one time apprentice of varden the locksmith  rejoiced at this excitement as at a chance to show his talent for leadership .  his apprentice society had now become the  united bulldogs   and he himself  helping the schemes of gashford  strutted about among the crowds with an air of vast importance .   sir john chester watched the trouble gathering with glee .  his old enemy haredale  he knew  was a catholic  and as this movement  if it grew bold enough  meant harm to all of that religion  he hoped for its success .  he was too cunning to aid it publicly  but he sent maypole hugh  who was still his spy  to gashford  and the brawny hostler  who savagely longed for fighting and plunder  joined with the secretary and with dennis the hangman to help increase the tumult .   a day had been set on which lord george gordon had vowed he would march to parliament at the head of forty thousand men to demand the passing of a law to forbid all catholics to enter the country .  this vast rabble army gathered in a great field  under the command of these sorry leaders  the misguided lord  dennis the hangman  tappertit  hugh the hostler  gashford the secretary  and other rowdies picked for their boldness and daring .  the mob thus formed covered an immense space .  all wore blue cockades in their hats or carried blue flags  and from them went up a hoarse roar of oaths  shouts and ribald songs .   such was the scene on which barnaby and his mother came as they walked into london .  they knew nothing of its cause or its meaning .  mrs .  rudge saw its rough disorder with terror  but the confusion  the waving flags and the shouts had got into barnaby s brain .  to him this seemed a splendid host marching to some noble cause .  he watched with sparkling eyes  longing to join it .   suddenly maypole hugh rushed from the crowd with a shout of recognition  and  thrusting a flagstaff into barnaby s hands  drew him into the ranks .   his mother shrieked and ran forward  but she was thrown to the ground  barnaby was whirled away into the moving mass and she saw him no more .   barnaby enjoyed that hour of march with all his soul  and the louder the howling the more he was thrilled .  the crowd surrounded the houses of parliament and fought the police .  at length a regiment of mounted soldiers charged them .  barnaby thought this brave work and held his ground valiantly  even knocking one soldier off his horse with the flagstaff  until others dragged him to a place of safety .   that night the drunken mob  grown bolder  tore down  pillaged and burned all the catholic chapels within their reach  and  with hugh and dennis the hangman  poor crazed barnaby ran at its head  covered with dirt  his garments torn to rags  singing and leaping with delight .  he thought he was the most courageous of all  that he was helping to destroy the country s enemies  and that when the fighting was over he and his mother would be rich and she would always be proud that he was so noble and so brave .   the golden cups  the candlesticks and the money they stole from the burned chapels hugh and the hangman buried under a heap of straw in the tavern which they had made their headquarters  and left barnaby to guard the place .  he counted this a sacred trust  and when soldiers came to arrest all in the building he refused to fly in time .  he even fought them single handed and felled two before he was knocked down with the butt of a musket and handcuffed .   while he had been resisting  grip had been busily plucking away the straw from the hidden plunder  now his hoarse croak showed them the hoard and they unearthed it all .  at length  closing ranks around barnaby  they marched him off to a barracks  from which he was taken to newgate prison  where a blacksmith put irons on his arms and legs  and he and the raven were locked in a cell .   while barnaby was guarding the tavern room  hugh  egged on by his master  sir john chester  had proposed the burning of the warren  where haredale still lived with emma  his niece  and dolly varden  now her companion .   the crowd agreed gladly  since haredale was a catholic and that same day in london had given evidence to the police against the rioters who had burned the chapels .  they rushed away  marched hastily across the fields  tied the old host of the maypole inn to his chair  drank all the liquor they could find and then rushed to the warren .  there they put the servants to flight  burst in the doors  staved the wine casks in the cellar  split up the costly furniture with hammers and axes and set fire to the building  so that it soon burned to the ground .   haredale  in london  saw the red glare in the sky and rode post haste to the place  but found on his arrival only ruins and ashes .  he believed that emma and dolly had had time to escape to safety  but while he was searching the grounds for some sign of them he saw in the starlight a man hiding in a broken turret .   he drew his sword and advanced .  as the figure moved into the light he rushed forward  flung himself upon him and clutched his throat .    villain .   he cried in a terrible voice   dead and buried as all men supposed  at last  at last i have you .  you  rudge  slayer of my brother and of his faithful servant .  double murderer and monster  i arrest you in the name of god .    bound and fettered in his carriage  haredale took rudge back to london and had him locked in newgate prison .   iv  barnaby prospers at last  haredale searched vainly next day for emma and dolly varden .  he could not believe they had lost their lives in the burning building  yet he was filled with anxiety because of their disappearance .  could he have known what had happened he would have been even more fearful .   simon tappertit had seen his chance at last to win for himself the lovely dolly  who had scorned him when he was an apprentice of the locksmith .  he had bribed hugh and the hangman to aid him .  while the mob was occupied at the front of the house this precious pair had entered from the back  seized the two girls and put them into a coach .   this they guarded at a distance till the burning was done  then  with tappertit on the box and surrounded by his ruffians  the coach was driven into the city .   emma had spent the day in the fear that her uncle had been killed with other catholics in london  and at this new and surpassing fright she had fainted .  dolly  though no less concerned  had fought her captors bravely  though vainly .  often in that long ride she wished that joe  her vanished lover  were there to rescue her as he had rescued her once from maypole hugh .   she had determined when she reached the london streets to scream as loudly as she could for help  but before they came to the city hugh climbed into the carriage and sat between them  threatening to choke either if she made a noise .   in this wise they were driven to a miserable cottage  and in the dirty apartment to which they were taken dolly threw herself upon the unconscious emma and wept pitifully  unmindful of the jeers of hugh and of the hangman .   when tappertit entered the room suddenly  dolly  not knowing his part in the plot  screamed with joy and threw herself into his arms crying    i knew it .  my dear father s at the door .  heaven bless you for rescuing us .    but she saw in an instant her mistake  when the ridiculous braggart laid his hand on his breast and told her  now that he no longer was an apprentice but a famous leader of the people  he had chosen to be her husband .  with this announcement he left them .   meanwhile mrs .  rudge  day and night  had searched everywhere for barnaby .  in one of the riots she was injured  and was taken to a hospital  and while she lay there she heard with agony that her son had been so active in the disturbances that a price had been put by the government on his head .   but in his present trouble barnaby had unexpectedly found an old friend .  joe willet  just returned with one empty sleeve from his five years of soldiering in america  had been with the soldiers in the barracks when barnaby had been brought there on his way to prison .  he soon discovered who the boy s rioting companions had been and took them word of his plight  for he knew it meant death to barnaby unless he escaped .   maypole hugh  tappertit and the hangman were all itching for more disorder  and this news gave them an excuse .  they went out at once and gathered the mob together to attack newgate prison and to release all the prisoners .  they themselves led the procession .  the house of varden  dolly s father  was on their way  they stopped there  and  in spite of the lusty fight he made  carried the locksmith with them to compel him to open the prison gates with his tools .   this he refused to do  and they would doubtless have killed him  but for two men who dragged him from their clutches in the nick of time .  these two men were the one armed joe and edward chester  just returned from the west indies  whom the former had met by accident that day .  they took the locksmith to his home  while the raging crowd brought furniture from neighboring houses and built a bonfire of it to burn down the great prison gate .   from this same mob haredale himself had a narrow escape .  he was staying at a house near by  which  belonging to a catholic  was attacked .  he tried to escape across the roof  but was recognized from the street by the giant hugh .  the cellar luckily had a back door opening into a lane  and with the assistance of joe and edward  who had hastened to the rear to aid him  he escaped that way .   maypole hugh  during this terrible time while the mob was burning houses everywhere and the soldiers firing on the rioters in every quarter of london  seemed to bear a charmed life .  he rode a great brewer s horse and carried an ax  and wherever the fight was thickest there he was to be found .   never had such a sight been seen in london as when the prison gate fell and the crowd rushed from cell to cell  smashing the iron doors to release the prisoners  some of whom  being under sentence of death  had never expected to be free again .  rudge  the murderer  knowing nothing of what the uproar meant  suffered tortures  thinking in his guilty fear that the hordes were howling for his life .  when he was finally released and in the open street he found barnaby beside him .   they broke off their fetters  and that night took refuge in a shed in a field .  next day rudge sent barnaby to try to find the blind man  his cunning partner  in whose wits he trusted to help them get away .  barnaby brought the blind man  and brought also hugh  whom he found wounded in the street  but in so doing he was seen by dennis  the hangman .   this villainous sneak  knowing that the daring of the rioters had reached its limit  and that they must soon be scattered and captured  and thinking to buy pardon for himself by a piece of treachery  without delay brought soldiers  who surrounded the shed .  the blind man  attempting to run away  was shot dead  and the others  rudge  hugh and poor  innocent barnaby  were captured .   then  well satisfied with his work  dennis set out for the house where simon tappertit had confined emma haredale and dolly varden .  the hangman wanted them well out of the way  so they could not testify that he had helped to burn the warren and to kidnap them .  he had thought of a plan to have them taken to a boat in the river and conveyed where their friends would never find them  and to carry them off he chose gashford  lord george gordon s secretary  who was the more willing as he had fallen in love with emma s beauty .   but this wicked plan was never to be carried out .  the very hour that gashford came on this pitiless errand  while he roughly bade emma prepare to depart  the doors flew open .  men poured in  led by edward chester  who knocked gashford down  and in another moment emma was clasped in her uncle s embrace  and dolly  laughing and crying at the same time  fell into the arms of her father .  their place of concealment had been discovered a few hours before  and the three men had lost no time in planning their capture .   dennis the hangman  in spite of his previous treachery  caught in the trap  was taken straight way to jail  and simon tappertit  wounded and raging  watched dolly s departure from the floor  where he lay with his wonderful legs  the pride and glory of his life  broken and crushed into shapeless ugliness .  the famous riots were over .  lord george gordon was a prisoner  hundreds were being arrested  and london was again growing quiet .   mrs .  rudge  poor mother .  at last found barnaby where he lay chained in his cell and condemned to death .  day after day she never left him  while varden  the locksmith  and haredale worked hard for his release .  they carried his case even to the king  and at the last moment  while he rode on his way to execution  his pardon was granted .   of the rest who died on the scaffold  rudge  the murderer  was hanged  cursing all men to the last  maypole hugh died glorying in his evil life and with a jest on his lips  and dennis  the hangman  was dragged to the gallows cringing and shrieking for mercy .   a few weeks later emma haredale was married to edward chester and sailed with him back to the west indies  where he had established a flourishing business .   before this  however  his father  sir john chester  was well punished for his hard heart and bad deeds by the discovery that maypole hugh  the hostler  was really his own unacknowledged son  whose mother he had deserted many years before .  but even this blow  and the marriage of his son edward to the niece of his lifelong enemy  did not soften him .  he still hated haredale with his old venom and loved to go to the ruins of the warren and gloat over its destruction .   on one of these visits he met and taunted haredale beyond all endurance .  the two men drew their swords and fought a duel  which ended by haredale s running sir john through the heart .  haredale left england at once  entered a convent in a foreign country and spent his few remaining years in penance and remorse .   lord george gordon  the poor deluded noble who had been the cause of all this disorder  finally died

uriah heep his clerk later  his partner  doctor strong david s schoolmaster in dover  dora spenlow the daughter of david s employer and his  child wife              david copperfield  i  david s early ups and downs  there was once a little boy by the name of david copperfield  whose father had died before he was born .  the night he was born his great aunt  miss betsy trotwood  a grim lady with a black cap tied under her chin and a great gold watch chain  came to the house to ask his mother to name the baby  which she took for granted was a girl  after her  but as soon as she found it was a boy she flounced out in anger and never came back again .   the first thing david remembered was living in a big country house in england with his pretty  golden haired mother and with peggotty  his nurse  a red faced  kindly woman  with a habit of wearing her dresses so tight that whenever she hugged him some buttons would fly off the back .  he loved his mother dearly  so dearly that when a tall  handsome man named murdstone began to come to see her in the evenings david was jealous and sad .  mr .  murdstone acted as if he liked him  and even took him riding on his horse  but there was something in his face that david could not like .   one summer day david was sent off with peggotty for a two weeks  visit to her brother s house in yarmouth .  yarmouth was a queer fishing town on the sea coast  and the house they went to was the queerest thing in it .  it was made of an old barge  drawn up high and dry on the beach .  it had a chimney on one side and little windows  and there were sea shells around the door .  david s room was in the stern  and the window was the hole which the rudder had once passed through .  everything smelled of salt water and lobsters  and david thought it was the most wonderful house in the world .   he soon made friends with the family  mr .  peggotty  a big fisherman with a laugh like a gale of wind  ham  his nephew  a big  overgrown boy who carried david from the coach on his back  and mrs .  gummidge  who was the widow of mr .  peggotty s drowned partner .   and  last of all  there was a beautiful little girl with curly hair and a string of blue beads around her neck whom they called little em ly .  she was an orphan niece of peggotty s .  none of these people belonged to mr .  peggotty  but  though he was only a poor fisherman himself  he was so kind that he gave them all a home .  david played with little em ly  and went out in the boat with mr .  peggotty  and enjoyed his visit greatly  though he grew anxious to see his mother again .   he had no idea what had happened to her till he got back home with peggotty .  then he found why he had been sent off on his visit .  while he was away his mother had married mr .  murdstone .   david found things sadly altered after this .  mr .  murdstone was a hard  cruel master .  he cared nothing for the little boy and was harsh to him in everything .  he even took away david s own cozy bedroom and made him sleep in a gloomy chamber .  when he was sad mr .  murdstone called him obstinate and locked him up and forbade his mother to pet or comfort him .   david s mother loved him  but she loved her new husband  too  and it was a most unhappy state of things .  to make it worse  mr .  murdstone s sister came to live with them .  she was an unlovely old maid with big black eyebrows  and liked david no better than her brother did .   after this there were no more pleasant hours of sitting with his mother or walking with her to church  for mr .  murdstone and his sister kept them apart .  the only happy moments david spent were in a little upper room where there was a collection of books left by his dead father .  he got some comfort from reading these .   mr .  murdstone made david s mother give him hard tasks and lessons to do  and when david recited them he and his sister both sat and listened .  to feel their presence and disapproval confused the little fellow so much that even when he knew his lesson he failed .   one day when he came to recite he saw mr .  murdstone finishing the handle of a whip he had been making .  this frightened him so that he could scarcely remember a word .  mr .  murdstone grasped him then and led him to his room to whip him .   poor little david was so terrified that he hardly knew what he was doing  and in his agony and terror  while the merciless blows were falling  he seized the hand that held him and bit it as hard as he could .  mr .  murdstone then beat him almost to death and locked him in the room .   he was kept there for five days with only bread and milk to eat .  every day he was taken down for family prayers and then taken back again  and during prayers he was made to sit in a corner where he could not even see his mother s face .  he had to sit all day long with nothing to do but think of mr .  peggotty s house boat and of little em ly and wish he was there .  the last night peggotty  his nurse  crept up and whispered through the keyhole that mr .  murdstone was going to send him away the next day to a school near london .   the next morning he started in a carrier s cart .  his mother was so much in awe of mr .  murdstone that she hardly dared kiss david good by  and he saw nothing of peggotty .  but as he was crying  peggotty came running from behind a hedge and jumped into the cart and hugged him so hard that all the buttons flew off the back of her dress .   the man who drove the cart was named barkis .  he seemed to be very much taken with peggotty  and after she had gone back david told him all about her .  before they parted he made david promise to write her a message for him .  it was a very short message   barkis is willin  .   david didn t know in the least what the driver meant  but he promised  and he sent the message in his very first letter .   probably peggotty knew what he meant  though  for before david came back again mr .  barkis and she were courting .  however  that has not much to do with this part of the story .   the school to which mr .  murdstone had sent him was a bare building with gratings on all the windows like a prison  and a high brick wall around it .  it was owned by a man named creakle  who had begun by raising hops  and had gone into the school business because he had lost all of his own and his wife s money and had no other way to live .  he was fat and spoke always in a whisper  and he was so cruel and bad tempered that not only the boys  but his wife  too  was terribly afraid of him .   he nearly twisted david s ear off the first day  and he made one of the teachers tie a placard to david s back  this  he said  was by mr .  murdstone s order  which read                            take care of him     he bites                         to have to wear this before everybody made david sorrowful and ashamed  but luckily a good natured boy named tommy traddles  who liked david s looks  said it was a shame to make him wear it  and as tommy traddles was very popular  all the other boys said it was a shame  too .  so  beyond calling him  towser  for a few days  and saying  lie down  sir .   as if he were a dog  they did not make much fun of him while he wore it .   besides tommy traddles  david liked best the head boy  james steerforth  the oldest boy in the school  and the only one creakle did not dare beat or mistreat .  steerforth took david under his wing and helped him with his lessons  while in return david used to tell him stories from the books he had read .   what with the beatings and tasks  david was glad enough when vacation time came .  but his home coming was anything but pleasant .  he found his mother with a little baby  and she looked careworn and ill .   mr .  murdstone  he saw at once  hated him as much as ever  and miss murdstone would not let him even so much as touch his baby brother .  he was forbidden to sit in the kitchen with peggotty  and when he crept away to the upper room with the books mr .  murdstone called him sullen and obstinate .  david was so miserable every day that he was almost glad to bid his mother good by  and as he rode away  to look back at her as she stood there at the gate holding up her baby for david to see .   that was the last picture david carried in his heart of his pretty mother .  one day not long after  he was called from the school room to the parlor  and there mr .  creakle told him that his mother was dead and that the baby had died  too .   david reached home the next day .  peggotty took him into her arms at the door and called his mother her  dear  poor pretty   and comforted him  but he was very sad .  it seemed to him that life could never be bright again .   after the funeral miss murdstone discharged peggotty and  probably not knowing what else to do with him  let david go with the faithful old servant down to the old house boat at yarmouth  where he had been visiting when his mother was married to mr .  murdstone .   the wonderful house on the beach was just the same .  mr .  peggotty and ham and mrs .  gummidge were still there  with everything smelling just as usual of salt water and lobsters  and little em ly was there  too  grown to be quite a big girl .  it seemed  somehow  like coming back to a dear old quiet home  where nothing changed and where all was restful and good .   but this happiness was not to last .  david had to go home again  and there it was worse than ever .  he was utterly neglected .  he was sent to no school  taught nothing  allowed to make no friends .  and at last mr .  murdstone  as if he could think of nothing worse  apprenticed him as a chore boy in a warehouse in london .   the building where david now was compelled to work was on a wharf on the river bank  and was dirty and dark and overrun with rats .  here he had to labor hard for bare living wages  among rough boys and rougher men  with no counselor  hearing their coarse oaths about him  and fearing that one day he would grow up to be no better than they .  he was given a bedroom in the house of a mr .  micawber  and this man was  in his way  a friend .   there was never a better hearted man than mr .  micawber  but he seemed to be always unlucky .  he had a head as bald as an egg  wore a tall  pointed collar  and carried for ornament an eye glass which he never used .  he never had any money  was owing everybody who would lend him any  and was always  as he said   waiting for something to turn up .   with this exception david had not a friend in london  and finally mr .  micawber himself was put in prison for debt  and his relatives  who paid his debts to release him  did so on condition that he leave london .  so at length david had not even this one friend .   david bore this friendless and wretched life as long as he could  but at length he felt that he could stay at the warehouse no longer and made up his mind to run away .   the only one in the world he could think of who might help him was  whom do you think .  his great aunt  miss betsy trotwood  who had left his mother s house the night he was born because he did not happen to be a girl .  she was the only real relative he had in the world .   she lived  peggotty had told him  in dover  and that was seventy miles away  but the distance did not daunt him .  so one day he put all his things into a box and hired a boy with a cart to take it to the coach office .  but the boy robbed him of all the money he had  a gold piece peggotty had sent him  and drove off with his box besides  and poor david  crying  set out afoot  without a penny  in the direction he thought dover lay .   that evening he sold his waistcoat to a clothes dealer for a few pennies  and when night came he slept on the ground  under the walls of mr .  creakle s old school where he had known steerforth and tommy traddles .  the next day he offered his jacket for sale to a half crazy old store keeper  who took the coat but would not pay him at first  and david had to sit all day on the door step before the other would give him the money .   the next four nights he slept under haystacks  greatly in fear of tramps  and at length  on the sixth day  ragged  sunburned  dusty and almost dead from weariness  he got to dover .   he had to ask many people before he could find out where miss betsy trotwood lived .  it was outside the town  in a cottage with a little garden .  here she lived all alone  except for a simple minded old man  whom she called mr .  dick  who was a relative of hers  and who did nothing all day but fly big kites and write petitions to the king  which he began every morning and never finished .  all the neighbors thought miss betsy trotwood a most queer old woman  but those who knew her best knew that she had a very kind heart under her grim appearance .   when david reached the house miss betsy was digging at some flowers in the garden .  all she saw was a ragged  dirty little boy  and she called out  without even turning her head   go away  no boys here .    but david was so wretched that he went right in at the gate and went up behind her and said   if you please  aunt  i m your nephew .    his aunt was so startled at his looks and at what he said  that she sat down plump on the ground  and david  his misery getting all at once the better of him  sobbed out all the pitiful tale of his wrongs and sorrows since his mother had died .   miss betsy trotwood s heart was touched .  she seized david by the collar  led him into the house  made him drink something and then made him lie down on the sofa while she fed him hot broth .  then she had a warm bath prepared  and at last  very tired and comfortable  and wrapped up in a big shawl  david fell asleep on the sofa .   that night he was put to bed in a clean room  and before he slept he prayed that he might never be homeless and friendless again .   ii  little em ly  good fortune was with david now .  his aunt wrote to mr .  murdstone  and he and his sister came  fully expecting to take the boy back with them  but  instead  miss betsy told mr .  murdstone plainly that he was a stony hearted hypocrite  who had broken his wife s heart and tortured her son  and she ordered him and his sister from the house .  david was so delighted at this that he threw his arms around her neck and kissed her  and from that moment miss betsy trotwood began to love him as if he had been her own son .   david loved her in return .  he drove out with her and helped mr .  dick fly his kites and was very grateful .  and at length his aunt placed him in a school in dover and found him pleasant lodgings there in the house of her lawyer  mr .  wickfield .   it was a different sort of school from what his first had been .  his teacher was a doctor strong  and the school boys were not the frightened  ill treated lot he had known at mr .  creakle s house .  he was happy there  but his happiest hours of all were those spent  after school was out  at mr .  wickfield s .  the lawyer had an only daughter  agnes  just david s age  a sweet  gentle girl  who seemed to live for her father  and whom david came to consider before long almost as a sister .   one person connected with the lawyer s household whom he did not like so well was uriah heep .  heep was a high shouldered  red headed  bony young man  with no eyebrows or eyelashes  and with long skeleton fingers .  he dressed all in black  and his hands were clammy and cold  like a fish  so that it chilled one to touch them .  he never smiled  the nearest he could come to it was to make two creases down his cheeks .  he was always cringing and pretending to be humble  but really he was a sneak and a scoundrel at heart .  david detested him without knowing why  the more so when he came to see that heep was gaining an influence over agnes s father .  all the while  too  heep pretended to like david  though david knew very well he did not .   so time went on .  david studied hard and was a favorite with both pupils and teachers .  at length he was head boy himself  and at seventeen his school life was finished .   he parted regretfully from doctor strong and from agnes  and after paying his aunt  miss betsy trotwood  a visit  he started off to yarmouth to see his old nurse  now the wife of barkis  the driver  and just as fond of david as ever .  on his way through london  as it happened  david met the old school fellow whom he had so liked  james steerforth  and  loath to part with him so quickly  he proposed that the latter accompany him to yarmouth .   steerforth agreed and they went together .  they took dinner at peggotty s and spent the first evening in the old house boat  where mr .  peggotty still lived with ham and mrs .  gummidge and little em ly  the latter now grown to be a lovely girl and engaged to marry ham .  they spent some weeks there  each amusing himself in his own way  and soon steerforth was as popular as david had always been  for he sang beautifully and talked entertainingly  and all  from mr .  peggotty to little em ly  thought they had never seen so brilliant and handsome a lad .   if david could have read the thoughts that were in steerforth s mind he would have grieved that he had ever brought him to that peaceful  innocent spot .  for steerforth had changed since the old school days when david had been so fond of him .  he had learned wickedness  and now  while he was exerting himself in every way to make the peggottys like and admire him  in his heart he was trying to fascinate little em ly and to steal her love that she had given to ham  till she would leave her home and run away with him to a foreign country .  this  however  david could not guess  nor could any of the others  who regretted when the two friends  visit was over .   now that his school days were finished david s aunt had planned for him to study law in an office in london  and accordingly david began his new life there  very near the street where he had once toiled  a wretched  friendless helper  in the dirty warehouse on the dock .  he found tommy traddles  who had stood his friend at mr .  creakle s school  studying now to be a lawyer also  and boarding  curiously enough  at the house of mr .  micawber  who had drifted back to london  still as poor and as hopeful as ever and still  waiting for something to turn up .    in spite of these and all his new acquaintances  david was very lonely at first and missed agnes  who all through his life at doctor strong s school had been his friend and adviser .   he saw her once when she was visiting in london  and then she had bad news to tell him  her father had been steadily failing in health and business  and little by little uriah heep  his red headed clerk with the clammy hands  had got him and his affairs into his power and made himself a partner in the firm .  david guessed that heep had planned to entrap her father so as to compel agnes herself to marry him  and this suspicion made david despise the clerk more and more .  but he knew of no way to help .   all this time he often saw steerforth  but never guessed how often the latter had been secretly to see little em ly or of the wicked part he was playing .  but one day david heard that barkis  peggotty s husband  whose early courtship he himself had aided when he took her the message  barkis is willin    had died  and david went at once to yarmouth to try to comfort his old nurse in her loss .   while he was there the blow came which caused such sorrow to all who lived in the old house boat .  little em ly  the pride and joy of mr .  peggotty s tender heart  ran away with steerforth .   she left a letter  begging them to forgive her  especially her uncle  mr .  peggotty  and bidding them all good by .  it broke mr .  peggotty s heart  and ham s  too .  and david was scarcely less sorrowful .  because  for what he had done  steerforth  whose friendship had been so much to him  could never be his friend again .   but nothing could change mr .  peggotty s love for little em ly .  he determined to start out and search throughout the world for her  and  meantime  ham and mrs .  gummidge were to stay there in the old home  to keep it looking just the same  with a lighted candle in the window every night  so that if little em ly by any chance came back it would be bright and warm to welcome her .  mr .  peggotty s parting words to david were    i m a going to seek her far and wide .  if any hurt should come to me  remember that the last word i left for her was   my unchanged love is with my darling child  and i forgive her .     iii  david and his child wife  though agnes always held a large place in his heart  david was very impressionable .  in the next few years he thought himself in love a good many times  but when finally he met dora spenlow  the daughter of one of the members of the law firm with which he was studying  he knew that all his other love affairs had been only fancies .  dora was blue eyed  with cheeks like a pink sea shell  and looked like a fairy .  david fell head over ears in love with her the first time he ever saw her .  he lost his appetite  and took to wearing tight gloves and shoes too small for him  and he used to put on his best clothes and walk around her house in the moonlight and do other extravagant things .   they found a good deal of trouble in their love making  for dora was under the care of none other than the terrible sister of mr .  murdstone  who had made david so miserable in his childhood  but he and dora used to meet sometimes  and they sent each other letters through one of dora s girl friends .  david  perhaps  would not have done this if he had thought he would have a fair chance to win dora  but with his old enemy  miss murdstone  against him  he was afraid to tell her father of his love .  but one day he told it to dora  and she promised to marry him .   good luck  however  never comes without a bit of bad luck .  soon after this david came home to his rooms one night to find his aunt  miss betsy trotwood  there  with her trunk and mr .  dick  kites and all .  she told david she had no other place to go  that she had lost all of her money and was quite ruined .   this was misfortune indeed  for it seemed to put his hope of marrying dora a great deal further away  but david faced the situation bravely and began at once to look for something to do outside of the law office to earn money enough to support them all .   in this trouble agnes was his true friend .  he had written her already of his love for dora and she had advised him .  through her now he found employment as secretary to his old schoolmaster  doctor strong  who had given up the school at dover and had moved to london .  he told dora  of course  all about his changed prospects  but dora was like a little butterfly who knew only how to fly about among flowers  she hardly knew what poverty meant  and thought he was scolding when he told her .   david worked hard in the morning at doctor strong s  in the afternoons at the law office  and in the evenings he studied shorthand so he might come to be a newspaper reporter .  and all this while he wrote to dora every day .   it was one of these letters that at last betrayed their secret .  dora dropped it from her pocket and miss murdstone picked it up .  she showed it to dora s father and he sent at once for david and told him angrily that he could never marry his child and that he must not see dora any more .  and david went home disconsolate .   this might have ended their engagement for ever  but that same day dora s father dropped dead of heart disease .  instead of being rich he was found to have left no money at all  and dora was taken to live with two aunts on the outskirts of london .  david did not know what was best to do now  so he went to dover to ask agnes s advice .   he was shocked at the changes he found there .  her father looked ill and scarcely seemed himself .  uriah heep  his new partner  with his ugly  fawning way and clammy hands  was living in their house and eating with them at their table .  he had obtained more and more power over mr .  wickfield and gloried in it .  and the other seemed no longer to dare to oppose uriah in anything .   but in spite of all this  agnes talked bravely and cheerfully with david .  under her direction  he wrote a letter to dora s aunts  declaring his love and asking permission to call  and they  pleased with his frankness  gave their permission .  before the year was out david began to earn money with his shorthand  reporting speeches in parliament for a newspaper .  he had discovered besides that he could write stories that the magazines were glad to buy .  so one day david married dora and they went to housekeeping in a tiny house of their own .   life seemed very sweet to them both  though dora  while she was the most loving little wife in the world  knew no more about housekeeping than a bird .  the servants stole the silver spoons  and the storekeepers overcharged them  and the house was never tidy or comfortable .  for a while david tried to make dora learn these things  but when he chid her the tears would come  and she would throw her arms around his neck and sob that she was only his child wife after all  and he would end by kissing her and telling her not to mind .  she was most like a beautiful toy  and like a toy  she seemed made only to play with  just as she played with her dog jip  instead of helping and encouraging david in his work .   but at length dora fell ill  so ill that they knew she was too frail and weak to get well and strong again .  david carried her down stairs every day  and every day the burden grew lighter .  she never complained  but called him her poor  dear boy  and one day she whispered that she was only his child wife and could never have been more  so that it was better as it was .   agnes came  and was there when dora died .  but for her comfort all the world would have been blank for poor david as he sat alone  longing for the child wife who could never be his again .   iv  david finds all well at last  more than once during this life of david s with his child wife he had seen mr .  peggotty .  the brave old man had searched europe for little em ly in vain  then he had come back to london  feeling somehow that some day she would stray there .  he used to walk the streets by night  looking at every face he passed .  in the room where he lived he kept a candle always lighted and one of her dresses hanging on a chair for her .   after dora s death david joined in the search  and at length they did find poor little em ly .  steerforth had treated her cruelly and finally deserted her  and she had crept back to london heartbroken and repentant  hoping for nothing but to die within sight of those who had loved her so .   but nothing had dimmed mr .  peggotty s love .  wretched as she was  he caught her in his arms  held her to his breast as he had done so often when she was a child  and told her she was still his own little em ly  just as she had always been .   she was ill  but he nursed her back to health .  then he went to yarmouth to fetch mrs .  gummidge  and they and the little em ly that had been found took passage for australia  where they might forget the dark past and find happiness in a new life .   but before they sailed fate had brought to naught the villainous plot that had been woven by uriah heep about agnes and her father .  and the one whom they had most to thank for this was mr .  micawber .   heep had met mr .  micawber once  when the latter  as usual  was in money difficulties  and  thinking to make a tool of him  had hired him for his clerk .  little by little heep had then got the other into his debt  till mr .  micawber saw no prospect before him but the debtors  prison .   threatening him with this  heep tried to compel him to do various bits of dirty and dishonest work  at which the other s soul revolted until at length he made up his mind to expose his employer .  so  pretending obedience  mr .  micawber wormed himself into all of the sneaking heep s affairs  found out the evidence of his guilt  and finally taking all the books and papers from the office safe  sent for david and his friend tommy traddles and told them all he had discovered .  they found it was by forgery that heep had got agnes s father into his power in the first place  and that among others whom he had robbed was david s aunt  miss betsy trotwood  whose fortune he had stolen .   david and tommy traddles sent for miss betsy and for agnes and her father  and they faced uriah all together .  he tried to brazen it out  but when he saw the empty safe he knew that all was known .  they told him the only way he could save himself from prison was by giving back the business to agnes s father  just as it had been years before  when david had lived there  and by restoring to miss betsy trotwood every cent he had robbed her of .  this he did with no very good grace and with an especial curse for david  whom he seemed to blame for it all .   in reward for mr .  micawber s good services  miss betsy and agnes s father paid off all his debts and gave him money enough to take him and his family to australia .  they sailed in the same vessel that carried mr .  peggotty and little em ly .   before it sailed little em ly had written a letter to ham  whose promised wife she had been before she ran away with steerforth  begging his forgiveness  and this letter she had asked david to give him after they had gone .  accordingly one day he went to yarmouth to do this .   that night a terrible storm arose .  the wind was so strong that it uprooted trees and threw down chimneys and rolled waves mountain high on the sand where stood the old deserted house boat of the peggottys .  next morning david was awakened with the news that a spanish ship had gone ashore and was fast going to pieces  and he ran to the beach  where all the town was gathered .   he could see the doomed vessel plainly where the surf broke over her .  her masts had snapped short off and at every wave she rolled and beat the sand as if she would pound herself to fragments .  several figures were clinging to the broken masts  and one by one the waves beat them off  and they went down for ever .   at length but one was left  and he held on so long that a shout of encouragement went up from the throng .  at this ham  the bravest and strongest of all the hardy boatmen there  tied a rope about his waist and plunged into the sea to try to save him .  but it was not to be .  the same huge wave that dashed the vessel to pieces threw the rescuer back on the sand  dead .  the body of the man he had tried to save was washed ashore  too  and it was that of james steerforth  who had so wronged little em ly .   so poor  great souled ham died  honest and faithful to the last  giving his life for the man who had injured him .  and so  too  james steerforth met his fate on the very spot where he had done such evil  for his corpse was found among the fragments of the old peggotty house boat  which the tempest tore down that night .   after this david went abroad and stayed three years .  he lived in switzerland  and wrote novels that were printed in london and made him famous there .   and now  alone  he had time to think of all that made up his past .  he thought of dora  his child wife  and sorrowed for her  and of the peggottys and little em ly  but most of all he found himself thinking of agnes  who  throughout his youth  had seemed like his guiding star .   so one day he went back to england and told her  and asked her if she would marry him .  and with her sweet face on his breast she whispered that she had loved him all her life .   david and agnes lived long and happily  and their children had three guardians who loved them all  miss betsy trotwood  david s old nurse  peggotty  and white haired mr .  dick  who taught them to fly kites and thought them the greatest children in the world .  tommy traddles  when he had become a famous lawyer  often visited them  and once  too  mr .  peggotty  older  but still hale and strong  came back from australia to tell them how he had prospered and grown rich  and had always his little em ly beside him  and how mr .  micawber had ceased to owe everybody money and had become a magistrate  and many other things .   david had one thing  however  to tell mr .  peggotty  and that was of a certain prisoner he had seen in one of the country s greatest prisons  sentenced for life for an attempt to rob the bank of england  and whose name was  uriah heep .              great expectations  published            scene  london  neighboring towns and the country  time       to       characters  philip pirrip an orphan boy

herbert pocket his son .  pip s comrade in london             great expectations  i  pip and the convict  in england  in a lonely village not far from london  there once lived a little orphan boy named philip pirrip  whom everybody called  for short   pip .   his parents had died when he was a baby  and he had been brought up by his older sister  the wife of joe gargery  a blacksmith whose forge looked out across wide marshes and a river that flowed through them .   joe  the blacksmith  was a fair faced man with flaxen whiskers and very bright blue eyes .  he was a mild  honest  good natured  sweet tempered  easy going  foolish  dear fellow  tender hearted and kind to little pip and yet a hercules for strength .   very different  indeed  was  mrs .  joe   as everybody spoke of her .  she was tall and bony and had black hair  a red skin and a continual habit of scolding .  she may have loved pip in her way  but that way was a very cross grained one .  she treated joe  the big blacksmith  and pip  the little boy  just alike  and they were both equally in dread of her .  this made them quite like partners .  whenever pip came into the house he used to look at joe s fingers  if joe crossed them that was a sign mrs .  joe was cross and that pip was to look out for himself .   joe had an uncle named pumblechook  who was a corn seller in the next town and a pompous old hypocrite .  he had a way of standing pip before him  rumpling up his hair and asking him hard questions out of the multiplication table .  and whenever he told a story of any one who was ungrateful or wicked he would glower at pip in a way that made him feel very uncomfortable .   another who came as often and was almost as dismal to see was wopsle  the clerk  who read the lesson in church every sunday .  he had an idea he would make a great actor and used to recite whole pages from shakespeare when he could find any one to listen to him .   worst of all was a workman of joe s named orlick .  he was a loose limbed  swarthy  slouching giant with a hangdog look .  he used to tell pip that the devil lived in a certain corner of the forge  and once in every seven years the fire had to be rekindled with a live boy .  orlick at heart disliked everybody  especially harmless little pip  and often quarreled with mrs .  joe .   beside the blacksmith  the only one who understood pip was a little girl named biddy  about his own age and an orphan  too .  she liked him and used to help him with his lessons at school .   but in spite of joe and biddy  pip was sometimes so lonely and miserable that he would steal off alone to the village churchyard  where his father and mother lay buried  to cry .   one afternoon  it was the day before christmas  pip was more wretched than usual  and was sitting crying among the graves when suddenly a rough voice spoke behind him .   keep still  you little imp .   it said   or i ll cut your throat .   with the words a man rose up from behind a tombstone and seized him .   he was a fearful looking man  dressed all in gray clothes  with a great iron band riveted on his leg .  his shoes were torn  he had no hat and wore a ragged  dirty handkerchief tied around his head .  he was soaked with water  caked with mud and limped and shivered as he walked .  he set pip on a tombstone and tilted him so far back that the church steeple seemed to turn a somersault  growling at him in a terrible voice .   pip had never been so frightened in his life .  with a trembling voice he begged his captor to spare him .  the man asked him his name and where he lived  and told him he would let him go on one condition .  he had to promise to come next morning at daybreak to a certain spot in the marshes and to bring a file and something to eat .  and the man said if pip did not do so  or if he told any one what he was going to do  he would catch him again and cut out his heart and eat it .   this terrible threat frightened poor little pip more than ever .  his voice shook so that he could hardly promise  and when the man set him down he ran home as fast as his legs would carry him .   the evening was a miserable one .  pip thought he would save his own supper for the man in case he should not be able to get into his sister s pantry  so instead of eating his bread and butter he slipped it down his trouser leg .   before long a great gun began to boom  and he asked joe what it was .  the blacksmith told him that in the river across the marshes were anchored some big hulks of ships  like wicked noah s arks  where convicts were kept prisoners  and that the gun was a signal that some of these convicts had escaped .  then pip knew the man he had promised to help was a criminal  perhaps a murderer  who had got away and was hiding from the soldiers .   all night he did not sleep .  he hated to steal the food  but he felt certain he would be killed if he did not .  so at dawn he slipped down stairs  got a file from the forge  unlocked the pantry  took some bread and cheese and a pork pie that uncle pumblechook had sent for christmas dinner  and ran out through the foggy morning to the marshes .   he had not got quite there when he came on a man in gray  sitting on the ground  with an iron fetter on his leg .  pip thought he was the one he was in search of  but as soon as the other turned his face he saw by a bruise on the cheek that he was not .  this second man in gray  as soon as he saw him  sprang to his feet and ran away .   greatly wondering  pip went on  and at the right spot he found the man who had frightened him in the graveyard .  he seemed now to be almost starved  for he snatched the food and ate it like a hungry dog .  he asked pip if he had seen any one else on his way there  and pip told him of the other man in gray who also wore an iron on his leg .   he asked pip to describe the other  and when pip told of the bruised cheek  the man he was feeding flew into a rage .  he began to curse  and  seizing the file  set to filing like mad at his fetter .  pip could see that he hated the other convict  and was sorry he had escaped  but he had fulfilled his promise now  so he turned and ran home again  and the last thing he heard was the rasp of the file as the man worked madly at the iron .   very guilty pip felt all that christmas morning .  he went to church with joe  and after service uncle pumblechook  wopsle  the clerk  and other company came to dinner .  he could not enjoy the good things to eat  for he knew now his sister must discover that the pork pie was gone .  just as she went to get it he got up from the table to run away  but as he opened the door he ran plump into a file of soldiers .   he was sure at first they had come to arrest him for helping the convict  but he was soon relieved  when the officer at their head explained that they were on their way to search the marshes for the escaped men and wanted the blacksmith to mend a broken handcuff .   in the flurry of their arrival the pork pie was forgotten  while joe mended the handcuff in the forge .  when the soldiers left  the blacksmith set pip on his broad shoulder  and he and wopsle went striding with them to see the result of the hunt .   it was sunset as the party entered the marshes  and the searchers opened out into a wide line .  on a sudden all stopped  for a confused shouting had come from the distance .  they ran toward it  cocking their guns  and wopsle and joe  with pip on his shoulder  followed .  the shouts became plainer and plainer .  all at once they came to a ditch and in it the convict pip had fed and the one with the bruised cheek were struggling fiercely together .   the soldiers seized and handcuffed them both  the man with the bruised cheek pale and trembling  the other boasting that he had dragged the man he hated back to captivity  even though it cost him his own freedom .   while the soldiers were preparing to take their prisoners back  pip s convict saw the boy standing there with joe .  pip hoped he would not think he had had anything to do with bringing the soldiers .  he was pretty sure the man did not  because he presently told the officer  in every one s hearing  that the night before he had broken into a house where a blacksmith lived  near a church  and had stolen a pork pie .  joe heard this and so pip knew that he himself would be clear of any blame .   the convicts were taken back to their cells and joe and pip went home to tell the company of their adventure .  but neither then nor ever afterward did pip find courage to tell joe the part he had played  for pip loved the honest blacksmith and did not want him to think him worse than he really was .   time went on and pip grew older and bigger  and though he never forgot the adventure of the churchyard  yet the memory of it grew dimmer .  in the next few years only one thing happened to recall it to him .   one evening mrs .  joe sent pip to the village inn  the three jolly bargemen  with a message .  pip found joe there  sitting with a stranger  a secret looking man  who held his head on one side and kept one eye perpetually shut as if he were taking aim with a gun .  this man  when he heard pip s name  looked at him with a curious wink  and when no one but pip was looking he took out of his pocket  to stir his drink with  the very file pip had stolen from joe s forge .   pip knew that minute that the man was a friend of the convict he had aided .  when pip left the inn the stranger called him back and gave him a shilling wrapped up in a piece of paper .   when he got home mrs .  joe  who took the prize away from him  discovered that the piece of paper was in reality two bank notes  and both joe and she wondered at it .  the blacksmith tried next day to find the stranger to restore the money  but he had left the inn .   so it always remained a mystery  to all but pip of course  who knew in his heart that the convict had remembered his aid and had taken this means of repaying him .   ii  the queer miss havisham  one day  when pip was considerably older  uncle pumblechook brought mrs .  joe word that a miss havisham  a lady who lived in his own town  had heard of pip  and wanted him to come to her house to see her .   miss havisham was a very queer lady  indeed  so queer that some said she was crazy .  but she was rich  and for this reason mrs .  joe scrubbed pip and dressed him in his best clothes and sent him off in care of uncle pumblechook  who took him as far as miss havisham s gate .   miss havisham  when a beautiful young lady  had been engaged to marry a man named compeyson  whom she loved very much .  he was a wicked  heartless villain  however  and had made her love him only that he might persuade her to give him great sums of money .   the marriage day finally was fixed  her wedding clothes were bought  the house was decorated for the ceremony  the bride cake was put on the table in the dining room and the guests arrived .  but compeyson  the bridegroom  did not come .   miss havisham was dressing for the wedding when she received a cruel note from him telling her he did not intend to marry her .  she had put on her white wedding gown and her lace veil and one of her satin slippers  the other lay on the dressing table .  it was exactly twenty minutes to nine o clock when she read the note .   she fainted and afterward lay for a long time ill .  when she recovered she laid the whole place waste .  she never afterward let the light of day into the old mansion .  the shutters were closed  candles were kept always lighted  and all the clocks in the house were stopped at exactly twenty minutes to nine o clock .  not a thing in any room was changed .  the bride cake rotted on the table  the decorations faded on the walls  and day after day miss havisham sat in the dressing room clad in her wedding gown and veil  with one slipper on  the dead flowers on her table and the trunks for her wedding journey scattered about half packed .  in time she became shrunken and old and the white satin and lace became faded yellow  but she never varied this habit of life .   soon after her love disappointment she had written to her lawyer in london  who was named jaggers  asking him to find a baby girl for her to adopt as her own .  now mr .  jaggers had just defended in court a man named abel magwitch  the tool of compeyson  who had broken miss havisham s heart .  compeyson had tempted magwitch into passing some stolen money and they had both been arrested .  at the trial compeyson  sneak and liar as he was .   threw all the blame on his comrade  who was duller and less sharp than he  and as a consequence  while compeyson got a light sentence  magwitch  though really the more innocent of the two  had been sent to the prison ship for a term of many years .  these two men  by the way  were the pair who escaped from the hulks into the marshes .  magwitch was pip s convict of the churchyard  and compeyson was the one he had dragged back to capture .  this magwitch  at the time of his arrest  had a baby daughter  who had fallen into mr .  jaggers s care  and in answer to miss havisham s request the lawyer had sent the little girl to her  telling her nothing whatever of the child s parentage .   miss havisham had named the child estella  and  seeing she would be a very beautiful woman  had determined to bring her up heartless and cold  to ruin as many men s lives as possible  so as to avenge her own wrongs and broken heart .   so estella had grown up in the dismal house  miss havisham s only companion .  day by day she became more lovely  and even while she was still a little girl  the same age as pip  miss havisham was impatient to begin teaching her her lesson .   this was the reason pip had received his invitation to miss havisham s house .  though he had no idea of it  he was intended only as practice for little estella  who under miss havisham s teaching was growing up very fond of admiration and very cold hearted  too .   pip thought miss havisham the strangest lady he had ever seen  and the yellow satin  the candle lighted rooms  and the stopped clocks seemed to him very odd .  but estella was so pretty that from the first moment he saw her he had no eyes for anything else .  even though she called him clumsy and common  and seemed to delight in hurting his feelings  pip fell in love with her and could not help himself .  miss havisham made them play together and told him to come again the next week .   pip went home in very bad humor on account of all the hurts which estella had given his feelings .  uncle pumblechook  being very curious to know all about his trip  bullied and questioned him so  beginning as usual with the multiplication table  that pip  perfectly frantic  told him the most impossible tales .  he said miss havisham was in a black coach inside the house  and had cake and wine handed to her through the coach window on a golden plate  and that he and she played with flags and swords  while four dogs fought for veal cutlets out of a silver basket .   but when uncle pumblechook told joe these wonders  pip was remorseful .  he went to the forge and confessed to joe that he had been telling a falsehood  and promised he would never do so again .   this visit was the first of many that pip paid to the gloomy house whose shutters were always closed .  next time he went he was taken into the chamber where the decayed wedding cake sat on the table .  the room was full of relatives of miss havisham  for it was her birthday   who spent their lives flattering and cringing  hoping when she died she would leave them some money .   after a time pip went into the garden and there he met another relative in the person of a pale young gentleman about his own age  but larger  who promptly lowered his head  butted pip in the stomach and invited him to fight .  pip was so sure nobody else s head belonged in the pit of his stomach that he obliged him at once  and as practice at the forge had made him tough  it was not many minutes before the pale young gentleman was lying on his back  looking up at him out of an exceedingly black eye and with a bleeding countenance .   when estella let pip out of the gate that day he guessed that she had seen the encounter and that somehow it had pleased her  for she gave him her cheek to kiss .  yet he knew that at heart she thought him only a coarse  common boy  fit to be treated rudely and insolently .  this thought rankled more and more in him .  he made up his mind to study and learn  and he got faithful little biddy to teach him all she knew .   pip saw no more of the pale young gentleman  though for almost a year he went to miss havisham s every other day .  each time he saw estella and found himself loving her more and more .  but she was always unkind  and often  when she had been ruder than usual  he saw that miss havisham seemed to take delight in his mortification .  sometimes she would fondle estella s hand  and he would hear her say    that s right .  break their hearts  my pride and hope .  break their hearts and have no mercy .    one day miss havisham sent for joe  the blacksmith  and gave him a bag of money  telling him that he was not to send pip to her any more  but that he should put him to work and teach him the trade of blacksmithing .  so uncle pumblechook took pip to town that very day and had him bound to joe as an apprentice .   this was just what pip had once looked forward to with pleasure .  but now it made him wretched .  through estella s jeers he had come to feel that blacksmithing was common and low .  as he helped joe to blow the forge fire  he thought constantly of estella s looks of disdain  yet in spite of all he longed to see her .   on his first half holiday he went to call on miss havisham .  but there was no estella .  miss havisham told him she had sent her abroad to be educated as a lady  and when the miserable tears sprang to pip s eyes  she laughed .   when he got home he confided in biddy .  he told her how he loved estella  and that he wanted more than anything else in the world to be a gentleman .  meanwhile he began to study hard in any spare time he had  and biddy helped him all she could .   pip might have fallen in love with biddy if he had not had estella always in his mind .  orlick  joe s helper  indeed  thought he had done so  and it made him hate pip more than ever  for he was in love with biddy himself .  he grew morose and quarrelsome and spoke so roughly to mrs .  joe one day that she was not satisfied till the blacksmith took off his singed apron and knocked the surly orlick flat in the coal dust .   this was a costly revenge for mrs .  joe  however .  orlick never forgave it  and a few nights after  when no one was at home but herself he crept in behind her in the kitchen and struck her a terrible blow on the head with a piece of iron .   hours afterward joe found her lying senseless  and though she lived to recover a part of her senses  she never scolded or spoke again .  she grew well enough at last to sit all day in her chair  but was so helpless that biddy came to the house to be her nurse .  it chanced that a prisoner had escaped from the prison boats on the night mrs .  joe was injured  and he was thought to be the one who attacked her .  but pip suspected orlick all the while .   so time went on .  once a year  on his birthday  pip went to see miss havisham  but he never saw estella there .  and nothing else of particular importance occurred till he had been for four years joe s apprentice .   one night  as pip sat with joe before the fire in the three jolly bargemen  they were called out by a gentleman whom pip remembered to have seen once at miss havisham s .  it was  as a matter of fact  mr .  jaggers  her lawyer  who had sent estella to her as a baby .   the lawyer walked home with them  for he had a wonderful piece of news to relate .  it was that an unknown benefactor  whose name he was not permitted to tell  intended when he died to leave pip a fortune .  in the meantime he wished to have him educated to become a gentleman  and as a lad of great expectations  and  the better to accomplish this  he wished pip to go without delay to london .   this great good fortune seemed so marvelous that pip could hardly believe it .  he had never imagined miss havisham intended to befriend him  but now he guessed at once that she was this unknown benefactor .  and he jumped next to another conclusion even more splendid  that she intended him sometime to marry estella and was even then educating her for him .  pip went home almost in a dream  too full of his own prospects to see how sad biddy was beneath her gladness for him  or how sorrowful the good news made joe .   that night estella s face came before him  more full of disdain than ever .  as he thought of her and of the fine gentleman he was to be  the humble kitchen and forge seemed to grow commoner and meaner by contrast .  he began to become a little spoiled and disdainful himself .   the news soon spread about  and every one who had looked down upon pip now gave him smiles and flattery .  uncle pumblechook wept on his shoulder and  instead of telling him  as usual  that he was sure to come to a bad end  reminded him that he had always been his favorite .   mr .  jaggers had given pip a generous amount of money to buy new clothes with  and these tended to make him more spoiled than ever .  he began to feel condescending toward biddy  and found himself wondering whether  when he should be rich and educated  joe s manners would not make him blush if they should meet .   and even when the day came for him to bid them good by and he climbed aboard the coach for london  he thought more of these things and his own good luck than of the home he was parting from for ever  or of the true and loving hearts he was leaving behind him .   this was an ignoble beginning for pip and one that he came afterward to remember with shame .   iii  pip discovers his benefactor  mr .  jaggers  the lawyer in whose care pip found himself in london  was sharp and secret  and was so feared by criminals that they would never go near his house  though he never locked his door  even at night .   he had a crusty clerk named wemmick  as secret as he and a deal queerer .  wemmick lived in a little wooden cottage that he called the castle  and which had its top cut out like a fort .  it had a ditch all around it with a plank drawbridge .  when he got home from the office in the evening he pulled up the drawbridge and ran up a flag on a flagstaff planted there .  and exactly at nine every night he fired off a brass cannon that he kept in a latticework fortress beside it .   wemmick was the first one pip met in london  and the clerk took him to the rooms where mr .  jaggers had arranged for pip to live  with the son of a gentleman who was to be his teacher .  this gentleman was a mr .  pocket  a relative  as pip discovered  of miss havisham  which fact made him all the more certain that she was his unknown friend .  mr .  pocket s son was named herbert  and the minute he and pip first saw each other they burst out laughing .  for herbert was none other than the pale young gentleman who  years before in miss havisham s garden  pip had last seen looking up at him out of a very black eye .   they were excellent friends from that hour .  they occupied the rooms together when they were in london  and pip also had a room of his own at mr .  pocket s house in the country .   mr .  pocket was a helpless scholarly man who depended on mrs .  pocket to manage everything  and she depended on the servants .  there were seven little pockets of various ages tumbling about the house  and mrs .  pocket s only idea of management seemed to be to send them all to bed when any one of them was troublesome .  at such times mr .  pocket would groan  put his hands in his hair  lift himself several inches out of his chair and then let himself down again .   in spite of his oddities  however  mr .  pocket was an excellent teacher  and pip in some ways made progress .  but his great expectations taught him bad habits .  he found it so easy to spend money that he soon overstepped the allowance mr .  jaggers had told him was his  and not only had got into debt himself  but had led herbert  who was far poorer  into debt also .   joe came to see him only once  and then pip s spoiled eyes overlooked his true  rugged manliness and noted more clearly his awkward manners and halting speech .  joe was quick to see this difference in the pip he had known and he did not stay long  only long enough to leave a message from miss havisham  that estella had returned from abroad and would be glad to see him if he came .   pip lost no time in making this visit  and started the very next day .  the old house looked just the same  but a new servant opened the gate for him  it was orlick  as low browed and sullen and surly as ever  and pip saw at the first glance that his old hatred was still smoldering .   miss havisham was in her room  dressed in the same worn wedding dress  and beside her  with diamonds on her neck and hair  sat estella .  pip hardly knew her  she had grown so beautiful .  but she was proud and wilful as of old  and though he felt the old love growing stronger every moment  he felt no nearer to her than in those past wretched days of his boyhood .  before he left  miss havisham asked him eagerly if estella was not more lovely  and  as he sat by her alone  she drew his head close to her lips and whispered fiercely    love her  love her  love her .  if she favors you  love her .  if she tears your heart to pieces  love her  love her  love her .    though this visit took him so near the old forge  pip did not go to see joe and biddy .  indeed  only once in the months that followed did he see them  when he went to attend the funeral of mrs .  joe .   after that he had no need to leave the city to see estella  for miss havisham soon sent her to live in london .  from there she required her to write letters weekly  telling how many men she had fascinated and made wretched .  pip saw her constantly and tortured himself with the growing belief that miss havisham s training  the purpose of which he had begun to guess  was really succeeding in crushing her heart  and was leaving her with no power to love any one .   thus  between hope and despair  pip became of age .  mr .  jaggers now told him that a certain large sum was his to spend each year .  he was deeply in debt and a great part of his first year s portion went to pay his creditors .  but with the remainder he did a good and unselfish deed  he bought secretly a share in a good business for herbert  so that his comrade became a partner in it .   a great blow was now to fall upon pip without warning  something that changed the whole course of his life .  one rainy night  when herbert was away from london  as he sat alone in their rooms  a heavy step stumbled up the stair and a man entered .  he was coarse and rough looking and tanned with exposure  with a furrowed bald head  tufted at the sides with gray hair .   there was something strangely familiar to pip in his face  but at first he did not recognize him .  seeing this  the stranger threw down his hat  twisted a handkerchief around his head  took a file from his pocket and walked across the room with a curious shivering gait that brought back to pip s mind  like a lightning flash  the scene in the churchyard so many years ago  when he had sat perched on a tombstone looking in terror at that same man s face .  and he knew all at once that the man was the escaped convict of that day .   it was a strange tale the new comer told then  one that pip s heart sank to hear .  miss havisham had not been his benefactor after all .  the one whose money had educated him  had set him there in london to live the life of a gentleman  the one to whom he was indebted for every penny he owned  was abel magwitch  a criminal  the convict for whom he had once stolen food years before .   pip sank into a chair trembling as magwitch  in a hoarse voice  told his story .  he told how the man compeyson had led him into crime and then deserted him .  how he had hated the other so fiercely that after they both had escaped from the prison hulks he had dragged compeyson back to imprisonment even at the loss of his own liberty .  how for that attempt to escape he had been sentenced to transportation for life  and had been sent to botany bay in australia  where in time he became in a measure free  though forbidden under penalty of death to return to england .  how he had never forgotten the little pip who had tried to aid him  and how he had sworn that he would repay him many times over .  how he had taken to sheep raising and prospered  and became a rich man .  how he had written to mr .  jaggers  the lawyer who had defended him  and paid him to find pip and educate him .  and how at last he had dared even the death penalty to come to england to see how he fared .   his voice shook as he told how he had slaved through all the years  looking forward only to this moment when he should come back to see the little pip whom he had made into a gentleman .   poor pip .  it was an end to all his dreams of miss havisham and of estella .  he shrank from magwitch  horrified at the bare thought of what he owed to him .  he forced himself to utter some trembling words and set food before the convict  watching him as he ate like a ravenous old dog .  his heart was like lead  all his plans knocked askew .  even while he pitied the old man  he shrank from him as if from a wild beast  with all his childish dread increased a hundredfold .   at length pip put magwitch in herbert s room to sleep  but all that night he himself lay tossing and sleepless  staring into the darkness and listening to the rain outside .   iv  pip comes to himself  the days that followed were one long agony to pip .  when herbert returned he told him the whole story .  herbert was shocked and surprised  but he was true to his friendship and together they planned what to do .   it was clear to pip that he could not spend any more of magwitch s money  indeed  recoiling from him as he did  he would gladly have repaid every penny if it had been possible .  to make the matter worse  it seemed that magwitch had brought a great deal of money with him and was determined that pip should move into a fashionable house  buy fast horses  keep servants and live most expensively .   pip hesitated to tell magwitch his decision  however  for what the convict now planned showed how much he had thought of him and loved him in his rough way during all his years in australia .   meanwhile he and herbert kept magwitch hidden as much as possible  and gave out that the old man was pip s uncle  on a visit from the country .   unluckily  however  magwitch s presence in london had been seen .  he had been recognized in the street and followed to pip s rooms .  and the man who saw him was his bitterest enemy  compeyson  the breaker of miss havisham s heart  who had first made magwitch a criminal  and whom the convict so hated .  compeyson had served out his term  and was now free .  he saw his chance to pay the old grudge with magwitch s life .  in order  however  to make sure of his capture he decided to entice pip away and bring the police upon magwitch when he would have no one to warn him .   meanwhile  unconscious of this plot  pip made a last visit to miss havisham .  he felt now that he was again poor and without prospects  and with small hope of winning estella .   but finding her there  in miss havisham s presence  he told her how dearly he had always loved her since the first day they had met .  she seemed moved by his distress  but her heart had not yet awakened .  she told him that she was about to marry one whom he knew for a coarse  brutal man  in every way beneath her .  and then pip knew for certain that miss havisham s bitter teaching had borne its fruit at last  and that estella was to marry this man  not because she loved him  but merely as a final stab to all the other worthier ones .   in spite of her years of self torture and revengeful thoughts  miss havisham had still a spark of real pity .  as pip reminded her of the wreck she had made of him  through estella  and through allowing him falsely to believe her his benefactor  his agony struck her with remorse .  she put her hand to her heart as he ended  and as he left them he saw through his own tears her hand still pressed to her side and her faded face ghastly in the candlelight .   sick with despair  pip went back to london  to learn from wemmick  mr .  jaggers s friendly clerk  that the rooms were being watched  and that he and herbert  who in the absence of pip had confided in him  had removed magwitch to another lodging  a room overlooking the river  from which it would be easier  if worst came to worst  to get him on a ship and so out of the country .   to do this it was necessary to wait for a favorable chance .  so pip  providing for magwitch s comfort meantime  bought a boat  and he and herbert rowed daily up and down the river  so that when the time came to row the convict to some sea going ship they would know the turns of the stream .   pip soon learned that compeyson was their spy .  wopsle  who in pip s boyhood had been the clerk in the village church  had turned actor  he made  to be sure  a very poor one .    and was now playing in london .  in the theater one night he recognized in the audience the pale faced convict whom he had once  with joe  the blacksmith  and little pip  seen dragged back to capture by his more powerful fellow .  pip had long ago learned from magwitch that this man was compeyson  and when wopsle said he had seen him sitting directly back of pip at the play  the latter realized that they had this bitter enemy to reckon with  and that magwitch was in terrible danger .   only once was this time of waiting interrupted  and that was by a letter from miss havisham begging pip to come to see her .  he went  and she told him she realized now too late how wicked her plans had been  and begged him with tears to try to forgive her .  pip  sore as his own heart was  forgave her freely  and he was glad ever afterward that he had done so  for that same evening  while he was standing near her  her yellowed wedding veil  sweeping too near the hearth  caught fire and in an instant her whole dress burst into flame .  pip worked desperately to put out the fire  but she was so frightfully burned that it was plain she could not live long .  his own hands and arms were painfully injured  so that he returned to london with one arm  for the time being  almost useless .   compeyson  meanwhile  made friends with orlick  and between them they wrote pip a letter  decoying him to a lonely hut in the marshes .  when he came there orlick threw a noose over his head  tied him to the wall and would have killed him with a great stone hammer but for herbert  who broke down the door and rushed in just in time to put orlick to flight and to save pip s life .  herbert had picked up the letter pip had thrown down  read it  seen in it something suspicious  and had followed from london .   pip saw now there was no time to lose if he would save magwitch .  they made haste to london  and when night fell  took the convict in the rowboat and rowing a few miles down the river  waited to board a steamer bound for germany .   what happened next happened very speedily .  they were about to board the steamer when a boat containing compeyson and some police shot out from the bank  compeyson calling on magwitch to surrender .  the two boats clashed together  and the steamer  unable to stop  ran them both down .  at the same moment magwitch seized compeyson and they went into the water together .   when pip came to himself the steamer had gone  his own boat had sunk and he and herbert had been dragged aboard the other .  a few minutes later magwitch was picked up  badly injured in the chest  and was handcuffed .  but they did not find compeyson  the other had killed him in that fearful struggle under water .   that night magwitch was lodged in jail .  before many days he was tried for returning to england and was sentenced to be hanged .  but it was clear before the trial ended that his injury would never let him live to suffer this penalty .   and now  as he saw the convict lying day by day drawing nearer to death  calling him  dear boy  and watching for his face  all the loathing and repugnance pip had felt for him vanished away .  he had sat beside the sick man at his trial  now he sat beside his cot each day in his cell  holding his hand .  he knew there could be no longer any possibility of his taking the fortune the convict would leave  for  being condemned to death  all magwitch s property went to the crown .  but he did not tell this to magwitch .   one thing he discovered  however  which he told the dying man .  this concerned estella .  as the film of death came over the convict s face pip said    dear magwitch  you had a child once  whom you loved and lost .  she is living still .  she is a lady and very beautiful .  and i love her .   and hearing this last glad news  magwitch died .   before this happened herbert had left england for egypt where his business took him .  left alone  after the strain  pip fell sick of a fever and in the midst of this found himself arrested for debt .   that was the last he knew for many weeks .  when he came to himself he found joe  the true hearted blacksmith  nursing him .  he had paid pip s debts .  miss havisham was dead and orlick had been sent to jail for robbing uncle pumblechook s house .   joe s faithfulness smote pip with a sense of his own ingratitude .  after a visit to the old forge with joe and biddy  now joe s wife  pip felt how true were the old friends .  he buried for ever the past false pride and folly and knew himself for all his trials a nobler man .   he sailed to egypt  where he became a clerk in herbert s business house  and finally a partner  and it was eleven years before he was in england again .   then  one day he went down to the old ruined house where miss havisham had lived .   he entered the weed grown garden  and there on a bench  a sad  beautiful widow  sat estella .  her husband had treated her brutally till he died  and she had learned through suffering to know that she had a heart and had thrown away the one thing that could have made her happy  pip s love .   when pip and she left the old house that day it was hand in hand  never to part again .              life and adventures of nicholas nickleby

and invalid  madeline his daughter  gride a miser             nicholas nickleby  i  nicholas at dotheboys hall  once on a time  in england  there were two brothers named nickleby who had grown up to be very different men .  ralph was a rich and miserly money lender who gained his wealth by persecuting the poor of london  a thin  cold hearted  crafty man with a cruel smile .  the other  who lived in the country  was generous but poor  so that when he died he left his wife and two children  nicholas and kate  with hardly a penny to keep them from starving .   in their trouble the mother decided to go and try to obtain help from her husband s brother  ralph nickleby .   ralph was angry when he learned they had come to london  for he loved his gold better than anything else in the world .  he lived in golden square  a very rich part of the city  in a great fine house  all alone save for one servant  and he kept only one clerk .   this clerk  who was named noggs  had one glass eye and long  bony fingers which he had an uncomfortable habit of cracking together when he spoke to any one .  he had once been rich  but he had given his money to ralph nickleby to invest for him  and the money lender had ended by getting it all  so that the poor man at last had to become the other s clerk .  when he first saw nicholas and kate  noggs was sorry enough for them  because he knew it would be little help they would get from their stingy uncle .   nicholas was proud mettled  and his very bearing angered the money lender .  he called him a young puppy  and a pauper besides  to which nicholas replied with heat and spirit .  his mother succeeded in smoothing things over for the time  and though ralph nickleby from that moment hated the boy  he grudgingly promised her to get him a situation as a teacher .   the school the miser selected was one called dotheboys hall  a long  cold looking  tumble down building  one story high  in a dreary part of the country .  it belonged to a man named squeers  a burly  ruffianly hypocrite  who pretended to the world to be a kind  fatherly master  but in fact treated his pupils with such cruelty that almost the only ones ever sent there were poor little orphans  whose guardians were glad to get rid of them .  squeers had an oily  wrinkled face and flat shiny hair  brushed straight up from his forehead .  his sleeves were too long and his trousers too short  and he carried a leather whip about in his pocket to punish the boys with .   mrs .  squeers was a fat woman  who wore a soiled dressing gown  kept her hair in curl papers all day  and always had a yellow handkerchief tied around her neck .  she was as cruel as her husband .  they had one daughter and a son named wackford .  the latter they kept as plump as could be  so he would serve as an advertisement of the school  the rest of the boys  however  were pale and thin .   no wonder  for they got almost nothing to eat .  for dinner all they had was a bowl of thin porridge with a wedge of bread for a spoon .  when they had eaten the porridge they ate the spoon .  once a week they were forced to swallow a dreadful mixture of brimstone and sulphur  because this dose took away their appetites so that they ate less for several days afterward .  they were made to sleep five in a bed  and were poorly clothed  for whenever a new boy came mrs .  squeers took his clothes away from him for wackford  and made the new boy wear any old ones she could find .  they were allowed to write only letters telling how happy they were there  and when letters came for any of them  mrs .  squeers opened them first and took for herself any money that they contained .   there was no attempt at teaching at dotheboys hall .  the books were dirty and torn and the classes were scarecrows .  all the boys were made to work hard at chores about the place  and were flogged almost every day  so that their lives were miserable .  what squeers wanted was the money their guardians paid him for keeping them .   this was the kind of school for which nicholas found himself hired at very low wages as a teacher .   he knew nothing about it yet  however  and thought himself lucky and his uncle kind as he bade his mother and kate good by and took the coach for dotheboys hall .  noggs  ralph nickleby s one eyed clerk  was there to see him off  and put a letter into his hand as he started .  nicholas was so sad at leaving the two he loved best in the world  that he put it into his pocket and for the time forgot all about it .   on his arrival next day nicholas s heart sank into his boots .  when he saw the boys gathered in the barn  which served for a school room  he was ready to die with shame and disgust to think he was to be a teacher in such a place .   but he had no money to take him back to london  and because he did not want to make his mother and kate unhappy  he wrote them as cheerfully as he could .  the letter noggs had given him he remembered at last to read .  it told him the writer feared his uncle had deceived him in regard to the school  and said if nicholas needed a friend at any time  he would find one in him  noggs .  these kind words from the old clerk brought tears to nicholas s eyes .   of all the wretched boys there nicholas pitied most a poor fellow named smike  whom squeers had made a drudge .  he was tall and lanky and wore a little boy s suit  too short in the arms and legs .  he had been placed there when a child  and the man who had brought him had disappeared and left no money to pay for his keep .  squeers s cruelties had made the unfortunate lad simple minded .  besides this he was lame .  nicholas helped smike all he could  and the poor fellow was so grateful that he followed the other about like a slave .   squeers s daughter was named fanny .  she had red hair  which she wore in five exact rows on the top of her head .  she thought herself very beautiful and at once fell in love with nicholas .  as he could not help showing that he did not like her  miss fanny grew spiteful and in revenge began to persecute smike  knowing nicholas liked him .   smike stood this as long as he could  but at last one day he ran away .  squeers was furious .  he took one chaise and mrs .  squeers another  and off they went in different directions to find him .  nicholas was miserable  for he knew smike would be caught .  sure enough  on the second day mrs .  squeers returned  dragging her victim .  when squeers arrived smike was taken from the cellar  where he had been locked up  and brought before the assembled boys for a public thrashing .   at the rain of brutal blows which began nicholas s blood boiled .  he stepped forward  crying  stop .    for answer squeers struck him savagely in the face with his heavy ruler .  then nicholas threw away his self control  and leaping on the bully  to the unmeasured delight of the boys  took the ruler from him and thrashed him until he cried for mercy .  all the while mrs .  squeers was trying to drag the victor away by his coat tails  while the spiteful miss fanny threw inkstands at his head .   when his arm was tired nicholas gave squeers a final blow  which knocked him senseless into a corner  coolly went to his room  packed his few belongings in a bundle and left dotheboys hall for ever .   he was two hundred and fifty miles from london and had very little money .  snow was falling and for that night he took refuge in an empty barn .  in the morning he awoke  startled  to see a figure sitting by him .  it was smike  who had followed him .   the poor creature fell on his knees .   let me go with you .   he cried .   i want no clothes and i can beg my food .  i will be your faithful servant .  only let me go with you .     and so you shall .   said nicholas .   come .   he rose  took up his bundle  gave his hand to smike and so they set out toward london together .   ii  nicholas becomes an actor  meanwhile ralph nickleby  the money lender  had given kate and her mother leave to live in a rickety  unoccupied house which he owned .  it was a dingy building on an old wharf  but noggs  the clerk  himself cleaned and furnished one of its rooms so that it was fairly comfortable .  when they were settled ralph took kate to a dressmaker s  where he got her a situation  hoping thus they would not call on him for any money .   the dressmaker called herself madame mantalini .  her real name was muntle  but she thought the other sounded better .  her husband was a plump  lazy man with huge side whiskers  who spent most of the time curling them and betting on horse races .  he gambled away all the money madame mantalini made  but he pretended to be terribly fond of her  and was always calling her his  little fairy  and his  heart s delight   so that the silly woman always forgave him .  he tried to kiss kate the first day  which made her detest him .   at madame mantalini s kate had to stand up all day trying on dresses for rich ladies  who were often rude to her .  and because they preferred to be waited on by the pretty  rosy cheeked girl  miss knag  the ugly forewoman  hated the child  and did all she could to make her unhappy .   kate s mother used to wait each evening on the street corner outside  and they would walk home together .  they had no idea what trouble nicholas was having all this time  because he had written them such cheerful letters  and whenever they felt sadder than usual they would comfort themselves by thinking how well he was getting along and what a fine position he had .   if they could have seen him when he finally got to london after running away from dotheboys hall  they would hardly have known him .  both he and poor smike were hungry and muddy and tired .  remembering noggs s kind letter  nicholas went first to the little garret where the clerk lived  and through him he found a cheap room on the roof of the building  which he rented for himself and smike .  then he started out to find his mother and kate .   he would have hastened if he had guessed what was happening or how badly kate had been treated by ralph nickleby .   the evening before  as it happened  kate had been invited to dinner at her uncle s fine house  and there she had met two dissipated young men  lord frederick verisopht and sir mulberry hawk  the latter of whom had looked at her and talked to her so rudely that she had indignantly left the table and gone home .  she had not slept a wink that night  and the next morning  to make her and her mother more wretched still  ralph nickleby called with a letter he had just received from fanny squeers  declaring that nicholas was a thief and a scoundrel  that he had tried to murder her father and all his family  and had run off with one of the pupils of dotheboys hall .   to be sure  neither of them believed it  but if made them very unhappy .  and then  just as ralph was reading them the last line of the letter  in came nicholas .  you may be sure he comforted them and told them it was a lie .  he told ralph what he thought of him also in stern language  which made his uncle angrier than ever .   then  seeing that his presence was making things worse  and realizing in what poverty his dear ones were  and that they were so wholly dependent on ralph for help  nicholas came to a very brave determination .  he told them that  as he could not help them himself  he would go away from them until his fortune bettered .  so  bidding them good by  and telling his uncle he should keep watch over them and that if any harm came to them he would hold him accountable  nicholas went sadly back to his garret room and to smike .   he tried hard for some days to find a situation  but failed  and he would not take money from noggs  who was so poor himself .  so at last  with smike  he set out on foot for portsmouth  which was a seaport  thinking there they might find a chance to go as sailors in some ship .   at an inn on the way  however  nicholas met a man who caused him to change all his plans .  this man was a mr .  vincent crummles .  when nicholas first saw him in the inn he was teaching his two sons to make believe fight with swords .  they were practising for a play  for mr .  crummles was manager of a theater in portsmouth  and he proposed that nicholas join the company and become an actor .   there seemed nothing else to do  so nicholas agreed  and next day they went to the portsmouth theater  where he was introduced to all the company .   it was a very curious mixture .  there was mrs .  crummles  who took the tickets  and little miss crummles  whom the bills called  the infant phenomenon   and who was always said to be only ten years old .  there was a slim young man with weak eyes who played the lover  and a fat man with a turned up nose who played the funny countryman  and a shabby old man whose breath smelled of gin  who took the part of the good old banker with the gray side whiskers .  then there was the lady who acted the r  le of the wicked adventuress  and all the others .   nicholas had to begin by writing a play which had parts for all of them  and it proved a great success .  smike  whom he drilled himself  took the part of a hungry boy  and he looked so starved  naturally  from his life with squeers  that he was tremendously applauded .   one of the other actors was so jealous at the play s success that he sent nicholas a challenge to a duel  but nicholas walked on to the stage before the whole company and knocked the actor down  and after that he had no trouble and was a great favorite .   he might have stayed a long time at mr .  crummles s theater  for he had earned quite a good deal of money  but one day he got a letter from noggs  the clerk  telling him that all was not well with his mother and kate .  and without waiting an hour  nicholas resigned from the company and  with smike  set out again for london .   iii  nicholas comes to kate s rescue  noggs was right .  ralph nickleby had never ceased to persecute kate and her mother .  in fact  when he had invited kate to the dinner at which she had been insulted  it was for his own evil purpose .  he had done so  hoping she might impress the foolish young lord verisopht  whose money he was hoping to get  and whom he wished to attract to his house .   the young nobleman  as ralph had intended  fell in love with kate s sweet face at once  and found out from her uncle where she lived .   she had lost her first position at the dressmaker s  for mr .  mantalini had thrown away his wife s money on race horses until the sheriff had seized the business   and she was acting now as companion to a mrs .  wititterly  a pale  languid lady who considered herself a very fashionable person indeed  and was always suffering from imaginary ailments .  lord frederick and sir mulberry hawk came often to the house  pretending to flatter mrs .  wititterly  but really to see kate  who heartily disliked them both .   mrs .  wititterly at last came to realize that the two men at whose attentions she had felt so flattered really cared only for her young companion  and  being vain and jealous  she tormented and scolded kate till the poor girl s life was a burden .   at length  feeling that she could endure it no longer  kate went to ralph and begged him with tears to help her find another situation  but the money lender refused to aid her .  noggs  the clerk  was sorry for her  but could do nothing except write to nicholas  and this was the reason for the letter that had brought nicholas post haste back to london .   just what kind of persecution kate had had to bear he learned by accident almost as soon as he got there .   as he sat in a coffee house he suddenly heard the words   little kate nickleby   spoken by a man behind him .  he turned and listened .   four men whom he had never seen were drinking toasts to her  and nicholas grew hot with rage at the coarse words they used .  sitting there  scarcely able to contain himself  he heard the whole story of his uncle ralph s plot  he heard his sister s sufferings derided  her goodness jeered at  her beauty made the subject of insolent jests .  one of the four men  of course  was lord frederick verisopht  and the coarsest and the most vulgar of them all  as may be guessed  was sir mulberry hawk .   white with anger  nicholas confronted the party and  throwing down his card on the table  declared that the lady in question was his sister  and demanded of hawk his name .  hawk refused to answer .  nicholas called him a liar and a coward  and seating himself  swore the other should not leave his sight before he knew who he was .   when hawk attempted to enter his carriage nicholas sprang on to the step .  the other  in a fury  struck him with the whip  and nicholas  wrenching it from him  with one blow laid open hawk s cheek .  the horse  frightened at the struggle  started off at a terrific speed  and nicholas felt himself hurled to the ground .   as he rose  he saw the runaway horse  whirling across the pavement  upset the carriage with a crash of breaking glass .  nicholas had no doubt that the man it held had been frightfully hurt if not killed .  he felt faint from his own fall  and it was with difficulty that he reached noggs s garret  whither  before the adventure in the coffee room  he had sent smike to announce his coming .   his first step now was to write a letter to ralph  telling him he at last knew what a villain he was  and that he and his mother and sister cast him off for ever  with shame that they had ever asked his aid .  the next day nicholas took kate from the wititterly house and his mother from her poor lodging  and rented them rooms in another part of the city .  then he started out to find some employment for himself .   for a long time he was unsuccessful  but one day  and a very lucky day nicholas thought it ever afterward  he met on the street a round faced  jolly looking old gentleman  with whom he fell into conversation  and before long  almost without knowing it  he had told him all his troubles .   this old gentleman was named cheeryble  and the firm to which he belonged was cheeryble brothers .  he and his twin brother had come to london  barefoot  when they were boys  and though they had grown very rich  they had never forgotten what it was to be poor and wretched .  the old gentleman asked nicholas to come with him to his office and there they met the other mr .  cheeryble .   nicholas could scarcely tell the two brothers apart  for they were like as two peas .  they were precisely the same size  wore clothes just alike and laughed in the same key .  each had even lost exactly the same number of teeth .  they were loved by everybody  for they went through life doing good wherever they could .  they both liked nicholas at once  and the upshot was that they gave him a position in their counting room and rented a pleasant cottage near by for his mother and kate .   so there nicholas took up work and they were all happy and comfortable  very different from ralph nickleby  the money lender  in his fine house  with only the memory of his own wickedness for company .   iv  what happened to everybody  ralph nickleby s hatred had been growing day by day .  as he could not harm nicholas now  he tried to hurt him through smike .  he sent for squeers  and the latter  finding smike alone one day on the street  seized him  put him in a coach and started to take him back to dotheboys hall .  but luckily his victim escaped and got back to london .   then ralph formed a wicked plot to get smike surely into their hands .  he hired a man to claim that he was the boy s father  who had first taken him to squeers s school .  squeers  too  swore to this lying tale .  but the cheeryble brothers suspected the story  and when ralph saw they were determined to help nicholas protect smike  he was afraid to go any further with the plan .  so he smothered his rage for the time being  and meanwhile a most important thing happened to nicholas  he fell in love .   it came about in this way  there was a man named bray  who had been arrested for debt and was allowed to live only in a certain street under the guardianship of the jailer  for this was the law in england then .  he was slowly dying of heart disease  and all the money he had to live on was what his only daughter  a lovely girl named madeline  earned by painting and selling pictures .   the cheeryble brothers had learned of their poverty   for it was hard for madeline to find purchasers   and they sent nicholas to buy some of the pictures .  he was to pretend to be a dealer  so that madeline would not suspect it was done for charity .  nicholas went more than once and soon had fallen very much in love with madeline bray .   he was not the only one who admired her  however .  there was an old man named gride  almost as stingy as ralph nickleby  who had discovered by accident that a large sum of money really belonged to madeline  which she and her father knew nothing about  and he thought it would be a fine thing to marry her and thus get this fortune into his hands .  now  ralph nickleby was one of the men who was keeping bray a prisoner  and so gride went to him and asked him to help him marry madeline .  if bray made his daughter marry the old miser he himself was to be set free .  ralph  for his share  was to get some of the money the old man gride knew should be madeline s .   it was a pretty plan and it pleased ralph  for he cared little what lives he ruined so long as he got money by it .  so he agreed  and soon convinced bray  who  ill as he was  was utterly selfish  that it would be a fine thing for madeline to marry the hideous old gride and so free her father .  at length  in despair  because she thought it her duty to her heartless father  madeline consented to do so .   nicholas might never have known of this till after the wedding  but luckily noggs  the clerk  had overheard the old skinflint make the bargain with ralph  and when one day nicholas confessed that he was in love with madeline  the good hearted clerk told him all that he had found out .   nicholas was in great trouble  for he loved madeline very dearly .  he went to her and begged her not to marry gride  but she thought it her duty .  he went to gride  too  but the hideous old miser only sneered at him .   at last  in desperation  he told kate  and the brother and sister went together to bray s house .  they reached it just as the wedding was about to begin .   ralph nickleby  who was there  foamed with fury to find the nephew he so hated again stepping between him and his evil designs .  he tried to bar them out  but nicholas forced him back .   they would doubtless have come to blows  but at that moment there came from another room the sound of a fall  and a scream from madeline .  the excitement had proved too much for her father .  his heart had failed and he had fallen dead on the floor .  thus providence interfered to bring the wicked scheme of the marriage to naught .   vainly did gride bemoan the loss of the money he had hoped to gain  and vainly did ralph nickleby  with curses  try to prevent .  nicholas thrust them both aside  lifted the unconscious madeline as easily as if she had been a baby  placed her with kate in a coach and  daring ralph to follow  jumped up beside the coachman and bade him drive away .   he took her to his own home  where his mother and kate cared for her tenderly till she had recovered from the shock and was her own lovely self again .   the penalty that he had so long deserved was soon to overtake ralph nickleby .  he lost much of his wealth through a failure  and close on the heels of this misfortune came the news that the infamous plot he had formed against smike had been discovered and that squeers  his accomplice  had been arrested .   the most terrible blow came last .  a man whom ralph had long ago ruined and had caused to be transported for a crime  confessed that he had been the one who  many years before  had left smike at dotheboys hall  and he confessed also that smike was really ralph nickleby s own son by a secret marriage .  ralph had not known this  because the man  in revenge  had falsely told him the child was dead .   the knowledge that  in smike  he had been persecuting his own son was the crowning blow for cruel ralph nickleby .  when he heard this he locked himself up alone in his great house and never was seen alive again .  his body was found in the garret where he had hanged himself to a rafter .   poor smike  however  did not live to sorrow over the villainy of his father .  the exposure and hardships of his years at squeers s school had broken his health .  he had for long been gradually growing weaker  and at last one day he died peacefully  with nicholas s arms around him .   every one of whose villainy this story tells came to a bad end .  sir mulberry hawk quarreled with young lord verisopht and shot him dead in the duel that followed .  for this he himself had to fly to a foreign country  where he finally died miserably in jail .  gride  the miser who had plotted to marry madeline  met almost as terrible a fate as ralph s .  his house was broken into by burglars one night and he was found murdered in his bed .   squeers was declared guilty and transported for seven years .  when the news reached dotheboys hall such a cheer arose as had never been heard there .  it came on the weekly  treacle day   and the boys ducked young wackford in the soup kettle and made mrs .  squeers swallow a big dose of her own brimstone .  then  big and little  they all ran away  just as nicholas and smike had done .   kate married a nephew of the cheeryble brothers  and nicholas  of course  married madeline  and in time became a partner in the firm .  all of them lived near by  and their little children played together under the watchful care of old noggs  the one eyed clerk  who loved them all alike .   the children laid flowers every day on poor smike s grave  and often their eyes filled with tears as they spoke low and softly of the dead cousin they had never known .                dealings with the firm of dombey and son wholesale  retail  and for exportation  published

little paul  in london there was once a business house known as dombey and son .  it had borne that name for generations  though at the time this story begins mr .  dombey  the head of the house  had no son .  he was a merchant  hard  cold and selfish  who thought the world was made only for his firm to trade in .  he had one little daughter  florence  but never since her birth had he loved or petted her because of his disappointment that she was not a boy .   when at last a son was born to him it wakened something at the bottom of his cold and heavy heart that he had never known before .  he scarcely grieved for his wife  who died when the baby was born  but gave all his thought to the child .  he named him paul  and began at once to long for the time when he should become old enough to be a real member of the firm in which all his own interest centered  dombey and son .  he hired the best nurse he could find  and  when he was not at his office  would sit and watch the baby paul hour after hour  laying plans for his future .  so selfishly was the father s soul wrapped up in this that he scarcely ever noticed poor  lonely little florence  whose warm heart was starving for affection .   little paul s nurse was very fond of him  and of his sister  too  but she had children of her own also  and one day  instead of walking up and down with florence and the baby near the dombey house  she took the children to another part of the city to visit her own home .   this was a wrong thing to do  and resulted in a very unhappy adventure for florence .  on their way home a mad bull broke away from his keepers and charged through the crowded street .  there was great screaming and confusion and people ran in every direction  florence among the rest .  she ran for a long way  and when she stopped  her nurse was nowhere to be seen .  terrified to find herself lost in the great city  she began to cry .   the next thing she knew  an ugly old woman  with red rimmed eyes and a mouth that mumbled all the while  grasped her by the wrist and dragged her through the shabby doorway of a dirty house into a back room heaped with rags .    i want that pretty frock   said she   and that little bonnet and your petticoat .  come .  take them off .    florence  dreadfully frightened  obeyed .  the old woman took away her shoes  too  and made her put on some filthy ragged clothing from the heaps on the floor .  then she let her go  first making her promise she would not ask any one to show her the way home .   the poor child could think of nothing else but to find her father s office at dombey and son s  and for two hours she walked  asking the way of everybody she met .  she might not have found it at all  but at a wharf where she wandered  there happened to be a young clerk of dombey and son s  and the minute he was pointed out to her she felt such trust in his bright and open face that she caught his hand and sobbed out all her story .   this lad s name was walter gay .  he lived with his uncle  honest old solomon gills  a maker of ship s instruments  who kept a little shop with the wooden figure of a midshipman set outside .  very few customers ever came into the shop  and  indeed  hardly any one else  for old sol  as the neighbors called him  had only one intimate friend .   this friend was a retired seaman named captain cuttle  who always dressed in blue  as if he were a bird and those were his feathers .  he had a hook instead of a hand attached to his right wrist  a shirt collar so large that it looked like a small sail  and wherever he went he carried in his left hand a thick stick that was covered all over  like his nose  with knobs .   captain cuttle used to talk on land just as if he were at sea .  he would say  steady .   and  belay  there .   and called old sol  shipmate   as though the little shop  in which he spent his evenings  was a ship .  he had a deep  rumbling voice  in which he would sing lovely peg  the only song he knew  and which he never but once got through to the last line .  but in spite of his queer ways and talk  captain cuttle had the softest  kindest heart in the world .  he thought old solomon gills the greatest man alive  and was as fond as possible of  wal r   as he called the nephew .  and  indeed  walter was a handsome boy  and as good as he was handsome .   walter soothed florence s tears and took her  ragged clothes and all  straight home to solomon gills s shop  where his uncle gave her a warm supper  while walter ran to the dombey house with the news that she was found  and to bring back a dress for her to wear .   so florence s adventure turned out very well in one way  since through it she first met walter gay  but it turned out badly in another way  for mr .  dombey was angry that any one should have seen a daughter of his in such a plight  and  unjustly enough  treasured this anger against walter .  florence  however  never forgot her rescuer after that day  and as for walter  he fell quite in love with her .   florence loved her little brother very dearly  but paul  in the constant companionship of his father  grew up without boys or play .  his face was old and wistful  and he had an old fashioned way of sitting  brooding in his little arm chair beside his father  looking into the fire .  he used to ask strange  wise questions  and the only time he seemed childlike at all was when he was with florence .  he was never strong and well  like her  but he grew tired easily  and used to say that his bones ached .   mr .  dombey at length grew anxious about paul s health and sent him with florence to brighton  a town on the sea coast  to the house of a mrs .  pipchin  a stooped old lady with a mottled face  a hooked nose and a hard gray eye .   mrs .  pipchin took little children to board  and her idea of  managing  them was to give them everything they didn t like and nothing they did like .  she lived in a gloomy house  so windy that it always sounded to any one in it like a great shell which one had to hold to his ear whether he liked it or not .  the children there stayed most of the time in a bare room they called  the dungeon   with a big ragged fireplace in it .  they  had only bread and butter and rice to eat  while mrs .  pipchin had tea and mutton chops and buttered toast and other nice things .   little paul s father did not know what a dreary place this was for a child  or doubtless he would not have sent him there .  mr .  dombey knew so little about children that it seemed as if he had never been a child himself .  paul was not happy  except when he was out on the beach with florence  who used to draw him in a little carriage and sing to him and tell him stories .  once a week mr .  dombey came to brighton and then she and little paul would go to his hotel to take tea with him .   paul seemed to find a curious fascination in mrs .  pipchin .  he would sit by the hour before the fire looking steadily at her  where she sat with her old black cat beside her  till his gaze quite disturbed her .  he did not care to play with other children  only with florence  whom he called  floy .   often  as they sat together on the beach  he would ask her what it was the sea was always saying  and would rise up on his couch to listen to something he seemed to hear  far  far away .   walter gay  meanwhile  in london  was working away and thinking often of florence .  he was greatly worried about his uncle solomon  for the business of the old instrument maker was in a bad way  and old sol himself was melancholy .   one day walter came home from his work at dombey and son s to find that an officer had taken possession of the shop and all that was in it for debt .  his old uncle sol was sobbing like a child  and not knowing what else to do  he went post haste for captain cuttle .   he found the captain with his hat on  peeling potatoes with a knife screwed into the wooden socket in his wrist instead of the hook .  when he told him what had happened  captain cuttle jumped up  put all the money he had  his silver watch  some spoons and a pair of sugar tongs into his pocket and went back at once with him to the shop .   but the debt  he found  was far too big to be thus paid  and captain cuttle advised walter to go to mr .  dombey and ask him to help them  or else everything in the shop would have to be sold  and that would kill old solomon gills .   it was saturday  and mr .  dombey had gone to see little paul  so walter and captain cuttle took the next coach for brighton .   they found him with the children at breakfast  and walter  discouraged by his cold look  faltered lamely through his story  while captain cuttle laid on the table the money  the watch  the spoons and the sugar tongs  offering them to help pay the debt .  mr .  dombey was astonished at his strange appearance and indignant at being annoyed by such an errand  so that florence  seeing his mood and walter s trouble  began to sob .  little paul  however  stood looking from walter to his father so intently and wisely that the latter  telling him he was one day to be a part of dombey and son  asked him if he would like to loan walter the money .   paul joyfully said yes  and mr .  dombey  telling walter that it was to be considered a loan from the boy  gave him a note which would at once release his uncle from his difficulty .  so walter and captain cuttle went gladly back to london .   soon after this  when paul was six years old  his father thought he should be studying  so he put him in a school next door to mrs .  pipchin s .   the master was doctor blimber  a portly gentleman in knee breeches  with a bald head and a double chin .  he made all the boys there study much too hard  even those only six years old had to learn greek and history .  poor little paul did the best he could  but such difficult tasks made him giddy and dull .  it was only the saturdays he enjoyed  these he spent with florence on the seashore or in mrs .  pipchin s bare room .   paul would have broken down sooner under doctor blimber s system but that florence bought all the books he studied and studied them herself  so as to help him on saturdays .  people called him  old fashioned   and that troubled him a great deal  but he tried to love even the old watch dog at doctor blimber s  and before the holidays came everybody in the school liked him .   but before the term ended little paul fell sick .  he seemed not to be ill of any particular disease  but only weak  so weak he had to sit propped up with pillows at the entertainment doctor blimber gave on the final evening .  after that everything was hazy until he found himself  somehow  at home in bed  with florence beside him .   he lay there day after day  watching and dreaming .  he dreamed often of a swift  silent river that flowed on and on  and he wanted to stop it with his hands .    why will it never stop  floy .   he would ask her .   it is bearing me away  i think .    there were many shadowy figures that came and went .  one came often and sat long  but never spoke .  one day he saw it was his father  and he called out to it   don t be so sorry for me  dear papa .  indeed  i am quite happy .    once he roused himself  and there were many about the bed  florence  his father  his old nurse and walter gay  and he called each by name and waved his hand to them .   florence took him in her arms and he heard the swift river flowing .    how fast it runs  floy .  it is taking me with it .  there is a shore before me now .  who is standing on the bank .    he put his hands together behind her neck  as he had been used to do at his prayers .    mama is like you  floy   he said .   i know her by her face .  the light about the head is shining upon me as i go .    so little paul died .   ii  how florence lost her father  it was a sad  sad house for many days after that  and florence  in her loneliness  often thought her heart would break .  her father she scarcely ever saw  for he sat alone in his room .  every night she would steal down the dark hall to his door  and lay her head against the panels  hungering for a little love  but he thought only of his dead son  and gave no sign of tenderness to her .   one of doctor blimber s pupils begged for and brought her diogenes  the old watch dog which little paul had petted at the school and this dog was all she had to love .  she had not seen walter gay since the death of her brother  though he himself thought of her very often .   walter s prospects  thanks to an enemy he had made without knowing it  had changed since then .  this enemy was carker  the manager at dombey and son s .   carker was a thin man  with the whitest  most regular teeth  which he continually showed in an unpleasant smile .  there was something cat like about him  the more he disliked a person the wider was his smile .  carker had a brother whom he hated  and walter unconsciously earned his enmity by liking and being kind to this brother .   mr .  dombey was not fond of walter either  the less so because florence liked him  and disliking florence  he disliked all for whom she cared .  so  between mr .  dombey and carker  walter was ordered to go  on business for the firm  on a long voyage to the west indies .   walter was not deceived .  he knew he was not sent there for his own good  but in order not to worry his uncle he and captain cuttle pretended that it was a splendid opportunity .  so old solomon gills tried not to sorrow for his going .   florence heard of the voyage  and  the night before walter sailed  in she came to the little shop where walter had brought her years before when she had been lost .  she kissed old sol and called walter her brother  and said she would never forget him .   and so walter  when next day he sailed away  waving his hand to his uncle and captain cuttle  went with even more of love in his heart for florence than he had had .   after his going florence was lonelier than before .  she was all alone  save for the dog diogenes and her books and music .  her father was much away  and in the evenings she could go into his room and nestle in his easy chair without fear of repulse .  she kept the room in order and a fresh nosegay on the table  and never left it without leaving on his deserted desk a kiss and a tear .  the purpose of her life  she determined  should be to try continually to let her father know how much she loved him .   but months passed and she had no chance .  her father  in fact  seldom came near the house .  he was away visiting in the country with a major bagstock  who had struck up an acquaintance with him because of mr .  dombey s wealth .   bagstock  who had a habit of referring to himself as  j .  b .   or  joey b .    or almost anything but his full name  was as fat as a dancing bear  with a purple  apoplectic looking face  and a laugh like a horse s cough .  he was a glutton  and stuffed himself so at meals that he did little but choke and wheeze through the latter half of them .  he was a great flatterer  however  and he flattered so well that mr .  dombey  blind from his own pride  thought him a very proper person indeed .  and even though everybody laughed at the major  mr .  dombey always found him most agreeable company .   there was an old lady at the town they visited who was poor  but very fond of fashion and rich people .  she had no heart  and was silly enough  even though she was seventy years old  to wear rouge on her cheeks and dress like a girl of seventeen .  she had a widowed daughter  edith granger  a proud  lovely woman  who despised the life her mother led  but  in spite of this  was weak enough to be influenced by her .   major bagstock introduced mr .  dombey to the mother  and the latter soon made up her mind that her daughter should marry him .  the major  who wanted mr .  dombey to marry so he himself could profit by the dinners and entertainments that would follow  helped this affair on all he could  and edith  though at times she hated herself for the false part she was playing  agreed to it .   to tell the truth  mr .  dombey was so full of his own conceit that he never stopped to wonder if edith could really love him .  she was beautiful and as cold and haughty as he was himself  and that was all he considered .  so major bagstock and the old lady were soon chuckling and wheezing together with delight at the success of their plan  and before long edith had promised to marry florence s father .   poor florence .  she had other griefs of her own by this time .  carker  of dombey and son  with the false smile and the white teeth  came several times to see her  asking if she had messages to send to her father  each time seeming purposely to wound her by recalling her father s dislike .  she tried to like the smooth  oily manager  but there was something in his face she could not but distrust .   to add to her trouble  the ship by which walter gay had sailed for the west indies had not yet arrived there .  it was long overdue  and in the absence of news people began to fear it had been lost .  she went to the little shop where the wooden midshipman stood  but found old solomon gills and captain cuttle in as great anxiety .   old sol  indeed  was soon in such distress for fear walter had been drowned  that he felt he could bear the suspense no longer .  one day  soon after florence s visit  he disappeared from london  leaving a letter for captain cuttle .   this letter said he had gone to the west indies to search for walter  and asked the captain to care for the little shop and keep it open  so that it could be a home for his nephew if he should ever appear .  as for himself  old sol said if he did not return within a year he would be dead  and the captain should take the shop for his own .   the disappearance of his old friend was a great blow to bluff captain cuttle  but  determined to do his part  he left his own lodgings and took up his place at the sign of the wooden midshipman to wait for news either of walter or of old solomon gills .   florence knew nothing about this  for the captain had not the heart to tell her .  and  for her own part  she had much to think of in the approaching marriage of her father  in preparation for which the house was full of painters and paper hangers  making it over for the bride .   the first time florence saw edith was when one day she entered the parlor to find her father there with a strange  beautiful lady beside him .  mr .  dombey told her the lady would soon be her mama  and edith  touched by the child s sweet face  bent down and kissed her so tenderly that florence  so starved for affection  began at that moment to love her  and to hope through edith s love finally to win the love of her father .   the wedding was a very grand one  and many people were at the church to see it .  even captain cuttle watched it from the gallery  and carker s smile  as he looked on  showed more of his white teeth than ever .  the only thing that marred florence s happiness and hope on this day was the knowledge that walter had not been heard from and the fear that he might never return .   but in spite of her brave hope  after her father and edith came back from their wedding journey and the life of parties and dinners began  florence was soon disheartened .  in the first flush of confidence she opened all her soul to edith and begged her to teach her to win her father s liking .  but edith  knowing  as florence did not know  how she had sold herself in this rich marriage and that she had no particle of love in her heart for her husband  told her sadly that she could not help her .  this puzzled florence greatly  for she loved edith and knew that edith loved her in return .   in fact  it was florence s trust and innocence that made edith s conscience torture her the more .  in florence s pure presence she felt more and more unworthy  and the knowledge that her husband s hardness of heart was crushing the child s life and happiness made her hate him .   florence saw  before many months passed  that her father and edith did not live in love and contentment .  indeed  how could they .  she had married for ambition  he for pride  and neither loved nor would yield to the other .  they had not the same friends or acquaintances .  hers were people of fashion  his were men of business .  at the dinners they gave  mr .  dombey did not think edith treated his friends politely enough .  he began to reprove her more and more often  and when she paid no heed he finally chid her openly and sternly in the presence of carker  who brought his smile and gleaming teeth often to the house   knowing this action would most wound edith s pride .  and at length he took the management of the house out of her hands and hired as housekeeper mrs .  pipchin  the old ogre of brighton  at whose house florence and little paul had once lived .   the worst of it all was that the more mr .  dombey grew to dislike his wife the more he saw she loved florence  and this made him detest the poor child more than ever .  he imagined  in his cruel selfishness  that as florence had come between him and the love of little paul  so she was now coming between him and his wife .  finally he sent carker to edith  telling her she must no longer sit or talk with florence  that they must see each other only in his presence .   florence s cup of bitterness was now almost full  for she knew nothing of this command  and  when she saw that edith avoided her  sorrowed in secret .  she was quite alone again now  save for diogenes .  neither major bagstock  her father s flatterer  nor carker  with his cat like smile  could she see without a shudder  and all the while her heart was aching for her father s love .   mr .  dombey s insults were heaped more and more upon the defenseless edith  till at last  made desperate by his pride and cruelty  she prepared a terrible revenge .  on the morning of the anniversary of their wedding day mr .  dombey was startled by the news that edith had run away with the false hearted carker .   on that terrible morning  when the proud old man sat stunned in his room  florence  yielding to her first impulse of grief and pity for him  ran to him to comfort him .  but when she would have thrown her arms around his neck he lifted his arm and struck her so that she tottered .   and as he did so he bade her follow edith  since they had always been in league .   in that blow florence felt at last his cruelty  neglect and hatred trampling down any feeling of compassion he may once have had for her .  she saw she had no longer a father she could love  and  wringing her hands  with her head bent to hide her agony of tears  ran out of the house that could no more be her home  into the heartless street .   iii  how florence reached a refuge  for a long time she ran without purpose  weeping  and not knowing where to go .  but at last she thought of the day  so many years before  when she had been lost and when walter gay had found her .  he had taken her then to the shop of his uncle  old solomon gills .  there  she thought  she might at least find shelter .   when she got to the sign of the wooden midshipman she had just enough strength to knock and push open the door  and then  at sight of captain cuttle s honest face  all her strength left her  and she fainted on the threshold .   captain cuttle was cooking his breakfast .  he knew her at once  even though she had grown to be a young lady .  he lifted her and laid her on the sofa  calling her his  lady lass   and bathed her face in cold water till she opened her eyes and knew him .  she told him all her story  and he comforted her  and told her the shop should be her home just as long as she would stay in it .  when she had eaten some toast and drunk some tea he made her lie down in the little upper room and sleep till she woke refreshed at evening .   when she came down the stair she found captain cuttle cooking dinner .  he seemed to her then to have some great  joyful and mysterious secret .  all through the evening and until she went to bed he would persist in drawing the conversation around to walter  which brought the tears again and again to her eyes .   then he would rumble out   wal r s drown ded  ain t he  pretty .   and nod his head and look very wise .   indeed  captain cuttle did have a wonderful secret .  while florence had been sleeping he had received a great piece of news  walter  whom every one had believed drowned  had escaped death alone of all on the wrecked vessel .  he had clung to a spar when the ship went down  and had been picked up by a vessel going in another direction  so he had had no way of sending back news of his safety .  the ship that had rescued him had at last brought him back to london  and it would not be long now before he would appear at the shop .   you may guess captain cuttle s heart was full of thankfulness .  but  not knowing much about such matters  he had an idea that the good news must be broken very gently to florence .  so at last he commenced to tell her a story about a shipwreck in which only one was saved  and then she began to suspect the truth and her heart beat joyfully .  just as he finished the story the door opened .  there was walter himself  alive and well  and with a cry of joy she sprang to his arms .   there was much to talk of that night in the little shop .  with her face on captain cuttle s shoulder  florence told him how and why she had left her home .  and walter  as he took her hand and kissed it  knew that she was a homeless  wandering fugitive  but richer to him thus than in all the wealth and pride of her former station  that had once made her seem so far off from him .  very soon after that he told florence that he loved her  not as a brother  but as something even dearer  and she promised to be his wife .   on the evening before their wedding day one more surprise came to them .  they were all gathered in the shop when the outer door opened .  captain cuttle suddenly hit the table a terrific blow with his hook  shouted  sol gills  ahoy .   and tumbled into the arms of a man in an old  weather beaten coat .  it was old solomon gills indeed  returned from his long search  and now  to see walter there  weeping with joy .   in another moment walter and florence were both in his arms  too  and everybody was laughing and crying and talking together .  old sol had been half way around the world in his search for walter  but had finally heard of his safety and started home  knowing he would go there also .  it was a very joyous evening  that last evening of florence s girl life .   the next morning walter and florence paid an early visit to the grave of little paul .  she bade it a long good by  for walter had become an officer of a ship and she was to make the coming voyage with her husband .  then they went to the church  where they were married  and a few days later they sailed away to china  with captain cuttle s big watch and sugar tongs and teaspoons  that he had once offered to mr .  dombey  for wedding presents   content in each other s love .   often  indeed  in this happy honeymoon florence remembered the father who had spurned her .  but walter s love had taken away the bitterness of that thought .  she tried to love her father now rather as she loved the memory of little paul  not as a cruel  cold  living man  but as some one who had once lived and who might once have loved her .   iv  how florence found her father at last  mr .  dombey  alone in the silent house  had made no search for florence .  his pride bade him hide all traces of his grief and rage from the world .  he had only one thought  to find where carker had fled with his wife  to follow and to kill him .  he hired detectives and at last discovered that carker had gone to a certain city in france .  and to that place he followed him .   now edith  desperate as she had been  had not really been so wicked as mr .  dombey supposed her .  she had deserted him  but she had not run away with carker .  in all the trouble between herself and mr .  dombey  carker  the smooth  smiling hypocrite .   had labored to make matters worse .  he had lied to mr .  dombey about his wife and taunted her with her position  and done everything in his power to make them hate each other more bitterly .  at last  when he saw edith could bear it no longer  he had begged her to run away with him  and when she refused  he had threatened her in many cowardly ways .  but edith hated him as much as she disliked her husband  and had not the least idea of running away with him .  she had pretended to carker that she would do so  and had led her husband and everybody else to think she had done so  but this was only to wound her husband s pride  and to punish him for all his tortures .  carker had followed her to france  but  once there  he had found the tables turned .  edith laughed at him and scorned him  and sent him from her  baffled and furious .   carker was thus caught in his own trap .  he had lost his own position and reputation  and had gained nothing for all his evil plots .  and besides this  he was a fugitive  and mr .  dombey  the man he had wronged  was on his track .   when he learned his enemy had followed him to france  carker  raging  but cowardly  fled back to england  and back to england edith s revengeful husband followed him day and night .  the wicked manager knew no more peace or rest .  he traveled into the country  seeking some lonely village in which to hide  but he could not shake off that grim pursuer .   they met at last face to face one day on a railroad platform when neither was expecting to see the other .   in the surprise of the meeting  carker s foot slipped  he stepped backward  directly in the path of the engine that was roaring up the track .  it caught him  and tossed him  and tore him limb from limb  and its iron wheels crushed and ground him to pieces .   and that was the end of carker  of the white teeth and false smile  and mr .  dombey went back to london  still proud and alone  still cold and forbidding .   but his conscience at last had begun to cry out against him  and to deafen its voice he plunged more and more recklessly into business  spending money too lavishly  and taking risks of which  in other days  he would not have thought .   the months went by and little by little the old firm of dombey and son became more entangled .  soon there were whispers that the business was in difficulty  but mr .  dombey did not hear them .  one morning the crash came .  a bank closed and then suddenly the word went around that the old firm had failed .   it was too true .  the proud  hard hearted merchant  who had driven his daughter from him  was ruined and a beggar .  his rich friends  whom he had treated so haughtily  shrugged their shoulders and sneered .  even major bagstock at his club grew purple in the face with chuckling .   the servants were all sent away  most of the furniture was sold at a public sale  and the old man  who had once been so proud and held his gray head so high  still sat on hour after hour in the echoing house  so empty now that even the rats would not live in it .  what was he thinking .   at last  in his agony  his sorrow  his remorse  his despair  he remembered florence .  he saw again her trembling lips  her lonely face longing for love  the terrible hopeless change that came over it when his own cruel arm struck her on that final day when she had stood before him .   his pride at last had fallen .  he knew now himself what it was to be rejected and deserted .  he thought how the daughter he had disliked  of them all  had never changed in her love for him .  and by his own act he had lost her for ever .  his son  his wife  his fortune  all had gone  and now at last in his wretchedness he knew that florence would always have been true to him if he had only let her .   days passed  but he never left the house  every night he wandered through the empty rooms like a ghost .  he grew to be a haggard  wasted likeness of himself .  and one day the thought came to him that it would be better if he  too  were dead  even if it be by his own hand .  this thought clung to him .  he could not shake it off .   one day he took a pistol from his dressing table and sat hugging it to his breast .  at length he rose and stood in front of a mirror with the weapon in his hand .   but suddenly he heard a cry  a piercing  loving  rapturous cry  and he saw at his feet  clasping his knees  with her face lifted to his  florence  his long lost daughter .    papa  dearest papa .   she cried   i have come back to you .  i never can be happy more without you .    he tottered to a chair  feeling her draw his arms around her neck .  he felt her wet cheek laid against his own .  he heard her soft voice telling him that now she herself had a little child  a baby boy born at sea  whom she and walter had named paul .    dear papa   she said   you will come home with me .  we will teach our little child to love and honor you  and we will tell him when he can understand that you had a son of that name once  and that he died and that you were sorry  but that he is gone to heaven  where we all hope to see him sometime .  kiss me  papa  as a promise that you will be reconciled .  never let us be parted any more .    his hard heart had been melting while she spoke .  as she clung closer to him he kissed her  and she heard him mutter   oh  god forgive me  for i need it very much .    she drew him to his feet  and walking with a feeble gait he went with her .  with her eyes upon his face and his arm about her  she led him to the coach waiting at the door and carried him away .   mr .  dombey was very ill for a long time .  when he recovered he was no longer his old self  but a gentle  loving  white haired old man .  walter did not go to sea again  but found a position of great trust and confidence in london  and in their home the old man felt growing stronger and stronger his new found love for the daughter whom till now he had never really known .   florence never saw edith again but once .  then the latter came back to bid her farewell for ever before she went to live in italy .  in these years edith had seen her own pride and grieved for her fault .  there were tears in her stern  dark eyes when florence asked if she would send some message to mr .  dombey .    tell him   she answered   that if in his own present he can find a reason to think less bitterly of me  i asked him to do so .  i will try to forgive him his share of blame  let him try to forgive me mine .    time went happily by in the home of walter and florence .  they often visited the little shop where stood the wooden midshipman  now in a new suit of paint .  the sign above the door had become  gills and cuttle   for old sol and the captain had gone into partnership  and the firm had grown rich through the successes of some of solomon gills s old investments which had finally turned out well .   walter was beloved by everybody who knew him  and in time refounded the old firm of dombey and son .   often in the summer  on the sea beach  old mr .  dombey might have been seen wandering with florence s little children .  the oldest was little paul  and he thought of him sometimes almost as of the other little paul who died .   but most of all the old gentleman loved the little girl .  he could not bear to see her sit apart or with a cloud on her face .  he often stole away to look at her in her sleep  and was fondest and most loving to her when there was no one by .   the child used to say then sometimes    dear grandpa  why do you cry when you kiss me .    but he would only answer   little florence .  little florence .   and smooth away the curls that shaded her earnest eyes .              the posthumous papers of the pickwick club

winkle is involved in a duel  once upon a time  in london  there was a club called  the pickwick club .   mr .  samuel pickwick  its founder and chairman  was a benevolent  simple hearted old gentleman of some wealth  with a taste for science .  he delighted to invent the most profound theories  to explain the most ordinary happenings and to write long papers to be read before the club .  he had a large bald head  and eyes that twinkled behind round spectacles  and he made a speech with one hand under his coat tails and the other waving in the air .   his fellow members looked upon mr .  pickwick as a very great man  and when he proposed that he and three others form a  corresponding society   which should travel about and forward to the club accounts of their adventures  the idea was at once adopted .   the three that mr .  pickwick chose were named tupman  snodgrass and winkle .  tupman was middle aged with a double chin and was so fat that for years he had not seen the watch chain that crossed his silk waistcoat .  but he had a youthful  romantic disposition  and a great liking for the fair sex .  snodgrass  who had no parents  was a ward of mr .  pickwick s and imagined himself a poet .  winkle was a young man whose father had sent him to london to learn life  he wore a green shooting coat and his great ambition was to be considered a sportsman  though at heart he was afraid of either a horse or a gun .  with these three companions mr .  pickwick prepared to set out in search of adventures .   next morning as he drove in a cab to the inn where all were to take the coach  mr .  pickwick began to chat with the driver .  the cabman amused himself by telling the most impossible things  all of which mr .  pickwick believed .  when he said his horse was forty two years old and that he often kept him out three weeks at a time without resting  down it went in mr .  pickwick s note book as a wonderful instance of the endurance of horses .  unfortunately  however  the driver thought mr .  pickwick was putting down the number of the cab so as to complain of him  and as they arrived just then at the inn  he jumped from his seat with the intention of fighting his dismayed passenger .  he knocked off mr .  pickwick s spectacles and  dancing back and forth as the other s three comrades rushed to the rescue  planted a blow in mr .  snodgrass s eye  another in tupman s waistcoat and ended by knocking all the breath out of winkle s body .   from this dilemma they were rescued by a tall  thin  long haired  young man in a faded green coat  worn black trousers and patched shoes  who seized mr .  pickwick and lugged him into the inn by main force  talking with a jaunty independent manner and in rapid and broken sentences    this way  sir  where s your friends .   all a mistake  never mind  here  waiter  brandy and water  raw beefsteak for the gentleman s eye  eh   ha ha .    the seedy looking stranger  whose name was alfred jingle  was a passenger on the same coach that day and entertained the pickwickians with marvelous stories of his life in spain .  none of these was true  to be sure  but they were all entered in mr .  pickwick s note book .  in gratitude  that night the latter invited jingle to dinner at the town inn where they stopped .   the dinner was long  and almost before it was over not only mr .  pickwick  but snodgrass and winkle also were asleep .  tupman  however  was more wakeful  a ball  the waiter had told him  was to be held that night on the upper floor and he longed to attend it .  jingle readily agreed  especially when tupman said he could borrow for him a blue dress suit  the property of the sleeping winkle .   they were soon dressed and at the ball .  jingle s jaunty air gained him a number of introductions .  before long he was dancing with a little old widow named mrs .  budger  who was very rich  and to whom he at once began to make love .  there was an army surgeon present named slammer  a short fat man with a ring of upright black hair around his head  and a bald plain on top of it  who had been courting the rich widow himself .  doctor slammer was old  jingle was young  and the lady felt flattered .  every moment the doctor grew angrier and at last tried to pick a quarrel with the wearer of the blue dress suit  at which jingle only laughed .  the ball over  tupman and jingle went down stairs .  winkle s clothes were returned to their place  and jingle  promising to join the party at dinner next day  took his departure .   the pickwickians were hardly awake next morning when an army officer came to the inn inquiring which gentleman of their number owned a blue dress suit with gilt buttons .  when told that mr .  winkle had such a costume he demanded to see him  and at once  in the name of his friend doctor slammer  challenged him to fight a duel that night at sunset .   poor winkle almost fainted with surprise .  when the stranger explained that the wearer of the blue suit had insulted doctor slammer  winkle concluded that he must have drunk too much wine at dinner  changed his clothes  gone somewhere  and insulted somebody  of all of which he had no recollection .  he saw no way  therefore  but to accept the bloodthirsty challenge  hoping that something would happen to prevent the duel .   winkle was dreadfully afraid  for he had never fired a pistol in his life .  he chose snodgrass for his second  hoping the latter would tell mr .  pickwick  but snodgrass  he soon found to his dismay  had no idea of doing so .  the day wore heavily away  and winkle could think of no escape .  at sunset they walked to the appointed spot  a lonely field  and at last winkle found himself  pistol in hand  opposite another man armed likewise  and waiting the signal to shoot .   at that moment doctor slammer saw that the man he faced was not the one who had insulted him at the ball .  explanations were soon made and the whole party walked back together to the inn  where winkle introduced his new friends to the pickwickians .  jingle  however  was with the latter  and doctor slammer at once recognized him as the wearer of the blue dress suit .  the doctor flew into a rage and only the statement of his fellow officer  that jingle was not a gentleman  but a strolling actor far beneath the doctor s dignity  prevented an encounter .  as it was  slammer stumped off in anger  leaving the pickwickians to enjoy the evening in their own way .   ii  tupman has a love affair with a spinster  and the pickwickians find out the real character of jingle  next day a military drill was held just outside the town and the pickwickians went to see it .  in the confusion of running officers and prancing horses they became separated from one another .  mr .  pickwick  snodgrass and winkle found themselves between two lines of troops  in danger of being run down .  at this moment they saw tupman standing in an open carriage near by and  hurrying to it  were hoisted in .   the carriage belonged to a short  stout old gentleman named wardle who had attended some of the club s meetings in london and knew mr .  pickwick by sight .  he lived at a place near by called dingley dell  from which he had driven to see the drill  with his old maid sister and his own two pretty daughters .  fastened behind was a big hamper of lunch and on the box was a fat boy named joe  whom mr .  wardle kept as a curiosity because he did nothing but eat and sleep .  joe went on errands fast asleep and snored as he waited on the table .  he had slept all through the roaring of the cannon and the old gentleman had to pinch him awake to serve the luncheon .   they had a merry time that day  tupman being deeply smitten with the charms of the elderly miss wardle  and snodgrass no less in love with emily  one of the pretty daughters .  when the review was over the old gentleman invited them all to visit dingley dell next day .   early in the morning they set out  mr .  pickwick driving tupman and snodgrass in a chaise  while winkle rode on horseback to uphold his reputation as a sportsman .  mr .  pickwick was distrustful of the horse he hired  but the hostler assured him that even a wagon load of monkeys with their tails burnt off would not make him shy .   winkle had never ridden a horse before  but he was ashamed to admit it .   for a while all went well  then the luckless winkle dropped his whip and when he dismounted the horse would not let him mount again .  mr .  pickwick got out of the chaise to help  and at this the animal jerked the bridle away and trotted home .  hearing the clatter the other horse bolted  too .  snodgrass and tupman jumped for their lives and the chaise was smashed to pieces against a wooden bridge .  with difficulty the horse was freed from the ruins and  leading him  the four friends walked the seven miles to dingley dell  where they found mr .  wardle and the fat boy  the latter fast asleep as usual  posted in the lane to meet them .   brushes  a needle and thread and some cherry brandy soon cured their rents and bruises and they forgot their misfortunes in an evening of pleasure .  mr .  wardle s mother was a deaf old lady with an ear trumpet  who loved to play whist .  when she disliked a person she would pretend she could not hear a word he said  but mr .  pickwick s jollity and compliments made her forget even to use her ear trumpet .  tupman flirted with the spinster aunt and snodgrass whispered poetry into emily s ear to his heart s content .   next morning mr .  wardle took winkle rook shooting .  the pair set out with their guns  preceded by the fat boy and followed by mr .  pickwick  snodgrass and the corpulent tupman .  winkle  who disliked to admit his ignorance of guns  showed it in a painful way .  his first shot missed the birds  and lodged itself in the arm of tupman  who fell to the ground .  the confusion that followed can not be described .  they bound up his wounds and supported him to the house  where the ladies waited at the garden gate  mr .  wardle calling out to them not to be frightened .   the warning  however  had no effect on the spinster aunt .  at the sight of her tupman wounded  she began to scream .  old mr .  wardle told her not to be a fool  but tupman was affected almost to tears and spoke her name with such romantic tenderness that the poor foolish lady felt quite a flutter at her heart .   a surgeon found the wound a slight one  and as a cricket match was to be played that day  the host left tupman in the care of the ladies and carried off the others to the game .   when they reached the field  the first words that fell on mr .  pickwick s ear made him start    this way  capital fun  glorious day  make yourself at home  glad to see you  very .   it was jingle  still clad in his faded green coat .  he had fallen in with the visiting players  and by telling wonderful tales of the games he had played in the west indies  soon convinced them he was a great cricket player .  seeing him greet mr .  pickwick  mr .  wardle  thinking him a friend of his guest  procured him an invitation to the dinner that followed the match .  there jingle made good use of his time in eating and drinking  and at midnight was heard leading with great effect the chorus    we won t go home till morning .    meanwhile  the romantic tupman at dingley dell had been free to woo the middle aged spinster .  this he did with such success that when evening came  he and she sat together in a vine covered arbor in the garden like a pair of carefully folded kid gloves  bound up in each other .  he had just printed a kiss on her lips when both looked up to see the fat boy  perfectly motionless  staring into the arbor .    supper s ready   said the fat boy  and his look was so blank that they both concluded he must have been asleep and had seen nothing .   it was long past midnight when a tremendous noise told that the absent ones had returned .  all rushed to the kitchen  where jingle s voice was heard crying   cricket dinner  glorious party  capital songs  very good  wine ma am  wine .   mr .  pickwick  snodgrass and winkle went to bed  but the talkative jingle remained with the ladies and before they retired had made tupman almost mad with jealousy by his attentions to the spinster aunt  who showed herself greatly pleased with his politeness .   now the fat boy  for once in his life  had not been asleep when he had announced supper that evening .  he had seen tupman s love making  and took the first occasion to tell the deaf old lady  as she sat in the garden arbor next morning .  he was obliged to shout it in her ear  and thus the whole story was overheard by jingle  who happened to be near .   the deceitful jingle saw in this a chance to benefit himself .  the spinster  he thought  had money  what could he better do than turn her against tupman  and marry her himself .  with this plan he went to tupman  recited what the fat boy had told  and advised him  for a time  in order to throw off the suspicions of the old lady and of mr .  wardle  to pay special attention to one of the younger daughters and to pretend to care nothing for the spinster .  he told tupman that the latter herself had made this plan and wished him to carry it out for her sake .  tupman  thinking it the wish of his lady love  did this with such success that the old lady concluded the fat boy must have been dreaming .   the spinster  however  thought tupman false  and jingle used the next few days to make such violent love to her that the silly creature believed him  forgot tupman  and agreed to run away with the deceiver to london .   there was great excitement when their absence was discovered  and the wrathful mr .  wardle and mr .  pickwick pursued them at once in a four horse chaise .  they rode all night and  reaching london  at once began to inquire at various inns to find a trace of the runaway pair .   they came at length to one called the white hart  in whose courtyard a round faced man servant was cleaning boots .  this servant  whose name was sam weller  wore a coat with blue glass buttons  a bright red handkerchief tied around his neck and an old white hat stuck on the side of his head .  he spoke with a quaint country accent  but he was a witty fellow  with a clever answer for every one .    werry well  i m agreeable   he said when mr .  pickwick gave him a gold piece .   what the devil do you want with me  as the man said when he see the ghost .    with sam weller s aid  they soon found that jingle and the spinster were there  and entered the room in which the couple sat at the very moment jingle was showing the marriage license which he had just brought .  the spinster at once went into violent hysterics  and jingle  seeing the game was up  accepted the sum of money which mr .  wardle offered him to take himself off .   there were deep lamentations when the confiding spinster found herself deserted by the faithless jingle  and slowly and sadly mr .  pickwick and mr .  wardle bore her back to dingley dell .   the heartbroken tupman had already left there  and with feelings of gloom mr .  pickwick  with snodgrass and winkle  also departed .   iii  mr .  pickwick has an interesting scene with mrs .  bardell  his housekeeper .  further pursuit of jingle leads to an adventure at a young ladies  boarding school  mr .  pickwick lived in lodgings  let for a single gentleman  in the house of a mrs .  bardell  a widow with one little boy .  for a long time she had secretly adored her benevolent lodger  as some one far above her own humble station .   mr .  pickwick had not forgotten sam weller  the servant who had aided in the pursuit of jingle  and on returning to london he wrote  asking sam to come to see him  intending to offer him a position as body servant .  sam came promptly and mr .  pickwick then proceeded to tell his landlady of his plan  a more or less delicate matter  since it would cause some change in her household affairs .    mrs .  bardell   said he   do you think it a much greater expense to keep two people than one .     la  mr .  pickwick .   answered mrs .  bardell  fancying she saw matrimony in his eye .   that depends on whether it s a saving person .     very true   said mr .  pickwick   but the person i have in my eye   here he looked at mrs .  bardell   has this quality .  and to tell you the truth  i have made up my mind .    mrs .  bardell blushed to her cap border .  her lodger was going to propose .   oh  mr .  pickwick .   she said   you re very kind  sir .  i m sure i ought to be a very happy woman .     it ll save you a deal of trouble   mr .  pickwick went on   and when i m in town you ll always have somebody to sit with you .     oh  you dear    said mrs .  bardell .   mr .  pickwick started .    oh  you kind  good  playful dear .   said mrs .  bardell  and flung herself on his neck with a cataract of tears .   the astonished mr .  pickwick struggled violently  pleading and reproving  but in vain .  mrs .  bardell clung the tighter  and exclaiming frantically that she would never leave him  fainted away in his arms .  at the same moment tupman  winkle and snodgrass entered the room .  mr .  pickwick tried to explain  but in their faces he read that they suspected him of making love to the widow .   this reflection made him miserable and ill at ease .  he lost no time in taking sam weller into his service  on condition that he travel with the pickwickians in their further search for adventures  and at once proposed to his three comrades another journey .   next day  therefore  found them on the road for eatanswill  a town near london which was then on the eve of a political election .  this was a very exciting struggle and interested them greatly .   here  one morning soon after their arrival  a fancy dress breakfast was given by mrs .  leo hunter  a lady who had once written an ode to an expiring frog and who made a great point of knowing everybody who was at all celebrated for anything .  all of the pickwickians attended the breakfast .  mr .  pickwick s dignity was too great for him to don a fancy costume  but the rest wore them  tupman going as a bandit in a green velvet coat with a two inch tail .   mrs .  leo hunter herself  in the character of minerva  insisted on presenting mr .  pickwick to all the guests .   in the midst of the gaiety mrs .  leo hunter s husband called out   my dear  here comes mr .  fitz marshall   and  to his astonishment  mr .  pickwick heard a well known voice exclaiming   coming  my dear ma am  crowds of people  full room  hard work  very .    it was jingle .  mr .  pickwick indignantly faced him  but the impostor  at the first glance turned and fled .  mr .  pickwick  after hurriedly questioning his hostess  who told him mr .  fitz marshall lived at an inn in a village not far away  left the entertainment instantly  bent on pursuit .  with sam weller  his faithful servant  he took the next stage coach and nightfall found him lodged in a room in that very inn  while sam set himself to discover jingle s whereabouts .   with the money mr .  wardle had paid him jingle had set up as a gentleman  he even had a servant  a sneaking fellow with a sallow  solemn face and lank hair  named job trotter  who could burst into tears whenever it suited his purpose and whose favorite occupation seemed to be reading a hymn book .  sam weller soon picked an acquaintance with job  and it was not long before the latter confided to him that jingle his master  whom he pretended to think very wicked  had plotted to run away that same night  with a beautiful young lady from a boarding school just outside the village  at which he was a frequent caller .  job said his master was such a villain that he had made up his mind to betray him .   sam took job to mr .  pickwick  to whom he repeated his tale  adding that he and his master were to be let into the school building at ten o clock  and that if mr .  pickwick would climb over the garden wall and tap on the kitchen door a little before midnight  he  job  would let him in to catch jingle in the very act of eloping .   this seemed to mr .  pickwick a good plan  and he proceeded to act upon it .  in good time that night sam hoisted him over the high garden wall of the school  after which he returned to the inn  while his master stealthily approached the building .   it was very still .  when the church chimes struck half past eleven mr .  pickwick tapped on the door .  instead of being opened by job  however  a servant girl appeared with a candle .  mr .  pickwick had presence of mind enough to hide behind the door as she opened it .  she concluded the noise must have been the cat .   mr .  pickwick did not know what was best to do .  to make matters worse  a thunder storm broke and he had no refuge from the rain .  he was thoroughly drenched before he dared repeat the signal .   this time windows were thrown open and frightened voices demanded  who s there .   mr .  pickwick was in a dreadful situation .  he could not retreat  and when the door was timidly opened and some one screamed  a man .   there was a dreadful chorus of shrieks from the lady principal  three teachers  five female servants and thirty young lady boarders  all half dressed and in a forest of curl papers .   mr .  pickwick was desperate .  he protested that he was no robber  that he would even consent to be tied or locked up  only to convince them .  a closet stood in the hall  as a pledge of good faith he stepped inside it .  its door was quickly locked and only then the trembling principal consented to listen to him .  by the time he had told his story  he knew that he had been cruelly hoaxed by jingle and job trotter .  she knew not even the name of mr .  fitz marshall .  for her own part she was certain mr .  pickwick was crazy  and he had to stay in the stuffy closet over an hour while at his request some one was sent to find sam weller .   the latter came at length  bringing with him old mr .  wardle  who  as it happened  unknown to mr .  pickwick  was stopping at the inn .  explanations were made and mr .  pickwick  choking with wrath  returned to the inn to find jingle and his servant gone  and to be  himself  for some time thereafter  a prey to rheumatism .   a serious matter at this juncture called mr .  pickwick home .  this was a legal summons notifying him that mrs .  bardell  his landlady  had brought a suit for damages against him  claiming he had promised to marry her and had then run away .  a firm of tricky lawyers had persuaded her to this in the hope of getting some money out of it themselves .  mr .  pickwick was very angry  but there was nothing for it but to hire a lawyer  so he and sam weller set out without delay .   iv  sam weller meets his father  and the pursuit of jingle is continued .  mr .  pickwick makes a strange call on a middle aged lady in yellow curl papers  having arranged this matter in london  master and servant sat one evening in a public house when sam recognized in a stout man with his face buried in a quart pot  his own father  old tony weller  the stage coach driver  and with great affection introduced him to mr .  pickwick .    how s mother in law .   asked sam .   the elder mr .  weller shook his head as he replied   i ve done it once too often  samivel .  take example by your father  my boy  and be very careful o  widders   specially if they ve kept a public house .    mrs .  weller the second  indeed  was the proprietress of a public house .  to a shrill voice and a complaining disposition she added a dismal sort of piety which showed itself in much going to meeting  in considering her husband a lost and sinful wretch and in the entertaining of a prim faced  red nosed  rusty old hypocrite of a preacher who sat by her fireside every evening consuming quantities of toast and pineapple rum  and groaning at the depravity of her husband  who declined to give money to the preacher s society for sending flannel waistcoats and colored handkerchiefs to the infant negroes of the west indies .  as may be imagined  sam s father led a sorry life at home .   the meeting with the elder weller proved a fortunate one  for when sam told of their experiences with jingle and job trotter  his father declared that he himself had driven the pair to the town of ipswich  where they were then living .  nothing would satisfy mr .  pickwick  when he heard this  but pursuit  and he and sam set out next morning by coach  mr .  pickwick having written to the other pickwickians to follow him .   on the coach was a red haired man with an inquisitive nose and blue spectacles  whose name was mr .  peter magnus  and with whom  since they stopped at the same inn  mr .  pickwick dined on his arrival .  mr .  magnus  before they parted for the night  grew confidential and informed him that he had come there to propose to a lady who was in the inn at that very moment .   for some time after he retired  mr .  pickwick sat in his bedroom thinking .  at length he rose to undress  when he remembered he had left his watch down stairs  and taking a candle he went to get it .  he found it easily  but to retrace his steps proved more difficult .  a dozen doors he thought his own  and a dozen times he turned a door knob only to hear a gruff voice within .  at last he found what he thought was his own room  the door ajar .  the wind had blown out his candle  but the fire was bright  and mr .  pickwick  as he retired behind the bed curtains to undress  smiled till he almost cracked his nightcap strings as he thought of his wanderings .   suddenly the smile faded  some one had entered the room and locked the door .   robbers .   thought mr .  pickwick .  he peered out between the curtains and almost fainted with horror .  standing before the mirror was a middle aged lady in yellow curl papers  brushing her back hair .    bless my soul .   thought mr .  pickwick .   i must be in the wrong room .  this is fearful .    he waited a while  then coughed  first gently  then more loudly .    gracious heaven .   said the middle aged lady .   what s that .     it s  it s only a gentleman  ma am   said mr .  pickwick .    a strange man .   exclaimed the lady with a terrific scream .   mr .  pickwick put out his head in desperation .    wretch .   she said  covering her face with her hands .   what do you want here .     nothing  ma am  nothing whatever  ma am   said mr .  pickwick earnestly .   i am almost ready to sink  ma am  beneath the confusion of addressing a lady in my nightcap  here the lady snatched off hers  but i can t get it off  ma am .   here mr .  pickwick gave it a tremendous tug  .  it is evident to me now that i have mistaken this bedroom for my own .     if this be true   said the lady sobbing violently   you will leave it instantly .     certainly  ma am   answered mr .  pickwick appearing   i  i  am very sorry  ma am .    the lady pointed to the door .  with his hat on over his nightcap  his shoes in his hand and his coat over his arm  mr .  pickwick opened the door  dropping both shoes with a crash .   i trust  ma am   he resumed  bowing very low   that my unblemished character    but before he could finish the sentence the lady had thrust him into the hall and bolted the door .   luckily mr .  pickwick met  coming along the corridor  the faithful sam weller who took him safely to his room .   v  the pickwickians find themselves in the grasp of the law .  the final exposure of jingle  and a christmas merrymaking  mr .  pickwick was still indoors next morning  when sam  strolling through the town  met  coming from a certain garden gate  the wily job trotter .  job tried at first to disguise himself by making a horrible face  but sam was not to be deceived  and finding this trick vain  the other burst into tears of joy to see him .   job told sam that his master  jingle  had bribed the mistress of the boarding school to deny to mr .  pickwick that she knew him  and had then cruelly deserted the beautiful young lady for a richer one .  but this time sam was too wise to believe anything job said .   meanwhile  in the inn  mr .  pickwick was giving mr .  peter magnus some good advice as to the best method of proposing .  the latter finally plucked up his courage  saw the lady  proposed to her  and was accepted .  in his gratitude  he insisted on taking mr .  pickwick to be introduced to her .   the instant he saw her  however  mr .  pickwick uttered an exclamation  and the lady  with a slight scream  hid her face in her hands .  she was none other than the owner of the room into which mr .  pickwick had intruded the night before .   mr .  peter magnus  in astonishment  demanded where and when they had seen each other before .  this the lady declared she would not reveal for the world  and mr .  pickwick likewise refusing  the other flew into a jealous rage  which ended in his rushing from the room swearing he would challenge mr .  pickwick to mortal combat .  tupman  winkle and snodgrass being announced at that moment  mr .  pickwick joined them  and the middle aged lady was left alone in a state of terrible alarm .   the longer she thought the more terrified she became at the idea of possible bloodshed and harm to her lover .  at length  overcome by dread  and knowing no other way to stop the duel  she hastened to the house of the mayor of the town  a pompous magistrate named nupkins  and begged him to stop the duel .  not wishing to make trouble for mr .  peter magnus  she declared that the two rioters who threatened to disturb the peace of the town were named pickwick and tupman  these two  nupkins  thinking them cutthroats from london  at once sent men to arrest .   mr .  pickwick was just telling his followers the story of his mishap of the night before  when a half dozen officers burst into the room .  boiling with indignation  mr .  pickwick had to submit  and the officers put him and tupman into an old sedan chair and carried them off  followed by winkle and snodgrass and by all the town loafers .   sam weller met the procession and tried to rescue them  but was knocked down and taken prisoner also .  so they were all brought to nupkins s house .   the mayor refused to hear a word mr .  pickwick said and was about to send them all to jail as desperate characters when sam weller called his master aside and whispered to him that the house they were in was the very one from which he had seen job trotter come  and from this fact he guessed that jingle himself had wormed himself into the good graces of the mayor .  at this mr .  pickwick asked to have a private talk with nupkins .   this was grudgingly granted and in a few moments mr .  pickwick had learned that jingle  calling himself  captain fitz marshall   had imposed so well on the pompous mayor that the latter s wife and daughter had introduced him everywhere and he himself had boasted to everybody of his acquaintance .   it was nupkins s turn to feel humble when mr .  pickwick told him jingle s real character .  he was terribly afraid the story would get out and that the town would laugh at him  so he became all at once tremendously polite  declared their arrest had been all a mistake and begged the pickwickians to make themselves at home .  sam weller was sent down to the kitchen to get his dinner  where he met a pretty housemaid named mary  with whom he proceeded to fall very much in love for the first time in his life .   jingle and job walked into the trap a little later  not expecting the kind of reception they were to find there .  but even before the combined scorn of nupkins  mrs .  nupkins  miss nupkins and the pickwickians  jingle showed a brazen front .  he knew pride would prevent the mayor from exposing him  and when finally shown the door  he left with a mocking jeer  followed by the chuckling job .   in spite of his own troubles mr .  pickwick left ipswich comforted by the defeat of jingle .  as for sam  he kissed the pretty housemaid behind the door and they parted with mutual regrets .   to atone for these difficult adventures  the pickwickians prepared for a long visit to dingley dell  where they spent an old fashioned merry christmas  where they found the fat boy even fatter and mr .  wardle even jollier  where tupman was not saddened by the sight of his lost love  the spinster aunt  who had been sent to live with another relative  where snodgrass came more than ever to admire emily  the pretty daughter  where winkle fell head over ears in love with a black eyed young lady visitor named arabella allen  who wore a nice little pair of boots with fur around the top  where they went skating and mr .  pickwick broke through  and had to be carried home and put to bed  where they hung mistletoe and told stories  and altogether enjoyed themselves in a hundred ways .   ben allen  arabella s brother  reached dingley dell on christmas day  a thick set  mildewy young man  with short black hair  a long white face and spectacles .  he was a medical student  and brought with him his chum  bob sawyer  a slovenly  smart  swaggering young gentleman  who smelled strongly of tobacco smoke and looked like a dissipated robinson crusoe .  ben intended that his chum should marry his sister arabella  and bob sawyer paid her so much attention that winkle began to hate him on the spot .   the christmas merrymaking was all too soon over  and as mrs .  bardell s lawsuit against mr .  pickwick was shortly to be tried  the pickwickians returned regretfully to the city .   vi  the celebrated case of barbell against pickwick .  sergeant buzfuz s speech and an unexpected verdict  on the morning of the trial mr .  pickwick went to court certain that the outcome would be in his favor .  the room was full of people  and all the pickwickians were there when he arrived .  the judge was a very short man  so plump that he seemed all face and waistcoat .  when he had rolled in upon two little turned legs  and sat down at his desk  all you could see of him was two little eyes  one broad pink face  and about half of a comical  big wig .  scarcely had the jurors taken their seats  when mrs .  bardell s lawyers brought in the lady herself  half hysterical  and supported by two tearful lady friends .  the ushers called for silence and the trial began .   the lawyer who spoke for mrs .  bardell was named sergeant buzfuz  a blustering man with a fat body and a red face .  he began by picturing mr .  pickwick s housekeeper as a lonely widow who had been heartlessly deceived by the villainy of her lodger .  he declared that for two years  mrs .  bardell had attended to mr .  pickwick s comforts  that once he had patted her little boy on the head and asked him how he would like to have another father  that he had also asked her to marry him  and on the same day had been seen by three of his friends holding her in his arms and soothing her agitation .  drawing forth two scraps of paper  sergeant buzfuz went on    gentlemen  one word more .  two letters have passed between these parties  which speak volumes .  they are not open  fervent letters of affection .  they are sly  underhanded communications evidently intended by pickwick to mislead and delude any one into whose hands they might fall .  let me read the first   dear mrs .  b .   chops and tomato sauce .  yours  pickwick .   gentlemen  what does this mean .  chops .  gracious heavens .  and tomato sauce .  gentlemen  is the happiness of a trusting female to be trifled away by such shallow tricks .  the next has no date .   dear mrs .  b .   i shall not be at home till to morrow .   and then follows this remarkable expression   don t trouble yourself about the warming pan .   the warming pan .  why is mrs .  bardell begged not to trouble herself about this warming pan  unless  as is no doubt the case  it is a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise  cunningly used by pickwick  with a view to his intended desertion .    but enough of this  gentlemen .  it is hard to smile with an aching heart .  my client s hopes are ruined .  all is gloom in the house  the child s sports are forgotten while his mother weeps .  but pickwick  gentlemen  pickwick  the pitiless destroyer  pickwick who comes before you to day with his heartless tomato sauce and warming pans  pickwick still rears his head  and gazes without a sigh on the ruins he has made .  damages  gentlemen  heavy damages is the only punishment with which you can visit him .  and for these damages  my client now appeals to a high minded  a right feeling  a sympathizing jury of her countrymen .    with this sergeant buzfuz stopped  and began to call his witnesses .  the first was one of mrs .  bardell s female cronies  whose testimony of course  was all in her favor .   then winkle was called .  knowing that he was a friend of mr .  pickwick s  mrs .  bardell s lawyers browbeat and puzzled him till poor mr .  winkle had the air of a disconcerted pickpocket  and was in a terrible state of confusion .  he was soon made to tell how  with tupman and snodgrass  he had come into mr .  pickwick s lodgings one day to find him holding mrs .  bardell in his arms .  the other two pickwickians were also compelled to testify to this .   nor was this all .  sergeant buzfuz finally entrapped the agonized winkle into telling how mr .  pickwick had been found at night in the wrong room at the ipswich inn and how as a result a lady s marriage had been broken off and the whole party arrested and taken before the mayor .  poor winkle was obliged to tell this  though he knew it would hurt the case of mr .  pickwick .  when he was released he rushed away to the nearest inn  where he was found some hours later by the waiter  groaning dismally with his head under the sofa cushions .   mr .  pickwick s case looked black .  the only comfort he received was from the testimony of sam weller  who tried to do mrs .  bardell s side all possible harm yet say as little about his master as he could  and who kept the court room in a roar of laughter with his sallies .    do you mean to tell me  mr .  weller   said sergeant buzfuz finally   that you saw nothing of mrs .  bardell s fainting in the arms of mr .  pickwick .  have you a pair of eyes  mr .  weller .     yes  i have a pair of eyes   replied sam   and that s just it .  if they was a pair o  patent double million magnifyin  gas miscroscopes of hextra power  p r aps i might be able to see through a flight o  stairs and a deal door  but bein  only eyes  you see  my wision s limited .   sergeant buzfuz could make nothing out of sam  and so the case for mrs .  bardell closed .   mr .  pickwick s lawyer made a long speech in his favor  but it was of no use .  the evidence seemed all against him .  the jury found him guilty of breach of promise of marriage  and sentenced him to pay mrs .  bardell her damages .   mr .  pickwick was speechless with indignation .  he vowed that not one penny would he ever pay if he spent the rest of his life in a jail .  his own lawyer warned him that if he did not pay within two months  mrs .  bardell s lawyers could put him into the debtors  prison  but mr .  pickwick prepared to start on another excursion with his three friends  still declaring that he would never pay .   vii  winkle has an exciting adventure with mr .  dowler  and with the aid of mr .  pickwick and sam weller discovers the whereabouts of miss arabella allen  at bath  a resort very popular with people of fashion  the pickwickians decided to spend the next two months  and started by coach at once  accompanied by sam weller .  on the coach they fell in with a fierce looking  abrupt gentleman named dowler  with a bald  glossy forehead and large black whiskers  who introduced them to the society of bath  particularly to mr .  angelo cyrus bantam  master of ceremonies at the famous assembly room  where the fashionable balls were held .  mr .  bantam carried a gold eye glass  a gold snuff box  gold rings on his finger  a gold watch in his waistcoat pocket  a gold chain and an ebony cane with a gold head .  his linen was the whitest  his wig the blackest  and his teeth were so fine that it was hard to tell the real ones from the false ones .   mr .  bantam made the pickwickians welcome and in three days  time they were settled in a fine house  where mr .  and mrs .  dowler also lodged .  mr .  pickwick passed his days in drinking the spring water for which bath was famous  and in walking  his evenings he spent at the assembly balls  at the theater or in making entries in his journal .   one evening mrs .  dowler was carried off to a party in her sedan chair  leaving her husband to sit up for her .  the pickwickians had long since gone to bed  and mr .  dowler fell fast asleep while he waited .  it was a very windy night and the sedan carriers  who brought the lady home  knocked in vain at the door .  mr .  dowler did not wake  though they knocked like an insane postman .   at length winkle in his own room was roused by the racket .  he donned slippers and dressing gown  hurried down stairs half asleep and opened the door .  at the glare of the torches he jumped to the conclusion that the house was on fire and rushed outside  when the door blew shut behind him .   seeing a lady s face at the window of the sedan chair  he turned and knocked at the door frantically  but with no response .  he was undressed and the wind blew his dressing gown in a most unpleasant manner .   there are people coming down the street now .  there are ladies with  em  cover me up with something .  stand before me .   roared winkle  but the chairmen only laughed .  the ladies were nearer and in desperation he bolted into the sedan chair where mrs .  dowler was .   now mr .  dowler  a moment before  had bounced off the bed  and now threw open the window just in time to see this .  he thought his wife was running away with another man  and seizing a supper knife  the indignant husband tore into the street  shouting furiously .   winkle  hearing his horrible threats  did not wait .  he leaped out of the sedan chair and took to his heels  hotly pursued by dowler .  he dodged his pursuer at length  rushed back  slammed the door in dowler s face  gained his bedroom  barricaded his door with furniture and packed his belongings .  at the first streak of dawn  he slipped out and took coach for bristol .   mr .  pickwick was greatly vexed over winkle s unheroic flight .  sam weller soon discovered where he had gone  and mr .  pickwick sent him after the fugitive  bidding him find winkle and either compel him to return or keep him in sight until mr .  pickwick himself could follow .   winkle  meanwhile  walking about the bristol streets  chanced to stop at a doctor s office to make some inquiries  and in a young medical gentleman in green spectacles recognized  to his huge surprise  bob sawyer  the bosom friend of ben allen  both of whom he had met on christmas day at dingley dell .  bob  in delight  dragged winkle into the back room where sat ben allen  amusing himself by boring holes in the chimney piece with a red hot poker .   the precious couple had  in fact  set up shop together  and were using every trick they knew to make people think them great doctors with a tremendous practice .  they insisted on winkle s staying to supper  and it was lucky he did so  for he heard news of arabella  the pretty girl who had worn the little boots with fur around the top at dingley dell  and with whom he had fallen in love .  he learned that arabella had scorned the sprightly bob sawyer  and that her brother  in anger  had taken her away from mr .  wardle s and put her in the house of an old aunt  a dull  close place not far from bristol .  before he bade them good night  winkle had determined to find her .   he met with a shock  on returning to his inn  to come suddenly upon dowler sitting in the coffee room .  winkle drew back  very pale  and was greatly surprised to see the bloodthirsty dowler do likewise as  growing even paler than winkle  he began an apology for his action of the evening before .  as a matter of fact  dowler had run away from bath  too  at dawn  in fear of winkle  and thought now the latter had pursued him .  winkle  suspecting this  put on a look of great fierceness but accepted the apology  and the pair shook hands .   winkle s plan for finding arabella allen met now with a set back .  sam weller arrived at midnight and insisted that winkle be waked at once .  once in his room  sam told him mr .  pickwick s instructions and declared he would not leave his sight till winkle came back with him to bath .  this was awkward  but luckily  mr .  pickwick himself  to whom sam wrote  arrived next day and released his follower .   mr .  pickwick approved of winkle s determination to find the pretty arabella  and so the next morning sam weller was sent on a voyage of discovery among the servants of the town .  for many hours sam searched in vain without a clue .   in the afternoon he sat in a lane running between rows of gardens in one of the suburbs  when a gate opened and a maid servant came out to shake some carpets .  sam gallantly rose to help her  when she uttered a half suppressed scream .  it was mary  the good looking housemaid whom sam had kissed at the house of nupkins  the mayor of ipswich  on the day of the arrest of the pickwickians and the exposure of jingle .  she had left her place there for this new situation .   when sam had finished his gallant speeches and mary her blushing  he told her of winkle s search .  what was his surprise when she told him that arabella was living the very next door .  she let sam come into the garden  and presently when arabella came out to walk  he scrambled on to the wall and pleaded winkle s cause .    ve thought ve should ha  been obliged to straitveskit him last night   he declared .   he s been a ravin  all day  and he says if he can t see you afore to morrow night s over  he vishes he may be somethin  unpleasanted if he don t drownd hisself .    arabella  in great distress at this prospect  promised she would be in the garden next evening  and sam returned with the news to mr .  pickwick and winkle .   the next evening all three set out for the spot .  mary let them into the garden and  while winkle climbed the wall to throw himself at arabella s feet  mr .  pickwick kept guard at the gate with a dark lantern .  so far he threw its beam that a scientific gentleman who lived a few houses away  seeing the light from his window  took it for some new and wonderful freak of electricity and came out to investigate .   before he arrived  however  winkle had scrambled back over the wall and arabella had run into the house .  seeing the scientific gentleman s head poked out of a garden gate as they passed  sam gave it a gentle tap with his fist and then  hoisting mr .  pickwick on his back  and followed by winkle  he ran off at full speed  leaving the scientific gentleman to go back to his room and write a long article about the wonderful light and to tell how he had received a shock of electricity which left him stunned for a quarter of an hour afterward .   the pickwickians  stay at bath came to an end soon after this adventure  and their leader  with sam weller  returned to london .   viii  mr .  pickwick s experiences in the debtors  prison  where he finds an old enemy and heaps coals of fire on the head of mrs .  bardell  mr .  pickwick had not been long in london when his lawyer s warning proved too true .  one morning a bailiff forced his way to his bedroom and  since he had not paid the damages to mrs .  bardell  arrested him in bed  waited till he was dressed and carried him off to the debtors  prison .   the prison was called the fleet .  it was a gloomy building with a heavy gate  guarded by a turnkey  holding all classes  from laboring men to broken down spendthrifts .  its filthy galleries  and low coffee room reeked with tobacco smoke and its open court was noisy with the oaths of card players .  in some of the rooms lived men with their wives and whole families of children  and mr .  pickwick found he would have to pay extra even to have a room to himself .   caged with this coarse  vulgar crowd  mr .  pickwick suffered greatly  but no idea of paying the unjust damages entered his mind .  instead  he busied himself with wandering about the prison and learning all he could of its customs and inmates .  those who  like himself  had money were well treated .  those who had none lived in starvation and wretchedness .  in one wall was a kind of iron cage  within which was posted a lean and hungry prisoner who rattled a money box and called out   remember the poor debtors .   the money he collected from passers by in the street was divided and bought food for the poorest .   as mr .  pickwick entered the room given over to the latter class  he started .  in one of its occupants  clad in tattered garments and yellow shirt  pinched with starvation and pale with illness  he saw alfred jingle  and near him  faithful still in rags and dirt  was job trotter .   jingle was no longer jaunty and impudent .  he had pawned all his belongings  had lived  in fact  for the last week on a silk umbrella with an ivory handle .  his smile now was a mere twitch of the face as he said   nothing soon  starve  die  workhouse funeral  serve him right  all over  drop the curtain .   unable  however  to keep up this make believe recklessness  jingle sat down at length and sobbed like a child .   mr .  pickwick was greatly moved at the sight  and gave job some money for his master as he turned away .   sam weller had come with mr .  pickwick to the prison .  the latter  however  told his servant he must now leave him  though his wages would go on as usual .  sam pretended to agree  but lost no time in going to his father with a plan by which he  too  should be sent to the fleet prison for debt  so as to be near his master .  he borrowed some money from the old stage driver  and then when he refused to pay it  his father had him arrested and sent to the prison as he wished .  old tony weller and all his friends went with him  and gave him three tremendous cheers at the door .  when mr .  pickwick saw sam return and learned what he had done  he was much affected at the devotion of this faithful servant and felt himself more fond of him than ever .   it was a long time before winkle  tupman and snodgrass learned of their leader s imprisonment and came to see him .  sam also had visitors in the person of his mother in law  who  of course  did not know he had brought about his own arrest  and the hypocritical  red nosed preacher who came with her to lecture him on his evil ways .   old tony weller came  too  with a plan that he had thought of for mr .  pickwick s escape in a piano .    it ll hold him easy   he whispered   with his hat and shoes on  and breathe through the legs  vich is holler .  have a passage ready taken for  mericker .  the  merikin gov ment will never give him up when they finds as he s got money to spend  sammy .  let him stop there till mrs .  bardell s dead  then let him come back and write a book about the  merikins as ll pay all his expenses and more if he blows  em up enough .    but mr .  pickwick did not avail himself of this plan to escape to america .  day by day he wandered about the prison  learning its tales of misery and hopelessness  till his head and his heart ached and he could bear no more .  for three months he remained there  shut up all day  stealing from his room only at night  and no entreaties would induce him to pay the money which was keeping him a prisoner .   mrs .  bardell s lawyers meanwhile grew impatient .  they had not been paid even the costs of the trial  and these mrs .  bardell had agreed to pay if they won the suit .  as mr .  pickwick had not paid the damages  however  she had no money  and so the lawyers at last had her arrested  and she  too  was sent to the fleet prison .  after a few hours there  mrs .  bardell was willing to do anything to escape  and she agreed if mr .  pickwick paid the costs  to release him from the damages .   mr .  pickwick was still so indignant that he would possibly not have consented  but at this juncture winkle entered  leading by the hand the beautiful girl who had been arabella allen  but whom he introduced now as mrs .  winkle .  he had run away with her from the old aunt s house  with the help of mary  the pretty housemaid  and they had been married without the knowledge of winkle s father .  they had come to mr .  pickwick to beg him to go and plead with old mr .  winkle for forgiveness .   arabella s tears and winkle s plight proved too much for mr .  pickwick s resolution .  he paid mrs .  bardell s costs and left fleet prison that very day  with sam weller  whose father  of course  immediately released him also .   ix  snodgrass gets into difficulties  but wins his lady love .  the adventures of the pickwickians come to an end  mr .  pickwick journeyed first to bristol  to break the news of arabella s marriage to her brother  ben allen .  the latter was angry at first  but finally he and bob sawyer shook hands with the visitor and agreed to treasure no ill feeling .   both the young gentlemen insisted on going with mr .  pickwick to the winkle homestead  a circumstance which did not make that visit an easy one .  arabella s brother went fast asleep in the parlor while they waited  and when bob sawyer pinched him  as the old gentleman entered  he awoke with a shriek without the least idea where he was .   this was most embarrassing to mr .  pickwick  but he said all he could for winkle .  the old gentleman  however  would send no message to his son  and mr .  pickwick and sam weller returned with disappointment .   in london sam found a letter awaiting him from his father .  his mother in law was dead and the public house and its earnings were now the old stage driver s .  sam went to see old tony and found him terrified .  all the widows in town were setting their caps for him and he was afraid one of them would succeed in marrying him .  he had determined to sell out the business  give the money to mr .  pickwick to invest for him  and keep to stage driving so as to be safe .   while sam sat with his father talking matters over  the red nosed preacher came sidling in to inquire whether mrs .  weller s will had not left some money for him .  he felt so much at home that he went to the cupboard and poured himself out a big tumbler of his favorite pineapple rum .  this was more than old tony weller could stand .  he fell upon the old hypocrite  kicked him through the door and ducked him in the horse trough .   mr .  pickwick  meanwhile  had been arranging to buy the release of jingle and job trotter  and to send them to the west indies  where they might have a chance to make an honest living .  while he was attending to this at his lawyer s  a prolonged knock came at the door .  it was joe  mr .  wardle s fat boy  erect  but gone fast asleep between his knocks .   mr .  wardle came up from his carriage  delighted to see his old friend  of whose imprisonment he had just heard .  he told mr .  pickwick that his daughter emily had fallen in love with snodgrass  and that  discovering it  he had brought her to london to ask the advice of mr .  pickwick in the matter .  while they talked he sent the fat boy back to the inn to tell emily that mr .  pickwick would dine there with them .   the fat boy went on this errand  and coming suddenly into the inn sitting room  discovered emily  with her waist encircled with snodgrass s arm while arabella and her pretty housemaid were obligingly looking out of the window .  there was but one thing to do  they bribed the fat boy not to tell .   snodgrass  unluckily  stayed too long .  as he was leaving  he heard mr .  wardle  with mr .  pickwick and winkle  coming up the stair .  he was obliged to retreat  and took refuge in mr .  wardle s bedroom  from which there was no escape  save through the dining room .   the dinner hour was a painful one to emily  for the fat boy s secret kept him awake  and he winked at her and at arabella so often that mr .  wardle noticed it .  the latter sent him into the bedroom finally for his snuff box and he came out very pale  mr .  snodgrass having seized him there  and begged him to tell some one secretly to release him .   accordingly the fat boy made desperate efforts to attract mr .  pickwick s attention  first by making faces at him when he thought no one else was looking and finally by running a pin into his leg .  but this did not have the desired results .  mr .  pickwick concluded he was crazy  and mr .  wardle was about to have him taken down stairs  when into the confusion  with a very red face  walked snodgrass  out of the bedroom .  he explained his presence there  declared his love for emily  was forgiven on the spot and joined the dinner .   the happiness of all was complete when old mr .  winkle arrived  having made up his mind to see his son s wife and judge for himself  and found arabella so sweet that he kissed her and forgave winkle on the instant .   thus the last adventure of the pickwickians ended happily .  mr .  pickwick had seen  before this  that the marriage of his companions would change his own life .  he withdrew his name from the pickwick club  which thereupon went to pieces   and purchased a house near london for the entertainment of his friends  and there a few days later snodgrass and emily were married in the presence of mr .  wardle and all the pickwickians .   after the wedding  snodgrass bought a farm near dingley dell where  with emily  he lived many years  and was always accounted a great poet on account of his pensive and absent minded manner .  winkle  with arabella  settled a half mile from mr .  pickwick .  tupman never again fell in love  though for years his romantic air made him the admiration of numerous single ladies of the neighborhood .   ben allen and bob sawyer went to india as surgeons where  after having had yellow fever fourteen times  they became teetotalers and thereafter did well .  mrs .  bardell continued to let lodgings to single gentlemen  but never had another breach of promise suit .  old tony weller finally gave up business and retired to live on the interest of the money mr .  pickwick had invested for him  having  to the end of his life  a great dislike for widows .  his son  sam  remaining faithful to his master  mr .  pickwick at length made mary  the pretty maid  his housekeeper  on condition that she marry sam  which she did at once .   mr .  pickwick lived happily  occupied in writing his adventures and in acting as godfather to the children of snodgrass and winkle .  he never regretted what he had done for jingle and job trotter  who became in time worthy members of society .  he was a favorite with all and the children loved him .  every year he went to mr .  wardle s to a large merrymaking  attended by his faithful sam weller  between whom and his master there was a regard that nothing but death could end .              little dorrit  published            scene  london and various places on the continent  time       to       characters  mr .  dorrit an inmate of the debtors

arthur came home from china  a long  long time ago there lived in london a young man named clennam .  he was an orphan  and was brought up by a stern uncle  who crushed and repressed his youth and finally forced him to marry a cold  unfeeling  stubborn woman whom he did not in the least love .   some time before this marriage  the nephew had met a beautiful young woman  also an orphan  whom a rich man named dorrit was educating to be a singer  since she had a remarkable voice .  clennam had fallen in love with her and had persuaded her to give him all her love in return .  there had even been a kind of ceremony of marriage between them .   but they were both very poor and could not really marry for fear of the anger of clennam s cruel uncle  who finally compelled his nephew to marry the other woman  whom he had picked out for him .  and the singer  because she loved him and could not bear to see him made a beggar  gave him up .  so clennam married one woman while loving another  and this  as all wrong things must do  resulted in unhappiness for them both .   the singer had given him a little silk watch paper worked in beads with the initials d .  n .  f .  these letters stood for the words   do not forget .    the wife saw the paper with her husband s watch in his secret drawer and wondered what it meant .  one day she found an old letter  that had passed between her husband and the singer  which explained the initials and betrayed the secret of their love .   she was hard and unforgiving .  though she had never loved clennam herself  her anger was terrible .  she went to the singer  and under threat of for ever disgracing her in the eyes of the world  she made her give up to her her baby boy  arthur  to rear as her own .  she promised  in return  that the little arthur should be provided for and should never know the real history of his parentage .  she also compelled her husband and the singer to take an oath that neither would ever see or communicate with the other again .   mrs .  clennam  in taking this terrible revenge  cheated herself into believing that she was only the instrument of god  carrying out his will and punishment .  but in reality she was satisfying the rage and hatred of her own heart .  year by year she nursed this rage in the gloomy house in which clennam lived and where he carried on the london branch of his business .   it was an old brick house separated from the street by a rusty courtyard .  it seemed to have once been about to slide down sidewise  but had been propped up as though it leaned on some half dozen gigantic crutches .  inside it was dark and miserable  with sunken floors and blackened furniture .  in a corner of the sitting room was an ugly old clock that was wound once a week with an iron handle  and on the walls were pictures showing the  plagues of egypt .   the only pleasure the grim woman enjoyed was reading aloud from those parts of the old testament which call for dreadful punishments to fall upon all the enemies of the righteous  and in these passages she gloried .   in this melancholy place the boy arthur clennam grew up in silence and in dread  wondering much why they lived so lonely and why his father and mother  for so he thought mrs .  clennam to be  sat always so silent with faces turned from each other .   there were but two servants  an old woman named affery  and flintwinch  her husband  a short  bald man  who was both clerk and footman  and who carried his head awry and walked in a one sided crab like way  as though he were falling and needed propping up like the house .  flintwinch was cunning and without conscience .  very few secrets his mistress had which he did not know  and they often quarreled .   at length the uncle  who had compelled the unhappy marriage of arthur s father  died .  feeling sorry at the last for the wretched singer  whose life had been ruined  he left her in his will a sum of money  and another sum to the youngest niece of the man who had befriended and educated her  mr .  dorrit .   this money  however  mrs .  clennam did not intend either the woman she hated or the niece of her patron should get .  she hid the part of the will which referred to it  and made flintwinch  who  beside her husband  was the only one who knew of it  promise not to tell .  arthur s father she compelled to sail to china  to take charge of the branch of his business in that country  and when arthur was old enough  she sent him there also .   for twenty years  while arthur stayed with his father on the other side of the world  mrs .  clennam  cold and unforgiving as ever  lived on in the old  tumbling house  carrying on the london business with the aid of flintwinch .   the poor  forsaken singer lost her mind and at last died .  mr .  dorrit  of course  knowing nothing about the hidden will  could not claim his share  and the guilty secret remained  except for arthur s unhappy father  in possession of only mrs .  clennam and the crafty flintwinch .   so the years rolled by  and mrs .  clennam s cold gray eyes grew colder  her gray hair grayer and her face more hard and stony .  she went out less and less  and finally paralysis made her keep to her room and her chair .   the time came when arthur s father lay dying with his son beside him .  on his death bed he did not forget the money which had never been restored .  he had not strength to write  but with his dying hand he gave arthur his watch  making him promise to take it back to england to the wife whose anger and hatred still lived .  the watch still held the little paper with the bead initials that stood for  do not forget   and he meant thus to remind her of the wrong which was still unrighted .   many times thereafter  on his way back to london  arthur thought of his father s strange manner and wondered if it could be that some wrong deed lay on his conscience .  this idea clung to him  so that when he saw mrs .  clennam again on his arrival  and spoke to her of his father s last hours  he asked her if she thought this might be so .  but at this her anger rose  she upbraided him and declared if he ever referred again to the subject she would renounce him as her son and cast him off for ever .   it was her guilty conscience  of course  that caused this burst of rage .  and yet  just because it was not for the money s sake that she had done that evil act  but because she so hated the woman to whom it should have been given  she tried to convince herself that she had acted rightly  as the instrument of god  to punish wickedness .  she had told herself this falsehood over and over again so often that she had ended by quite believing it to be the truth .   arthur said no more to her about the matter .  he was a man now  and his father s death had made him master of a very considerable fortune .  he decided that he would not carry on the business  but would make a new one for himself .  this resolution angered mrs .  clennam greatly  but she grimly determined to carry it on herself  and in arthur s place took the wily flintwinch as her partner and told arthur coldly to go his own way .   ii  the child of the marshalsea  on the first night of his return to the house of his childhood arthur had noticed there a little seamstress  with pale  transparent face  hazel eyes and a figure as small as a child s .  she wore a spare thin dress  spoke little  and passed through the rooms noiselessly and shy .  they called her  little dorrit .   she came in the morning and sewed quietly till nightfall  when she vanished .  it had been so rare in the old days for any one to please the mistress of that gloomy house that the little creature s presence there interested arthur greatly and he longed to know something of her history .   he soon found there was nothing to be learned from flintwinch  and so one night he followed little dorrit when she left the house .  to his great surprise he saw her finally enter a great bare building surrounded with spiked walls and called the marshalsea .   this was a famous prison where debtors were kept .  in those days the law not only permitted a man to be put in jail for debt  but compelled him to stay there till all he owed was paid  a strange custom  since while he was in jail he was unable to earn any money to pay with .  in fact  in many cases poor debtors had to stay there all their lives .   inside the walls of the marshalsea the wives and children of unfortunate prisoners were allowed to come to live with them just as in a boarding house or hotel  but the debtors themselves could never pass out of the gate .  arthur entered the prison ignorant of its rules and so stayed too long  for presently the bell for closing rang  the gates were shut  and he had to stay inside all night .  this was not so pleasant  but it gave him a chance easily to find out all he wished to learn of little dorrit s history .   her father  before she was born  had lost all his money through a business failure  and had thus been thrown into the marshalsea .  there amy  or little dorrit  as they came to call her  was born  there her mother had languished away  and there she herself had always lived  mothering her pretty frivolous sister fanny  and her lazy  ne er do well brother   tip .    her father had been an inmate of the prison so many years that he was called  the father of the marshalsea .   from being a haughty man of wealth  he had become a shabby old white haired dignitary with a soft manner  who took little gifts of money which any one gave him half shame facedly and to the mortification of little dorrit alone .   the child had grown up the favorite of the turnkeys and of all the prison  calling the high  blank walls  home .   when she was a little slip of a girl she had her sister and brother sent to night school for a time  and later taught herself fine sewing  so that at the time arthur clennam returned to london she was working every day outside the walls  for small wages .  each night she returned to the prison to prepare her father s supper  bringing him whatever she could hide from her own dinner at the house where she sewed  loving him devotedly through all .   she even had a would be lover  too .  the son of one of the turnkeys  a young man with weak legs and weak  light hair  soft hearted and soft headed  had long pursued her in vain .  he was now engaged in seeking comfort for his hopeless love by composing epitaphs for his own tombstone  such as                                                       here lie the mortal remains of     john chivery     never anything worth mentioning     who died of a broken heart  requesting with     his last breath that the word     amy     might be inscribed over his ashes     which was done by his afflicted parents                                                    old mr .  dorrit held his position among the marshalsea prisoners with great fancied dignity and received all visitors and new comers in his room like a man of society at home .  during that evening arthur called on him and treated the old man so courteously and talked to little dorrit with such kindness that she began to love him from that moment .   many things of little dorrit s pathetic story arthur learned that night .  his first surprise at finding her in the clennam house mingled strangely with his old thought that his father on his death bed seemed to be troubled by some remorseful memory  and as he slept in the gloomy prison he dreamed that the little seamstress was in some mysterious way mingled with this wrong and remorse .   there was more truth than fancy in this dream .  not knowing the true history of his parentage  and wholly ignorant of the sad life and death of the poor singer  his own unhappy mother  arthur had never heard the name dorrit .  he did not know  to be sure  that it was the name of the wealthy patron who had once educated her .  as a matter of fact  this patron had been little dorrit s own uncle  who now was living in poverty .  it was to his youngest niece that the will mrs .  clennam had wickedly hidden declared the money should go .  and as little dorrit was this niece  it rightfully belonged to her .  the real reason of mrs .  clennam s apparent kindness to little dorrit was the pricking of her conscience  which gave her no rest .   but all this arthur could not guess .  nevertheless  he had gained such an interest in the little seamstress that next day he determined to find out all he could about her father s unfortunate affairs .   he had great difficulty in this .  the government had taken charge of old mr .  dorrit s debts  and his affairs were in the hands of a department which some people sneeringly called the  circumlocution office   because it took so much time and talk for it to accomplish anything .  this department had a great many clerks  every one of whom seemed to have nothing to do but to keep people from troubling them by finding out anything .   arthur went to one clerk  who sent him to a mr .  tite barnacle  a fat  pompous man with a big collar  a big watch chain and stiff boots .  mr .  barnacle treated him quite as an outsider and would give him no information whatever .  then he tried another department  where they said they knew nothing of the matter .  still a third advised him not to bother about it .  so at last he had to give up  quite discouraged .   though he could do nothing for little dorrit s father  arthur did what he could for her lazy brother .  he paid his debts so that he was released from the marshalsea  and this kindness  though tip himself was ungrateful to the last degree  endeared him still more to little dorrit  who needed his friendship so greatly .   the night her brother was released she came to arthur to thank him  alone save for a half witted woman named maggie  who believed she herself was only ten years old  and called little dorrit  little mother   and who used to go with her when she went through the streets at night .  little dorrit was dressed so thinly and looked so slight and helpless that when she left  arthur felt as if he would like to take her up in his arms and carry her home again .   it would have been better if he had .  for when they got back to the marshalsea the prison gates had closed for the night and they had to stay out till morning .  they wandered in the cold street till nearly dawn  then a kind hearted sexton who was opening a church let them come in and made little dorrit a bed of pew cushions  and there she slept a while with a big church book for a pillow .  arthur did not know of this adventure till long afterward  for little dorrit would not tell him for fear he should blame himself for letting them go home alone .   little dorrit had one other valuable friend beside arthur at this time .  this was a rent collector named pancks  who was really kind hearted  but who was compelled to squeeze rent money out of the poor by his master .  the latter looked so good and benevolent that people called him  the patriarch   but he was at heart a genuine skinflint  for whose meanness pancks got all the credit .  pancks was a short  wiry man  with a scrubby chin and jet black eyes  and when he walked or talked he puffed and blew and snorted like a little steam engine .   little dorrit used sometimes to go to sew at the house of  the patriarch   and pancks often saw her there .  one day he greatly surprised her by asking to see the palm of her hand  and then he pretended to read her fortune .  he told her all about herself  which astonished her  for she did not know that he knew anything of her history   and then  with many mysterious puffs and winks  he told her she would finally be happy .  after that she seemed to meet pancks wherever she went  at mrs .  clennam s and at the marshalsea as well  but at such meetings he would pretend not to know her .  only sometimes  when no one else was near  he would whisper    i m pancks  the gipsy  fortune telling .     illustration  arthur clennam calling on little dorrit and her father at the marshalsea  see page       these strange actions puzzled little dorrit very much .  but she was far from guessing the truth  that pancks had for some time been interested  as had arthur clennam  in finding out how her father s affairs stood .  he had discovered thus  accidentally  that old mr .  dorrit was probably the heir at law to a great estate that had lain for years forgotten  unclaimed and growing larger all the time .  the question now was to prove this  and this  pancks  out of friendship for little dorrit  was busily trying to do .   one day the rent collector came to arthur to tell him that he had succeeded .  the proof was all found .  mr .  dorrit s right was clear  all he had to do was to sign his name to a paper  and the marshalsea gates would open and he would be free and a rich man .   arthur found little dorrit and told her the glad tidings .  they made her almost faint for joy  although all her rejoicing was for her father .  then he put her in a carriage and drove as fast as possible with her to the prison to carry her father the great news .   little dorrit told the old man with her arms around his neck  and as she clasped him  thinking that she had never yet in her life known him as he had once been  before his prison years  she cried    i shall see him as i never saw him yet  my dear love  with the dark cloud cleared away .  i shall see him  as my poor mother saw him long ago .  o my dear  my dear .  o father  father .  o thank god  thank god .    so  the father of the marshalsea  left the old prison  in which he had lived so long  and all the prisoners held a mass meeting and gave him a farewell address and a dinner .   on the last day  when they drove away from the iron gates  old mr .  dorrit was in fine  new clothing  and tip and fanny were clad in the height of fashion .  poor little dorrit  in joy for her father and grief at parting from arthur  for they were to go abroad at once   did not appear at the last moment  and arthur  who had come to see them off  hastening to her room  found that she had fainted away .  he carried her gently down to the carriage  and as he lifted her in  he saw she had put on the same thin little dress that she had worn on the day he had first seen her .   so  amid cheers and good wishes  they drove away  and arthur  as he walked back through the crowded streets  somehow felt very lonely .   iii  what riches brought to the dorrits  great changes came to old mr .  dorrit with his money .  as they traveled slowly through switzerland and into italy  he put on greater dignity daily .  he lived each day suspecting that every one was in some way trying to slight him and grew very much ashamed of his past years in the marshalsea  and forbade all mention of them .  he hired a great number of servants  and  to improve the manners of fanny and little dorrit  he employed a woman named mrs .  general  who had many silly notions of society .   little dorrit could not even say  father  without being reproved by mrs .  general .   papa is preferable  my dear   the lady would insist   and  besides  it gives a pretty form to the lips .  papa  potatoes  poultry  prunes and prisms are all good words for the lips .  you will find it serviceable in the formation of a demeanor  if you say to yourself in company  on entering a room  for instance   papa  potatoes  poultry  prunes and prisms .     fanny and tip were as spoiled as possible .  fanny  morning and night  thought of nothing but wearing costly dresses and  going into society   and tip did little but play cards and bet on horse races .  only little dorrit  through all  kept her old sweet self unchanged .   wherever they went they lived in splendid hotels .  in venice the palace they occupied was six times as big as the whole marshalsea .  mr .  dorrit  when he remembered arthur clennam at all  spoke of him as an upstart who had intruded his presence upon them in their poverty  and quickly forgot all his kindness and his efforts to help and comfort them .   but little dorrit never forgot .  her present existence seemed a dream .  she tried to care for her father as she used to do  but he was afraid people would think he had not been used to servants  foolish man .   so she lost even the little pleasure of her old prison life in the marshalsea .  there were valets and maids now to do all the little things she had once loved to do with her own hands  and she seemed to be no longer of use to him .  she loved her father as dearly as she always had  but now she had begun to feel that she could never see him as he used to be before his prison days  because first poverty and now wealth had changed him .  the old sad shadow came over her .  he grew angry at her and chid her  and hurt her .  it seemed he had entirely forgotten the old days when she slaved so for him .   poor little dorrit .  she was far lonelier now than she had ever been before in the debtors  prison  lonelier and unhappier than arthur clennam in london could have guessed .  the gay  fashionable life of her brother and sister did not attract her .  she was timid of joining in their gaieties .  she asked leave only to be left alone  and went about the city in a gondola in a quiet  scared  lost manner .  it often seemed to her as if the marshalsea must be just behind the next big building  or mrs .  clennam s house  where she had first met arthur  just around the next corner .  and she used to look into gondolas as they passed  as if she might see arthur any minute .   in the days of their prison poverty fanny had occasionally earned some money by dancing at a theater .  there she had met a silly  chuckle headed young man  the son of a mrs .  merdle  and he had been fascinated by her beauty .  now  in their wealth  he saw fanny again and fell even more deeply in love with her .  mrs .  merdle was a cold hearted  artificial woman  who kept a parrot that was always shrieking  and who thought of nothing but riches and society .  she would have refused to let her son marry fanny in the old days  but now it was another matter .  he proposed  and fanny  who had been made angry a thousand times by mrs .  merdle s insolence and patronizing ways  made up her mind to marry him if only to take her revenge on his mother .   mrs .  merdle s husband always stayed in london .  he was immensely rich  so rich that people said everything he touched turned into gold .  he was a quiet  dull man  with dull red cheeks  and cared nothing at all for society  though everybody flattered and courted him .   when old mr .  dorrit saw mrs .  merdle s son was in love with fanny he was greatly pleased .  he had by this time grown so selfish that he considered much less her happiness than his own profit  and he thought if they were married he could persuade mr .  merdle to invest his own great fortune for him  so that he would be even richer than he was now .  mr .  merdle s name had been growing bigger and bigger every day .  nobody believed the great man could make a mistake  but that he was going to keep on getting richer and richer  though nobody knew how he did it  as long as he lived .   so  before long  fanny married mrs .  merdle s son  and went back to london to take up life in the magnificent merdle mansion with her silly  chuckle headed husband .  mr .  merdle had got a very rich position for him in the  circumlocution office  with which arthur clennam had had so much trouble once on a time .   old mr .  dorrit went to london  too  and  as he had schemed  gave the famous mr .  merdle all his fortune to invest .  then he returned to italy  where  in rome  his faithful and lonely little dorrit waited lovingly for him .   on the night after he reached rome mrs .  merdle gave a dinner party to a large company  and little dorrit and her father attended .   in the midst of the dinner he suddenly called to her across the table .  his voice was so loud and excited that all the guests were frightened and rose to their feet .  little dorrit ran to him and put her arms about him  for she saw at once that he was not himself .   he began to address the company  and his first words showed that his mind had failed .  he imagined he was still in the debtors  prison and that all the rich people about him were the other poor prisoners .  he made them a speech  welcoming them to its walls  thanking them in advance for any money they might give to him as  the father of the marshalsea .   and he ended by calling for the old turnkey he had known there to help him up the narrow stair to bed  as he had been used to do in the prison .   little dorrit was not ashamed  she loved him too much for that .  her only wish was to soothe him  and with a pale  frightened face  she begged him to come with her .   they got him away at last and carried him to his house .  once laid on his bed  he never rose from it again .  nor did he regain his memory of the immediate present .  that  with its show and its servants  its riches and power  in which little dorrit had had so small a part  had faded out for ever  and now his mind  back in the marshalsea  recognized his daughter as his only stay and faithful comfort .   it was well so  for this was the father she had most loved .   so she watched beside him day and night  while every day his life grew weaker and weaker .  every day the shadow of death stole deeper and deeper over his face  until one morning  when the dawn came  they saw that he would never wake again .   iv  what happened to arthur clennam  arthur  meanwhile  had missed little dorrit greatly .  he was very friendly with a couple named meagles  a comely  healthy  good humored and kind hearted pair  and he was so lonely he almost thought himself in love with their daughter  pet  for a while .  but pet soon married a portrait painter and went to live abroad .   mr .  and mrs .  meagles had a little orphan maid whom they called  tattycoram   for no particular reason except that her first name had been hattie  and the name of the man who founded the asylum where they found her was  coram .   tattycoram had a very bad temper  so that mr .  meagles  when he saw one of these fits coming on  used to stop and say   count twenty five  tattycoram .   and tattycoram would count twenty five  and by that time the fit of temper was over .   but one day she had an attack that was very much worse than usual  so much worse that she couldn t wait to count twenty five  and ran away .  and it was a long time before they saw tattycoram again .   at mr .  meagles s house arthur met an inventor named doyce  a quiet  straightforward man  whom he soon came to like .  doyce had made a useful invention and for twelve years had been trying to bring it to the notice of the british government .  but this matter  too  had to go through the famous  circumlocution office   and so there it had stuck just as arthur s inquiry had done .   arthur having chosen no new business as yet  before long proposed a partnership between himself and doyce .  the latter agreed readily  and the new firm was established .  soon after this doyce went abroad on business  leaving arthur to manage the affairs .   all might have gone well but for the fame of mr .  merdle .  his wealth seemed so enormous  and his plans so sure  that many people throughout england  just as old mr .  dorrit had done  put their money in his care .  even pancks  the rent collector  did so  and strongly advised arthur to do the same .  convinced by such advice arthur was unhappily led to invest the money of the new firm in merdle s schemes .   one day soon after  mr .  merdle  whom every one had looked up to and respected  killed himself  and then to every one s astonishment it was found that his money was all gone  that his schemes were all exploded  and that the famous man who had dined and wined with the great was simply the greatest forger and the greatest thief that had ever cheated the gallows .   but it was too late then .  arthur s firm was utterly ruined with all the rest .  what hurt him most was the knowledge that by using the firm s money he had ruined his honest partner  doyce .   in order to set the latter as near right as he could  arthur turned over every cent of his own personal fortune to pay as much of the firm s debt as it would  keeping nothing of value but his clothes and his books .  beside doing this  he wrote out a statement  declaring that he  arthur clennam  had of his own act and against his partner s express caution  used the firm s money for this purpose  and that he alone  and not doyce  was to blame .  he declared also that his own share  if any remained out of the wreck  should go to his partner  and that he himself would work as a mere clerk  at as small a salary as he could live on .   he published this statement at once  unwisely no doubt  when all london was so enraged against merdle and glad to have some one on whom to vent its madness .  in the public anger and excitement the generosity of his act was lost sight of .  a few hours later a man who had invested some of his money in arthur s firm  and thus lost it  had him arrested for debt  and that night he entered the dismal iron gates of the marshalsea prison  not now as a visitor  but as one whom the pitiless bars locked in from liberty .   the turnkey took him up the old familiar staircase and into the old familiar room in which he had so often been .  and as he sat down in its loneliness  thinking of the fair  slight form that had dwelt in it so long  he turned his face to the wall and sobbed aloud   oh  my little dorrit .    wherever he looked he seemed to see her  and just as she herself in a foreign country found herself looking and listening for his step and voice  so  too  it was with him .   in the days that followed he thought of her all the while .  he was too depressed and too retiring and unhappy to mingle with the other prisoners  so he kept his own room and made no friends .  the rest disliked him and said he was proud or sullen .   a burning  reckless mood soon added its sufferings to his dread and hatred of the place .  the thought grew on him that he would in the end break his heart and die there .  he felt that he was being stifled  and at times the longing to be free made him believe he must go mad .  a week of this suffering found him in his bed in the grasp of a slow  wasting fever .  he felt light headed and delirious  and heard tunes playing that he knew were only in his brain .   one day when he had dragged himself to his chair by the window  the door of his room seemed to open to a quiet figure  which dropped a mantle it wore  then it seemed to be little dorrit in her old dress  and it seemed first to smile and then to burst into tears .   he roused himself  and all at once he saw that it was no dream .  she was really there  kneeling by him now with her tears falling on his hands and her voice crying   oh  my best friend .  don t let me see you weep .  i am your own poor child come back .    no one had told her he was ill  for she had just returned from italy .  she made the room fresh and neat  sewed a white curtain for its window  and sent out for grapes  roast chicken and jellies  and every good thing .  she sat by him all day  smoothing his hot pillow or giving him a cooling drink .   though he had been strangely blind  he knew at last that she must have loved him all along .  and to find her great heart turned to him thus in his misfortune made him realize that during all those months in the lonely prison he had been loving her  too  though he had not known it .   a feeling of peace came to him .  whenever he opened his eyes he saw her at his side  the same trusting little dorrit that he had always known .   v   all s well that ends well   all the while these things were happening  mrs .  clennam and flintwinch had continued their grim partnership .   mrs .  clennam at last decided to burn the part of the will she had hidden  so that her share in the wicked plan could never be found out .  flintwinch  however  wishing for his own purposes to keep her in his power  deceived her .  he cunningly put in its place a worthless piece of paper  and this mrs .  clennam burned instead .  flintwinch then locked up the real piece in an iron box  with a lot of private letters that had been written by the poor crazed singer to mrs .  clennam  begging her forgiveness .  the box he gave to his brother  who took it to holland with him for safe keeping .   but flintwinch  in this deception  overreached himself .   there was an adventurer in holland named rigaud  who used to drink and smoke with this brother .  he was an oily villain  who had been in jail in france on suspicion of having murdered his wife .  he had shaggy dry hair streaked with red  and a thick mustache  and when he smiled his eyes went close together  his mustache went up under his hooked nose  and his nose came down over his mustache .  rigaud saw the box  concluded it contained something valuable  and made up his mind to get it .  his chance came when the brother of flintwinch died suddenly one day  and he lost no time in making away with the iron box .   by means of the letters it contained  he soon guessed the secret which mrs .  clennam had been for so many years at such pains to conceal  and  deciding that by this knowledge he could squeeze money out of her  he came to london to find and threaten her .   but she  believing she had burned the part of the will which rigaud claimed to possess  refused to listen to him  until at last  maddened by her refusals  he searched out the dorrits .   he soon discovered that the man who had educated the singer  arthur s real mother  was frederick dorrit  little dorrit s dead uncle  and that it was little dorrit herself  since she was his youngest niece  from whom the money was now being unjustly kept .   rigaud easily found little dorrit  for she was now in the marshalsea nursing arthur  where he lay sick  and to her the cunning adventurer sent a copy of the paper in a sealed packet  asking her  if it was not reclaimed before the prison closed that same night  to open and read it herself .   he then went to the clennam house  told mrs .  clennam and flintwinch what he had done and demanded money at once as the price of his reclaiming the packet before little dorrit should learn the secret it held .   at this flintwinch had to confess what he had done  and mrs .  clennam knew that the fatal paper had not been burned  after all .   the wretched woman  seeing this sharp end to all her scheming  was almost distracted .  she had not walked a step for twelve years  but now her excitement and frenzy gave her unnatural strength .  she rose from her invalid chair and ran with all her speed from the house .  old affery  the servant  followed her mistress  wringing her hands as she tried vainly to overtake her .   mrs .  clennam did not pause till she had reached the prison and found little dorrit .  she told her to open the packet at once and to read what it contained  and then  kneeling at her feet  she promised to restore to her all she had withheld  and begged her to forgive and to come back with her to tell rigaud that she already knew the secret and that he might do his worst .   little dorrit was greatly moved to see the stern  gray haired woman at her feet .  she raised and comforted her  assuring her that  come what would  arthur should never learn the truth from her lips .  this return of good for evil from the one she had most injured brought the tears to the hard woman s eyes .   god bless you   she said in a broken voice .   side by side they hastened back to the clennam house  but as they reached the entrance of its dark courtyard there came a sudden noise like thunder .  for one instant they saw the building  with the insolent rigaud waiting smoking in the window  then the walls heaved  surged outward  opened and fell into pieces .  its great pile of chimneys rocked  broke and tumbled on the fragments  and only a huge mass of timbers and stone  with a cloud of dust hovering over it  marked the spot where it had stood .   the rotten old building  propped up so long  had fallen at last .  for years old affery had insisted that the house was haunted .  she had often heard mysterious rustlings and noises  and in the mornings sometimes she would find little heaps of dust on the floors .  curious  crooked cracks would appear  too  in the walls  and the doors would stick with no apparent reason .  these things  of course  had been caused by the gradual settling of the crazy walls and timbers  which now finally had collapsed all at once .   frightened  they ran back to the street and there mrs .  clennam s strange strength left her  and she fell in a heap upon the pavement .   she never from that hour was able to speak a word or move a finger .  she lived for three years in a wheel chair  but she lived  and died  like a statue .   for two days workmen dug industriously in the ruins before they found the body of rigaud  with his head smashed to atoms beneath a huge beam .   they dug longer than that for the body of flintwinch  and stopped at last when they came to the conclusion that he was not there .  by that time  however  he had had a chance to get together all of the firm s money he could lay his hands on and to decamp .  he was never seen again in england  but travelers claimed to have seen him in holland  where he lived comfortably under the name of  mynheer von flyntevynge   which is  after all  about as near as one can come to saying  flintwinch  in dutch .   no one grieved greatly over his loss .  it was long before arthur knew of these events  and little dorrit was too happy in nursing him back to health to think much about it .   she was not content with this  either  but wrote to mr .  and mrs .  meagles  who were abroad  of the sick man s misfortune .  the former went at once in search of doyce and brought him back to london  where together they set the firm of  doyce and clennam  on its feet again and arranged to buy arthur s liberty .  they did not tell arthur anything of this  however  in order that they might surprise him .   mr .  meagles  for little dorrit s sake  tried hard to find the fragment of the will which rigaud had kept in the iron box .  but it was tattycoram  the little maid with the bad temper  who finally found it in a lodging rigaud had occupied  and brought it to mr .  meagles  praying on her knees that he take her back into his service  which  to be sure  he was very glad to do .   arthur  while he was slowly growing better  had thought much of his condition .  though little dorrit had begged him again and again to take her money and use it as his own  he had refused  telling her as gently as he could that now that she was rich and he a ruined man  this could never be  and that  as the time had long gone by when she and the marshalsea had anything in common  they two must soon part .   one day  however  when he was well enough to sit up  little dorrit came to his room in the prison and told him she had received a very great fortune and asked him again if he would not take it .    never   he told her .    you will not take even half of it .   she asked pleadingly .    never  dear little dorrit .   he said emphatically .   then  at last  she laid her face on his breast crying    i have nothing in the world .  i am as poor as when i lived here in the marshalsea .  i have just found that papa gave all we had to mr .  merdle and it is swept away with the rest .  my great fortune now is poverty  because it is all you will take .  oh  my dearest and best  are you quite sure you will not share my fortune with me now .    he had locked her in his arms  and his tears were falling on her cheek as she said joyfully    i never was rich before  or proud  or happy .  i would rather pass my life here in prison with you  and work daily for my bread  than to have the greatest fortune that ever was told and be the greatest lady that ever was honored .    but arthur s prison life was to be short .  for mr .  meagles and doyce burst upon them with all the other good news at once .  arthur was free  the firm had been re  stablished with him at its head  and to morrow the debtors  prison would be only a memory .   next morning  before they left the marshalsea for ever  little dorrit handed arthur a folded paper  and asked him to please her by putting it into the fire with his own hand .    is it a charm .   he asked .    it is anything you like best   she answered  standing on tiptoe to kiss him .   only say  i love you  as you do it .    he said it  and the paper burned away .  and so the will that had been the cause of so much pain and wrong was turned to ashes .  little dorrit kept the promise she had made  and arthur never learned of the sin of which the woman he had always called his mother had been guilty .   then  when all good bys had been said  they walked together to the very same church where little dorrit had slept on the cushions the night she had been locked out of the marshalsea  and there she and arthur were married .  doyce gave the bride away .   and among the many who came to witness the wedding were not only pancks  and maggie  the half witted woman  but even a group of little dorrit s old turnkey friends from the prison  among whom was the disconsolate chivery  who had so long solaced himself by composing epitaphs for his own tombstone  and who went home to meditate over his last inscription                                                         stranger .  respect the tomb of     john chivery  junior     who died at an advanced age not necessary to     mention .  he encountered his rival and     felt inclined     to have a round with him      but  for the sake of the loved one  conquered     those feelings of bitterness and became     magnanimous                                                                   life and adventures of martin chuzzlewit  published

chuzzlewit was the grandson of an old man who  from being poor  became so rich that he found not only that people bowed low and flattered him  but that many of his relatives were trying by every trick to get some of his money .   the old man was naturally suspicious and obstinate  and when he saw this he began to distrust everybody and to think the whole world selfish and deceitful .  he had loved most of all his grandson  martin  but at length his heart became hardened to him also .   this was partly martin s own fault  for he was somewhat selfish  but he had  nevertheless  a great deal of good in him .  and perhaps his selfishness was partly his grandfather s fault  too  because the latter had brought him up to believe he would inherit all his money and would sometime be very rich .   at last  ill and grown suspicious of every one he met  old chuzzlewit gave a home to a beautiful orphan girl named mary graham  and kept her near him as his nurse and secretary .  in order that she might not have any selfish interest in being kind to him  he took an oath in her presence that he would not leave her a cent when he died .  he paid her monthly wages and it was agreed that there should be no affection shown between them .   in spite of his seeming harshness  mary knew his heart was naturally kind  and she soon loved him as a father .  and he  softened by her sympathy  came in spite of himself to love her as a daughter .   it was not long before young martin  too  had fallen very deeply in love with mary .  he concluded too hastily  however  that his grandfather would not approve of his marrying her  and told the old man his intentions in such a fiery way that chuzzlewit resented it .   the old man accused martin of a selfish attempt to steal from him mary s care  and at this  martin  whose temper was as quick as his grandfather s flew to anger .  they quarreled and martin left him  declaring he would henceforth make his own way until he was able to claim mary for his wife .   while he was wondering what he should do  martin saw in a newspaper the advertisement of a mr .  pecksniff  an architect  living near salisbury  not many miles from london  who wished a pupil to board and teach .  an architect was what martin wanted to be  and he answered the advertisement at once and accepted pecksniff s terms .   now  to tell the truth  martin had another reason for this .  pecksniff was his grandfather s cousin  and he knew the old man thought him the worst hypocrite of all his relatives  and disliked him accordingly .  and martin was so angry with his grandfather that he went to pecksniff s partly to vex him .   pecksniff was just the man old chuzzlewit thought him .  he was a smooth  sleek hypocrite  with an oily manner .  he had heavy eyelids and a wide  whiskerless throat  and when he talked he fairly oozed virtuous sayings  for which people deemed him a most moral and upright man .  he was a widower with two daughters  charity and mercy  the older of whom had a very bitter temper  which made it hard for the few students as long as they stayed there .   after pecksniff had once got a pupil s money in advance  he made no pretense of teaching him .  he kept him drawing designs for buildings  and that was all .  if any of the designs were good  he said nothing to the pupil  but sold them as his own  and pocketed the money .  his pupils soon saw through him and none of them had ever stayed long except one .   this one was named tom pinch .  he had been poor and mr .  pecksniff had pretended to take him in at a reduced rate .  but really pinch paid as much as the others  beside being a clever fellow who made himself useful in a thousand ways .  he was a musician  too  and played the organ in the village church  which was a credit to pecksniff .   with all this  pinch was a generous  open hearted lad  who believed every one honest and true  and he was so grateful to pecksniff  whose hypocrisy he never imagined  that he was always singing his praises everywhere .  in return for all this  pecksniff treated him with contempt and made him quite like a servant .   tom pinch  however  was a favorite with every one else .  he had a sister ruth who loved him dearly  but he seldom saw her  for she was a governess in the house of a brass and iron founder  who did not like her to have company .  one of tom s greatest friends had been a pupil named john westlock  who in vain had tried to open the other s eyes to pecksniff s real character .  when westlock came into his money he had left and gone to live in london  and it was to take his vacant place that the new pupil martin was now coming .   another friend of pinch s was mark tapley  a rakish  good humored fellow  whose one ambition was to find a position so uncomfortable and dismal that he would get some credit for being jolly in it .  tapley was an assistant at the blue dragon  the village inn  whose plump  rosy landlady was so fond of him that he might have married her if he had chosen to .  but  as tapley said  there was no credit in being jolly where he was so comfortable  so he left the blue dragon and went off  too  to london .   with neither westlock nor mark tapley there tom pinch was lonely and welcomed the arrival of martin  with whom he soon made friends .  mr .  pecksniff folded his new pupil to his breast  shed a crocodile tear and set him to work designing a grammar school .   old chuzzlewit soon heard where martin his grandson was  and wrote to pecksniff asking him to meet him in london .  pecksniff was so anxious to curry favor with the rich old man that  taking his daughters with him  he left at once for london  where they put up at a boarding house kept by a mrs .  todgers  while pecksniff awaited the arrival of old chuzzlewit .   mrs .  todgers s house smelled of cabbage and greens and mice  and mrs .  todgers herself was bony and wore a row of curls on the front of her head like little barrels of flour .  but a number of young men boarded there  and charity and mercy enjoyed themselves very much .   one whom they met on this trip to london was a remote relative of theirs  a nephew of old chuzzlewit s  named jonas .  jonas s father was eighty years old and a miser  and the son  too  was so mean and grasping that he often used to wish his father were dead so he would have his money .   the old father  indeed  would have had no friend in his own house but for an old clerk  chuffey  who had been his schoolmate in boyhood and had always lived with him .  chuffey was as old and dusty and rusty as if he had been put away and forgotten fifty years before and some one had just found him in a lumber closet .  but in his own way chuffey loved his master .   jonas called on the two pecksniff daughters  and charity  the elder  determined to marry him .  jonas  however  had his own opinion  and made up his mind to marry mercy  her younger sister .   before long old chuzzlewit reached london  and when pecksniff called he told him his grandson  martin  was an ingrate  who had left his protection  and asked the architect not to harbor him .  pecksniff  who worshiped the other s money and would have betrayed his best friend for old chuzzlewit s favor  returned home instantly  heaped harsh names upon martin and ordered him to leave his house at once .   martin guessed what had caused pecksniff to change his mind so suddenly  and with hearty contempt for his truckling action  he left that very hour in the rain  though he had only a single silver piece in his pocket .  tom pinch  in great grief for his trouble  ran after him with a book as a parting gift  and between its leaves martin found another silver piece  all tom had .   most of the way to london martin walked .  once there he took a cheap lodging  and tried to find some vessel on which he could work his passage to america  for there  as he walked  he had made up his mind to go .  but he found no such opportunity .  his money gone  he pawned first his watch and then his other belongings  one by one  until he had nothing left  and was even in distress for food .   yet his pride was strong  and he gave what was almost his last coin to escape the attentions of one montague tigg  a dirty  jaunty  bold  mean  swaggering  slinking vagabond of the shabby genteel sort  whom he recognized as one who had more than once tried to squeeze money out of his grandfather .   at last  when he was almost in despair  a surprise came in the shape of an envelop addressed to himself  containing no letter  but a bank note for a generous amount .  there was no clue whatever to the sender  but the sum was enough to pay his passage and he determined therefore to sail next day .   while he was still wondering at this good luck  martin chanced to come upon mark tapley  the old assistant at the blue dragon inn .  tapley had found london too pleasant a place to be jolly in with any credit  and  as he had heard america was a very dismal place  he proposed to go with martin .   as it happened  tapley knew that mary graham was then in london  for he had seen old chuzzlewit going into his house .  when martin learned this he sent a letter to her by tapley  and she met him next morning in a little park near by .  there he told her of his leaving pecksniff s and of his coming voyage .   she was very sorrowful over his departure  but he cheered her by telling her he would soon return  well and prosperous  for her .  she told him that pecksniff seemed somehow to have made his grandfather trust him  and that by his advice they were both to move to the blue dragon inn  near his house .  martin told her of pecksniff s true character  warned her against him  and begged her to trust in tom pinch as a true friend .  so they parted  pledging each other their love whatever befell .   before martin left next day mary sent him a diamond ring  which he thought his grandfather had given her  but for which in reality she had paid all her savings  so that he should have with him something of value to sell if he be in want .   so martin and mark tapley took ship for america  and mary graham and old chuzzlewit went to live at the blue dragon  to the huge satisfaction of the oily pecksniff  who thought now he could easily get the rich old man under his thumb .   ii  pecksniff and old chuzzlewit  after his first burst of anger at martin s leaving him  old chuzzlewit  to mary s eyes  seemed to grow gradually a different man .  he appeared more old and stooped and deaf  and took little interest in anything .   after they came to the blue dragon inn  pecksniff threw himself constantly in old chuzzlewit s way  flattering and smooth  and before long mary saw  to her grief  that the old man was coming more and more under the other s influence .  when she was alone with him he seemed more his former eager self  but let pecksniff appear and the strange dull look would come and he would seem only anxious to ask his advice about the smallest matters .   little wonder pecksniff concluded he could wind his victim around his finger .  at length he proposed that old chuzzlewit and mary leave the blue dragon  where he said he felt sure they were not comfortable  and come and live with him under his own roof .  to mary s dismay  the old man consented  and they were soon settled in the architect s house .   the only thing that now seemed to stand in pecksniff s way was mary  and he decided that  as old chuzzlewit was fond of her  he himself would marry her .  once married to her  he reasoned  with both of them to influence old chuzzlewit  it would be easy to do what they pleased with him and with his money  too .  with this end in view  he began to persecute poor mary with his attentions  squeezing her hand and throwing kisses to her when no one else was looking .   charity  pecksniff s older daughter  was not blind to his plan .  she was in a sour temper because the miserly jonas  who came from london often now to see them  had begun to make love to mercy instead of to her .  to see her father now paying so much attention to mary graham made charity angry  and she left her father s house and went to live in london at mrs .  todgers s boarding house  where she set her cap to catch a young man  whether he wanted to be caught or not .  as for mercy  the younger sister  she was leading jonas such a dance that she thought very little of her father s schemes .   his vinegary daughter charity out of the way  pecksniff began to persecute mary more and more .  one day he made her so angry by holding her hand and kissing it that she threatened to complain to old chuzzlewit .  pecksniff told her that if she did he would use all his influence to turn the old man still more against his grandson .  the poor girl was in great trouble then  for she loved martin and feared pecksniff s growing power with old chuzzlewit .  and seeing that this threat frightened her  pecksniff continued his annoyances .   according to martin s parting advice  mary had learned to like and to trust tom pinch  in spite of his mistaken worship of pecksniff .  one day while tom was practising the organ at the church she came to him and  confiding in him  told all that she had endured .   in his simple heartedness he had admired and looked up to pecksniff all his life  but this evidence opened tom pinch s eyes .  at last he saw the pompous hypocrite in his true light .  he agreed with her that the architect was a scoundrel  and comforted her  and asked her always to trust in his own friendship .   unluckily while they talked there was an eavesdropper near .  it was pecksniff himself .  he had gone into the church to rest  and lying down in one of the high back pews  had gone to sleep  and now the voices of tom and mary had awakened him .  he listened and waited till they had both gone  then he stole out and went home by a roundabout way .   that night he went to old chuzzlewit and  pretending to shed tears of sorrow  told him he had overheard tom pinch  the pauper pupil  whom he had trusted and befriended  making love to mary  the old man s ward  in the church .  making a great show of his respect and regard for old chuzzlewit  he told him this villain should not remain under his roof one night longer .  then he called in tom pinch and  abusing and insulting him in chuzzlewit s presence  sent him away as he had sent away martin .   tom was feeling so bad over his loss of faith in his idol  pecksniff  that he did not greatly mind this last blow .  in fact  he had about concluded he could not live any longer with such a wicked hypocrite anyway .  he packed his things and set off for london  feeling almost as if the world had come to an end .   once there  however  he plucked up spirit and felt better .  first of all he looked up westlock  the former pupil of pecksniff s  and found him the same friendly  clever fellow now in his riches as he was of old .  westlock was glad tom had at last found his master out  and began at once to plan for his future .  next tom went to see his sister ruth at the house where she was governess .   he arrived there at a fortunate time  for the vulgar brass and iron founder who had hired her to try to teach his spoiled little daughter was at that moment scolding ruth harshly for what was not her fault at all .   tom had been gaining a spirit of his own since he had parted from pecksniff  and  now  at sight of his gentle little sister s tears  his honest indignation rose .  he gave her unjust employer a lecture that left him much astonished  and then  drawing ruth s arm through his  he led her from the house for ever .   it was not long before each had told the other all that had happened .  tom decided that they should part no more  and they set out together to find a lodging .  they took some rooms in a quiet neighborhood and settled down together till tom could find something to do .   ruth was a neat housekeeper  but she had to learn to cook  and they had great fun over their first meal .  while she was making her first beefsteak pudding westlock called with a great piece of news .  an agent had come to him asking him to offer to his friend tom pinch a position as a librarian at a good salary .  who the employer was tom was not to know .  here was a rare mystery  and ruth in her mingled excitement and pie making looked so sweet and charming that then and there westlock fell in love with her .   tom and he went at once to the agent who had made this extraordinary offer  and he took them to an unoccupied house  to a dusty room whose floor was covered all over with books .  tom  he said  was to arrange and make a list of these .  then he gave him the key  told him to come to him each week for his salary  and disappeared .   still wondering  the two friends went back together  for of course westlock had to taste the beefsteak pudding .  ruth had supper waiting for them .  every minute westlock thought she grew more lovely  and as he walked home he knew he was in love at last .   now  the mystery of tom s library  and of the bank note that martin had received when his money was all gone  would have been a very joyful one to them both if they could have guessed it .  old chuzzlewit  whom they believed so harsh  and whom the wily pecksniff thought he had got under his thumb  was a very deep and knowing old man indeed .  he had never ceased to love martin  his grandson  though he had misunderstood him at first  but he had seen very plainly that the lad was growing selfish and he wished to save him from this .  he had longed for nothing more than that martin and mary should marry  but he wished to try their love for each other as well as martin s affection for him .  it was to test pecksniff that old chuzzlewit had asked the architect to send martin from his house  and when he saw that pecksniff was fawning hound enough to do it  he determined to punish him in the end .  it was old chuzzlewit who had found where martin lodged in london  and had sent him the bank note .  and  won by tom pinch s goodness and honor  it was he who now  secretly  made him this position .  if pecksniff had guessed all this  he would probably have had a stroke of apoplexy .   iii  jonas gets rid of an enemy  jonas  meanwhile  in his miserly soul  had been wishing that his old father would hurry and die .  he wanted the money and he wanted to marry mercy pecksniff  and to do both he preferred the old man out of his way .  he thought of this and wished it so long that at last he began to think of helping the matter along .   his father kept in a drawer some cough lozenges which he constantly used .  jonas at last bought some poison from a dissipated man who needed money badly  and made some lozenges like them .  these he put in his father s drawer instead of the others .   his father  however  and chuffey  the old clerk  noticed that the lozenges were not the same  and they guessed what jonas had done .  the shock of discovering that his own son had tried to murder him proved the old man s death .  he made chuffey promise not to betray jonas  then fell in a fit and never spoke again .   jonas naturally thought the poison had done the work  and was at first in dreadful fear of discovery .  he made a fine funeral  with four horse coaches  velvet trappings and silver plate  so that people would think he loved his father  and not till the body was buried did he forget his dread .   chuffey  however  seemed to go almost daft .  he would walk and cry and wring his hands and talk so strangely about his master s death that jonas feared he would cause suspicion that all was not right .  so he hired a nurse to come and keep him in his room .   this nurse went by the name of  sairey  gamp .  she was a fat old woman  with a red face  a husky voice and a moist eye  which often turned up so as to show only the white .  wherever she went she carried a faded umbrella with a round white patch on top  and she always smelled of whisky .  mrs .  gamp was fond of talking of a certain  mrs .  harris   whom she spoke of as a dear friend  but whom nobody else had ever seen .  when she wanted to say something nice of herself she would put it in the mouth of mrs .  harris .  she was always quoting   i says to mrs .  harris   or  mrs .  harris says to me .   people used to say there was no such person at all  but this never failed to make mrs .  gamp very angry .   she was a cruel nurse  and her way of making a sick man swallow a dose of medicine was by choking him till he gasped and then putting the spoon down his throat .   such was the guardian jonas chose to keep old chuffey quiet in london  while he himself courted pecksniff s daughter at her father s house .  and it was not very long before he proposed to mercy and they were married .   if pecksniff had searched london he could not have found a worse man for his daughter to marry .  but pecksniff cared for nothing but money  and  as jonas was now rich  he pretended great love for his new son in law and went around with his hands clasped and his eyes lifted to heaven in pious thankfulness .  as for jonas  he began to treat mercy brutally and soon she was miserable .   jonas  meanwhile  had fallen in with a very prosperous individual .  this was none other than montague tigg  the bold  jaunty  swaggering  shabby genteel tigg  who had once been glad to beg a coin from any one he knew .  now he had changed in both appearance and name .  his face was covered with glossy black whiskers  his clothes were the costliest and his jewelry the most expensive .  he was known now as  mr .  tigg montague   and was president of the great  anglo bengalee company .    the anglo bengalee company was a business which pretended to insure people s lives .  it had fine offices with new furniture  new paper and a big brass plate on the door .  it looked most solid and respectable  but it was really a trap  for tigg and its other officers were only waiting until they had taken in enough money to run away with it to a foreign country .  jonas  sharp as he was  was deceived into believing it an honest enterprise .  he came there to get his wife s life insured  and so he met tigg .   tigg  however  knowing jonas of old  knew he had a great deal of money of his own  and thought  too  that he might influence mr .  pecksniff  now his father in law .  tigg flattered jonas accordingly  telling him what a sharp man he was and offered to make him a director in the company .  he assured jonas that there would be enormous profits and showed him how  by putting his own money into it  he could cheat other people out of much more .  this idea tickled jonas and he agreed .   having got thus far  tigg hired a spy named nadgett to see if he could discover whether jonas had ever committed any crime  the knowledge of which would put him in their power .  nadgett began his work  got on the right side of sairey gamp  the nurse  found out that old chuffey was locked up for fear he might talk  and soon had a suspicion that jonas had been concerned in his father s death .   as an experiment tigg boldly charged him with it one day  and knew in an instant  by the way jonas s face whitened with fear  that he had stumbled on the truth .  he then told jonas he not only must put into the company more of his own money  but must persuade pecksniff to do likewise .   jonas dared not now refuse .  he thought of escaping to some other country  but wherever he turned he found tigg s spies watching  and at last  he determined on a second murder to hide the first  the murder of tigg  who knew his secret .   tigg did not forget his plan to ensnare pecksniff .  to do this he took jonas by carriage from london to salisbury and  mile by mile  as they sped  the latter laid his plans .  near their destination accident came near assisting him .  in the storm the carriage was upset and tigg was thrown under the horses  feet .  jonas lashed the struggling horses  hoping they would trample and kill his companion  but the driver pulled him out just in time .   they finally reached the blue dragon inn  and there  the next day  jonas brought pecksniff to dine with tigg  and the latter told the architect all about his wonderful company .  though pecksniff pretended he took the idea as a joke  yet the thought of cheating other people for big profits was very attractive to him .  before the evening was over he had fallen into the trap and had promised next day to give tigg his money .   jonas  his part of the bargain finished  hurried back to london .  there  after telling mercy not to disturb him  as he expected to sleep all next day  he locked himself into his room .  when it was dark he dressed himself in a rough suit that he had prepared for disguise  let himself out by a rear way and took the stage back again to the village where he had left tigg with pecksniff .   he lay in wait in a wood through which tigg passed after his last call on the architect  and there he killed him with a club .  then he went swiftly back to london and let himself into his room again  thinking no one had noticed his absence .   but there had been an eye at the shutter of the window in the house opposite that did not fail to observe jonas when he went and when he came .  and this eye belonged to nadgett  the spy .   iv  what came of martin s trip to america  while these things were occurring  much had happened to martin and mark tapley far away in america .   the sailing vessel on which they crossed was crowded and dirty  and in order to save their money they had taken passage in the steerage .  for a long time martin was very seasick  and even when he grew better he was so ashamed at having to travel in the worst and cheapest part of the vessel that he would not go on deck .   but tapley had none of this false pride .  he made friends with all  helped every one he could and soon became such a general favorite that  as he thought sadly  he was having much too good a time for him to be jolly with any credit .   the long voyage of so many weeks came to an end at last  and they reached new york .  they found it a strange place indeed  and met many strange characters in it .  only one they met pleased them  a gentleman named bevan  and from him they got much information and advice .  there seemed  however  to be little opening for an architect in new york  and martin at length decided to go west and settle in some newer region .   in the western town where they left the train they found a land agent who was selling lots in a new settlement  on the mississippi river  called eden .  to buy their railway tickets martin had already sold the ring mary graham had given him  and he had just enough to purchase a tract of land in eden and to pay their fare there .   martin looked at the agent s splendid plans of the new town  showing wharves  churches and public buildings  and thought it a capital place for a young architect  so they closed the bargain without more ado and took the next steamer down the desolate mississippi .   a terrible disappointment awaited them when they found what eden really was  a handful of rotting log cabins set in a swamp .  the wharves and public buildings existed only on the agent s map with which he had so cruelly cheated them .  there were only a few wan men alive there  the rest had succumbed to the sickly hot vapor that rose from the swamp and hung in the air .  at the sight of what they had come to  martin lay down and wept in very despair .  but for his comrade s cheerfulness he would have wholly given up hope .   next morning martin found himself in the grip of the deadly fever with which the place reeked  and for many days thereafter he lay helpless and burning  nursed like a child by the faithful mark tapley .  when he had begun to recover it came the other s turn to fall ill and martin took his place at nursing .   through all tapley never complained .  at last he found himself in circumstances where to be jolly was really a credit to anybody .  he always insisted that he was in great spirits  and when he was weakest and could not speak he wrote  jolly  on a slate for martin to see .   watching beside his friend day by day  martin came to know himself truly and to see his own selfishness .  as he nursed tapley to health again he determined to root it out of his nature and to return to england a nobler man .  he began to think not of what he had sacrificed for mary  but of what she would have sacrificed for him  and to wish with all his heart that he had not parted from his grandfather in anger .  and even before tapley was able to sit up martin had determined to return as soon as possible to england .   he laid aside his pride and wrote to bevan  who had befriended them in new york  to borrow money enough to bring them both to that city .  once there  tapley found a position as cook in the same ship that had brought them from england and his wages proved sufficient to pay for martin s passage .   so martin started back to the home he had parted from a year before  poorer than he had left it  but at heart a better and a sounder man .  his false pride was gone now .  he mingled with others and helped them  and by the time they landed he was as popular a passenger as mark tapley was a cook .   almost the first man they saw on landing  curiously enough  was the oily pecksniff .  they saw him escorted along the street  pointed out by the crowds as  the great architect .   on that day the corner stone of a splendid public building was to be laid  and pecksniff s design for this structure had taken the prize .  the two comrades went with the crowd to hear pecksniff s speech  and looking over a gentleman s shoulder at a picture of the building as it was to look  martin saw that it was the very grammar school he himself had designed when he had first come to pecksniff s .  the old rascal had stolen the plans .   martin was angry  of course  but there was no help for it  and besides he had other things to think of .  mary graham  to be sure  was his first thought  and he and tapley set out at once for the blue dragon to learn the latest news .   the rosy landlady laughed and cried together to see them and mark tapley kissed her so many times that she was quite out of breath .  she cooked the finest dinner in the world for them and told them all she knew about their friends  how tom pinch had been sent away  and how every one said that pecksniff intended to marry mary .  this news made martin grind his teeth  and it would have been unlucky for the architect if he had been near at that moment .   martin first sent tapley with a note addressed to his grandfather  but pecksniff  who came to the door  tore up the letter before the bearer s face .  mark told martin of this  and together they forced themselves into the house  and into the room where old chuzzlewit sat  with pecksniff beside him  and mary standing behind his chair .   martin s grandfather hardly looked at him  keeping his eyes on pecksniff s face  as though he depended on him even for his thoughts .  martin  seeing this  was almost hopeless  but he did as he had determined  and in a few manly words begged old chuzzlewit s pardon for his own haste and temper  and asked him to take him back to his favor .  while he talked  mary had hidden her face in her hands and was weeping  for she believed his grandfather so wholly in pecksniff s power that she had no hope for martin .   pecksniff was in rare good humor  for it was this very day that he had turned his money over to tigg to make a fortune for him in the great anglo bengalee company .  now  rejoicing in his opportunity  he took it upon himself to answer .  he called martin a shameless  cowardly vagabond and ordered him from the door .  then he gave his arm to the old man and led him out of the room .   martin clasped mary for a moment in his arms as he kissed her and told her to keep up heart .  then he left the house and set out with mark tapley for london .   v  old chuzzlewit s plot succeeds  where was the guilty jonas meanwhile .  shivering at every sound  listening for the news that tigg s body had been found in the wood  wondering if by any chance the crime might be laid on him .   already fate was weaving a net about his feet .  the man from whom he had bought the poison to kill his father had fallen very ill  and in his illness had repented of the part he had played .  he had confessed to westlock  whom  before he had fallen into wicked company  he had once known .  westlock sent for old chuzzlewit  and he  too  was told the story of the purchased poison .  then together the three went to jonas s house and brought him face to face with his accuser .   confronted with their evidence jonas gave himself up for lost  but old chuffey  whom he had so abused  escaped the watchful eye of sairey gamp and entered just in time to keep his promise to his dead master and to clear jonas  the son .  he told them how it had really happened  how jonas had intended to kill his father but how the latter s death had been due  not to the poison which he had never taken  but to the knowledge of his son s wickedness .   jonas  in the reaction from his fear  laughed aloud  and was abusively ordering them to leave  when the door opened and the color suddenly left his cheeks .  policemen stood there  and at their head was nadgett  the spy .   in another moment there were handcuffs on his wrists and he knew not only that the murder of tigg had been discovered  but that every action of his own on that fatal night had been traced and that he was surely doomed to die on the gallows .   when he realized that he was lost he fell to the floor in pitiable fear .  they put him in a wagon to take him to jail  but when they arrived there they found him motionless in his seat .  he had swallowed some of his own poison which he carried in his pocket  and was as dead as any hangman could have made him .   old chuzzlewit had yet another purpose to carry out before he left london  and for this purpose he asked westlock to meet him in his rooms at a certain time next day .  he sent for tom pinch and his sister ruth  for his grandson martin  and mark tapley  and last  but not least  for pecksniff himself  all to meet him there at the same hour .   all save pecksniff arrived together  and greatly astonished most of them were  you may be sure  to see old chuzzlewit so changed .  for now the dull  bent look had vanished .  his eyes were bright  his form erect and every feature eager and full of purpose .  even mary graham scarcely knew what to make of it .   as they sat wondering and waiting for old chuzzlewit to speak  pecksniff came hurriedly in  to start back as if at a shock of electricity .  but he recovered himself  and clasped his hands with a look of pious joy to see the old man safe and well .  then he looked around him and shook his head .    oh  vermin .  oh  bloodsuckers .   he said .   horde of unnatural plunderers and robbers .  begone .  leave him and do not stay in a spot hallowed by the gray hairs of this patriarchal gentleman .    he advanced with outstretched arms  but he had not seen how tightly old chuzzlewit s hand clasped the walking stick he held .  the latter  in one great burst of indignation  rose up  and with a single blow  stretched him on the ground .  mark tapley dragged him into a corner and propped him against the wall  and in this ridiculous position  cringing  and with his assurance all gone  pecksniff listened  as did they all  to the old man s story .   he told the assembled company how the curse of selfishness had seemed to him always to rest upon his family .  how he had misunderstood martin  his best loved grandson  and how he had seen pecksniff doing his best to add to this bad feeling .  he beckoned martin to him and put mary s hand in his  as he told how he had tested them both and had at last resolved to see to what a length the hypocrisy of pecksniff would lead him .  how to this end he had pretended feebleness of mind and had planned and plotted finally to expose pecksniff and set all right .   when he had finished the door was opened and pecksniff  looking all shrunken and frowsy and yellow  passed out  never to enter again into the lives of any of them .   there was a great and joyful gathering that night  when all these  so strangely united  took dinner together .  martin sat beside mary  while westlock walked home with ruth  and before they reached there she had promised to be his wife .   martin and mary were married soon  and old chuzzlewit made martin his heir .  he also gave a home to poor mercy  the wife of the dead jonas .  tom pinch lived a long and happy life in the home which westlock made for ruth  where he had a fine organ on which he played every day .  mark tapley  of course  married the rosy landlady of the blue dragon  and settled down at the inn  which he renamed the jolly tapley .   charity pecksniff succeeded in ensnaring her young man at last .  the day they were to be married  however  he did not come to the church  but ran off to van diemen s land  and she lived and died a vinegary  shrewish old maid .   as for pecksniff himself  having lost all his money in the anglo bengalee company  which  of course  went to pieces on tigg s death   he sank lower and lower  till at last  a drunken  squalid old man  he eked out a miserable existence writing whining begging letters to the very people whom he had once labored so hard to make unhappy .

schoolmaster  mr .  venus a dismal young man with a dismal trade  the stringing together of human skeletons on wires             our mutual friend  i  what happened to john harmon  in london there once lived an old man named harmon who had made a great fortune by gathering the dust and ashes of the city and sorting it for whatever it contained of value .  he lived in a house surrounded by great mounds of dust that he had collected .   he was a hard hearted man and when his daughter would not marry as he wished he turned her out of the house on a winter s night .  the poor girl died soon after  and her younger brother  a boy of only fourteen   indignant at his father s cruelty  ran away to a foreign country  where for years he was not heard of .   the old man  hard hearted as he was  and though he never spoke of the son save with anger and curses  felt this keenly  for in his own way he had loved the boy .   a mr .  boffin was foreman of harmon s dust business  and both he and his wife had loved the two children .  being kind and just people  they did not hesitate to let the father know how wicked they considered his action  and they never ceased to grieve for the poor little john who had run away .  so  though they did not guess it  the old man made up his mind they were an honest and deserving pair .   one morning the dust collector was discovered dead in his bed  and then it was found that he had left a very curious will .  the will bequeathed all his vast fortune to the son who had run away  on one condition  that he marry a young lady by the name of bella wilfer  the daughter of a poor london clerk .   the son had never seen bella in his life  and in fact the old man himself had seen her only a few times  and that was a long  long time before  when she was a very little girl .  he was sitting in the park one sunday morning  and the baby bella  because her father would not go the exact way she wanted  was screaming and stamping her little foot .  old mr .  harmon  having such a stubborn temper himself  admired it in the little child  and came to watch for her .  then  for some strange reason  which nobody ever could guess  he had put the baby s name in his will  declaring that his son john should get his money only by marrying this little girl .  and the will declared  moreover  that if the son  john harmon  should die  or should refuse to marry bella  all the fortune should go to mr .  boffin .   the lawyers had great trouble in finding where john harmon was  but finally they did so  and received word that he would return at once to england .   the ship he sailed on reached london  but the passenger it carried did not appear .  a few days later  a riverman named hexam found a body floating in the river thames  which flows through the middle of london .  in his pockets were the letters the lawyers had written to john harmon  and there seemed no doubt that the unfortunate young man had been murdered and his body thrown into the river .   the night the body was found  while it lay at the police station  a young man  very much excited  came and asked to see it .  he would not tell who he was  and his whole appearance was most wild and strange .  the police wondered  but they saw no reason to detain the stranger  so after looking at the body  he went away again very hastily .   a great stir was made about the case  and the police tried their best to discover the murderer  but they were unsuccessful .  then it occurred to them that there was something suspicious in the appearance of the young man that night .  they tried to find him  but he seemed to have disappeared .   at last the fortune was turned over to mr .  boffin  and all but a few people thought no more about the murder .   now  it was not really true that john harmon had been drowned .  this is what had happened   the young man had come back to england unwillingly  though he was coming to such wealth .  having left his father so long before in anger  he hardly liked to touch the money .  and he dreaded having to marry a young lady he had never seen  with whom all his life he might be most unhappy .   on the ship was a seaman about his own age whose face somewhat resembled his own .  with this man harmon became friendly and before the ship reached england he had told him his trouble and his dread .  the other proposed that harmon disguise himself in sailor s clothes  go into the neighborhood where miss bella wilfer lived  and see if she was one whom he could love .   now the man whom harmon was thus trusting was a villain  who  while he had been listening to the other s story  had been planning a crime against him .  he had made up his mind to kill harmon  and  as he looked so much like him  to marry bella himself and claim the fortune .   near the docks where the ship came in was a sailors  boarding house owned by a riverman of bad reputation named  rogue  riderhood .  riderhood had once been the partner of hexam  the man who found the floating body  but one day he was caught trying to rob a live man and hexam had cast him off .  the seaman took harmon to this house and there he secretly got from riderhood some poison .  last he persuaded harmon to change clothes with him .   all that remained now was to get rid of the real harmon .  to do this he put the poison in a cup of coffee  and harmon  drinking this  became insensible .   the lodging house hung out over the river and the wicked man had intended throwing the other s body  dressed now in seaman s clothing  into the water .  but fate was quickly to spoil his plan .  he and some others fell to quarreling over the money found in the clothing of the unconscious man .  the result was a desperate fight  and when it was over there were two bodies thrown from the window into the black river  the drugged man and the seaman who had planned his murder .   the shock of the cold water brought the drugged harmon to his senses .  he struck out  and after a terrible struggle succeeded in reaching shore .  the exposure and the poison made him very ill and he lay abed in an inn for some days .  while he was lying helpless there the drowned body of the seaman was found by hexam  the riverman .  as it wore the clothes of john harmon  and had his papers in its pockets  every one supposed  of course  that it was the body of the missing heir .   the first thing john harmon saw after he was well enough to walk was a printed notice announcing the finding of his own dead body  which gave him a very queer sensation .  lying there he had had time to think over the adventure and he had guessed pretty nearly how it all had happened .  he went at once to the police station to look at the corpse and saw it was that of his false friend  who had tried to lure him to his death .  so it was the real john harmon who had so excitedly appeared that night to the police inspectors  and had vanished immediately  and whom they had searched for so long in vain  under the suspicion that he himself was the murderer .   he had a very good reason for not letting the police find him  too .  now that the world considered him dead  he had determined  before he came to life  to carry out his first plan  and to find out for himself just what kind of person the bella wilfer he was expected to marry was  and whether mr .  and mrs .  boffin  who had been so kind to him in his childhood  would still be as true to his memory in their wealth .  for this reason he did not correct the error that had been made .  he took the name of john rokesmith  and  to get acquainted with bella  hired lodgings in her own father s house .   mr .  wilfer was a clerk for a mr .  veneering  a man who had made a big fortune in the drug business and wanted now to get into parliament .  everything the veneerings had was brand new .  they spent a great deal of money entertaining society people at dinners  but mr .  veneering spent very little on his clerks .  bella s father  though he was always as happy as a cherub  was so poor that he never had been able to buy a whole new suit at once .  his hat was shabby before he could afford a coat  and his trousers were worn before he got to new shoes .  so he was glad enough indeed to get a lodger .   mr .  and mrs .  boffin  to be sure  now had the great fortune .  they bought a fine house  and everybody called mr .  boffin  the golden dustman   because he was so rich .  mrs .  boffin wore velvet dresses  and mr .  boffin  thinking that now he was rich he ought to know a great deal about books  bought a big volume of the history of the roman empire and hired a man with a wooden leg who kept a ballad shop near by to come and read to him in the evenings .   but in spite of all their fine things  mr .  and mrs .  boffin remained the same good  kind hearted couple they had always been .  john harmon  or john rokesmith  as he now called himself   soon found this out  for he cleverly got a position as mr .  boffin s secretary  taking charge of all his papers and preventing many dishonest people from cheating him .  and mr .  and mrs .  boffin  never suspecting who he really was  instead of  secretary   called him  our mutual friend   and soon grew fond of him .   nor did they forget bella wilfer  for whose disappointment  at not getting the rich husband she had expected  they felt very sorry   and soon invited her to live with them .  bella was a good tempered  pretty girl  though inclined to be somewhat selfish and spoiled  and she was not sure  after all  that she would have liked a husband who had been willed to her like a dozen silver spoons  so she did not grieve greatly  and accepted mr .  and mrs .  boffin s offer gratefully .   so now the secretary  john rokesmith  beside being constantly with mr .  and mrs .  boffin  whom he had always loved  had a chance to see bella every day  and he was not long in finding out that it would be very easy  indeed  for him to fall in love with her .   ii  lizzie hexam and the dolls  dressmaker  hexam  the riverman who had found the body floating in the thames  made a living by watching in his boat for drowned bodies  and getting any rewards that might be offered for finding them .  he had two children  a daughter  lizzie  who used to row the boat for him  and a younger son  charley .   lizzie was a beautiful girl and a good daughter  and she never ceased to beseech her father to quit this ghastly business .  she saved every cent she could get to give her brother some schooling  and kept urging the boy until he left home and became a teacher in a respectable school .  for her own part she chose to stay by her father  hoping  in spite of her hatred of his calling  to make him sometime something better .   the night hexam found the body the lawyers who had the harmon will in charge came to his house to see about it .  one of them  a careless young man by the name of eugene wrayburn  was greatly struck with the beauty of lizzie  and pitied her because of the life she was obliged to live  and this interest in her made him even more deeply interested in the case of the odd will and the strange murder .   now mr .  and mrs .  boffin  since they were rich  had offered a great reward for the arrest of the murderer of john harmon .  to get this reward and at the same time to avenge himself on his old partner hexam for casting him off  rogue riderhood went to the lawyers and declared that it was hexam himself who had really killed the man whose body he had found .  riderhood swore that hexam had confessed the crime to him .   wrayburn  knowing what a shock this charge against her father would be for lizzie  went with the officers sent to seize him .  but they made no arrest  for that night hexam himself was drowned by accidentally falling from his own boat .   but the false charge against him lay heavy on lizzie s mind .  she hated the river and all that was connected with it  and soon found herself a decent lodging in another part of london .   here she lived with a weird little dwarf of a girl  so deformed that she could scarcely walk at all .    i can t get up   she used to say to strangers   because my back s bad and my legs are queer .    she had an odd face  with sharp gray eyes  and her wits were sharper yet .  she worked at the strangest trade in the world .  she had visiting cards on which was printed                                                miss jennie wren     dolls  dressmaker         dolls attended at their own residence                                             she was really and truly a dolls  dressmaker and sat all day long making tiny frocks out of silk and ribbon .  every evening she would hobble out to the door of the theater or of a house where a ball was going on and wait until a lady came out in a beautiful costume  then she would take careful note of it and go home and dress a doll just like it .  she even made a minister doll  in clerical collar and surplice  and used to rent him out for doll weddings .   but in spite of her trade she disliked children  because the rude ones of the neighborhood called her names through her keyhole and mimicked her bent back and crooked legs .    don t talk to me of children   she often said   i know their tricks and their manners .   and when she said this she would make a fierce little jab in the air with her needle  as if she were putting out somebody s eyes .   jennie wren had a miserable drunkard of a father  whom she called her  troublesome child .     he is enough to break his mother s heart   she would say when he staggered in .   i wish i had never brought him up .  ugh .  you muddling  disgraceful  prodigal old son .  i can t bear to look at you .  go into your corner this minute .   and the wretched creature  whining and maudlin  would shuffle into his corner in disgrace  not daring to disobey her .   the odd little dolls  dressmaker was cheerful and merry with all her trials and loved lizzie hexam very much .  wrayburn  the young lawyer  used to come to see them  but she did not approve of him .  she saw almost before lizzie did herself that the latter was falling in love with wrayburn  and the wise little creature feared that this would only bring pain to lizzie  because she was an uneducated girl and wrayburn a gentleman  who  when he married  would be expected to marry a lady far above lizzie s station .  lizzie knew this  too  but she could not help loving wrayburn  and as for the lawyer  he thought nothing of what the outcome might be .   meanwhile lizzie s brother charley  for whom she had worked so hard  was doing well at school  but now that he was getting up in the world he had turned out to be a selfish boy and was afraid that his sister might draw him down .   one day he came to visit her  bringing with him the master of his school .  the master s name was headstone .  he was a gloomy  passionate  revengeful man who dressed always in black and had no friends .  unfortunately enough  the first time he saw lizzie he fell in love with her .  it was unfortunate in more ways than one  for lizzie disliked him greatly  and he was  as it proved  a man who would stop at nothing  not even at the worst of crimes  to attain an object .   when lizzie s brother found headstone wanted to marry her  in his selfishness he saw only what a fine thing it would be for himself  and when she refused  he said many harsh things and finally left her in anger  telling her she was no longer a sister of his .   this was not the worst either  for she knew headstone had been made almost angry by her dislike  and she was in dreadful fear lest he do harm to eugene wrayburn  whom he suspected she loved .   in her anxiety lizzie left her lodging with the dolls  dressmaker  and found employment in a paper mill in a village on the river  some miles from london  letting neither wrayburn nor headstone know where she had gone .   the schoolmaster imagined that the lawyer  whom he now hated with a deadly hatred  knew where she was  and in order to discover if he visited her he began to dog the other s footsteps .  at night  after teaching all day in school  headstone would lie in wait outside the lawyer s door and whenever he came out would follow him .   wrayburn soon discovered this and delighted to fool his enemy .  every night he would take a new direction and lead his pursuer for hours about the city .  so that in a few weeks headstone became almost insane with murderous anger and disappointment .   so things went on for a long while .  lizzie continued to love eugene wrayburn  who kept trying in every way to find her .  headstone  the schoolmaster  kept watching him and meditating evil .  the little dolls  dressmaker worked on cheerily every day in the city  and in their fine house mr .  and mrs .  boffin grew fonder and fonder of miss bella  whom john rokesmith  the secretary  thought more beautiful every day .   iii  the rise and fall of silas wegg  the wooden legged ballad seller whom mr .  boffin had hired to read to him was a sly  dishonest rascal named silas wegg  who soon made up his mind to get all the money he could out of his employer .   there is an old story of a camel who once asked a shopkeeper to let him put his nose in at the shop door to warm it .  the shopkeeper consented  and little by little the camel got his head  then his neck  then his shoulders and at last his whole body into the shop  so that there was no room for the poor shopkeeper  who had to sit outside in the cold .  wegg soon began to act like the camel and took such advantage of easy going mr .  boffin that the latter at last let him live rent free in the house amid the dust heaps  which he himself had occupied before he got old harmon s money .   wegg imagined the mounds contained treasures hidden by the old man and thought it would be a fine thing to cheat mr .  boffin out of them .  so every night he spent hours prodding the heaps .  finally he persuaded a mr .  venus  a man who had been disappointed in love and made a melancholy living by stringing skeletons together on wires   to become his partner in the search .   one day wegg really did find something .  it was a parchment hidden in an empty pump  and he soon saw that it was a second will of old harmon s  later than the one already known  leaving the whole fortune  not to the son at all  but to the crown .   when wegg saw this his hypocritical soul swelled with joy  for he thought  sooner than give up all the money to the crown  mr .  boffin would pay him a great deal to destroy this new will .  he was such a rascal himself that it never occurred to him that maybe mr .  boffin would prefer to be honest .  he took it for granted everybody else was as bad as he was himself  yet all the while he tried to make himself believe that he was upright and noble in all he did  as hypocrites generally do .   the only point wegg could not make up his mind about was how much he could squeeze out of his benefactor  mr .  boffin .  at first he had thought of asking for half  but the more he hugged his secret the lesser the half seemed .  at last he determined to demand for himself  as the price for giving up the will  all but a very small share of the whole fortune .   now mr .  venus  though he had yielded at first to the rosy temptations of wegg  was after all quite honest at heart  and his conscience troubled him so that at last he went and told mr .  boffin all about wegg s discovery .   the golden dustman at first thought mr .  venus had some underhanded plan  so he pretended he was terribly frightened for fear of wegg and the will he had found .   as a matter of fact  sly old mr .  boffin was not afraid in the least  because he knew something that neither wegg nor venus  nor even john rokesmith  the secretary  knew .  this was  that the old original dustman  harmon  had made still a third will  later than either of the others .  the first will found was the one that had called the son back to england to marry bella .  the second will was the one leaving all his fortune to the crown  which wegg had found in the empty pump .  the third and last one gave all the money to mr .  boffin  no matter whom the son married  and gave none to any one else .  and this third and last will  the one that was the true will  the golden dustman had long ago found himself  buried in a bottle in one of the dust heaps .   mr .  boffin had never told any one about this last will  because he had all the fortune anyway .  now  however  seeing how wegg had planned to act  he was very glad he had found it .  and when he was convinced that mr .  venus was really honest and wanted no reward whatever  mr .  boffin determined to fool the rascally wegg up to the very last moment .   wegg s plan was not to demand the money until he had fully searched all the dust mounds .  mr .  boffin spurred wegg on in this regard by making him read to him in the evenings from a book called the lives of famous misers which he had bought  about the famous mr .  dancer who had warmed his dinner by sitting on it and died naked in a sack  and yet had gold and bank notes hidden in the crevices of the walls and in cracked jugs and tea pots  of an old apple woman in whose house a fortune was found wrapped up in little scraps of paper  of  vulture hopkins  and  blewbury jones  and many others whose riches after their death were found hidden in strange places .  while wegg read  mr .  boffin would pretend to get tremendously excited about his dust mounds  so that wegg grew surer and surer there must be riches hidden in them .   finally the golden dustman sold the mounds and had them carted away little by little  wegg watching every shovelful for fear he would miss something .   mr .  boffin hired a foreman to manage the removal of the dust who wore wegg down to skin and bone .  he worked by daylight and torchlight  too .  just as wegg  tired out by watching all day in the rain  would crawl into bed  the foreman  like a goblin  would reappear and go to work again .  sometimes wegg would be waked in the middle of the night  and sometimes kept at his post for as much as forty eight hours at a stretch  till he grew so gaunt and haggard that even his wooden leg looked chubby in comparison .   at last he could not keep quiet any longer and he told mr .  boffin what he had found .  mr .  boffin pretended the most abject dread .  wegg bullied and browbeat him to his heart s content  and ended by ordering him  like a slave  to be ready to receive him on a certain morning  and to have the money ready to pay him .   when he went to the fine boffin house to keep this appointment he entered insolently  whistling and with his hat on .  a servant showed him into the library where mr .  boffin and the secretary sat waiting  and where the secretary at once astonished him by taking off the hat and throwing it out of the window .   in another moment wegg found himself seized by the cravat  shaken till his teeth rattled  and pinned in a corner of the room  where the secretary knocked his head against the wall while he told him in a few words what a scoundrel he was .   when he learned that the will he had discovered was worthless paper  wegg lost all his bullying air and cringed before them .  mr .  boffin was disposed to be merciful and offered to make good his loss of his ballad business  but wegg  grasping and mean to the last  set its value at such a ridiculously high figure that mr .  boffin put his money back into his pocket .   then  at a sign from john rokesmith  one of the servants caught wegg by the collar  hoisted him on his back  ran down to the street with him and threw him into a garbage cart  where he disappeared from view with a tremendous splash .   and that  so far as this story is concerned  was the end of silas wegg .   iv  bella and the golden dustman  it was not long before john rokesmith  the secretary  was very much in love with bella indeed .  bella saw this plainly  but the fine house and costly clothes had quite spoiled her  and  thinking him only a poor secretary and her father s lodger  she treated him almost with contempt .   yet he would not tell her who he was  for he did not want her to marry him merely because of the money it would bring her .  she hurt his feelings often  but in spite of it she could not help being attracted to him .  he had a way  too  of looking at her that made her feel how proud and unjust she was  and sometimes made her quite despise herself .   but having had a taste of the pleasures and comforts that wealth would bring  bella had quite determined when she married to marry nobody but a very rich man .  mr .  and mrs .  boffin both noticed how changed she was growing from her own sweet self and regretted it  for they liked bella and they liked the secretary  too  and they could easily see that the latter was in love with her .   one day mrs .  boffin went to the secretary s room for something .  as she entered  rokesmith  who was sitting sadly over the fire  looked up with a peculiar expression that told the good woman all in a flash who he was .    i know you now   she cried   you re little john harmon .    in the joy and surprise she almost fainted  but he caught her and set her down beside him .  just then in came mr .  boffin  and the secretary told them the whole story  and how he now loved bella  but would not declare himself because of her contempt .   both mr .  and mrs .  boffin were so glad to know he was really alive they fell to crying with joy .  the golden dustman declared that  no matter how the last will read  john should have the fortune for his own .  rokesmith  or harmon  at first refused to do this  but mr .  boffin swore that if he did not he himself would not touch the money  and it would have to go to the crown anyway .  so at last it was agreed that mr .  boffin should keep a small portion for his own  but that the other should take all the rest .   mr .  boffin wanted to tell everybody the truth at once  but john would not let them .  you see he wouldn t marry bella for anything unless she loved him for himself alone .  and she was growing so fond of riches that there seemed little chance of this happening .   nevertheless they believed that at heart bella was good and sweet  if they could only get to her real self  so mr .  boffin that moment made a plan .   he determined to show bella how much unhappiness misused riches could cause  and how too much money might sometimes spoil the kindest and best people .  as a lesson to her in this he was to pretend gradually to turn into a mean  hard hearted miser .  they agreed that he should begin to treat the secretary harshly and unjustly in bella s presence  feeling sure that her true self would stand up for him when he was slighted  and be kinder to him when he seemed poorest and most friendless .   the golden dustman began the new plan that very night .  every day he made himself act like a regular brown bear  and every evening he would say   i ll be a grislier old growler to morrow .   he made the secretary slave from morning till night and found fault with him and sneered at his poverty and cut down his wages .   each afternoon  when he went walking with bella  mr .  boffin would make her go into bookshops and inquire if they had any book about a miser .  if they had  he would buy it  no matter what it cost  and lug it home to read .  he began to drive hard bargains for everything he bought and all his talk came to be about money and the fine thing it was to have it .    go in for money  my dear   he would say to bella .   money s the article .  you ll make money of your good looks  and of the money mrs .  boffin and me will leave you  and you ll live and die rich .  that s the state to live and die in  r r rich .    bella was greatly shocked at the sorrowful change in mr .  boffin .  wealth began to look less lovely when she saw him growing so miserly .  she began to wonder if she herself might ever become like that  too  and sometimes  when she thought how kind and generous the old mr .  boffin had been  she fairly hated money and wished it had never been invented .   there was an old woman who peddled knitting work through the country whom mr .  and mrs .  boffin had befriended  and to whom they had given a letter to carry wherever she went .  this letter asked whoever should find her  if she fell sick  to let them know .  the old woman fell and died one day by the roadside near the spot where lizzie hexam was now living  and lizzie  finding the letter  wrote about it to mr .  and mrs .  boffin .   they sent the secretary and bella  to make arrangements for the poor woman s burial  and in this way bella met lizzie and became her friend .  lizzie soon told her all her story  and bella  seeing how unselfishly she loved  began to think her own ambition to marry for money a mean and ignoble thing .  she thought how patient and kind the secretary had always been  and  knowing he loved her  wished heartily that her own coldness had not forbidden him to tell her so .   one day mr .  boffin s pretended harsh treatment of his secretary seemed to come to a climax .  he sent for him to come to the room where mrs .  boffin and bella sat  and made a fearful scene .  he said he had just heard that he  rokesmith  had been presuming on his position to make love to bella  a young lady who wanted to marry money  who had a rightto marry money  and who was very far from wanting to marry a poor beggar of a private secretary .  he threw the wages that were due rokesmith on the floor and discharged him on the spot  telling him the sooner he could pack up and leave  the better .   then  at last  in the face of this apparent meanness and injustice  bella saw herself and mr .  boffin s money and john rokesmith s love and dignity  all in their true light .  she burst out crying  begged rokesmith s forgiveness  told mr .  boffin he was an old wretch of a miser  and when the secretary had gone  she said rokesmith was a gentleman and worth a million boffins  and she would not stay in the house a minute longer .   then she packed up her things and went straight to her father s office .  all the other clerks had gone home  for it was after hours  and she put her head on his shoulder and told him all about it .   and while they were talking  in came john rokesmith  and seeing her there alone with her father  rushed to her and caught her in his arms .    my dear  brave  noble  generous girl .   he said  and bella  feeling all at once that she had never been quite so happy in her life  laid her head on his breast  as if that were the one place for it in all the world .   they had a talk together and then walked home to mr .  wilfer s poor little house  bella s father agreeing that she had done exactly the proper thing  and bella herself feeling so happy now in having john rokesmith s love  that she cared not a bit for the fine mansion and clothes and money of the boffins which she had left for ever .   a few days later john rokesmith and bella were married and went to live in a little furnished cottage outside of london  where they settled down as happy as two birds .   v  the end of the story  while these things were happening at mr .  boffin s house  eugene wrayburn  with headstone the schoolmaster watching him like a hawk  had never left off trying to find where lizzie hexam had gone .  at length  through the  troublesome child  of the little dolls  dressmaker  he learned the name of the village where she was living and went at once to see her .   headstone followed close behind him and when  from his hiding place  he saw how glad lizzie was to see the lawyer  he went quite mad with jealousy and hate  and that moment he determined to kill wrayburn .   it happened that rogue riderhood was then working on the river that flowed past the village  where he tended a lock .  the schoolmaster  in order to turn suspicion from himself in case any one should see him when he did this wicked deed  observing carefully how riderhood was dressed  got himself clothes exactly like the lock tender s  even to a red handkerchief tied around his neck .   in this guise  with murder in his heart  he lay in wait along the riverside till wrayburn passed one evening just after he had bade good night to lizzie hexam .  the schoolmaster crept up close behind the lawyer and struck him a fearful crashing blow on the head with a club .  wrayburn grappled with him  but headstone struck again and again with the bloody weapon  and still again as the other lay prostrate at his feet  and dragging the body to the bank  threw it into the river .  then he fled .   lizzie hexam had not yet turned homeward from the riverside .  she heard through the night the sound of the blows  the faint moan and the splash .  she ran to the spot  saw the trampled grass  and  looking across the water  saw a bloody face drifting away .  she ran to launch a boat  and rowed with all her strength to overtake it .   but for her dreadful life on the river with her father she could not have found the drowning man in the darkness  but she did  and then she saw it was the man she loved .  one terrible cry she uttered  then rowed with desperate strokes to the shore and with superhuman strength carried him to a near by inn .   wrayburn was not dead  but was dreadfully disfigured .  for many days he hovered between life and death .  jennie wren  the dolls  dressmaker  came  and she and lizzie nursed him .  as soon as he could speak he made them understand that before he died he wanted lizzie to marry him .  a minister was sent for  and with him came john rokesmith and bella .  so the sick man was married to lizzie  and from that hour he began to get better  till before long they knew that he would recover .   meanwhile  not waiting to see the result of his murderous attack  headstone had fled down the river bank to the hut where riderhood lived and there the villainous lock tender let him rest and sleep .  as the schoolmaster tossed in his guilty slumber  riderhood noted that his clothes were like his own .  he unbuttoned the sleeping man s jacket  saw the red handkerchief  and  having heard from a passing boatman of the attempted murder  he guessed that headstone had done it and saw how he had plotted to lay the crime on him .   when the schoolmaster went away riderhood followed him  watched him change clothes in the bushes and rescued the bloody garments the other threw away .   with these in his hands he faced the schoolmaster one day in his class room and made him promise  under threat of exposure  to come that night to the hut by the lock .  headstone was afraid to disobey .  when he came  riderhood told him he must give him money at once or he would follow him till he did .   headstone refused and  as the other had threatened  when he started back to london  he found the lock tender by his side .  he returned to the hut and the other did the same .   he started again  and again the other walked beside him .  then headstone  turning suddenly  caught riderhood around the waist and dragged him to the edge of the lock .    let go .   said riderhood .   you can t drown me .     i can   panted headstone .   and i can drown myself .  i ll hold you living and i ll hold you dead .  come down .    riderhood went over backward into the water  and the schoolmaster upon him .  when they found them  long afterward  riderhood s body was girdled still with the schoolmaster s arms and they held him tight .   this was the awful end of the two wicked men whom fate had brought into lizzie s life .   all this time  of course  bella had been believing her husband to be very poor .  at first he had intended to tell her who he was on the day they were married  but he said to himself   no  she s so unselfish and contented i can t afford to be rich yet .   so he pretended to get a position in the city at small wages .  then after a few months he thought it over again  and he said to himself   she s such a cheerful little housewife that i can t afford to be rich yet .   and at last a little baby was born to bella  and then they were so happy that he said   she s so much sweeter than she ever was that i can t afford to be rich just yet .    but meantime bella was imagining that mr .  boffin was a cruel old miser  and mr .  boffin didn t like this  so john agreed that he would tell her all about it .   but first he got bella to describe exactly the kind of house she would like if they were very  very rich  and when she told him  he and mr .  boffin had the boffin mansion fixed over in just the way she had said  with a nursery with rainbow colored walls and flowers on the staircase  and even a little room full of live birds  and a jewel box full of jewels on the dressing table .   fate  however  had arranged even a greater trial of bella s love for him than all the others .  as they walked together on the street one day  they came face to face with a man who had been in the police office on the night the body which every one believed to be john harmon s had lain there .  he had seen the entrance of the agitated stranger  and had helped the police in their later vain search for rokesmith .  now he at once recognized bella s husband as that man  who the police believed had probably committed the murder .   rokesmith knew the man had recognized him  and when they got home he told bella that he was accused of killing the man the harmon will had bidden her marry .    illustration  jennie wren and her  troublesome child   see page       but nothing now could shake her faith in him .   how dare they .   she cried indignantly .   my beloved husband .   he caught her in his arms at that  and while he held her thus the officers entered to arrest him .   rokesmith found the matter very easy to explain to the satisfaction of the police  but he told bella nothing as yet  and  trusting and believing in him absolutely  she waited in great wonder .  next day he told her he had a new position and that now they must live in the city where he had taken a furnished house for them .   they drove together to see it .  strangely enough it seemed to be in the same street as mr .  boffin s house  and stranger yet  the coach stopped at mr .  boffin s own door .  her husband put his arm around her and drew her in  and she saw that everything was covered with flowers .  as he led her on she exclaimed in astonishment to see the little room full of birds just as she had wished .   suddenly her husband opened a door and there was mr .  boffin beaming and mrs .  boffin shedding tears of joy  and folding her to her breast as she said   my deary  deary  deary  wife of john and mother of his little child .  my loving loving  bright bright  pretty pretty .  welcome to your house and home  my deary .    then of course the whole story came out .  the mystery was solved and she knew that john rokesmith was the true john harmon and that her husband was really the man the harmon will had picked out for her to marry .   in the splendid boffin house they lived happily for many years  surrounded by bella s children .  and they were never so happy as when they welcomed eugene wrayburn with lizzie his wife  or jennie wren  the little dolls  dressmaker .              a tale of two cities  published       scene  london and paris  time       to       characters  doctor manette a french physician rescued after long imprisonment in the bastille  lucie his daughter  miss pross her english nurse  sydney carton an idle and dissipated law student  mr .  lorry the agent of an english bank doing business in paris  the marquis de st .  evr  monde a french nobleman  charles darnay his

leader of the revolutionists  madame defarge his wife  barsad a spy and turnkey             a tale of two cities  i  how lucie found a father  a little more than a hundred years ago there lived in london  one of the two cities of this tale  a lovely girl of seventeen named lucie manette .  her mother had died when she was a baby  in france  and she lived alone with her old nurse  miss pross  a homely  grim guardian with hair as red as her face  who called lucie  ladybird  and loved her very much .  miss pross was sharp of speech and was always snapping people up as if she would bite their heads off  but  though she seldom chose to show it  she was the kindest  truest  most unselfish person in the world .  lucie had no memory of her father  and had always believed he also had died when she was a baby .   one day  however  through a mr .  lorry  the agent of a bank  she learned a wonderful piece of news .  he told her that her father was not dead  but that he had been wickedly thrown into a secret prison in paris before she was born  and had been lost thus for eighteen long years .  this prison was the bastille  a cold  dark building like a castle  with high gray towers  a deep moat and drawbridge  and soldiers and cannon to defend it .   in those days in france the rich nobles who belonged to the royal court were very powerful and overbearing  and the rest of the people had few rights .  one could be put into prison then without any trial at all  so that many innocent people suffered .  lucie s mother had guessed that doctor manette  for he was a physician  had in some way incurred the hatred of some one of the nobles and had thus been taken from her  but all she certainly knew was that he had disappeared one day in paris and had never come back .   for a year she had tried in every way to find him  but at length  desolate and heartbroken  she had fallen ill and died  leaving little lucie with only miss pross  her english nurse  to care for her .  mr .  lorry himself  who told lucie this story  having known her father  had brought her  a baby  to london in his arms .   now  he told her  after all these years  her father had been released  and was at that moment in paris in charge of a man named defarge  who had once been his servant .  but the long imprisonment had affected his mind  so that he was little more than the broken wreck of the man he had once been .  mr .  lorry was about to go to paris to identify him  and he wished lucie to go also to bring him to himself .   you can imagine that lucie s heart was both glad and sorrowful at the news  joyful that the father she had always believed dead was alive  and yet full of grief for his condition .  she hastily made ready and that same day set out with mr .  lorry for france .   when they reached paris they went at once to find defarge .  he was a stern  forbidding man  who kept a cheap wine shop in one of the poorer quarters of the city .  he took them through a dirty courtyard behind the shop and up five flights of filthy stairs to a door  which he unlocked for them to enter .   in the dim room sat a withered  white haired old man on a low bench making shoes .  his cheeks were worn and hollow  his eyes were bright and his long beard was as white as snow .  he wore a ragged shirt  and his hands were thin and transparent from confinement .  it was lucie s father  doctor manette .   he scarcely looked up when they entered  for his mind was gone and he knew no one .  all that seemed to interest him was his shoemaking .  he had forgotten everything else .  he even thought his own name was  one hundred and five  north tower   which had been the number of his cell in the bastille .   lucie s heart almost broke to see him .  she wanted to throw her arms about him  to lay her head on his breast and tell him she was his daughter who loved him and had come to take him home at last .  but she was afraid this would frighten him .   she came close to him  and after a while he began to look at her .  she greatly resembled her dead mother  and presently her face seemed to remind him of something .  he unwound a string from around his neck and unfolded a little rag which was tied to it  and there was a lock of hair like lucie s .  then he suddenly burst into tears  the first he had shed for long  long years  and the tears seemed to bring back a part of the past .  lucie took him in her arms and soothed him  while mr .  lorry went to bring the coach that was to take them to england .   through all their preparations for departure her father sat watching in a sort of scared wonder  holding tight to lucie s hand like a child  and when they told him to come with them he descended the stairs obediently .  but he would not go into the coach without his bench and shoemaking tools  and  to quiet him  they were obliged to take them  too .   so the father and daughter and mr .  lorry journeyed back to lucie s home in london .  all the miles they rode lucie held her father s hand  and the touch seemed to give him strength and confidence .   on the boat crossing to london was a young man who called himself charles darnay  handsome  dark and pale .  he was most kind to lucie  and showed her how to make a couch on deck for her father  and how she could shelter it from the wind .  in the long months that followed their arrival  while the poor old man regained a measure of health  she never forgot darnay s face and his kindness to them .   doctor manette s mind and memory came slowly back with his improving health .  there were some days when his brain clouded .  then lucie would find him seated at his old prison bench making shoes  and she would coax him away and talk to him until the insanity would pass away .   so time went by peacefully till a strange thing happened  charles darnay  who had been so kind to lucie and her father on the boat  was arrested on a charge of treason .   england at that time was not on good terms with france  and darnay  who was of french birth  was accused of selling information concerning the english forts and army to the french government .  this was a very serious charge  for men convicted of treason then were put to death in the cruelest ways that could be invented .   the charge was not true  and darnay himself knew quite well who was working against him .   the fact was that charles darnay was not his true name .  he was really charles st .  evr  monde  the descendant of a rich and noble french family  though he chose to live in london as charles darnay  and earned his living by giving lessons in french .  he did this because he would not be one of the hated noble class of his own country  who treated the poor so heartlessly .   in france the peasants had to pay many oppressive taxes  and were wretched and half starved  while the rich nobles rode in gilded coaches  and  if they ran over a little peasant child  threw a coin to its mother and drove on without a further thought .  among the hardest hearted of all  and the most hated by the common people  were the evr  mondes  the family of the young man who was now accused of treason .  as soon as he was old enough to know how unjust was his family s treatment of the poor who were dependent on them  he had protested against it .  when he became a man he had refused to live on the money that was thus taken from the hungry peasantry  and had left his home and come to london to earn his own way by teaching .   his heartless uncle  the marquis de st .  evr  monde  in france  the head of the family  hated the young man for this noble spirit .  it was this uncle who had invented the plot to accuse his nephew of treason .  he had hired a dishonest spy known as barsad  who swore he had found papers in darnay s trunk that proved his guilt  and  as darnay had been often back and forth to france on family matters  the case looked dark for him .   cruelly enough  among those who were called to the trial as witnesses  to show that darnay had made these frequent journeys to france  were doctor manette and lucie  because they had seen him on the boat during that memorable crossing .  lucie s tears fell fast as she gave her testimony  believing him innocent and knowing that her words would be used to condemn him .   darnay would doubtless have been convicted but for a curious coincidence  a dissipated young lawyer  named sydney carton  sitting in the court room  had noticed with surprise that he himself looked very much like the prisoner  in fact  that they were so much alike they might almost have been taken for twin brothers .  he called the attention of darnay s lawyer to this  and the latter  while one of the witnesses against darnay was making oath that he had seen him in a certain place in france  made carton take off his wig  all lawyers wear wigs in england while in court  and stand up beside darnay .  the two were so alike the witness was puzzled  and he could not swear which of the two he had seen .  for this reason darnay  to lucie s great joy  was found not guilty .   sydney carton  who had thought of and suggested this clever thing  was a reckless  besotted young man .  he cared for nobody  and nobody  he used to say  cared for him .  he lacked energy and ambition to work and struggle for himself  but for the sake of plenty of money with which to buy liquor  he studied cases for another lawyer  who was fast growing rich by his labor .  his master  who hired him  was the lion  carton was content  through his own indolence and lack of purpose  to be the jackal .   his conscience had always condemned him for this  and now  as he saw the innocent darnay s look  noble and straightforward  so like himself as he might have been  and as he thought of lucie s sweet face and of how she had wept as she was forced to give testimony against the other  carton felt that he almost hated the man whose life he had saved .   the trial brought lucie and these two men  so like each other in feature  yet so unlike in character  together  and afterward they often met at doctor manette s house .   it was in a quiet part of london that lucie and her father lived  all alone save for the faithful miss pross .  they had little furniture  for they were quite poor  but lucie made the most of everything .  doctor manette had recovered his mind  but not all of his memory .  sometimes he would get up in the night and walk up and down  up and down  for hours .  at such times lucie would hurry to him and walk up and down with him till he was calm again .  she never knew why he did this  but she came to believe he was trying vainly to remember all that had happened in those lost years which he had forgotten .  he kept his prison bench and tools always by him  but as time went on he gradually used them less and less often .   mr .  lorry  with his flaxen wig and constant smile  came to tea every sunday with them and helped to keep doctor manette cheerful .  sometimes darnay  sydney carton and mr .  lorry would meet there together  but of them all  darnay came oftenest  and soon it was easy to see that he was in love with lucie .   sydney carton  too  was in love with her  but he was perfectly aware that he was quite undeserving  and that lucie could never love him in return .  she was the last dream of his wild  careless life  the life he had wasted and thrown away .  once he told her this  and said that  although he could never be anything to her himself  he would give his life gladly to save any one who was near and dear to her .   lucie fell in love with darnay at length and one day they were married and went away on their wedding journey .   until then  since his rescue  lucie had never been out of doctor manette s sight .  now  though he was glad for her happiness  yet he felt the pain of the separation so keenly that it unhinged his mind again .  miss pross and mr .  lorry found him next morning making shoes at the old prison bench and for nine days he did not know them at all .  at last  however  he recovered  and then  lest the sight of it affect him  one day when he was not there they chopped the bench to pieces and burned it up .   but her father was better after lucie came back with her husband  and they took up their quiet life again .  darnay loved lucie devotedly .  he supported himself still by teaching .  mr .  lorry came from the bank oftener to tea and sydney carton more rarely  and their life was peaceful and content .   once after his marriage  his cruel uncle  the marquis de st .  evr  monde  sent for darnay to come to france on family matters .  darnay went  but declined to remain or to do the other s bidding .   but his uncle s evil life was soon to be ended .  while darnay was there the marquis was murdered one night in his bed by a grief crazed laborer  whose little child his carriage had run over .   darnay returned to england  shocked and horrified the more at the indifference of the life led by his race in france .  although now  by the death of his uncle  he had himself become the marquis de st .  evr  monde  yet he would not lay claim to the title  and left all the estates in charge of one of the house servants  an honest steward named gabelle .   he had intended after his return to lucie to settle all these affairs and to dispose of the property  which he felt it wrong for him to hold  but in the peace and happiness of his life in england he put it off and did nothing further .   and this neglect of darnay s  as important things neglected are apt to prove  came before long to be the cause of terrible misfortune and agony to them all .   ii  darnay caught in the net  while these things were happening in london  the one city of this tale  other very different events were occurring in the other city of the story  paris  the french capital .   the indifference and harsh oppression of the court and the nobles toward the poor had gone on increasing day by day  and day by day the latter had grown more sullen and resentful .  all the while the downtrodden people of paris were plotting secretly to rise in rebellion  kill the king and queen and all the nobles  seize their riches and govern france themselves .   the center of this plotting was defarge  the keeper of the wine shop  who had cared for doctor manette when he had first been released from prison .  defarge and those he trusted met and planned often in the very room where mr .  lorry and lucie had found her father making shoes .  they kept a record of all acts of cruelty toward the poor committed by the nobility  determining that  when they themselves should be strong enough  those thus guilty should be killed  their fine houses burned  and all their descendants put to death  so that not even their names should remain in france .  this was a wicked and awful determination  but these poor  wretched people had been made to suffer all their lives  and their parents before them  and centuries of oppression had killed all their pity and made them as fierce as wild beasts that only wait for their cages to be opened to destroy all in their path .   they were afraid  of course  to keep any written list of persons whom they had thus condemned  so madame defarge  the wife of the wine seller  used to knit the names in fine stitches into a long piece of knitting that she seemed always at work on .   madame defarge was a stout woman with big coarse hands and eyes that never seemed to look at any one  yet saw everything that happened .  she was as strong as a man and every one was somewhat afraid of her .  she was even crueler and more resolute than her husband .  she would sit knitting all day long in the dirty wine shop  watching and listening  and knitting in the names of people whom she hoped soon to see killed .   one of the hated names that she knitted over and over again was  evr  monde .   the laborer who  in the madness of his grief for his dead child  had murdered the marquis de st .  evr  monde  darnay s hard hearted uncle  had been caught and hanged  and  because of this  defarge and his wife and the other plotters had condemned all of the name of evr  monde to death .   meanwhile the king and queen of france and all their gay and careless court of nobles feasted and danced as heedlessly as ever .  they did not see the storm rising .  the bitter taxes still went on .  the wine shop of defarge looked as peaceful as ever  but the men who drank there now were dreaming of murder and revenge .  and the half starved women  who sat and looked on as the gilded coaches of the rich rolled through the streets  were sullenly waiting  watching madame defarge as she silently knitted  knitted into her work names of those whom the people had condemned to death without mercy .   one day this frightful human storm  which for so many years had been gathering in france  burst over paris .  the poor people rose by thousands  seized whatever weapons they could get  guns  axes  or even stones of the street  and  led by defarge and his tigerish wife  set out to avenge their wrongs .  their rage turned first of all against the bastille  the old stone prison in which so many of their kind had died  where doctor manette for eighteen years had made shoes .  they beat down the thick walls and butchered the soldiers who defended it  and released the prisoners .  and wherever they saw one of the king s uniforms they hanged the wearer to the nearest lamp post .  it was the beginning of the terrible revolution in france that was to end in the murder of thousands of innocent lives .  it was the beginning of a time when paris s streets were to run with blood  when all the worst passions of the people were loosed  and when they went mad with the joy of revenge .   the storm spread over france  to the village where stood the great ch  teau of the evr  monde family  and the peasants set fire to it and burned it to the ground .  and gabelle  the servant who had been left in charge by darnay  the new marquis de st .  evr  monde  whom they had never seen  but yet hated  they seized and put in prison .  they stormed the royal palace and arrested the king and queen  threw all who bore noble names or titles into dungeons  and  as they had planned  set up a government of their own .   darnay  safe in london with lucie  knew little and thought less of all this  till he received a pitiful letter from gabelle  who expected each morning to be dragged out to be killed  telling of the plight into which his faithfulness had brought him  and beseeching his master s aid .   this letter made darnay most uneasy .  he blamed himself  because he knew it was his fault that gabelle had been left so long in such a dangerous post .  he did not forget that his own family  the evr  mondes  had been greatly hated .  but he thought the fact that he himself had refused to be one of them  and had given his sympathy rather to the people they oppressed  would make it possible for him to obtain gabelle s release .  and with this idea he determined to go himself to paris .   he knew the very thought of his going  now that france was mad with violence  would frighten lucie  so he determined not to tell her .  he packed some clothing hurriedly and left secretly  sending a letter back telling her where and why he was going .  and by the time she read this he was well on his way from england .   darnay had expected to find no trouble in his errand and little personal risk in his journey  but as soon as he landed on the shores of france he discovered his mistake .  he had only to give his real name   the marquis de st .  evr  monde   which he was obliged to do if he would help gabelle  and the title was the signal for rude threats and ill treatment .  once in  he could not go back  and he felt as if a monstrous net were closing around him  as indeed  it was  from which there was no escape .   he was sent on to paris under a guard of soldiers  and there he was at once put into prison to be tried  and in all probability condemned to death  as one of the hated noble class whom the people were now killing as fast as they could .   the great room of the prison to which he was taken darnay found full of ladies and gentlemen  most of them rich and titled  the men chatting  the women reading or doing embroidery  all courteous and polite  as if they sat in their own splendid homes  instead of in a prison from which most of them could issue only to a dreadful death .  he was allowed to remain here only a few moments  then he was taken to an empty cell and left alone .   it happened that the bank of which mr .  lorry was agent had an office also in paris  and the old gentleman had come there on business the day before darnay arrived .  mr .  lorry was an englishman born  and for him there was no danger .  he knew nothing of the arrest of darnay until a day or two later  when  as he sat in his room  doctor manette and lucie entered  just arrived from london  deeply agitated and in great fear for darnay s safety .   as soon as lucie had read her husband s letter she had followed at once with her father and miss pross .  doctor manette  knowing darnay s real name and title  for  before he married lucie  he had told her father everything concerning himself   feared danger for him .  but he had reasoned that his own long imprisonment in the bastille  the building the people had first destroyed  would make him a favorite  and render him able to aid darnay if danger came .  on the way  they had heard the sad news of his arrest  and had come at once to mr .  lorry to consider what might best be done .   while they talked  through the window they saw a great crowd of people come rushing into the courtyard of the building to sharpen weapons at a huge grindstone that stood there .  they were going to murder the prisoners with which the jails were by this time full .   fearful that he would be too late to save darnay  doctor manette rushed to the yard  his white hair streaming in the wind  and told the leaders of the mob who he was  how he had been imprisoned for eighteen years in the bastille  and that now one of his kindred  by some unknown error  had been seized .  they cheered him  lifted him on their shoulders and rushed away to demand for him the release of darnay  while lucie  in tears  with mr .  lorry and miss pross  waited all night for tidings .   but none came that night .  the rescue had not proved easy .  next day defarge  the wine shop keeper  brought a short note to lucie from darnay at the prison  but it was four days before doctor manette returned to the house .  he had  indeed  by the story of his own sufferings  saved darnay s life for the time being  but the prisoner  he had been told  could not be released without trial .   for this trial they waited  day after day .  the time passed slowly and terribly .  prisoners were no longer murdered without trial  but few escaped the death penalty .  the king and queen were beheaded .  thousands were put to death merely on suspicion  and thousands more were thrown into prison to await their turn .  this was that dreadful period which has always since been called  the reign of terror   when no one felt sure of his safety .   there was a certain window in the prison through which darnay sometimes found a chance to look  and from which he could see one dingy street corner .  on this corner  every afternoon  lucie took her station for hours  rain or shine .  she never missed a day  and thus at long intervals her husband got a view of her .   so months passed till a year had gone .  all the while doctor manette  now become a well known figure in paris  worked hard for darnay s release .  and at length his turn came to be tried and he was brought before the drunken  ignorant men who called themselves judge and jury .   he told how he had years before renounced his family and title  left france  and supported himself rather than be a burden on the peasantry .  he told how he had married a woman of french birth  the only daughter of the good doctor manette  whom all paris knew  and had come to paris now of his own accord to help a poor servant who was in danger through his fault .   the story caught the fancy of the changeable crowd in the room .  they cheered and applauded it .  when he was acquitted they were quite as pleased as if he had been condemned to be beheaded  and put him in a great chair and carried him home in triumph to lucie .   there was only one there  perhaps  who did not rejoice at the result  and that was the cold  cruel wife of the wine seller  madame defarge  who had knitted the name  evr  monde  so many times into her knitting .   iii  sydney carton s sacrifice  that same night of his release all the happiness of darnay and lucie was suddenly broken .  soldiers came and again arrested him .  defarge and his wife were the accusers this time  and he was to be retried .   the first one to bring this fresh piece of bad news to mr .  lorry was sydney carton  the reckless and dissipated young lawyer .  probably he had heard  in london  of lucie s trouble  and out of his love for her  which he always carried hidden in his heart  had come to paris to try to aid her husband .  he had arrived only to hear  at the same time  of the acquittal and the rearrest .   as carton walked along the street thinking sadly of lucie s new grief  he saw a man whose face and figure seemed familiar .  following  he soon recognized him as the english spy  barsad  whose false testimony  years before in london  had come so near convicting darnay when he was tried for treason .  barsad  who  as it happened  was now a turnkey in the very prison where darnay was confined  had left london to become a spy in france  first on the side of the king and then on the side of the people .   at the time of this story england was so hated by france that if the people had known of barsad s career in london they would have cut off his head at once .  carton  who was well aware of this  threatened the spy with his knowledge and made him swear that if worst came to worst and darnay were condemned  he would admit carton to the cell to see him once before he was taken to execution .  why carton asked this barsad could not guess  but to save himself he had to promise .   next day darnay was tried for the second time .  when the judge asked for the accusation  defarge laid a paper before him .   it was a letter that had been found when the bastille fell  in the cell that had been occupied for eighteen years by doctor manette .  he had written it before his reason left him  and hidden it behind a loosened stone in the wall  and in it he had told the story of his own unjust arrest .  defarge read it aloud to the jury .  and this was the terrible tale it told   the marquis de st .  evr  monde  the cruel uncle of darnay   when he was a young man  had dreadfully wronged a young peasant woman  had caused her husband s death and killed her brother with his own hand .  as the brother lay dying from the sword wound  doctor manette  then also a young man  had been called to attend him  and so  by accident  had learned the whole .  horrified at the wicked wrong  he wrote of it in a letter to the minister of justice .  the marquis whom it accused learned of this  and  to put doctor manette out of the way  had him arrested secretly  taken from his wife and baby daughter and thrown into a secret cell of the bastille  where he had lived those eighteen years  not knowing whether his wife and child lived or died .  he waited ten years for release  and when none came  at last  feeling his mind giving way  he wrote the account  which he concealed in the cell wall  denouncing the family of evr  monde and all their descendants .   the reading of this paper by defarge  as may be guessed  aroused all the murderous passions of the people in the court room .  there was a further reason for madame defarge s hatred  for the poor woman whom darnay s uncle had so wronged had been her own sister .  in vain old doctor manette pleaded .  that his own daughter was now darnay s wife made no difference in their eyes .  the jury at once found darnay guilty and sentenced him to die by the guillotine the next morning .   lucie fainted when the sentence was pronounced .  sydney carton  who had witnessed the trial  lifted her and bore her to a carriage .  when they reached home he carried her up the stairs and laid her on a couch .   before he went  he bent down and touched her cheek with his lips  and they heard him whisper   for a life you love .    they did not know until next day what he meant .   carton had  in fact  formed a desperate plan to rescue lucie s husband  whom he so much resembled in face and figure  even though it meant his own death .  he went to mr .  lorry and made him promise to have ready next morning passports and a coach and swift horses to leave paris for england with doctor manette  lucie and himself  telling him that if they delayed longer  lucie s life and her father s also would be lost .   next  carton bought a quantity of a drug whose fumes would render a man insensible  and with this in his pocket early next morning he went to the spy  barsad  and bade him redeem his promise and take him to the cell where darnay waited for the signal of death .   darnay was seated  writing a last letter to lucie  when carton entered .  pretending that he wished him to write something that he dictated  carton stood over him and held the phial of the drug to his face .  in a moment the other was unconscious .  then carton changed clothes with him and called in the spy  directing him to take the unconscious man  who now seemed to be sydney carton instead of charles darnay  to mr .  lorry s house .  he himself was to take the prisoner s place and suffer the penalty .   the plan worked well .  darnay  who would not have allowed this sacrifice if he had known  was carried safely and without discovery  past the guards .  mr .  lorry  guessing what had happened when he saw the unconscious figure  took coach at once with him  doctor manette and lucie  and started for england that very hour .  miss pross was left to follow them in another carriage .   while miss pross sat waiting in the empty house  who should come in but the terrible madame defarge .  the latter had made up her mind  as carton had suspected  to denounce lucie also .  it was against the law to mourn for any one who had been condemned as an enemy to france  and the woman was sure  of course  that lucie would be mourning for her husband  who was to die within the hour .  so she stopped on her way to the execution to see lucie and thus have evidence against her .   when madame defarge entered  miss pross read the hatred and evil purpose in her face .  the grim old nurse knew if it were known that lucie had gone  the coach would be pursued and brought back .  so she planted herself in front of the door of lucie s room  and would not let madame defarge open it .   the savage frenchwoman tried to tear her away  but miss pross seized her around the waist  and held her back .  the other drew a loaded pistol from her breast to shoot her  but in the struggle it went off and killed madame defarge herself .   then miss pross  all of a tremble  locked the door  threw the key into the river  took a carriage and followed after the coach .   not long after the unconscious darnay  with lucie and doctor manette  passed the gates of paris  the jailer came to the cell where sydney carton sat and called him .  it was the summons to die .  and with his thoughts on lucie  whom he had always hopelessly loved  and on her husband  whom he had thus saved to her  he went almost gladly .   a poor little seamstress rode in the death cart beside him .  she was so small and weak that she feared to die  and carton held her cold hand all the way and comforted her to the end .  cruel women of the people sat about the guillotine knitting and counting with their stitches  as each poor victim died .  and when carton s turn came  thinking he was darnay  the hated marquis de st .  evr  monde  they cursed him and laughed .   men said of him about the city that night that it was the peacefullest man s face ever beheld there .  if they could have read his thought  if he could have spoken it in words it would have been these    i see the lives  for which i lay down mine  peaceful and happy in that england i shall see no more .  i see lucie and darnay with a child that bears my name  and i see that i shall hold a place in their hearts for ever .  i see her weeping for me on the anniversary of this day .  i see the blot i threw upon my name faded away  and i know that till they die neither shall be more honored in the soul of the other than i am honored in the souls of both .  it is a far  far better thing that i do  than i have ever done  it is a far  far better rest that i go to than i have ever known .                 bleak house  published            scene

jane  his cat             bleak house  i  the court of chancery  an englishman named jarndyce  once upon a time having made a great fortune  died and left a great will .  the persons appointed to carry out its provisions could not agree  they fell to disputing among themselves and went to law over it .   the court which in england decides such suits is called the court of chancery .  its action is slow and its delays many  so that men generally consider it a huge misfortune to be obliged to have anything to do with it .  sometimes it has kept cases undecided for many years  till the heirs concerned were dead and gone  and often when the decision came at last there was no money left to be divided  because it had all been eaten up by the costs of the suit .  lawyers inherited some cases from their fathers  who themselves had made a living by them  and many suits had become so twisted that nobody alive could have told at last what they really meant .   such came to be the case with the jarndyce will .  it had been tried for so many years that the very name had become a joke .  those who began it were long since dead and their heirs either knew nothing of it or had given up hope of its ever being ended .   the only one who seemed to be interested in it was a little old woman named miss flite  whom delay and despair in a suit of her own had made half crazy .  for many years she had attended the chancery court every day and many thoughtless people made fun of her .   she was wretchedly poor and lived in a small room over a rag and bottle shop kept by a man named krook .  here she had a great number of birds in little cages  larks and linnets and goldfinches .  she had given them names to represent the different things which the cruel chancery court required to carry on these shameful suits  such as hope  youth  rest  ashes  ruin  despair  madness  folly  words  plunder and jargon .  she used to say that when the jarndyce case was decided she would open the cages and let the birds all go .   the last jarndyce that was left had given up in disgust all thought of the famous lawsuit and steadfastly refused to have anything to do with it .  he lived quietly in the country in a big  bare building called bleak house .  he was past middle age  and his hair was silver gray  but he was straight and strong and merry .   he was rich  yet was so tender hearted and benevolent that all who knew him loved him .  most of his good deeds he never told  for he had a great dislike to being thanked .  it used to be said that once  after he had done an extremely generous thing for a relative of his  seeing her coming in the front gate to thank him  he escaped by the back door and was not seen again for three months .  he never spoke ill of his neighbors  and whenever he was vexed he would pretend to look for a weather cock and say   dear  dear .  the wind must be coming from the east .    it happened  finally  that all the other jarndyce heirs had died except two  a young girl named ada clare and a young man named richard carstone .  these two  who were cousins  were left orphans .  the master of bleak house  therefore  in the goodness of his heart  offered them a home with him  and this they thankfully accepted .  mr .  jarndyce now wished to find a companion for ada clare  and this is how esther summerson comes into this story .   esther was a sweet girl who had been brought up by a stern  hard hearted woman whom she had always called  godmother   in ignorance of her parentage .  she had never known who were her mother or father  for from earliest babyhood her godmother had forbidden her to ask questions concerning them  and she would have had a sad and lonely youth but for her sunny disposition .   it was not till her godmother died suddenly that she found she had a guardian  and that he was mr .  jarndyce of bleak house .  how he came to be her guardian was a mystery to her  but she was glad to find herself not altogether friendless .  although he had taken the pains to see her more than once  and had noticed with pleasure what a cheerful  loving nature she had  yet esther had never  so far as she knew  seen him  so that she received his invitation to come and live at bleak house with joyful surprise .   she went  on the day appointed  to london  and there she met ada  whom she began to love at once  and richard  a handsome  careless young fellow of nineteen .  they spent the day together and got well acquainted before they took the morrow s coach to bleak house .   at the chancery court they met poor  crazy little miss flite  who insisted on taking them to her room above the rag and bottle shop to show them her caged birds .  and that night  as they had been directed  they stayed at the house of a mrs .  jellyby  of whom mr .  jarndyce had heard as a woman of great charity .   mrs .  jellyby was a woman with a mission  which mission was the education of the natives of borrioboola gha  in africa  and the cultivation there of the coffee bean .  she thought of nothing else  and was for ever sending out letters or pamphlets about it .   but she seemed unable to see or think of anything nearer home than africa .  the house was unswept  the children dirty and always under foot  and the meals half cooked .  she would sit all day in slipshod slippers and a dress that did not meet in the back  drinking coffee and dictating to her eldest daughter caddy  who hated africa and all its natives  letters about coffee cultivation and the uplifting of the natives of borrioboola gha .   a very strange sort of philanthropist both esther and ada thought mrs .  jellyby .  perhaps  however  mr .  jarndyce sent them there for a useful lesson  for he afterward asked them what they thought of her  and he seemed well pleased to learn that they considered her ideas of doing good in the world extremely odd .   next day they drove to bleak house .  not one of them had ever seen mr .  jarndyce  but they found him all they had imagined and more  the kindest  pleasantest and most thoughtful person in the world .  before they had been there two days they felt as if they had known him all their lives .   bleak house was a building where one went up and down steps from one room to another  and where there were always more rooms when one thought he had seen them all .  in the daytime there was horseback riding or walking to amuse them  and in the evenings ada often sang and played to the rest .  altogether the time flew by most pleasantly  and  judging by mr .  jarndyce s jollity  the wind seldom showed any signs of coming from the east .   it was soon clear to everybody that richard was in love with ada and that ada was beginning to love him in return .  this pleased mr .  jarndyce  for he was fond of both .   but he was fondest of esther .  he made her his housekeeper and she carried a big bunch of keys and kept the house as clean as a new pin .  he used to say she reminded him of    little old woman and whither so high .  to sweep the cobwebs out of the sky .    she was so cheerful  he said  she would sweep the cobwebs out of anybody s sky .  and from this they took to calling her  little old woman   and  cobweb   and  mother hubbard   till none of them thought of her real name at all .   bleak house had a number of visitors who came more or less often .  one of these was an old school friend of mr .  jarndyce s  named boythorn .  he was a big  blustering man with a laugh as big as himself .  wherever he went he carried a tiny tame canary  that used to sit at meal time perched on the top of his great shaggy head .  it was odd to see this wee bird sitting there unafraid  even at one of his  ha ha ha s  that shook the whole house .   mr .  boythorn was exceedingly tender hearted  but took delight in pretending to be the stubbornest  most cross grained  worst tempered individual possible .  his neighbor was sir leicester dedlock  a dignified and proud old baronet  and him mr .  boythorn loved to keep in perpetual anger by bringing against him all manner of lawsuits regarding the boundary between their land .   another visitor whom esther found amusing was harold skimpole  a light  bright creature of charming manners  with a large head and full of simple gaiety .  he was a man who seemed to trifle with everything .  he sang a little  composed a little and sketched a little .  but his songs were never completed and his sketches never finished .   his aim in life seemed to be to avoid all responsibility  and to find some one else to pay his debts .  he always spoke of himself as a  child   though he was middle aged .  he claimed to have no idea whatever of the value of money .  he would take a handful of coins from his pocket and say laughing   now  there s some money .  i have no idea how much .  i don t know how to count it .  i dare say i owe more than that .  if good natured people don t stop letting me owe them  why should i .  there you have harold skimpole .   mr .  jarndyce was far too honest and innocent himself to see through the man s hollow selfishness and was continually paying his debts  as they soon learned .   most of all bleak house s visitors  esther came to like allan woodcourt  a handsome dark haired young surgeon  and before long she found herself unconsciously looking and longing for his coming .  woodcourt was poor  however  and although he was in love with esther he did not tell her  but soon sailed away on a long voyage as a ship s doctor .   ii  lady dedlock s secret  sir leicester dedlock  whom mr .  boythorn so loved to torment  was seventy years old .  his wife  many years younger than himself  he had married for love .  lady dedlock was not noble by birth  no one  indeed  knew who she had been before her marriage  but she was very beautiful .  she was as proud and haughty  too  as she was lovely  and was much sought after .  but with all her popularity she had few close friends  and no one in whom she confided .   even her housekeeper  mrs .  rouncewell  a fine  handsome old woman who had been sir leicester s servant for fifty years  thought her cold and reserved .  mrs .  rouncewell herself had had a son george  who many years before had gone off to be a soldier and had never come back  and  looking at her mistress s face  she often wondered if the shadow of pain there was the mark of some old grief or loss of which no one knew .  however that may have been  the old baronet loved his wife and was very proud of her .   sir leicester s family lawyer was named tulkinghorn .  he was a dull  dignified man who always dressed in black and seldom spoke unless he had to .  his one passion was the discovery of other people s secrets .  he knew more family secrets than any one else in london  and to discover a new one he would have risked all his fortune .   now  among the very many persons connected in some way or other with the famous jarndyce case  which seemed destined never to end  was sir leicester dedlock  and one day  the chancery court having actually made a little progress  mr .  tulkinghorn brought the baronet some legal papers to read to him .   as the lawyer held one in his hand  lady dedlock  seeing the handwriting  asked in an agitated voice who had written it .  he answered that it was the work of one of his copyists .  a moment later  as he went on reading  they found that lady dedlock had fainted away .   her husband did not connect her faintness with the paper  but mr .  tulkinghorn did  and that instant he determined that lady dedlock had a secret  that this secret had something to do with the copyist  and that what this secret was  he  tulkinghorn  would discover .   he easily found that the writing had been done by a man who called himself  nemo   and who lived above krook s rag and bottle shop  a neighbor to crazy little miss flite of the chancery court and the many bird cages .   krook himself was an ignorant  spectacled old rascal  whose sole occupations seemed to be to sleep and to drink gin  a bottle of which stood always near him .  his only intimate was a big  gray  evil tempered cat called  lady jane   who  when not lying in wait for miss flite s birds  used to sit on his shoulder with her tail sticking straight up like a hairy feather .  people in the neighborhood called his dirty shop the  court of chancery   because  like that other court  it had so many old things in it and whatever its owner once got into it never got out again .   in return for mr .  tulkinghorn s money krook told him all he knew about his lodger .  nemo  it seemed  was surly and dissipated and did what legal copying he could get to do in order to buy opium with which he drugged himself daily .  so far as was known  he had but one friend  joe  a wretched crossing sweeper  to whom  when he had it  he often gave a coin .   thus much the lawyer learned  but from the strange lodger himself he learned nothing .  for when krook took him to the room nemo occupied  they found the latter stretched on his couch  dead  whether by accident or design no one could tell  of an overdose of opium .   curious to see how lady dedlock would receive this news  mr .  tulkinghorn called on her and told her of the unknown man s death .  she pretended to listen with little interest  but his trained eye saw that she was deeply moved by it  and he became more anxious than ever to find out what connection there could be between this proud and titled woman and the miserable copyist who had lived and died in squalor .   chance favored mr .  tulkinghorn s object .  one night he saw joe  the ragged crossing sweeper pointing out to a woman whose face was hidden by a veil  and whose form was closely wrapped in a french shawl  the gate of the cemetery where nemo had been buried .  later  at sir leicester s  he saw lady dedlock s maid  hortense  a black haired  jealous french woman  with wolf like ways  wearing the same shawl .   he cunningly entrapped the maid into coming to his house one night wearing both veil and shawl  and there brought her unexpectedly face to face with joe .  by the boy s actions mr .  tulkinghorn decided at once that joe had never seen hortense before  and that instant  he guessed the truth  that the veiled woman who had gone to the cemetery was really lady dedlock herself  and that she had worn her maid s clothes to mislead any observer .   this was a clever trick in the lawyer  but it proved too clever for his own good  for  finding she had been enticed there for some deeper purpose  hortense flew into a passion with him .  he sneered at her and turned her out into the street  threatening if she troubled him to have her put into prison .  because of this she began to hate him with a fierceness which he did not guess .   mr .  tulkinghorn felt himself getting nearer to his goal .  but he now had to find out who nemo really had been .   if he had only known it  krook could have aided him .  the old man had found a bundle of old letters in nemo s room after his death  and these were all addressed to  captain hawdon .    krook himself could not read  except enough to spell out an address  and he had no idea what the letters contained .  but he was quick to think the bundle might be worth some money .  so he put it carefully away .   but mr .  tulkinghorn found out nothing from krook  for one day a strange thing happened .  krook had drunk so much gin in his life that he had become perfectly soaked with alcohol  so that he was just like a big spongeful of it .  now  it is a curious fact that when a great mass of inflammable material is heaped together  sometimes it will suddenly burst into flame and burn up all in a minute  without anything or anybody setting fire to it .  this is just what happened to krook .  as he stood in the middle of the dirty shop  without any warning  all in a twinkling  he blazed up and burned  clothes and all  and in less time than it takes to tell it  there was nothing left but a little pile of ashes  a burnt mark in the floor and a sticky smoke that stuck to the window panes and hung in the air like soot .  and this was all the neighbors found when they came to search for him .   this was the end of krook  and the rag and bottle shop was taken possession of by grandfather smallweed  a hideous  crippled money lender  who had been his brother in law  and who at once went to work ransacking all the papers he could find on the premises .   grandfather smallweed was a thin  toothless  wheezy  green eyed old miser  who was so nearly dead from age and asthma that he had to be wheeled about by his granddaughter judy .   he had a wife who was out of her mind .  everything said in her hearing she connected with the idea of money .  if one said  for example   it s twenty minutes past noon   mrs .  smallweed would at once begin to gabble   twenty pence .  twenty pounds .  twenty thousand millions of bank notes locked up in a black box .   and she would not stop till her husband threw a cushion at her  which he kept beside him for that very purpose  and knocked her mouth shut .   grandfather smallweed soon discovered the bundle of letters hidden back of the shelf where lady jane  krook s big cat  slept .   the name they bore   captain hawdon   was familiar enough to the money lender .  long ago  when hawdon was living a dissipated life in london  he had borrowed money from grandfather smallweed  and this money was still unpaid when he had disappeared .  it was said that he had fallen overboard from a vessel and had been drowned .   to think now that the captain had been living as a copyist all these years in london  free from arrest for the debt  filled the wizened soul of the old man with rage .  he was ready enough to talk when mr .  tulkinghorn questioned him  and finally sold him the bundle of letters .   the lawyer saw that they were in lady dedlock s penmanship  it remained to prove that the dead nemo had really been captain hawdon .   mr .  tulkinghorn  of course  had many specimens of the copyist s hand  and after much search he found a man who had once been a fellow soldier of the captain s .  he was called  mr .  george   and kept a shooting gallery .  mr .  george had among his papers a letter once written him by captain hawdon  and not knowing the purpose for which it was to be used  loaned it to the lawyer .  the handwriting was the same .  and thus mr .  tulkinghorn knew that the copyist had really been captain hawdon and that the letters in the bundle had once been written to him by the woman who was now the haughty lady dedlock .   it was a strange  sad story that the letters disclosed  as mr .  tulkinghorn  gloating over his success  read them  line by line .  the man who had fallen so low as to drag out a wretched existence by copying law papers  whom  until she saw the handwriting in the lawyer s hands  she had believed to be dead  was a man lady dedlock had once loved .   many years before  when a young woman  she had run away from home with him .  a little child was born to them whom she named esther .  when she and hawdon had separated  her sister  to hide from the world the knowledge of the elopement  had told her the baby esther was dead  had taken the child to another part of the country  given her the name of summerson  and  calling herself her godmother instead of her aunt  brought her up in ignorance of the truth .  years had gone by and captain hawdon was reported drowned .  at length the little esther s mother had met and married sir leicester dedlock  and in his love and protection had thought her dark past buried from view for ever .   all this the pitiless lawyer read in the letters  and knew that lady dedlock s happiness was now in his hands .  and as he thought how  with this knowledge  he could torture her with the fear of discovery  his face took on the look of a cat s when it plays with a mouse it has caught .   meanwhile lady dedlock had suffered much .  the knowledge that hawdon had not been drowned as she had supposed  had come to her like a thunderclap .  and the news of his death  following so soon after this discovery  had unnerved her .  she felt mr .  tulkinghorn s suspicious eyes watching her always and began to tremble in dread of what he might know .   in the midst of these fears  she accidentally discovered one day that the baby name of esther summerson of bleak house had been  not summerson  but hawdon .   this made lady dedlock guess the whole truth  that esther was in reality her own daughter .  as soon as she was alone  she threw herself on her knees in the empty room with sobs  crying    oh  my child .  my child .  not dead in the first hours of her life  as my cruel sister told me  but sternly nurtured by her  after she had renounced me and my name .  oh  my child .  my child .    iii  little joe plays a part  while these events  which so closely concerned esther  were occurring in london  life at bleak house went quietly on .  ada and esther had become bosom friends  and both loved and respected mr .  jarndyce above every one .  harold skimpole  as charming and careless as ever  and as willing as ever that some one else should pay his debts for him  was often there  and whenever they went to the city they saw miss flite and mrs .  jellyby  the latter still busily sending letters about the growing of coffee and the education of the natives of borrioboola gha .   esther grew especially to like caddy  the slipshod daughter to whom mrs .  jellyby dictated her letters .  the poor girl had much good in her  and esther encouraged and helped her all she could .  caddy finally fell in love with prince turveydrop  a blue eyed  flaxen haired young man whose father kept a dancing school .   old mr .  turveydrop  his father  was a fat man with a false complexion  false teeth  false whiskers  a wig and a padded chest .  he always carried a cane  eye glass and snuff box and was so tightly buttoned up that when he bowed you could almost see creases come into the whites of his eyes .  he thought himself a model of politeness and stood about to show off his clothes while he made his son  prince  do all the teaching .   caddy was so tired of hearing about africa that at last she married prince and moved into the turveydrop dancing school  and mrs .  jellyby had to hire a boy to help her with her great plans for the education of the natives of borrioboola gha .   once esther and ada went with mr .  jarndyce to visit mr .  boythorn  the man with the tremendous laugh and the pet canary  at his country house where he lived in one perpetual quarrel with his neighbor  sir leicester dedlock .  esther had often heard of the beauty of lady dedlock  and one sunday in the village church she saw her .  there was something strangely familiar in her look that reminded esther of her godmother .  an odd sensation came over her then and she felt her heart beat quickly .  but this was before lady dedlock had guessed the truth  and esther and she did not meet .   richard carstone had soon begun to be a source of great anxiety to all at bleak house .  it was plainly to be seen that he loved ada dearly  and that she loved him as well  but to mr .  jarndyce s regret he had begun to think and dream of the famous chancery suit and of the fortune that would be his when it ended .  mr .  jarndyce  from his own bitter experience  hated the chancery court and everything connected with it  and saw with grief that richard was growing to be a ne er do well  who found it easier to trust in the future than to labor in the present .   in spite of all advice richard went from bad to worse .  he began the study of medicine  soon changed this for law  and lastly decided to enter the army .  he was naturally a spendthrift  and as long as his money lasted harold skimpole found him a very fine friend and helped him spend it .   skimpole also introduced to him a knavish lawyer named vholes  who made him believe the great chancery suit must soon end in his favor  and who  when richard had put the case in his hands  proceeded to rob him of all he had .  he poisoned his mind  too  against mr .  jarndyce  so that richard began to think his truest friend deceitful .   ada saw this with pain  but she loved richard above all else  and the more so when she saw him so wretched and deceived  and at last  without telling either mr .  jarndyce or esther what she was going to do  she went to richard one day and married him  so that  as her husband  he could take the little fortune she possessed to pay vholes to go on with the chancery suit .   a great misfortune befell esther about this time  a misfortune that came to her  strangely enough  through little joe  the crossing sweeper .   half starved  ragged and homeless all his life  joe had never known kindness save that given to him by the poor copyist who had lived above krook s rag and bottle shop .  he lived  if having a corner to sleep in can be called living  in a filthy alley called  tom all alone s .   it seemed to him that every one he met told him to  move on .   the policeman  the shopkeepers at whose doors he stopped for warmth  all told him to  move on   till the wretched lad wondered if there was any spot in london where he could rest undisturbed .   mr .  tulkinghorn  in his search to find out the woman who had hired joe to show her the cemetery  had dogged him so with his detective that at length the lad had become frightened and left london for the open country .  there he was taken very ill  and on the highway near bleak house one evening esther found him helpless and delirious with fever .   touched by his condition she had him taken at once to bleak house and put to bed  intending when morning came to send for a doctor .   but in the morning little joe was missing .  though they searched high and low he was not to be found  and they decided that in his delirium he had taken to the road again .  it was not till long after that esther found his leaving had been brought about by harold skimpole  who was then visiting bleak house  and who  in his selfishness  feared the boy might be the bearer of some contagious disease .   this unfortunately proved to be the case .  joe s illness was smallpox  and a few days later a maid of esther s fell ill with it .  esther nursed her day and night  and just as she was recovering was stricken with it herself .   in her unselfishness and love for the rest  before unconsciousness came  she made the maid promise faithfully to allow no one  particularly neither mr .  jarndyce nor her beloved ada  to enter the room till all danger was past .   for many days esther hovered between life and death and all the time the maid kept her word .  caddy came from the turveydrop dancing school early and late  and little miss flite walked the twenty miles from london in thin shoes to inquire for her .  and at length  slowly  she began to grow well again .   but the disease had left its terrible mark .  when she first looked in a mirror she found that her beauty was gone and her face strangely altered .   this was a great grief to her at first  but on the day when mr .  jarndyce came into her sick room and held her in his arms and said   my dear  dear girl .   she thought   he has seen me and is fonder of me than before .  so what have i to mourn for .   she thought of allan woodcourt  too  the young surgeon somewhere on the sea  and she was glad that  if he had loved her before he sailed away  he had not told her so .  now  she told herself  when they met again and he saw her so sadly changed he would have given her no promise he need regret .   when she was able to travel  esther went for a short stay at the house of mr .  boythorn  and there  walking under the trees she grew stronger .   one day  as she sat in the park that surrounded the house  she saw lady dedlock coming toward her  and seeing how pale and agitated she was  esther felt the same odd sensation she had felt in the church .  lady dedlock threw herself sobbing at her feet  and put her arms around her and kissed her  as she told her that she was her unhappy mother  who must keep her secret for the sake of her husband  sir leicester .   esther thought her heart must break with both grief and joy at once .  but she comforted lady dedlock  and told her nothing would ever change her love for her  and they parted with tears and kisses .   another surprise of a different sort awaited esther on her return to bleak house .  mr .  jarndyce told her that he loved her and asked her if she would marry him .  and  remembering how tender he had always been  and knowing that he loved her in spite of her disfigured face  she said yes .   but one day  the very day he returned  esther saw allan woodcourt on the street .  somehow at the first glimpse of him she knew that she had loved him all along .  then she remembered that she had promised to marry mr .  jarndyce  and she began to tremble and ran away without speaking to woodcourt at all .   but they soon met  and this time it was joe the crossing sweeper who brought them together .  woodcourt found the poor ragged wanderer in the street  so ill that he could hardly walk .  he had recovered from smallpox  but it had left him so weak that he had become a prey to consumption .  the kind hearted surgeon took the boy to little miss flite and they found him a place to stay in mr .  george s shooting gallery  where they did what they could for him  and where esther and mr .  jarndyce came to see him .   joe was greatly troubled when he learned he had brought the smallpox to bleak house  and one day he got some one to write out for him in very large letters that he was sorry and hoped esther and all the others would forgive him .  and this was his will .   on the last day allan woodcourt sat beside him   joe  my poor fellow   he said .    i hear you  sir  but it s dark  let me catch your hand .     joe  can you say what i say .     i ll say anything as you do  sir  for i know it s good .     our father .     our father  yes  that s very good  sir .     which art in heaven .     art in heaven .  is the light a comin   sir .     hallowed be thy name .     hallowed be  thy       but the light had come at last .  little joe was dead .   iv  esther becomes the mistress of bleak house  when the last bit of proof was fast in his possession mr .  tulkinghorn  pluming himself on the cleverness with which he had wormed his way into lady dedlock s secret  went to her at her london home and informed her of all he had discovered  delighting in the fear and dread which she could not help showing .  she knew now that this cruel man would always hold his knowledge over her head  torturing her with the threat of making it known to her husband .   some hours after he had gone home  she followed him there to beg him not to tell her husband what he had discovered .  but all was dark in the lawyer s house .  she rang the private bell twice  but there was no answer  and she returned in despair .   by a coincidence some one else had been seen to call at mr .  tulkinghorn s that same night .  this was mr .  george  of the shooting gallery  who came to get back the letter he had loaned to the lawyer .   when morning came it was found that a dreadful deed had been done that night .  mr .  tulkinghorn was found lying dead on the floor of his private apartment  shot through the heart .  all the secrets he had so cunningly discovered and gloated over with such delight had not been able to save his life there in that room .   mr .  tulkinghorn was so well known that the murder made a great sensation .  the police went at once to the shooting gallery to arrest mr .  george and he was put into jail .   he was able later to prove his innocence  however  and  all in all  his arrest turned out to be a fortunate thing .  for by means of it old mrs .  rouncewell  lady dedlock s housekeeper  discovered that he was her own son george  who had gone off to be a soldier so many years before .  he had made up his mind not to return till he was prospering .  but somehow this time had never come  bad fortune had followed him and he had been ashamed to go back .   but though he had acted so wrongly he had never lost his love for his mother  and was glad to give up the shooting gallery and go with mrs .  rouncewell to become sir leicester s personal attendant .   at first  after the death of mr .  tulkinghorn  lady dedlock had hoped that her dread and fear were now ended  but she soon found that this was not to be .  the telltale bundle of letters was in the possession of a detective whom the cruel lawyer had long ago called to his aid  and the detective  thinking lady dedlock herself might have had something to do with the murder  thought it his duty to tell all that his dead employer had discovered to sir leicester .   it was a fearful shock to the haughty baronet to find so many tongues had been busy with the name his wife had borne so proudly .  when the detective finished  sir leicester fell unconscious  and when he came to his senses had lost the power to speak .   they laid him on his bed  sent for doctors and went to tell lady dedlock  but she had disappeared .   almost at one and the same moment the unhappy woman had learned not only that the detective had told his story to sir leicester  but that she herself was suspected of the murder .  these two blows were more than she could bear .  she put on a cloak and veil and  leaving all her money and jewels behind her  with a note for her husband  went out into the shrill  frosty wind .  the note read    if i am sought for or accused of his murder  believe i am wholly innocent .  i have no home left  i will trouble you no more .  may you forget me and forgive me .    they gave sir leicester this note  and great agony came to the stricken man s heart .  he had always loved and honored her  and he loved her no less now for what had been told him .  nor did he believe for a moment that she could be guilty of the murder .  he wrote on a slate the words   forgive  find   and the detective started at once to overtake the fleeing woman .   he went first to esther  to whom he told the sad outcome  and together they began the search .  for two days they labored  tracing lady dedlock s movements step by step  through the pelting snow and wind  across the frozen wastes outside of london  where brick kilns burned and where she had exchanged clothes with a poor laboring woman  the better to elude pursuit  then back to london again  where at last they found her .   but it was too late .  she was lying frozen in the snow  at the gate of the cemetery where captain hawdon  the copyist whom she had once loved  lay buried .   so lady dedlock s secret was hidden at last by death .  only the detective  whose business was silence  sir leicester her husband  and esther her daughter  knew what her misery had been or the strange circumstances of her flight  for the police soon succeeded in tracing the murder of mr .  tulkinghorn to hortense  the revengeful french maid whom he had threatened to put in prison .   one other shadow fell on esther s life before the clouds cleared away for ever .   grandfather smallweed  rummaging among the papers in krook s shop  found an old will  and this proved to be a last will made by the original jarndyce  whose affairs the court of chancery had been all these years trying to settle .  this will bequeathed the greater part of the fortune to richard carstone  and its discovery  of course  would have put a stop to the famous suit .   but the suit stopped of its own accord  for it was found now that there was no longer any fortune left to go to law about or to be willed to anybody .  all the money had been eaten up by the costs .   after all the years of hope and strain  this disappointment was too much for richard  and he died that night  at the very hour when poor crazed little miss flite  as she had said she would do when the famous suit ended  gave all her caged birds their liberty .   the time came at length  after the widowed ada and her baby boy had come to make their home with mr .  jarndyce  when esther felt that she should fulfil her promise and become the mistress of bleak house .  so she told her guardian she was ready to marry him when he wished .  he appointed a day  and she began to prepare her wedding clothes .   but mr .  jarndyce  true hearted and generous as he had always been  had an idea very different from this in his mind .  he had found  on allan woodcourt s return from his voyage  that the young surgeon still loved esther .  his keen eye had seen that she loved him in return  and he well knew that if she married him  jarndyce  it would be because of her promise and because her grateful heart could not find it possible to refuse him .  so  wishing most of all her happiness  he determined to give up his own love for her sake .   he bought a house in the town in which woodcourt had decided to practise medicine  remodeled it and named it  bleak house   after his own .  when it was finished in the way he knew esther liked best  he took her to see it  telling her it was to be a present from him to the surgeon to repay him for his kindness to little joe .   then  when she had seen it all  he told her that he had guessed her love for woodcourt  and that  though she married the surgeon and not himself  she would still be carrying out her promise and would still become the mistress of  bleak house .    when she lifted her tearful face from his shoulder she saw that woodcourt was standing near them .    this is  bleak house    said jarndyce .   this day i give this house its little mistress  and  before god  it is the brightest day of my life .               hard times  published       scene  coketown  an english factory town  and the country .   time  about       characters  mr

square wall of a forehead and a wide  thin  set mouth .  his head was bald and shining  covered with knobs like the crust of a plum pie  and skirted with bristling hair .  he had grown rich in the hardware business  and was a school director of the town .   he believed in nothing but  facts .   everything in the world to him was good only to weigh and measure  and wherever he went one would have thought he carried in his pocket a rule and scales and the multiplication table .  he seemed a kind of human cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts .    now  what i want is facts .   he used to say to mr .  m choakumchild  the schoolmaster .   teach boys and girls nothing but facts .  facts alone are wanted in life .  nothing else is of any service to anybody .  stick to facts  sir .    he had several children whom he had brought up according to this system of his  and they led wretched lives .  no little gradgrind child had ever seen a face in the moon  or learned mother goose or listened to fairy stories  or read the arabian nights .  they all hated coketown  always rattling and throbbing with machinery  they hated its houses all built of brick as red as an indian s face  and its black canal and river purple with dyes .  and most of all they hated facts .   louisa  the eldest daughter  looked jaded  for her imagination was quite starved under their teachings .  tom  her younger brother  was defiant and sullen .   i wish   he used to say   that i could collect all the facts and all the figures in the world  and all the people who found them out  and i wish i could put a thousand pounds of gunpowder under them and blow them all up together .    louisa was generous  and the only love she knew was for her selfish  worthless brother  who repaid her with very little affection .  of their mother they saw very little  she was a thin  white  pink eyed bundle of shawls  feeble and ailing  and had too little mind to oppose her husband in anything .   strangely enough  mr .  gradgrind had once had a tender heart  and down beneath the facts of his system he had it still  though it had been covered up so long that nobody would have guessed it .  least of all  perhaps  his own children .   mr .  gradgrind s intimate friend   one whom he was foolish enough to admire   was josiah bounderby  a big  loud  staring man with a puffed head whose skin was stretched so tight it seemed to hold his eyes open .  he owned the coketown mills and a bank besides  and was very rich and pompous .   bounderby was a precious hypocrite  of an odd sort .  his greatest pride was to talk continually of his former poverty and wretchedness  and he delighted to tell everybody that he had been born in a ditch  deserted by his wicked mother  and brought up a vagabond by a drunken grandmother  from which low state he had made himself wealthy and respected by his own unaided efforts .   now  this was not in the least true .  as a matter of fact  his grandmother had been a respectable  honest soul  and his mother had pinched and saved to bring him up decently  had given him some schooling  and finally apprenticed him in a good trade .  but bounderby was so ungrateful and so anxious to have people think he himself deserved all the credit  that after he became rich he forbade his mother even to tell any one who she was  and made her live in a little shop in the country forty miles from coketown .   but in her good and simple heart the old woman was so proud of her son that she used to spend all her little savings to come into town  sometimes walking a good part of the way  cleanly and plainly dressed  and with her spare shawl and umbrella  just to watch him go into his fine house or to look in admiration at the mills or the fine bank he owned .  on such occasions she called herself  mrs .  pegler   and thought no one else would be the wiser .   the house in which bounderby lived had no ornaments .  it was cold and lonely and rich .  he made his mill hands more than earn their wages  and when any of them complained  he sneered that they wanted to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a golden spoon .   bounderby had for housekeeper a mrs .  sparsit  who talked a great deal of her genteel birth  rich relatives and of the better days she had once seen .  she was a busybody  and when she sat of an evening cutting out embroidery with sharp scissors  her bushy eyebrows and roman nose made her look like a hawk picking out the eyes of a very tough little bird .  in her own mind she had set her cap at bounderby .   so firmly had mr .  gradgrind put his trust in the gospel of facts which he had taught louisa and tom that he was greatly shocked one day to catch them  instead of studying any one of the dry sciences ending in  ology  which he made them learn  peeping through the knot holes in a wooden pavilion along the road at the performance of a traveling circus .   the circus  which was run by a man named sleary  had settled itself in the neighborhood for some time to come  and all the performers meanwhile boarded in a near by public house  the pegasus s arms .  the show was given every day  and at the moment of mr .  gradgrind s appearance one  signor  jupe  the clown  was showing the tricks of his trained dog  merrylegs  and entertaining the audience with his choicest jokes .   mr .  gradgrind  dumb with amazement  seized both louisa and tom and led them home  repeating at intervals  with indignation   what would mr .  bounderby say .    this question was soon answered  for the latter was at stone lodge when they arrived .  he reminded mr .  gradgrind that there was an evil influence in the school the children attended  which no doubt had led them to such idle pursuits  this evil influence being the little daughter of jupe  the circus clown .  and bounderby advised mr .  gradgrind to have the child put out of the school at once .   the name of the clown s little daughter was cecelia  but every one called her sissy .  she was a dark eyed  dark haired  appealing child  frowned upon by mr .  m choakumchild  the schoolmaster  because somehow many figures would not stay in her head at one time .   when the circus first came  her father  who loved her very much  had brought her to the gradgrind house and begged that she be allowed to attend school .  mr .  gradgrind had consented .  now  however  at bounderby s advice  he wished he had not done so  and started off with the other to the pegasus s arms to find signor jupe and deny to little sissy the right of any more schooling .   poor jupe had been in great trouble that day .  for a long time he had felt that he was growing too old for the circus business .  his joints were getting stiff  he missed in his tumbling  and he could no longer make the people laugh as he had once done .  he knew that before long sleary would be obliged to discharge him  and this he thought he could not bear to have sissy see .   he had therefore made up his mind to leave the company and disappear .  he was too poor to take sissy with him  so  loving her as he did  he decided to leave her there where at least she had some friends .  he had come to this melancholy conclusion this very day  and had sent sissy out on an errand so that he might slip away  accompanied only by his dog  merrylegs  while she was absent .   sissy was returning when she met mr .  gradgrind and bounderby  and came with them to find her father .  but at the public house she met only sympathizing looks  for all of the performers had guessed what her father had done .  they told her as gently as they could  but poor sissy was at first broken hearted in her grief and was comforted only by the assurance that her father would certainly come back to her before long .   while sissy wept mr .  gradgrind had been pondering .  he saw here an excellent chance to put his  system  to the test .  to take this untaught girl and bring her up from the start entirely on facts would be a good experiment .  with this in view  then  he proposed to take sissy to his house and to care for and teach her  provided she promised to have nothing further to do with the circus or its members .   sissy knew how anxious her father had been to have her learn  so she agreed  and was taken at once to stone lodge and set to work upon facts .   but alas .  mr .  gradgrind s education seemed to make sissy low spirited  but no wiser .  every day she watched and longed for some message from her father  but none came .  she was loving and lovable  and louisa liked her and comforted her as well as she could .  but louisa was far too unhappy herself to be of much help to any one else .   several years went by .  sissy s father had never returned .  she had grown into a quiet  lovely girl  the only ray of light in that gloomy home .  mr .  gradgrind had realized one of his ambitions  had been elected to parliament and now spent much time in london .  mrs .  gradgrind was yet feebler and more ailing .  tom had grown to be a young man  a selfish and idle one  and bounderby had made him a clerk in his bank .  louisa  not blind to her brother s faults  but loving him devotedly  had become  in this time  an especial object of bounderby s notice .   indeed  the mill owner had determined to marry her .  louisa had always been repelled by his coarseness and rough ways  and when he proposed for her hand she shrank from the thought .  if her father had ever encouraged her confidence she might then have thrown herself on his breast and told him all that she felt  but to mr .  gradgrind marriage was only a cold fact with no romance in it  and his manner chilled her .  tom  in his utter selfishness  thought only of what a good thing it would be for him if his sister married his employer  and urged it on her with no regard whatever for her own liking .   at length  thinking  as long as she had never been allowed to have a sentiment that could not be put down in black and white  that it did not much matter whom she married after all  and believing that at least it would help tom  she consented .   she married bounderby  the richest man in coketown  and went to live in his fine house  while mrs .  sparsit  the housekeeper  angry and revengeful  found herself compelled to move into small rooms over bounderby s bank .   ii  the robbery of bounderby s bank  in one of bounderby s weaving mills a man named stephen blackpool had worked for years .  he was sturdy and honest  but had a stooping frame  a knitted brow and iron gray hair  for in his forty years he had known much trouble .   many years before he had married  unhappily  for through no fault or failing of his own  his wife took to drink  left off work  and became a shame and a disgrace to the town .  when she could get no money to buy drink with  she sold his furniture  and often he would come home from the mill to find the rooms stripped of all their belongings and his wife stretched on the floor in drunken slumber .  at last he was compelled to pay her to stay away  and even then he lived in daily fear lest she return to disgrace him afresh .   what made this harder for stephen to bear was the true love he had for a sweet  patient  working woman in the mill named rachel .  she had an oval  delicate face  with gentle eyes and dark  shining hair .  she knew his story and loved him  too .  he could not marry her  because his own wife stood in the way  nor could he even see or walk with her often  for fear busy tongues might talk of it  but he watched every flutter of her shawl .   one night stephen went home to his lodging to find his wife returned .  she was lying drunk across his bed  a besotted creature  stained and splashed  and evil to look at .  all that night he sat sleepless and sick at heart .   next day  at the noon hour  he went to his employer s house to ask his advice .  he knew the law sometimes released two people from the marriage tie when one or the other lived wickedly  and his whole heart longed to marry rachel .   but bounderby told him bluntly that the law he had in mind was only for rich men  who could afford to spend a great deal of money .  and he further added  according to his usual custom  that he had no doubt stephen would soon be demanding the turtle soup and venison and the golden spoon .   stephen went home that night hopeless  knowing what he should find there .  but rachel had heard and was there before him .  she had tidied the room and was tending the woman who was his wife .  it seemed to stephen  as he saw her in her work of mercy  there was an angel s halo about her head .   soon the wretched creature she had aided passed out of his daily life again to go he knew not where  and this act of rachel s remained to make his love and longing greater .   about this time a stranger came to coketown .  he was james harthouse  a suave  polished man of the world  good looking  well dressed  with a gallant yet indolent manner and bold eyes .   being wealthy  he had tried the army  tried a government position  tried jerusalem  tried yachting and found himself bored by them all .  at last he had tried facts and figures  having some idea these might help in politics .  in london he had met the great believer in facts  mr .  gradgrind  and had been sent by him to coketown to make the acquaintance of his friend bounderby .  harthouse thus met the mill owner  who introduced him to louisa  now his wife .   the year of married life had not been a happy one for her .  she was reserved and watchful and cold as ever  but harthouse easily saw that she was ashamed of bounderby s bragging talk and shrank from his coarseness as from a blow .  he soon perceived  too  that the only love she had for any one was given to tom  though the latter little deserved it .  in his own mind harthouse called her father a machine  her brother a whelp and her husband a bear .   harthouse was attracted by louisa s beauty no less than by her pride .  he was without conscience or honor  and determined  though she was already married  to make her fall in love with him .  he knew the surest way to her liking was to pretend an interest in tom  and he at once began to flatter the sullen young fellow .  under his influence the latter was not long in telling the story of louisa s marriage  and in boasting that he himself had brought it about for his own advancement .   to louisa  harthouse spoke regretfully of the lad s idle habits  yet hopefully of his future  so that she  deeming him honestly tom s friend  confided in him  telling him of her brother s love of gambling and how she had more than once paid his debts by selling some of her own jewelry .  in such ways as these harthouse  step by step  gained an intimacy with her .   while harthouse was thus setting his net  stephen blackpool  the mill worker  was on trial .   it was a time of great dissatisfaction among workmen throughout the country .  in many towns they were banding themselves together into  unions  in order to gain more privileges and higher wages from their employers .  this movement in time had reached coketown .  rachel was opposed to these unions  believing they would in the end do their members more harm than good  and knowing her mind  stephen had long ago promised her that he would never join one .  the day had come  however  when a workman who thus declined was looked on with suspicion and dislike by his fellows  and at length  though all had liked and respected stephen  because he steadfastly refused to join the rest  he found himself shunned .  day after day he went to and from his work alone and spoken to by none  and  not seeing rachel in these days  was lonely and disheartened .   this condition of things did not escape the eye of bounderby  who sent for stephen and questioned him .  but even in his trouble  thinking his fellow workmen believed themselves in the right  stephen refused to complain or to bear tales of them .  bounderby  in his arrogance  chose to be angry that one of his mill hands should presume not to answer his questions and discharged him forthwith  so that now stephen found himself without friends  money or work .   not wholly without friends  either  for rachel was still the same .  and he had gained another friend  too .  while he told her that evening in his lodgings what had occurred  and that he must soon go in search of work in some other town  louisa came to him .  she had witnessed the interview in which her husband had discharged this faithful workman  had found out where he lived  and had made her brother tom bring her there that she might tell stephen how sorry she was and beg him to accept money from her to help him in his distress .   this kindness touched stephen .  he thanked her and took as a loan a small portion of the money she offered him .   tom had come on this errand with his sister in a sulky humor .  while he listened now a thought came to him .  as louisa talked with rachel  he beckoned stephen from the room and told him that he could perhaps aid him in finding work .  he told him to wait during the next two or three evenings near the door of bounderby s bank  and promised that he himself would seek stephen there and tell him further .   there was no kindness  however  in this proposal .  it was a sudden plan  wicked and cowardly .  tom had become a criminal .  he had stolen money from the bank and trembled daily lest the theft become known .  what would be easier now  he thought  than to hide his crime  by throwing suspicion on some one else .  he could force the door of the safe before he left at night  and drop a key of the bank door  which he had secretly made  in the street where it would afterward be found .  he himself  then  next morning  could appear to find the safe open and the money missing .  stephen  he considered  would be just the one to throw suspicion upon .   all unconscious of this plot  stephen in good faith waited near the bank during three evenings  walking past the building again and again  watching vainly for tom to appear .  mrs .  sparsit  at her upper window  wondered to see his bowed form haunting the place .  nothing came of his waiting  however  and the fourth morning saw him  with his thoughts on rachel  trudging out of town along the highroad  bravely and uncomplainingly  toward whatever new lot the future held for him .   tom s plot worked well .  next day there was a sensation in coketown .  bounderby s bank was found to have been robbed .  the safe  tom declared  he had found open  with a large part of its contents missing .  a key to the bank door was picked up in the street  this  it was concluded  the thief had thrown away after using .  who had done it .  had any suspicious person been seen about the place .   many people remembered a strange old woman  apparently from the country  who called herself  mrs .  pegler   and who had often been seen standing looking fixedly at the bank .  what more natural than to suspect her .   then another rumor began to grow .  stephen blackpool  discharged from the mill by bounderby himself  the workman who had been shunned by all his comrades  to whom no one spoke  he had been seen recently loitering  night after night  near the robbed bank .  where was he .  gone  none knew where .   in an hour stephen was suspected .  by the next day half of coketown believed him guilty .   iii  harthouse s plan fails  two persons  however  had a suspicion of the truth .  one of these was the porter of the bank  whose suspicion was strong .  the other was louisa  who  though her love denied it room  hid in her secret heart a fear that her brother had had a share in the crime .  in the night she went to tom s bedside  put her arms around him and begged him to tell her any secret he might be keeping from her .  but he answered sullenly that he did not know what she meant .   mrs .  sparsit s fine bred nerves  so she insisted  were so shaken by the robbery that she came to bounderby s house to remain till she recovered .   the feeble  pink eyed bundle of shawls that was mrs .  gradgrind  happening to die at this time  and louisa being absent at her mother s funeral  mrs .  sparsit saw her opportunity .  she had never forgiven louisa for marrying bounderby  and she now revenged herself by a course of such flattery that the vulgar bully began to think his cold  proud wife much too regardless of him and of his importance .   what pleased the hawk faced old busybody most was the game the suave harthouse was playing  which she was sharp enough to see through at once .  if louisa would only disgrace herself by running away with harthouse  thought mrs .  sparsit  bounderby might be free again and she might marry him .  so she watched narrowly the growing intimacy between them  hoping for louisa s ruin .   there came a day when bounderby was summoned on business to london  and louisa stayed meanwhile at the bounderby country house  which lay some distance from coketown .  mrs .  sparsit guessed that harthouse would use this chance to see louisa alone  and  to spy upon her  took the train herself  reaching there at nightfall .   she went afoot from the station to the grounds  opened the gate softly and crept close to the house .  here and there in the dusk  through garden and wood  she stole  and at length she found what she sought .  there under the trees stood harthouse  his horse tied near by  and talking with him was louisa .   mrs .  sparsit stood behind a tree  like robinson crusoe in his ambuscade against the savages  and listened with all her ears .  she could not hear all  but caught enough to know that he was telling her he loved her  and begging her to leave her husband  her home and friends  and to run away with him .   in her delight and in the noise of rain upon the foliage  for a thunder storm was rolling up  mrs .  sparsit did not catch louisa s answer .  where and when harthouse asked her to join him  she could not hear  but as he mounted and rode away she thought he said  to night .    she waited in the rain  rejoicing  till her patience was at length rewarded by seeing louisa  cloaked and veiled as if for a journey  come from the house and go toward the railroad station .  then mrs .  sparsit  drawing her draggled shawl over her head to hide her face  followed  boarded the same train  and hastened to tell the news of his wife s elopement to bounderby in london .   wet to the skin  her feet squashing in her shoes  her clothes spoiled and her bonnet looking like an over ripe fig  with a terrible cold that made her voice only a whisper  and sneezing herself almost to pieces  mrs .  sparsit found bounderby at his city hotel  exploded with the combustible information she carried and fainted quite away on his coat collar .   furious at the news she brought  bounderby hustled her into a fast train  and together  he raging and glaring and she inwardly jubilant  they hurried toward coketown to inform mr .  gradgrind  who was then at home  of his daughter s doings .   but where  meanwhile  was louisa .  not run away with harthouse  as mrs .  sparsit so fondly imagined  but safe in her own father s house in coketown .   she had suffered much without complaint  but harthouse s proposal had been the last straw .  added to all the insults she had suffered at her husband s hands  and her fearful suspicion of tom s guilt  it had proven too much for her to bear .  she had pretended to agree to harthouse s plan only that she might the more quickly rid herself of his presence .   mr .  gradgrind  astonished at her sudden arrival at stone lodge  was shocked no less at her ghastly appearance than by what she said .  she told him she cursed the hour when she had been born to grow up a victim to his teachings  that her whole life had been empty  that every hope  affection and fancy had been crushed from her very infancy and her better angel made a demon .  she told him the whole truth about her marriage to bounderby  that she had married him solely for the advancement of tom  the only one she had ever loved  and that now she could no longer live with her husband or bear the life she had made for herself .   and when she had said this  louisa  the daughter his  system  had brought to such despair  fell at his feet .   at her pitiful tale the tender heart that mr .  gradgrind had buried in his long past youth under his mountain of facts stirred again and began to beat .  the mountain crumbled away  and he saw in an instant  as by a lightning flash  that the plan of life to which he had so rigidly held was a complete and hideous failure .  he had thought there was but one wisdom  that of the head  he knew at last that there was a deeper wisdom of the heart also  which all these years he had denied .   when she came to herself  louisa found her father sitting by her bedside .  his face looked worn and older .  he told her he realized at last his life mistake and bitterly reproached himself .  sissy  too  was there  her love shining like a beautiful light on the other s darkness .  she knelt beside the bed and laid the weary head on her breast  and then for the first time louisa burst into sobs .   next day sissy sought out harthouse  who was waiting  full of sulky impatience at the failure of louisa to appear as he had expected .  sissy told him plainly what had occurred  and that he should never see louisa again .  harthouse  realizing that his plan had failed  suddenly discovered that he had a great liking for camels  and left the same hour for egypt  never to return to coketown .   it was while sissy was absent on this errand of her own that the furious bounderby and the triumphant mrs .  sparsit  the latter voiceless and still sneezing  appeared at stone lodge .   mr .  gradgrind took the mill owner greatly aback with the statement that louisa had had no intention whatever of eloping and was then in that same house and under his care .  angry and blustering at being made such a fool of  bounderby turned on mrs .  sparsit  but in her disappointment at finding it a mistake  she had dissolved in tears .  when mr .  gradgrind told him he had concluded it would be better for louisa to remain for some time there with him  bounderby flew into a still greater rage and stamped off  swearing his wife should come home by noon next day or not at all .   to be sure louisa did not go  and next day bounderby sent her clothes to mr .  gradgrind  advertised his country house for sale  and  needing something to take his spite out upon  redoubled his efforts to find the robber of the bank .   and he began by covering the town with printed placards  offering a large regard for the arrest of stephen blackpool .   iv  stephen s return  rachel had known  of course  of the rumors against stephen  and had been both indignant and sorrowful .  she alone knew where he was  and how to find him  for deeming it impossible  because of his trouble with the coketown workmen  to get work under his own name  he had taken another .   now that he was directly charged with the crime  she wrote him the news at once  so that he might lose no time in returning to face the unjust accusation .  being so certain herself of his innocence  she made no secret of what she had done  and all coketown waited  wondering whether he would appear or not .   two days passed and he had not come  and then rachel told bounderby the address to which she had written him .  messengers were sent  who came back with the report that stephen had received her letter and had left at once  saying he was going to coketown  where he should long since have arrived .   another day with no stephen  and now almost every one believed he was guilty  had taken rachel s letter as a warning and had fled .  all the while tom waited nervously  biting his nails and with fevered lips  knowing that stephen  when he came  would tell the real reason why he had loitered near the bank  and so point suspicion to himself .   on the third day mrs .  sparsit saw a chance to distinguish herself .  she recognized on the street  mrs .  pegler   the old countrywoman who also had been suspected .  she seized her and  regardless of her entreaties  dragged her to bounderby s house and into his dining room  with a curious crowd flocking at their heels .   she plumed herself on catching one of the robbers  but what was her astonishment when the old woman called bounderby her dear son  pleading that her coming to his house was not her fault and begging him not to be angry even if people did know at last that she was his mother .   mr .  gradgrind  who was present when they entered  having always heard bounderby tell such dreadful tales of his bringing up  reproached her for deserting her boy in his infancy to a drunken grandmother .  at this the old woman nearly burst with indignation  calling on bounderby himself to tell how false this was and how she had pinched and denied herself for him till he had begun to be successful .   everybody laughed at this  for now the true story of the bullying mill owner s tales was out .  bounderby  who had turned very red  was the only one who did not seem to enjoy the scene .  after he had wrathfully shut every one else from the house  he vented his anger on mrs .  sparsit for meddling  as he called it  with his own family affairs .  he ended by giving her the wages due her and inviting her to take herself off at once .   so mrs .  sparsit  for all her cap setting and spying  had to leave her comfortable nest and go to live in a poor lodging as companion to the most grudging  peevish  tormenting one of her noble relatives  an invalid with a lame leg .   but meanwhile another day had passed  the fourth since rachel had sent her letter  and still stephen had not come .  on this day  full of her trouble  rachel had wandered with sissy  now her fast friend  some distance out of the town  through some fields where mining had once been carried on .   suddenly she cried out  she had picked up a hat and inside it was the name  stephen blackpool .   an instant later a scream broke from her lips that echoed over the country side .  before them  at their very feet  half hidden by rubbish and grasses  yawned the ragged mouth of a dark  abandoned shaft .  that instant both rachel and sissy guessed the truth  that stephen  returning  had not seen the chasm in the darkness  and had fallen into its depths .   they ran and roused the town .  crowds came from coketown .  rope and windlass were brought and two men were lowered into the pit .  the poor fellow was there  alive but terribly injured .  a rough bed was made  and so at last the crushed and broken form was brought up to the light and air .   a surgeon was at hand with wine and medicines  but it was too late .  stephen spoke with rachel first  then called mr .  gradgrind to him and asked him to clear the blemish from his name .  he told him simply that he could do so through his son tom .  this was all .  he died while they bore him home  holding the hand of rachel  whom he loved .   stephen s last words had told the truth to mr .  gradgrind .  he read in them that his own son was the robber .  tom s guilty glance had seen also .  with suspicion removed from stephen  he felt his own final arrest sure .   sissy noted tom s pale face and trembling limbs .  guessing that he would attempt flight too late  and longing to save the heartbroken father from the shame of seeing his son s arrest and imprisonment  she drew the shaking thief aside and in a whisper bade him go at once to sleary  the proprietor of the circus to which her father had once belonged .  she told him where the circus was to be found at that season of the year  and bade him ask sleary to hide him for her sake till she came .  tom obeyed .  he disappeared that night  and later sissy told his father what she had done .   mr .  gradgrind  with sissy and louisa  followed as soon as possible  intending to get his son to the nearest seaport and so out of the country on a vessel  for he knew that soon he himself  tom s father  would be questioned and obliged to tell the truth .  they traveled all night  and at length reached the town where the circus showed .   sleary  for sissy s sake  had provided tom with a disguise in which not even his father recognized him .  he had blacked his sullen face and dressed him in a moth eaten greatcoat and a mad cocked hat  in which attire he played the r  le of a black servant in the performance .  tom met them  grimy and defiant  ashamed to meet louisa s eyes  brazen to his father  anxious only to be saved from his deserved punishment .   a seaport was but three hours away .  he was soon dressed and plans for his departure were completed .  but at the last moment danger appeared .  it came in the person of the porter of bounderby s bank  who had all along suspected tom .  he had watched the gradgrind house  followed its master when he left and now laid hands on tom  vowing he would take him back to coketown .   in this moment of the father s despair  sleary the showman saved the day for the shivering thief .  he agreed with the porter that as tom was guilty of a crime he must certainly go with him  and he offered  moreover  to drive the captor and his prisoner at once to the nearest railroad station .  he winked at sissy as he proposed this  and she was not alarmed .  the porter accepted the proposal at once  but he did not guess what the showman had in mind .   sleary s horse was an educated horse .  at a certain word from its owner it would stop and begin to dance  and would not budge from the spot till he gave the command in a particular way .  he had an educated dog  also  that would do anything it was told .  with this horse hitched to the carriage and this dog trotting innocently behind  the showman set off with the porter and tom  while mr .  gradgrind and louisa  whom sissy had told to trust in sleary  waited all night for his return .   it was morning before sleary came back  with the news that tom was undoubtedly safe from pursuit  if not already aboard ship .  he told them how  at the word from him  the educated horse had begun to dance  how tom had slipped down and got away  while the educated dog  at his command  had penned the frightened porter in the carriage all night  fearing to stir .   thus tom  who did not deserve any such good luck  got safely away  but though his father was spared the shame of ever seeing his son behind the bars of a jail  yet he was a broken man ever after the truth became known .   what was the fate of all these .  bounderby  a bully to the last  died of a fit five years afterward  leaving his entire fortune to the perpetual support of twenty five humbugs  each of whom was required to take the name of  josiah bounderby of coketown .   louisa never remarried  but lived to be the comfort of her father and the loving comrade of sissy jupe .  sissy never found her father  and when at last merrylegs  his wonderful dog  came back alone to die of old age at sleary s feet  all knew that his master must be dead .  tom died  softened and penitent  in a foreign land .  rachel remained the same pensive little worker  always dressed in black  beloved by all and helping every one  even stephen s besotted wife .   as for mr .  gradgrind  a white haired  decrepit old man  he forgot all the facts on which he had so depended  and tried for ever after to mingle his life s acts with faith  hope and charity .              the mystery of edwin drood  published       scene  london and

quiet town of cloisterham  in england  in a boarding school  once lived a beautiful girl named rosa bud  an amiable  wilful  winning  whimsical little creature whom every one called rosebud .  she was an orphan .  her mother had been drowned when she was only seven years old and her father had died of grief on the first anniversary of that day .   her father s friend and college mate  a mr .  drood  had comforted his last hours  and they had agreed between them that when rosebud was old enough she should marry mr .  drood s son edwin  then a little boy .  her father put this wish in his will  as did mr .  drood  who died also soon after his friend  and so rosebud and edwin drood grew up knowing that  though not bound in any way  each was intended for the other .  so it came about that  while if they had been let alone they might have fallen in love naturally  yet as it was they were always shy and ill at ease with one another .  yet they liked each other  too .   rosebud s guardian was a mr .  grewgious  an arid  sandy man who looked as if he might be put in a grinding mill and turned out first class snuff .  he had scanty hair like a yellow fur tippet  and deep notches in his forehead  and was very near sighted .  he seemed to have been born old  so that when he came to london to call on rosebud amid all the school girls he used to say he felt like a bear with the cramp .  grewgious  however  under his oddity had a very tender heart  particularly for rosebud  whose mother he had been secretly in love with before she married .  but he had grown up a dry old bachelor  living in gloomy rooms in london  and no one would have guessed him ever to have been a bit romantic .   the school rosebud attended was called nun s house .  miss twinkleton  the prim old maid who managed it  termed it a  seminary for young ladies .   it had a worn front  with a shining brass door plate that made it look at a distance like a battered old beau with a big new eye glass stuck in his blind eye .  here rosebud lived a happy life  the pet of the whole seminary  till she was a young lady .   cloisterham was a dull  gray town with an ancient cathedral  which was so cold and dark and damp that looking into its door was like looking down the throat of old father time .  the cathedral had a fine choir  which sang at all the services and was taught and led by a music master whose name was john jasper .  this jasper  as it happened  was the uncle and guardian of edwin drood .   drood  who was studying to be an engineer  was very fond of his uncle and came often to cloisterham to visit him  so that rosebud saw a great deal of her intended husband .  he always called her  pussy .   he used to call on her at the school and take her walking and buy her candy at a turkish shop  called  lumps of delight   and did his best to get on well with her  though he felt awkward .   drood and jasper were much more like two friends than like uncle and nephew  for the choir master was very little older than the other .   jasper seemed to be wonderfully fond of drood  and every one who knew him thought him a most honorable and upright man  but in reality he was far different .  at heart he hated the cathedral and the singing  and wished often that he could find relief  like some old monk  in carving demons out of the desks and seats .  he had a soul that was without fear or conscience .   one vile and wicked practice he had which he had hidden from all who knew him .  he was an opium smoker .  he would steal away to london to a garret kept by a mumbling old woman who knew the secret of mixing the drug  and there  stretched on a dirty pallet  sometimes with a drunken chinaman or a lascar beside him  would smoke pipe after pipe of the dreadful mixture that stole away his senses and left him worse than before .  hours later he would awake  give the woman money and hurry back to cloisterham just in time  perhaps  to put on his church robes and lead the cathedral choir .   though no one knew of this  and though edwin drood thought his uncle was well nigh perfect  rosebud  after she grew up  had no liking for jasper .  he gave her music lessons and every time they met he terrified her .  she felt sometimes that he haunted her thoughts like a dreadful ghost .  he seemed almost to make a slave of her with his looks  and she felt that in every glance he was telling her that he  jasper  loved her and yet compelled her to keep silence .  but  though disliking the choir master so  and shivering whenever he came near her  rosebud did not know how to tell edwin  who she knew loved and believed in jasper  of her feelings .   ii  the coming of neville landless  one of the ministers in charge of the cathedral was the reverend mr .  crisparkle  a ruddy  young  active  honest fellow  who was perpetually practising boxing before the looking glass or pitching himself head foremost into all the streams about the town for a swim  even when it was winter and he had to break the ice with his head .   mr .  crisparkle sometimes took young men into his home to live while he tutored them to prepare them for college .  one day he received word from a mr .  luke honeythunder in london  telling him he was about to bring to cloisterham a twin brother and sister  neville and helena landless  the young man to be taught by mr .  crisparkle and his sister helena to be put in miss twinkleton s seminary .   this luke honeythunder called himself a philanthropist  but he was a queer sort of one  indeed .  he was always getting up public meetings and talking loudly  insisting on everybody s thinking exactly as he did  and saying dreadful things of them if they did not .   helena and neville landless had been born in ceylon  where as little children they had been cruelly treated by their stepfather .  but they had brave spirits  and four times in six years they had run away  only to be brought back each time and punished .  on each of these occasions  the first had been when they were but seven years old  helena had dressed as a boy and once had even tried to cut off her long hair with neville s pocket knife .  at length their cruel stepfather died  and they were sent to england  where for no other reason than that his name was continually appearing in the newspapers  mr .  honeythunder had been appointed their guardian .   no wonder the brother and sister had grown up thinking everybody was their enemy .  they were quite prepared to hate mr .  crisparkle when their guardian brought them .  but by the time mr .  honeythunder had gone  and mr .  crisparkle was as glad as they were when he went home  they liked the young minister and felt that they would be happy there .  they were a handsome pair  and mr .  crisparkle was attracted to them both .  neville was lithe  and dark and rich in color  helena was almost like a gypsy  slender  supple and quick .  both seemed half shy  half defiant  as though their blood were untamed .   to make them welcome that first evening  mr .  crisparkle invited to his house jasper  the choir master  with edwin drood  who was visiting him  and rosebud from the seminary .  before they parted rosebud was asked to sing .   jasper played her accompaniment  and while she sang he watched her lips intently .  all at once  to their great astonishment  rosebud covered her face with her hands and  crying out   i can t bear this .  i am frightened .  take me away .   burst into tears .   helena  the new comer  who had liked rosebud at first sight  seemed to understand her better than any one else .  she laid her on a sofa  soothed her  and in a few moments rosebud seemed again as usual .  mr .  crisparkle and edwin drood thought it only a fit of nervousness .  to her relief  they made light of the matter  and so the evening ended .   but later  at nun s house  where she and helena were to be room mates  rosebud told her new friend how much she disliked jasper and how his eyes terrified her  and how  as she sang  with his eyes watching her lips  she felt as if he had kissed her .   while the two girls were talking of this  neville and edwin drood  who had gone with them as far as the door of the seminary  were walking back together .  mr .  crisparkle had told neville of drood s betrothal to rosebud  and neville now spoke of it .  drood  who had felt all along that he and rosebud did not get along well together and who was sensitive on the subject  was unjustly angry that the other should so soon know what he considered his own private affair .  he answered in a surly way and  as both were quick tempered  they soon came to high words .   as it happened  jasper was walking near  and  overhearing  came between them .  he reproved them good naturedly and took them to his rooms  where he insisted they should drink a glass of wine with him to their good fellowship .  there he did a dastardly thing .  he mixed with the wine a drug which  once drunk  aroused their angry passions .  their speech grew thick and the quarrel began again .  safe now from any spectator  jasper did not attempt to soothe them .  he let them go on until they were about to come to blows .  then  pretending the greatest indignation  he threw himself upon neville and forced him  hatless  from the house .   in the cool night air neville s strange dizziness  and with it his rage  cleared away .  he realized that the blame for the quarrel had been jasper s  but he did not guess the drugging of the wine and could not explain the incident even to himself .  he went  however  manfully and sorrowfully to mr .  crisparkle and told him what had occurred  and naturally mr .  crisparkle  who had never found edwin drood quarrelsome  thought it the fault of neville s hot blood and revengeful character .   he was the more certain of this when jasper came to him  bringing neville s hat  and told him his own story of the meeting .  jasper told him falsely that neville had made a murderous attack on drood  and but for him would have laid his nephew dead at his feet .  he warned the minister that neville had a tigerish nature and would yet be guilty of terrible crime .  mr .  crisparkle liked neville  and all this saddened him  for he had not the least suspicion that jasper was lying for a cruel purpose of his own .   the affair was an unhappy one for neville .  jasper took care that the story spread abroad  and as it went it grew  so that almost everybody in cloisterham came to consider helena s brother a sullen fellow of a furious temper .  and they believed it the more because neville made no secret of the fact that he had fallen in love  too  with rosebud  and in this they thought they saw a reason for his hating edwin drood .   mr .  crisparkle was a faithful friend .  he concluded soon that the fault was not all on neville s side .  but he was anxious to have the two young men friends  and he begged his pupil for his own part to lay aside the ill feeling .  he went to the choir master also on the same errand  and jasper assured him that his nephew would do the same .  he even promised  hypocritically  that to bring this about he would invite both edwin drood and neville to dine with him on christmas eve  in his own rooms  where they might meet and shake hands .   both young men promised to come to the dinner  and mr .  crisparkle was highly pleased  little dreaming what the outcome would be .   iii  the choir master s dinner  there was a quaint character in cloisterham named durdles .  he was a stone mason whose specialty was the chiseling of tombstones .  he was an old bachelor and was both a very skilful workman and a very great sot .  he had keys to all the cathedral vaults and was fond of prowling about the old pile and its dismal crypt  for ever tap tapping  with a little hammer he carried  on its stones and walls  hunting for forgotten cavities  in which  perhaps  centuries before  persons had been buried .  he wore a coarse flannel suit with horn buttons and a yellow handkerchief with draggled ends  and it was a daily sight to see him perched on a tombstone eating his dinner out of a bundle .  when he was not feeling well he used to say he had a touch of  tomb atism   instead of rheumatism .   durdles was drunk so much that he was never certain about getting home at night  so he had hired  at a penny a day  a hideous small boy  known as  the deputy  to throw stones at him whenever he found him out of doors after ten o clock  and drive him home to his little hole of an unfurnished stone house .   the deputy used to watch for durdles after this hour  and when he saw him he would dance up and sing    widdy  widdy  wen .  i ketches  him  out  arter ten .  widdy  widdy wy .  when he  don t  go  then  i shy .  widdy  widdy  wake cock warning .    it was a part of the bargain that he must give this warning before he began to throw the stones  and when durdles heard this yell he knew what was coming .   before the christmas eve dinner jasper picked a friendship with durdles  and  pretending he wanted to make a trip by moonlight with him among the vaults  he persuaded him one night to be his guide .  while they were in the crypt of the cathedral jasper plied him with liquor which he had brought  to such purpose that durdles went fast asleep and the key of the crypt fell from his hand .  he had a dim idea that jasper picked up the key and went away with it  and was a long time gone  but when he awoke he could not tell whether this had really happened or not .  and this  when the deputy stoned him home that night  was all he could remember of the expedition .   but what jasper had really done while durdles was asleep  whether he had taken away the key to make a copy of it so as to make one like it for some evil purpose of his own  or whether he wanted to be able to unlock that dark underground place and hide something in it sometime when no one would be with him  this only jasper himself knew .   the christmas season arrived  and edwin drood  according to his promise  came to cloisterham to his uncle s dinner  at which he was to meet neville .   before leaving  however  he called upon mr .  grewgious  rosebud s guardian  who had sent for him with a particular purpose .  this purpose was to give into his hands a ring set with diamonds and rubies that had belonged to rosebud s mother .  it had been left in trust to mr .  grewgious to give to the man who married her  that he might himself put it on her finger .  and in accordance with the trust  the lawyer charged drood if anything should be amiss or if anything happened between him and rosebud  to bring back the ring .   mr .  grewgious gave him this keepsake with such wise and friendly advice on the seriousness of marriage that all the way to cloisterham with the ring in his pocket  edwin drood was very thoughtful .  he asked himself whether he really loved rosebud as a man should love his wife  whether he had not drifted into this betrothal rather as a result of their parents  wish and wills than from any deeper feeling .  and he began to wonder if by marrying her thus he would not be doing her a vast injustice .  he decided  therefore  to tell her all that was in his mind and be guided by her judgment .   rosebud  meanwhile  in the silence of the christmas vacation  with only helena for her companion  had been thinking of the same matter  and her wise little head had reached almost the same conclusion .  when drood came they walked out together under the trees by the cathedral .  their talk was not so difficult after all as each had feared it would be  and both felt relieved when they decided they could be far happier to remain as brother and sister  and not become husband and wife .  so they agreed without pain on either side .   drood s only anxiety was for his uncle .  he thought jasper had looked forward to his marriage to rosebud so long that he would be pained and disappointed to learn it was not to be .  so he concluded he would not tell him as yet .  poor rosebud .  she was greatly agitated .  she felt the falseness of jasper  and knew that he loved her himself  but she realized the impossibility of telling this to the nephew who believed in him .  so she was silent .  drood  for his part  since the betrothal was ended  said nothing to her of the ring grewgious had given to him  intending to return it to the lawyer .   they kissed each other when they parted .  the wicked choir master  who happened to be walking near  saw the embrace and thought it the kiss of lovers soon to be wed .  drood left rosebud then  to pass the time till the hour of the dinner in jasper s rooms .   neville that day had determined  the dinner over  to start at dawn next morning on a walking tour  to be absent a fortnight .  he bought a knapsack and a heavy steel shod stick in preparation for this expedition  and bade his sister helena and mr .  crisparkle good by before he went to the appointed meeting at the choir master s .   jasper himself  it was noticed  had never seemed in better spirits than on that day  nor had he ever sung more sweetly than in the afternoon service before the dinner which he gave to the two young men .  if he was contemplating a terrible crime  no one would have guessed it from his serene face and his agreeable manner .   edwin drood had one warning just before he went up the postern stair that led to his uncle jasper s .  the old hag who mixed the opium in the london garret where the choir master smoked the drug  had more than once tried to find out who her strange  gentlemanly visitor was .  she had listened to his mutterings in his drunken slumber  and at length that day had followed him from london to cloisterham  only to lose track of him there .  as drood strolled  waiting for the dinner hour to strike from the cathedral chimes  he passed her and she begged money from him .   he gave it to her and she asked him his name and whether he had a sweetheart .  he answered edwin  and that he had none .   be thankful your name s not ned   she said   for it s a bad name and a threatened name .     ned  was the name jasper always called him by  but drood did not think seriously of the old woman s words .  he could not have guessed that the threats she spoke of against the ned who had a sweetheart had been murmured in his drugged slumber by his own uncle against himself .  and yet something at just that moment made him shudder .   so the chimes struck  and edwin drood went on to jasper s rooms to meet his uncle and neville landless  went to his doom .  for from that time no one who loved him ever saw him again in this world .   iv  jasper shows his teeth  that night a fearful tempest howled over cloisterham .  in the morning early  as the storm was breaking  jasper  the choir master  came pale  panting and half dressed  to mr .  crisparkle s  asking for edwin drood .  he said his nephew had left his rooms the evening before with neville landless to go to the river to look at the storm  and had not returned .   strange rumors sprang up at once .  neville had left for his walking tour and an ugly suspicion flew from house to house .  he had got only a few miles from the town when he was overtaken by a party of men  who surrounded him .  thinking at first that they were thieves  he fought them  but was soon rendered helpless and bleeding  and in the midst of them was taken back toward cloisterham .  mr .  crisparkle and jasper met them on the way  and from the former neville first learned of what he was suspected .   the blood from his encounter with his captors was on his clothes and stick .  jasper pointed it out  and even those who had seen it fall there looked darkly at the stains .  he was taken back to the town and to mr .  crisparkle s house  who promised that he should remain in his own custody .   neville s story was simple .  he said they had gone to the river  as jasper had said  and returned together  he to mr .  crisparkle s  edwin drood to his uncle s .  he had not seen the other since that time .   the river was dragged and its banks searched  but to no purpose  till mr .  crisparkle himself found drood s watch caught among some timbers in a weir .   but as the body could not be found  it could not be definitely proven that drood was dead  or that any murder had been committed  so at last neville was released .  the whole neighborhood  however  believed him guilty of the murder .  no one spoke to him and he was obliged to quit the place .   beside his sister helena and rosebud  who  of course  believed in his innocence  he had but one friend there  mr .  crisparkle .  the latter stoutly refused to believe him guilty .  when neville left for london  through mr .  grewgious  rosebud s guardian  the minister found him a cheap lodging and made frequent trips to the city to help and advise him in his studies .   mr .  grewgious had his own opinion of the affair .  one day he went to cloisterham to see jasper  and there told him a thing the other did not yet know  that before that last night edwin drood and rosebud had agreed not to marry .  when he heard this the choir master s face turned the color of lead .  he shrieked and fell senseless at the lawyer s feet .  mr .  grewgious went back to the city more thoughtful than ever  and it was not long before a detective came from london to cloisterham and began to interest himself in all the doings of john jasper .   the detective  to be sure  was not known as such .  he called himself  dick datchery  and gave it out that he was an idle dog who lived on his money and had nothing to do .  he was a curious looking man  with a great shock of white hair  black eyebrows and a military air .  he rented lodgings next door to the choir master  and before long had made friends with durdles  the tombstone maker  and even with the deputy of the  wake cock warning .    meanwhile jasper  haggard and red eyed  took again his place in the cathedral choir  while neville landless worked sadly and alone in his london garret .  the latter made but one friend in this time  a lodger whose window adjoined his own .  this lodger was lieutenant tartar  a retired young naval officer .  tartar might have lived in fine apartments  for he was rich  but he had been so long on shipboard that he felt more at home where the walls were low enough for him to knock his head on the ceiling .  he used to climb across to neville s room by the window ledges  and they became friendly  the warmer friends when mr .  crisparkle discovered in the lieutenant a schoolmate who had once saved his life .   later  too  helena left miss twinkleton s seminary and came to be with her brother .  and so a year went by .   vacation arrived  and one day when rosebud was alone at nun s house  jasper  for the first time since edwin drood s disappearance  came to see her .   he found her in the garden  and she felt again the repulsion and fear she had always felt at sight of him .  this time the choir master threw away all concealment .  he told her that he had always loved her hopelessly and madly  though while she was betrothed to his nephew he had hidden the fact .  she answered indignantly that  by look if not by word  he had always been false to edwin drood  that he had made her life unhappy by his pursuit of her  and that  though she had shrunk from opening his nephew s eyes  she had always known he was a wicked man .   then  maddened by her dislike  jasper swore that no one else should ever marry her  that he would pursue her to the death  and that if she repulsed him he would bring dreadful ruin upon neville landless .  he said this  no doubt  knowing that neville loved rosebud  and thinking  perhaps  that she loved him in return .   when jasper left her  rosebud was faint from fear of his wicked eyes .  she made up her mind to go at once for protection to mr .  grewgious in london  and  leaving a note for miss twinkleton  she left by the next omnibus .   she told her guardian her story  he told it to mr .  crisparkle  who came to london next morning  and between them they told lieutenant tartar .  while rosebud visited with helena the three men took counsel together  agreeing that jasper was a villain and planning how best to deal with him .   the next time the choir master visited the opium garret the old woman tracked him back to cloisterham  with more success  with such success  indeed  that she heard him sing in the cathedral and found out his name from a stranger whom she encountered .  this stranger was dick datchery  the detective  who discovered so much  before he left her  of jasper s london habits that he went home in high good humor .   datchery had a trick  whenever he was following a particular search  of marking each step of his progress by a chalk mark on a wall or door .  to day he must have been highly pleased  for he drew a thick line from the very top of the cupboard door to the bottom .              when charles dickens  the master story teller  had told this tale thus far  he fell ill and died  and it was never finished .  the mystery of the disappearance of edwin drood  what became of rosebud and of mr .  crisparkle  how neville and helena fared and what was the end of jasper  are matters for each one of us to guess .  many have tried to finish this story and they have ended it in various ways .  before dickens died  however  he told to a friend the part of the story that remained unwritten  and this  the friend has recorded  was to be as follows   by means of the old woman of the opium den  durdles  the tombstone maker  and the deputy  the ragged stone thrower  dick datchery unraveled the threads which finally  made into a net  caught jasper  the murderer  in its meshes .  little by little  word by word  he was made at last to betray himself .   he had killed edwin drood  had hidden his body in one of the vaults and covered it with lime .  but there had been one thing in the dead man s pocket which the lime could not destroy  this was the ring set with diamonds and rubies  that had been given to him by mr .  grewgious .  by this the murder was proven .  mr .  crisparkle and mr .  grewgious worked hard to clear neville landless  of whose guilt  by the way  mr .  honeythunder remained always sure   but poor neville himself perished in aiding lieutenant tartar to seize the murderer .   finding all hope of escape gone  jasper confessed his crime in the cell in which he waited for death .   but  after all  the story closed happily  with the marriage of mr .  crisparkle to neville s sister helena  and that of lieutenant tartar to pretty little rosebud .              index to characters  affery little dorrit  agnes david copperfield  allen  arabella pickwick papers  allen  ben pickwick papers   artful dodger  the
