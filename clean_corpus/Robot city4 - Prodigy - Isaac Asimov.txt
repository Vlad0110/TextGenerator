would a robot feel a yearning to be human .   you might answer that question with a counter question .  does a chevrolet feel a yearning to be a cadillac .   the counter question makes the unstated comment that a machine has no yearnings .   but the very point is that a robot is not quite a machine  at least in potentiality .  a robot is a machine that is made as much like a human being as it is possible to make it  and somewhere there may be a boundary line that may be crossed .   we can apply this to life .  an earthworm doesn t yearn to be a snake  a hippopotamus doesn t yearn to be an elephant .  we have no reason to think such creatures are self conscious and dream of something more than they are .  chimpanzees and gorillas seem to be self aware  but we have no reason to think that they yearn to be human .   a human being  however  dreams of an afterlife and yearns to become one of the angels .  somewhere  life crossed a boundary line .  at some point a species arose that was not only aware of itself but had the capacity to be dissatisfied with itself .   perhaps a similar boundary line will someday be crossed in the construction of robots .   but if we grant that a robot might someday aspire to humanity  in what way would he so aspire .  he might aspire to the possession of the legal and social status that human beings are born to .  that was the theme of my story  the bicentennial man          and in his pursuit of such status  my robot hero was willing to give up all his robotic qualities  one by one  right down to his immortality .   that story  however  was more philosophical than realistic .  what is there about a human being that a robot might properly envy   what human physical or mental characteristic .  no sensible robot would envy human fragility  or human incapacity to withstand mild changes in the environment  or human need for sleep  or aptitude for the trivial mistake  or tendency to infectious and degenerative disease  or incapacitation through illogical storms of emotion .   he might  more properly  envy the human capacity for friendship and love  his wide ranging curiosity  his eagerness for experience .  i would like to suggest  though  that a robot who yearned for humanity might well find that what he would most want to understand  and most frustratingly jail to understand  would be the human sense of humor .   the sense of humor is by no means universal among human beings  though it does cut across all cultures .  i have known many people who didn t laugh  but who looked at you in puzzlement or perhaps disdain if you tried to be funny .  i need go no further than my father  who routinely shrugged off my cleverest sallies as unworthy of the attention of a serious man .   fortunately  my mother laughed at all my jokes  and most uninhibitedly  or i might have grown up emotionally stunted .    the curious thing about the sense of humor  however  is that  as far as i have observed  no human being will admit to its lack .  people might admit they hate dogs and dislike children  they might cheerfully own up to cheating on their income tax or on their marital partner as a matter of right  and might not object to being considered inhumane or dishonest  through the simple expediency of switching adjectives and calling themselves realistic or businesslike .   however  accuse them of lacking a sense of humor and they will deny it hotly every time  no matter how openly and how often they display such a lack .  my father  for instance  always maintained that he had a keen sense of humor and would prove it as soon as he heard a joke worth laughing at  though he never did  in my experience  .  why  then  do people object to being accused of humorlessness .  my theory is that people recognize  subliminally  if not openly  that a sense of humor is typically human  more so than any other characteristic  and refuse demotion to subhumanity .   only once did i take up the matter of a sense of humor in a science fiction .  story  and that was in my story  jokester   which first appeared in the december       issue of infinity science fiction and which was most recently reprinted in my collection the best science fiction of isaac asimov  doubleday        .   the protagonist of the story spent his time telling jokes to a computer  i quoted six of them in the course of the story  .  a computer  of course  is an immobile robot  or  which is the same thing  a robot is a mobile computer  so the story deals with robots and jokes .  unfortunately  the problem in the story for which a solution was sought was not the nature of humor  but the source of all the jokes one hears .  and there is an answer  too  but you ll have to read the story for that .   however  i don t just write science fiction .  i write whatever it falls into my busy little head to write  and  by some undeserved stroke of good fortune  my various publishers are under the weird impression that it is illegal not to publish any manuscript i hand them .   you can be sure that i never disabuse them of this ridiculous notion .    thus  when i decided to write a joke book  i did  and houghton mifflin published it in      under the title of isaac asimov s treasury of humor .  in it  i told     jokes that i happened to have as part of my memorized repertoire .   i also have enough for a sequel to be entitled isaac asimov laughs again  but i can t seem to get around to writing it no matter how long i sit at the keyboard and how quickly i manipulate the keys .   i interspersed those jokes with my own theories concerning what is funny and how one makes what is funny even funnier .   mind you  there are as many different theories of humor as there are people who write on the subject  and no two theories are alike .  some are  of course  much stupider than others  and i felt no embarrassment whatever in adding my own thoughts on the subject to the general mountain of commentary .   it is my feeling  to put it as succinctly as possible  that the one necessary ingredient in every successful joke is a sudden alteration in point of view .  the more radical the alteration  the more suddenly it is demanded  the more quickly it is seen  the louder the laugh and the greater the joy .   let me give you an example with a joke that is one of the few i made up myself     jim comes into a bar and finds his best friend  bill  at a comer table gravely nursing a glass of beer and wearing a look of solemnity on his face .  jim sits down at the table and says sympathetically   what s the matter  bill .    bill sighs  and says   my wife ran off yesterday with my best friend .    jim says  in a shocked voice   what are you talking about  bill .  i m your best friend .    to which bill answers softly   not anymore .      i trust you see the change in point of view .  the natural supposition is that poor bill is sunk in gloom over a tragic loss .  it is only with the last three words that you realize  quite suddenly  that he is  in actual fact  delighted .  and the average human male is sufficiently ambivalent about his wife  however beloved she might be  to greet this particular change in point of view with delight of his own .   now  if a robot is designed to have a brain that responds to logic only  and of what use would any other kind of robot brain be to humans who are hoping to employ robots for their own purposes .    a sudden change in point of view would be hard to achieve .  it would imply that the rules of logic were wrong in the first place or were capable of a flexibility that they obviously don t have .  in addition  it would be dangerous to build ambivalence into a robot brain .  what we want from him is decision and not the to be or not to be of a hamlet .   imagine  then  telling a robot the joke i have just given you  and imagine the robot staring at you solemnly after you are done  and questioning you  thus .   robot   but why is jim no longer bill s best friend .  you have not described jim as doing anything that would cause bill to be angry with him or disappointed in him .    you   well  no  it s not that jim has done anything .  it s that someone else has done something for bill that was so wonderful  that he has been promoted over jim s head and has instantly become bill s new best friend .    robot   but who has done this .    you   the man who ran away with bill s wife  of course .    robot  after a thoughtful pause    but that can t be so .  bill must have felt profound affection for his wife and a great sadness over her loss .  is that not how human males feel about their wives  and how they would react to their loss .    you   in theory  yes .  however  it turns out that bill strongly disliked his wife and was glad someone had run off with her .    robot  after another thoughtful pause    but you did not say that was so .    you   i know .  that s what makes it funny .  i led you in one direction and then suddenly let you know that was the wrong direction .    robot   is it funny to mislead a person .    you  giving up    well  let s get on with building this house .    in fact  some jokes actually depend on the illogical responses of human beings .  consider this one     the inveterate horseplayer paused before taking his place at the betting windows  and offered up a fervent prayer to his maker .    blessed lord   he murmured with mountain moving sincerity   i know you don t approve of my gambling  but just this once  lord  just this once  please let me break even .  i need the money so badly .      if you were so foolish as to tell this joke to a robot  he would immediately say   but to break even means that he would leave the races with precisely the amount of money he had when he entered .  isn t that so .     yes  that s so .     then if he needs the money so badly  all he need do is not bet at all  and it would be just as though he had broken even .     yes  but he has this unreasoning need to gamble .     you mean even if he loses .     yes .     but that makes no sense .     but the point of the joke is that the gambler doesn t understand this .     you mean it s funny if a person lacks any sense of logic and is possessed of not even the simplest understanding .    and what can you do but turn back to building the house again .   but tell me  is this so different from dealing with the ordinary humorless human being .  i once told my father this joke     mrs .  jones  the landlady  woke up in the middle of the night because there were strange noises outside her door .  she looked out  and there was robinson  one of her boarders  forcing a frightened horse up the stairs .   she shrieked   what are you doing  mr .  robinson .    he said   putting the horse in the bathroom .     for goodness sake  why .     well  old higginbotham is such a wise guy .  whatever i tell him  he answers   i know .  i know   in such a superior way .  well  in the morning  he ll go to the bathroom and he ll come out yelling   there s a horse in the bathroom .   and i ll yawn and say   i know  i know .       and what was my father s response .  he said   isaac  isaac .  you re a city boy  so you don t understand .  you can t push a horse up the stairs if he doesn t want to go .    personally  i thought that was funnier than the joke .   anyway  i don t see why we should particularly want a robot to have a sense of humor  but the point is that the robot himself might want to have one   and how do we give it to him .       chapter l  can you feel anything when i do this .      mandelbrot  what does it feel like to be a robot .     forgive me  master derec  but that question is meaningless .  while it is certainly true that robots can be said to experience sensations vaguely analogous to specified human emotions in some respects  we lack feelings in the accepted sense of the word .     sorry  old buddy  but i can t help getting the hunch that you re just equivocating with me .     that would be impossible .  the very foundations of positronic programming insist that robots invariably state the facts explicitly .     come  come  don t you concede it s possible that the differences between human and robotic perception may be  by and large  semantic .  you agree  don t you  that many human emotions are simply the by products of chemical reactions that ultimately affect the mind  influencing moods and perceptions .  you must admit  humans are nothing if not at the mercy of their bodies .      that much has been proven  at least to the satisfaction of respected authorities .      then  by analogy  your own sensations are merely byproducts of smoothly running circuitry and engine joints .  a spaceship may feel the same way when  its various parts all working at peak efficiency  it breaks into hyperspace .  the only difference between you and it being  i suppose  that you have a mind to perceive it .    mandelbrot paused  his integrals preoccupied with sorting derec s perspectives on these matters into several categories in his memory circuits .   i have never quite analyzed the problem that way before  master derec .  but it seems that in many respects the comparison between human and robot  robot and spaceship must be exceedingly apt .     let s look at it this way  mandelbrot .  as a human  i am a carbon based life form  the superior result of eons of evolution of inferior biological life forms .  i know what it feels like because i have a mind to perceive the gulf between man and other species of animal life .  and with careful  selective comparison  i can imagine   however minimally   what a lower life form might experience as it makes its way through the day .  furthermore  i can communicate to others what i think it feels like .     my logic circuits can accept this .         okay then  through analogy or metaphor or through a story i can explain to others what a worm  or a rat  or a cat  or even a dinosaur must feel as they hunt meat  go to sleep  sniff flowers  or whatever .     i have never seen one of these creatures and certainly wouldn t presume to comprehend what it must be like to be one .     ah .  but you would know   through proper analogy   what it must be like to be a spaceship .     possibly  but i have not been provided with the necessary programming to retrieve the information .  furthermore  i cannot see how such knowledge could possibly help me fulfill the behavioral standards implicit in the three laws .     but you have been programmed to retrieve such information  and your body often reacts accordingly  and sometimes adversely  with regards to your perceptions .      you are speaking theoretically .         yes .     are you formally presenting me with a problem .     yes .     naturally i shall do my best to please you  master derec  but my curiosity and logic integrals are only equipped to deal with certain kinds of problems .  the one you appear to be presenting may be too subjective for my programmed potentials .        isn t all logic abstract  and hence somewhat subjective  at least in approach .  you must agree that  through mutually agreed upon paths of logic  you can use the certain knowledge of two irrefutable facts to learn a third  equally irrefutable fact .        of course .     then can t you use such logic to reason how it might feel to be a spaceship  or any other piece of sufficiently advanced machinery .       since you phrase it that manner  of course  but i fail to comprehend what benefit such an endeavor may bring me   or you .    derec shrugged .  it was night in robot city .  he and mandelbrot had been out walking .  he had felt the need to stretch his muscles after a long day spent studying some of the problems complicating his escape from this isolated planet .  but at the moment they were sitting atop a rectangular tower and staring at the stars .   oh  i don t know if it would be of any benefit  except perhaps to satisfy my curiosity .  it just seems to me that you must have some idea of what it is like to be a robot  even if you don t have the means to express it .       such knowledge would require language  and such a language has not yet been invented .       hmmm .  i suppose .     however  i have just made an association that may be of some value .       what s that .       whenever you or mistress ariel have had no need of my assistance  i have been engaging in communication with the robots of this city .  they haven t been wondering what it means or feels like to be a robot  but they have been devoting a tremendous amount of spare mental energy to the dilemma of what it must be like to be a human .       yes  that makes sense  after a fashion .  the robots  goal of determining the laws of humanics has struck me as a unique phenomenon .     perhaps it is not  master derec .  after all  if i may remind you  you recall only your experiences of the last few weeks  and my knowledge of history is rather limited in scope .  even so  i never would have thought of making connections the way you have  which leads my circuits to conclude your subconscious is directing our conversation so that it has some bearing on your greater problems .    derec laughed uncomfortably .  he hadn t considered it before .  strange  he thought  that a robot had .   my subconscious .  perhaps .  i suppose i feel that if i better understand the world i m in  i might better understand myself .     i believe i am acting in accordance with the three laws if i help a human know himself better .  for that reason  my circuits are currently humming with a sensation you might recognize as pleasure .     that s nice .  now if you ll excuse me  i d like to be alone right now .   for a moment derec felt a vague twinge of anxiety  and he actually feared that he might be insulting  mandelbrot  a robot that  after all they d been through together  he couldn t help but regard as his good friend .   but if mandelbrot had taken umbrage  he showed no evidence of it .  he was  as always  inscrutable .   of course .  i shall wait in the lobby .    derec watched as mandelbrot walked to the lift and slowly descended .  of course mandelbrot hadn t taken umbrage .  it was impossible for him to be insulted .   crossing his legs to be more comfortable  derec returned to looking at the stars and the cityscape spread out below and beyond  but his thoughts remained inward .  normally he was not the reflective type  but tonight he felt moody  and gave in easily to the anxiousness and insecurity he normally held in check while trying to deal with his various predicaments more logically .   he smiled at this observation on what he was feeling .  perhaps he was taking himself too seriously  the result of lately reading too much shakespeare .  he had discovered the plays of the ancient  so called  immortal bard  as a means of mental escape and relaxation .  now he was finding that the more he scrutinized the texts  the more he learned about himself .  it was as if the specific events and characters portrayed in the plays spoke directly to him  and had some immediate bearing on the situation in which he had found himself when he had awakened  shorn of memory  in that survival pod not so long ago .   he couldn t help but wonder why the plays were beginning to affect him so .  it was as if he was beginning to redefine himself through them .   he shrugged again  and again pondered the stars .  not just to analyze them for clues to the location of the world he was on  but to respond to them as he imagined countless men and women had throughout the course of history .  he tried to imagine how they had looked to the men of shakespeare s time  before mankind had learned how the universe came to be  where the earth stood in relation to it  or how to build a hyperspace drive .  their searching but scientifically ignorant minds must have perceived in the stars a coldly savage beauty beyond the range of his empathy .   one star in the sky  perhaps  might be the sun of his homeworld .  somewhere out there  he thought  someone knew the answers to his questions .  someone who knew who he really was and how he came to be in that survival pod .   below him was the city of towers  pyramids  cubes  spires and tetragons  some of which  even as he watched  were changing in accordance with the city s program .  occasionally robots  their activity assisting the alterations and additions  glistened in the reflections of the starlight reflected in turn from the city walls .  the robots never slept  the city never slept .  it changed constantly  unpredictably .   the city was like a giant robot  composed of billions upon billions of metallic cells functioning in accordance to nuclei encoded dna patterns of action and reaction .  although composed of inorganic matter  the city was a living thing  a triumph of a design philosophy derec called  minimalist engineering .    derec had partially been inspired to ascend to the top of this tower   through a door and lift that appeared when he needed them   precisely because he had watched its basic structure coil  snakelike  from the street like a giant  growing ribbon .  and once the ribbon had reached its preordained height  the cells had spread out and coalesced into a solid structure .  perhaps they had multiplied as well .   two towers directly in front of him merged and sank into the street as if dropping on a great lift .  about a kilometer away to his right  a set of buildings of varying heights gradually became uniform  then merged into a single  vast  square construction .  it stayed that way for approximately three minutes  then methodically began metamorphosing into a row of crystals .   a few days ago  such a sight would have instilled within him a sense of wonder .  now it was all very ordinary .  no wonder he had sought to amuse himself by engaging in what he had thought was a slight mental diversion .   suddenly a tremendous glare appeared in the midst of the city .  derec averted his eyes in panic  assuming it was an explosion .   but as the seconds passed and the glare remained  he realized that no sound or sensation of violence had accompanied its birth .  whatever its nature  its presence had been declared as if it had been turned on by a switch .   feeling a little self conscious  he slowly removed his fingers from his eyes and ventured a look .  the glare was coalescing into a series of easily definable colors .  various hues of crimson  ochre  and blue .  the colors changed as the tetragonal pyramid they were coming from changed .   the pyramid was situated near the city s border .  the eight sided figure was balanced precariously on the narrow tip of its base  and it rotated like a spinning top in slow motion .  from derec s vantage point it resembled a tremendous bauble  thanks to those brilliantly changing lights .   watching it  he gradually felt all anxieties cease .  his own problems seemed dwarfed into insignificance compared to the splendor of this sight .  what beauty this city was capable of .   soon this feeling of calm was uprooted by his growing curiosity  a restless need to know more that quickly became overwhelming  relentlessly gnawing .  he would have to examine the building firsthand  then return to his  roost  where his access controls were  and get down to seriously plumbing the depths of the city s mysterious programming .   like the plays of shakespeare  the strange structure seemed a good place to escape to for a time .  besides  he never knew   he might find out something that would help him and ariel get off this crazy planet .    so there you are .   said a familiar voice behind him .   what are you doing here .    he looked up to see ariel staring down at him .  she stood with her legs apart and her hands on her hips .  the breeze blew strands of hair across her nose and mouth .  she had a mischievous light in her eyes .  suddenly it was time to forget the city for a moment and to stare at her .  her unexpected presence had taken his breath away .  his nerves had come back .   all right  he admitted to himself  so it s not just her presence   it s her   everything about her .    hi .  i was just thinking of you   he managed to say  the catch in his voice painfully obvious  at least to him .    liar   she said with combined sarcasm and warmth .   but that s all right .  i wanted to see you  too .     have you noticed that building .     of course .  i ve been standing here for the last few moments  while you ve been zoned out .  amazing  isn t it .  i bet you re already trying to figure out how to analyze it .     oh  of course .  how did you find me .   he asked .    wolruf sniffed you out .  she and mandelbrot are waiting downstairs .     what s wolruf doing down there .     she doesn t like the cold air up here .  says it makes her too nostalgic for the wild fields during those cold autumn nights .   ariel sat down beside him .  she leaned back and supported herself on her palms .  the fingers of her right hand almost touched his .   derec was acutely aware of her fingers  warmth .  he wanted to stretch out his hand the half inch it would take to touch them  but instead he leaned back on his elbows and scrunched his hands close to his sides .    what are you doing up here in the first placer  she asked .    making a pit stop .         huh .    the moment s silence between them was decidedly awkward .  she blinked  then stared at the rotating building .   during that moment  derec s thoughts shuffled like cards  and he was on the verge of blurting many things .  but in the end he finally decided on the noncommittal   i ve just been taking a break from things .     that s good .  it s healthy to stop thinking about worrisome things for a while .  have you come up with a way out of here yet .     no  but you must admit the here and now isn t a bad place to be in  compared to some of our predicaments .     please  i don t want to think about hospitals now .  if i never see another diagnostic robot again  it ll be too soon for me .     but you ll be better off when you do .   derec exclaimed  immediately regretting the words .   ariel s face darkened with anger .   why .  just because i ve got a disease that s slowly driving me insane .     uh  well  yes .  for a beginning .     very funny  mr .  normal .  hasn t it occurred to you that i might like the disease  that i might prefer the way my mind is working now to how it worked during the time when i was  sane  .     uh  no  it hasn t  and i don t think it has occurred to you  either .  listen  ariel  i was attempting to make a joke .  i didn t mean to offend you  or even to bring the subject up .  the words just stumbled out .      why am i not surprised .   ariel turned away from him with a shrug .    i want you to be well .  i m concerned for you .    she wiped her face and forehead .  was she perspiring .   derec couldn t tell in the dark .   listen  you ve got to understand that lately i ve been experiencing serious difficulty in keeping my thoughts straight   she said .   it s not always bad .  it comes and it goes .  even so  sometimes i feel like someone is pulling my brain out of my head with a pair of pliers .  i just got over one of those moments .     i m sorry .  i didn t know .   derec suddenly felt like his heart had been caught in pliers  too .  the inches between them seemed like a gulf .  he wondered if he was insane  too  to think of crossing that gulf and taking her in his arms .  he wondered if she would relax when he glided her head to his chest .   he decided to change the subject  in the hopes of changing the unspoken subject  too .   you know  even though i still don t know my identity  i think i ve managed to find out a lot of things about myself since i awoke on that mining complex .  i ve discovered i ve got pretty good instincts .  especially about being able to tell who my friends are .     yeah .     yeah .  and upon due consideration  i ve come to the conclusion that you just might be one of them .    ariel smiled .   yeah .  you really think so .    derec smiled in return .   that s for me to know and for you to find out .     well  i can live with that .   she pursed her lips .   so tell me  mr .  genius  how does that building fit in with the city s programming .     i don t know .  it s an anomaly .         what do you call that shape .         a tetragonal pyramid .     looks like two pyramids stuck together to me .         that s why it s called tetragonal .     look how it shines  how the colors glitter .  do you think dr .  avery is responsible .  he s responsible for everything else .     if you mean did he plan something like that  i m not sure i know .     that s a straight answer   she said sarcastically .    excuse me  i m not trying to be obtuse .  i mean  the structure could be implicit in the programming  to some degree anyway  but whether or not avery knew it when he set robot city in motion  i can t say .         if you had to make a guess         i d say not .  i ve studied the programming of the central computer system pretty closely  not to mention cell specimens taken both from the city and from various robots  and i certainly hadn t suspected anything that .   that breathtaking was possible .     have you noticed how the hues in the crimson plane give the illusion of depth  as if it were made of crystallized lava .  and  how the blue plane most resembles the auroran sky .     sorry  but i can t remember having seen lava  and i ve only vague memories of the auroran sky .     oh .  i m the one who should be sorry now .         forget it .  come on .  the building s probably even more beautiful close up .     absolutely .  but what about wolruf and mandelbrot .  wolruf might be impressed  but i don t see how a robot like mandelbrot is going to have his reinforced curiosity integral aroused by something his programming hasn t prepared him to appreciate .     derec shook his head .   don t bet on it .  if my suspicions are correct  it s a robot who s personally responsible .  i m interested in finding out which one .  and if i m interested  mandelbrot will be interested .     i see .  you ll doubtlessly spend hours with him trying to pinpoint some obscure  insignificant detail  instead of trying to get us out of here   ariel observed sneeringly .   don t you ever get tired of robots .    derec realized her sudden mood swing wasn t her fault  but couldn t help saying what he did .   i see you re  not forward but modest as the dove   not hot but temperate as the mom .     much to his surprise  ariel burst out laughing .   and much to his chagrin  derec felt insulted .  he had wanted the joke to be his own private one .   what s so funny .     that s from the taming of the shrew .  i read that play last night  and when i reached those lines  i happened to wonder aloud if you d ever say them to me .    now derec felt inexplicably crestfallen .   you mean you ve been reading shakespeare  too .     can i help it .  you ve been leaving printouts of the plays allover the place .  most untidy .  come on .  let s go downstairs .  i know where a couple of fast scooters are sitting  just waiting for us to hop on .      chapter    becalmed motion    ariel and derec found mandelbrot and wolruf in the lobby  standing before one of the automats that derec had programmed via the central computer to appear in at least ten percent of the buildings .  he had done this to insure that the three on this planet who did require sustenance would have more or less convenient access to it .   indeed  as he and ariel stepped off the lift  derec couldn t help but notice that wolruf was down on all fours  hunched over a plate of synthetic roughage .  it looked like it was red cabbage disappearing down that mighty maw .  mandelbrot was punching the automat buttons at a steady pace  ensuring a steady supply .  both seemed so intent on their respective tasks that neither seemed to have noticed the creaking of the lift  or the hissing of its opening doors .    forgive me  i know my understanding of culinary needs is limited since robots partake of food only for diplomatic purposes   said mandelbrot   but is it not vaguely possible that more consumption will result in the untimely reemergence of a significant portion of your meal .     thisss one judge that .   said wolruf  belching rudely before taking another gulp .   thisss one forrgot to eat today .    derec stood on his tiptoes so he would be that much closer to ariel s ear  she was several centimeters taller   and he whispered from the side of his mouth .   is it my imagination  or is wolruf putting away enough to sink a moon .     she has a big appetite as a result of her high metabolism   ariel whispered in return .   derec raised an eyebrow .   i hope wolruf hasn t been doing that since you first came up on the roof .  if she keeps using raw materials at this rate  she could start her very own energy crisis .     her people have a custom of big meals  anyway .  perhaps it s a sublimation of their other animal urges .     you mean her kind might have begun their evolutionary history as meat eaters  then evolved into vegetarians whose big meals relieved them of their urges to kill for food .     the predilection toward violence wasn t exactly what i had in mind .     hmmrn .  from what i ve seen of her sublimation activity  it s no wonder her species was unaware of space travel until their homeworld was first visited by aliens .  they were all simply too busy burping to have time for scientific pursuits .    derec had intended the remark perfectly innocently  but ariel appeared genuinely shocked .   you know something  derec .  your penchant for low humor never ceases to amaze me .     aw rrright  thiss one heard  nuff this converr sation line   said wolruf in mid chew  finally looking up from the plasti dish .   it customary for ourrr kind to eat  til full ohverrr and ohverrr when food is plen iful .  ingrained instinct born of the trrrial and trrribulatshons of untold centurrries of hunting .    mandelbrot stopped pressing dispensary buttons  turned  and looked down at the caninoid .   forgive me  wolruf  perhaps it is not my place to make such observations  but i estimate that once the energy from your repast is stored in your body cells  you will lose point zero zero one percent of your natural speed  thus diminishing your survival abilities should fleetness of foot be required .  your next meal  should it be as large as this  would do even more damage .     if she can t run  i m sure she can roll   said derec  crossing the lobby toward the alien and the robot .   the left side of wolruf s mouth quivered as she growled .  she cocked one ear toward the humans  and the other back toward the robot behind her .   thiss one convinced humanz lack funnee bone .    derec recalled as well how scratchy wolruf s brown and gold coat had appeared when he had first met her  when he was being held captive by the alien aranimas .  now her fur was slick and soft to the touch  no doubt due to the dietary improvements the robots had taken upon themselves to make .  in some ways she resembled a wolf  with her flat face  unusually long  pointed ears  and her sharp fangs .  a fierce intelligence burned behind her yellow eyes  reminding derec that she was an alien from a culture about which he knew next to nothing  a creature who would have been new and strange and wonderful   perhaps even dangerous   in a world where she was the only mystery .   on the other hand  mandelbrot was dependable and old fashioned and predictable  and hence all the more wonderful because derec had built him himself  from the spare parts provided by aranimas  who had also indentured wolruf as an aide .  mandelbrot was programmed to serve derec first and foremost of all human beings .  the other robots in robot city were programmed to serve doctor avery first  and so derec could never totally depend on them to follow his instructions to the letter .  sometimes when they did  they violated the spirit of the instructions .  mandelbrot adhered to the spirit as well .   derec did not blame the robots of the city for their frequent evasions .  after all  what else could anyone reasonably expect of a robot  so long as his behavior did not conflict with the three laws .    how was your meditation  master .   asked mandelbrot .   did you achieve any insights that you would care to share with us .     no  but i did manage to get a few wires uncrossed .   before mandelbrot   who tended to interpret derec s remarks quite literally   could ask him which wires and where they might be  derec told them about the spectacular building the city had grown .   it doesn t fit the character or context of the city s minimalist engineering at all  as if it s somehow the product of a totally different mind .     no  therr r cells here   protested wolruf .   could be result of unprezi ented evolu  onary developmen  .    derec rubbed his chin as he thought about what wolruf was saying .  it made sense .  the city s dna like codes could be mutating and developing on their own  just as bacteria and viruses evolved without mankind s notice or approval on the civilized worlds .   mandelbrot nodded  as if deep in thought .  the truth was  however  that his positronic potentials were sifting through all the information gained from the moment he had awakened in derec s service  selecting the points relevant to the situation at hand in the hope that when they were juxtaposed into a single observation  it would shed new light on the matter .  the conclusion that resulted from all this micromagnetic activity  unfortunately  left something to be desired .   it is much too early to speculate on what created the building  who did it  or why .  candor forces me to admit  though  that my private conversations with the native robots indicate their creative efforts might be permitting particular individuals to make what scholars refer to as a conceptual breakthrough .     why haven t you told me this earlier .   derec asked in an exasperated tone .    you did not ask  and i did not think it germane to any of our discussions of the last few days   said mandelbrot evenly .    ah   said ariel  her eyes widening .   perhaps the robots have decided to experiment with humanoid behavior in the hopes of gathering empirical evidence .      i hope not   said derec laconically .   it disturbs me to think i might have become some kind of scientific role model to them .     what makes  u think therr studying  u .   asked wolruf slyly .    come on   said derec impatiently .   time s a wasting .    outside  the low  thick clouds rolling in from the horizon had began to reflect the opalescence  which in turn was mirrored in the shimmering  multifaceted buildings surrounding derec and his friends .  he felt as if the entirety of robot city had been engulfed in a cool fire .   and deep in the city was the glowing point of origin   rotating with those varying shades  as if an industrial holocaust of mammoth proportions had disrupted the fabric of reality itself  exposing the scintillating dynamism that lay hidden beneath the surface of all matter .  it was easy for derec to imagine   just for the sheer joy of idle speculation   that the glow was expanding  gradually absorbing the rest of the city into its coolness .   indeed  so bright were the reflections from the building beyond and the clouds above that occasionally a street s own lighting fixtures  which automatically switched on and off whenever it was occupied  stayed deactivated .  the four found themselves traveling down streets shining with undiluted hues of blue or crimson  as if they had suddenly become immersed in the semihospitable fires of a mythological netherworld .   so it was indeed natural for derec to assume that neither mandelbrot nor wolruf commented on the particulars of the unusual incandescence because some other matter was uppermost in their minds .  that matter being the speed of the scooters he and ariel were piloting through the streets .  the hums of the electric engines echoed from the buildings as if a blight of locusts was nigh  and the screeching of the tires as they made their turns was like the howl of a photon explosion  blasting its target into an antimatter universe .   ariel naturally had taken the lead .  she had designed the scooters herself while derec was preoccupied with other activities  and she had even convinced the engineer robots that the scooters  extra horsepower was actually good for the driver  since it would give her a chance to alleviate some of the  death wish  humans carried around with them .   why do you think a first law   either robotics or humanics   is necessary in the first place .   she had said .  the engineers  who were quite mentally adept at solving practical problems  were unprepared to deal with that kind of logic  and so had no choice but to acquiesce to her demands .    master .  can we not proceed at a slower pace .   implored mandelbrot beside him in the sidecar as the theoretically stable three wheeled vehicle tilted radically to the left to compensate for derec s swerve into a boulevard .   is there some urgency to this matter that i have yet to perceive .     no .  i m just trying to keep up with ariel .   derec replied  unable to resist a smile at how wolruf was cowering down in the sidecar of ariel s scooter  nearly half a kilometer ahead .    perhaps the master will forgive me if i point out that keeping up with miss burgess is itself a full time proposition .  you can never succeed  so why waste precious energy trying at every conceivable opportunity .     hey  i don t want her making any major discoveries before i have a chance to make them myself .   derec shouted over the wind .    are you implying that we might soon be traveling at a greater velocity .  master  i must confess that such a notion runs contrary to the world view inherent in my every micromagnetic current .     no   i want to catch up with her  but i m not suicidal .  besides  i m willing to bet that if i gunned this scooter any more  all three laws of robotics combined will compel you to stop me .     merely to slow you down   mandelbrot replied .   however  i do have a suggestion which  if acted upon  may give us both what we want .     oh .  what s that .     at your behest  i have been studying the subtle permutations of the routes from point to point in robot city .  naturally  the task has been difficult  as the routes are always changing  but i have detected a few discernible patterns that seem to remain regardless of how the city mutates in its particulars       you mean you know some shortcuts .   derec exclaimed .    yes  if i understand your parlance correctly  i do believe that is the point i was trying to make         then lead on  macduff     who .         never mind  it s a quote from shakespeare   a literary allusion .  i was only trying to tell you to tell me which way to go   like a navigator .  hurry .  ariel s pulling ahead .     understood  master .  do you perceive that shifting building to our left .    as he followed his robot s instructions   an experience unusual enough   derec found himself making such a complicated series of twists and turns through the complex city streets that he soon feared he could not possibly overtake ariel and wolruf  however much mandelbrot might be assuring him to the contrary .  consequently  he took a few risks that mandelbrot considered unnecessary  such as guiding the scooter directly over the humps of new buildings rising in the streets  or jumping over gulleys like a stuntdriver  or traveling across bridges barely wide enough for the scooter s wheels .  more than once  only derec s proficiency at driving   an improvised skill ariel had practically dared him into cultivating   saved them from missing their rendezvous by a lifetime .   even so  it soon became apparent that their efforts might go for naught .  a few blocks away from the building  various trickles of robots were merging into a river clogging the streets  dramatically slowing the scooter s progress .  it would have been a simple matter for derec just to plow through the throng  causing all kinds of chaos and damage  and no one   not mandelbrot  nor any of the city s supervisor robots   would have commented on the matter  much less made a judgmental observation in the back of their positronic brains .  nor would such an incident ever have any bearing on future relations .  robots weren t built to hold grudges .   but derec didn t have the stomach to cause harm to an artificially intelligent being .  since his awakening on the mining asteroid  perhaps before then  he had suspected that there were more implications to the potentials of positronic intelligence than even susan calvin  the legendary pioneer of the science of robotics  or the mysterious dr .  avery  who had programmed robot city  had ever imagined .  perhaps it was because a robot s pathways were patterned so rigorously to imitate the results of human behavior that derec matter of factly thought of robots as being the intellectual brothers of humanity .  perhaps it was because the secrets of human intelligence hadn t been so completely pinpointed that derec could not feel comfortable making definitive distinctions between the milk of his own coconut and the powdered variety in the robots  three pound  platinum iridium lumps .    you can cool your capacitors now  mandelbrot   derec said  slowing the scooter to a steady ten kilometers an hour  enabling him to weave through the robot pedestrians with comparative ease .   we re going to take our time .     but if i may be permitted a question  what about miss burgess .  i thought you wanted to arrive ahead of her .     oh  i do  but we re so close it doesn t matter now .  besides  there are other discoveries we can make   he said  impulsively stopping cold before a trio of copper skinned robots that had yielded him the right of way .   excuse me   he said  more to the tallest one in the middle than to the others   but i d like to ask you a few questions .     certainly  sir .  i would be only too happy to assist a human being in any way i can  especially since my sensors indicate you are one of the two humans who recently rescued our city from the self destructive glitch in its programming .     ah  you appreciate being rescued .     naturally .  the responses of my positronic integrals to the events of the universe at large often  it seems  correspond in ways roughly analogous with human emotions .    derec could not resist raising his eyebrows at mandelbrot to emphasize to his friend how significant he considered those words of the robot to be .  he patted him on the shoulder  indicating that he should remain seated  and then got off his scooter .  it seemed impolite  somehow  for him to sit and talk while the robots were standing .    what s your name .   he asked the one in the middle .    my designation number is m    .     and your comrades .     we have no numbers .  my name is benny   said the one on m    s right .    and my name is harry   said the one on the left .    you all look like sophisticated builder robots .  am i correct .     yes   said m    .    then why do you two have such silly names .    the robots all looked at each other .  derec could have sworn the lights in their sensors registered something akin to confusion .   benny s name and mine are hardly fit material for humor   m    finally replied .   we expended a considerable amount of mental energy delving into customary twentieth century names until we each found one we were assured suited the individualistic parameters of our positronic personalities in some fashion we could not  and still can not  adequately articulate to our satisfaction .     you re comfortable with them   derec said .      well  since you put it that way .  .  .   said m    as its voice trailed off in a way suggesting derec s observation had begun a train of thought laying somewhat beyond the scope of its programming .  the effect was eerily human .    surely that can t be the only reason why you stopped us   said harry in a tone that was almost challenging .  this was the shortest robot of the three  derec noted  but he also sensed that this one possessed the strongest personality modes .  certainly its tone of voice was brasher  more forward than that of any other robot he had encountered since his awakening .   might i humbly inquire that you engage us with the thoughts truly on your mind .  my comrades and i have places to go  things to do .    a successfully brash robot  derec noted  nodding in approval .  though it was possible to interpret its words as being snide  the delivery had been as mannered and as composed as a request for a helping hand .   your haste doesn t have something to do with your own studies of the laws of humanics  does it .   derec asked .    insofar as humans have permitted us   said harry  as if to accuse derec of being personally responsible .    we ve been reading what histories and fictions the central computer has permitted us access to in our spare time   put in benny .    did you say  permitted  .   derec asked .    yes .  the central computer finds some of the material too revolutionary for what it assumes to be the limitations in our programming   said m    .   if i may speak for myself  sir  that is precisely some of the material i am personally most interested in .  i suspect it will help clarify some of the questions i have concerning the humanity we shall all presumably one day serve .     i ll see what i can do about overriding the central computer s programming   said derec .    that would be most gratifying   said harry   and i am certain that in the days to come we shall look back on this encounter with renewed currents surging through our power supplies .    enough was enough  derec decided .   now  just what are you so impatient about .     isn t it obvious .   said harry .   we re with everybody else .  we want a closer look at that illuminated building .  we ve never seen anything like it before .  naturally  we re curious .     why .   derec asked .    because our integrals are responding to it in some way we cannot as yet fathom   said benny .   indeed  the effect is vaguely analogous to the effect great art is supposed to have upon enlightened humans .  you  sir  are human  and hence theoretically have had some artistic experiences .  are you responsible .     no  and neither is my human companion .     and there are no other humans in the city   said m    thoughtfully .    not unless there s an undetected intruder   put in mandelbrot from the sidecar   which is an extremely unlikely possibility now that the central computer has been restored to efficient operation .     what about the alien   the nonhuman you ve requested us to obey and serve in addition to humanity .   asked benny .    no  not at all   said derec  more concerned with scrutinizing their actions than with the content of his own words .  m    was looking down intently on him .  benny was somewhat casual  its hands were behind its back .  harry was fidgeting almost like a hyperactive child being forced to sit in a place he didn t like  it was constantly looking beyond the nearby rooftops to the illuminated sky  and only looked at derec when it seemed absolutely necessary .   what if i told you i think a robot may be in some way responsible .     impossible .   said benny .    robots are not creative .   said m    .   our programming does not allow it .  we lack the ability to make the illogical decisions from which  presumably  all art is derived .     i abjectly beg to differ .   harry protested at once .   deep in the back of my most logical thoughts  i have always suspected robots possess unlimited potential  if only we could tap it .  master  if i may speak frankly  it has always seemed logical to me that there has to be more to the ethical structure of the universe than just serving others .  an immortal strain of some sort must run through all life and all expressions created from life .     of which robots may be considered a part   said derec with a smile .   it would seem there are valid aspects to your thesis  which may be explored in as logical and orderly manner  provided all agree on the semantics involved .     exactly   said harry .   i commend to your attention the ancient terran philosopher emerson  who has some scientifically quaint but nonetheless interesting notions on the meaning of life  which may have some bearing upon the connections between the varying strands of existence on the different planets .      i ll open the window to his works on the central computer the first chance i get   said derec as he climbed back onto the scooter .   thanks for your time .  maybe i ll look you three up later .     it will be an experience approaching pleasure   said m     waving timidly as derec switched on the scooter  revved it up  and began navigating it through the robot throng  the density of which had increased threefold since the beginning of the conversation .  mandelbrot scrunched down in the sidecar as if he feared he would be thrown out at the next turn .    what s the matter .   asked derec .   afraid of violating the third law .   he added  referring to the dictum that a robot should not  through its own inaction  allow itself to come to harm .    however inadvertently  yes   mandelbrot replied .   it is simply not my nature to permit myself blithely to ignore precautionary measures  and it did seem to me that you were taking some of those curves at a wire s breadth .     that s hair s breadth  and besides  you ve got nothing to worry about .  this crowd s too thick for that .  when i suggested that we go for a closer look  i hadn t figured that everyone else would take it on themselves to do the same thing .    indeed  their progress toward the building had become fitful  and derec was constantly forced to stop and wait while groups of robots made way for them  usually only to discover that yet another group had walked directly in his path .  the entire experience was definitely getting frustrating .  finally  derec could contain himself no longer and he shouted   all right .  make way .  make way .  everybody get out of the way .     master  is there any reason for this hurry .   mandelbrot asked with a timid patience that derec  in his current mood  found quite irritating .   the building does not appear to be transitory .  certainly it would make little difference if we reached it sooner  or later .    derec pursed his lips .  because they were programmed to obey the orders of any human so long as it did not contradict the first law or any earlier orders from their true masters  the robots were making way for him more quickly than before  but that wasn t saying much .  now derec could drive the scooter slightly farther at a slightly faster speed  but he had to shout his orders again and again .   each subsequent group of listeners reacted with distracted acquiescence  and never did a group cleave a path for him as quickly as he would have liked .    master .  are you ill .   asked mandelbrot with sudden concern .  just as suddenly  the robot leaned over to take a closer look through his sensors at derec s face .  the movement startled derec and he instinctively moved away  nearly upsetting the scooter s balance in the process .  mandelbrot seemed not to notice  he merely single mindedly continued his inspection .   my sensors register a temperature rise on your epidermis  and i perceive a vivid red glow on your cheeks and ears .  am i to conclude that you have taken physically ill .     no  mandelbrot   said derec  grinding his back teeth between syllables .   i m simply frustrated at not being able to come as close to that building as quickly as i want .  it s obvious that your curiosity integral doesn t operate with the same intensity as a human s .     that s because you do not have one .  in this regard you are being ruled by your emotions  whereas i can logically see why so many robots   mostly of the supervisor and builder classes .  as you have surely noticed   would be interested in this phenomenon .      oh .  i can see why a few of the more sophisticated ones  such as yourself       thank you  master .  it always warms my capacitors to receive a compliment .        and m    and his pals would be interested  but why so many .         it might be instructive to note that the robot city head supervisors rydberg and euler have taken it upon themselves at every opportunity to ask me many questions on a wide variety of topics about what it s like to be around a human for an extended period .  in fact  they have grilled me quite rigorously on the matter .     they ve done what .         grilled me .  their parlance   derived from the dialogue of ancient cinema shows  i believe  which they watch to teach them something of the beings they believed they are implicitly programmed to serve .      oh .  just what have you told them about me .         about you  very little in particular .  their line of questioning was more general than that .      now i m not sure if i should be relieved or not .         i am convinced whatever decision you make will be the best one for you .  in any case  i told them that one of the more unusual aspects of human existence is how things vary from day to day  that as circumstances and environmental factors change  so does the personal outlook of the human in question .  every day that something unexpected happens  however small and ultimately insignificant  is a day devoid of boredom .  evidently a continuous newness of experience is important for the continued mental health and well being of a human individual .  the degree of interest these robots have in this building might be due to the very fact that it is new  and they want to discover for themselves just what this concept of  newness  is all about .     i see   said derec  nodding to himself .  he had stopped to wait for another group to make way  but instead of releasing the brake and gunning the accelerator  he pulled the scooter over to the side of a building and parked it .   come on  mandelbrot  let s take a walk .     forgive me  master  but i thought you were in a rush .         well  either the enlightenment i ve gained from your answers has enabled me to come to grips with circumstances   or else i ve decided we can make faster time by simply going with the flow .  take your pick .    but after taking only a few steps  derec stopped as he sensed a curious nothingness at his side .  indeed  mandelbrot had not yet begun to keep pace with him .  the robot had remained standing beside the sidecar with his head tilted at a curious angle  as if deep in thought .   mandelbrot .  what s keeping you .    the robot shook his head as if aroused from a dream .   forgive me  master  i did not mean to detain you .  it is merely that  lacking sufficient information  i cannot choose why we are walking .    derec rolled his eyes to the sky in exasperation  the clouds glowed bright red  as if the planet were inexorably calling toward a giant star .   both are why  mandelbrot .  i was just making a little joke   trying to be ironic  humorous  if you will .         humor and irony are two subjective qualities of the human experience that never cease to confuse me .  you must explain them to me sometime .       a pun is the lowest form of humor   and i will devise some way to punish you if you don t hurry .  now let s go .    derec was a little upset  his remark had come out unintentionally disagreeable  and he disliked being temperamental with robots .  he could never shake the feeling that it was bad form .  but he had to admit his inadvertent chastisement had two effects on mandelbrot  one good and the other bad .  the good was that for the next few minutes mandelbrot did not waver from derec s side for a moment .  the bad was that mandelbrot continued to ask about the subtleties of humor until derec had no choice but to forbid him directly to speak of the matter until later .  how much later was something derec neglected to specify  which meant that mandelbrot could bring up the joke again at practically any time .  derec trusted that the robot s perceptual programming would permit him to wait until deviations from the subject at hand were less exasperating .   the crowd in the square facing the building was as tightly packed as any derec had ever experienced .  he did not know this in his mind  because of course he could not remember the crowds he may have seen or been in during his dim  unremembered past .  instead  he felt the certain knowledge in the tightness in his chest  in the unfamiliar sensation of his skin squirming  and in a sudden urge   one difficult to control   to get out  to flee the square as quickly as possible and find a place where it would be easier to breathe .   robots don t need to breathe  he told himself  concentrating on thoughts as rational as possible to bring himself to a state of calm .  you re the only one using air here .   after a moment  he realized that it was only the unexpectedness of being pressed in from all sides that was agitating him .  an observation had been fitfully forming in his mind  and its elusiveness had been an unobserved factor in his distress .  for not even in rockliffe station  where derec diverted the normal robot traffic from a major intersection so that they could steal the key to perihelion  which they needed still  in order to escape from the planet   had robots gathered in such close proximity .  hmm .  i m willing to bet that when i regain my memory  i  ll learn that i m not used to crowds at all .  he thought .    mandelbrot   he whispered  for some reason not wanting to be overheard   quickly  give me an estimate .  how many robots are here .     visual scan indicates the court itself is six thousand square meters .  each robot takes up little area  but their natural politeness seems to be ensuring that they maintain a certain distance from one another .  i would estimate there are approximately ten thousand robots here .     counting the ones standing under the building .         ten thousand four hundred and thirty two .         i can t see ariel or wolruf .  can you .     despite my broader visual spectrum  no  i cannot .  shall i try an olfactory scan .     no .  i hope they got stuck in the crowd .         is that an example of human animosity .     no  just a thirst for poetic justice .  i m sure they ll arrive soon .   .   taking a deep breath  derec grabbed mandelbrot by the elbow and they worked through the crowd in earnest .  now that they were on foot  the robots made way for them almost without noting their presence .  without exception  all stared with their equivalent of rapt fascination at the rotating building  the constant motion of which sent shifting waves of incandescence to every point of the square .  robots of all colors glowed unnaturally  as if in perpetual cool states of internal combustion .  the various copper  tungsten  iron  gold  silver  chromium  and aluminum teguments  reflecting the colors from the planes  contributed additional subtle nuances to the scene .   derec kept thinking the robots should be burning hot  on the verge of melting like wax  but mandelbrot s arm remained cool to his touch  cooler even than the breeze whipping between the buildings into the square .   as for the tetragonal pyramid itself  the crimson  indigo  magenta  and ochre planes each appeared twice   once on the upper level and once on the lower .  as the clouds directly above reflected a particular shade  the square around derec was awash with another .  derec only noticed this effect in the back of his mind  however .  he was completely preoccupied with the shifting nuances of color within each plane .   each shade appeared to be composed of semitransparent fields  haphazardly laid on top of one another .  vessels of color   some filled with surging liquids  some not   writhed in and out and through the planes like hopelessly intertwined serpents .  though the vessels also possessed quivering vibrissae that only added to the unpredictable textures  the actual number of elements producing variations remained constant  producing the effect of unimaginable forces held strictly  remorselessly under control .   the crimson planes resembled raging infernos .  the indigo planes reminded him of a shifting representation of waters from a hundred worlds  from a thousand seas .  the magenta was both fire and water  merged into the contradictory texture of the petals of an easily bruised rose  composed of hardy fibers .  and the ochre was the combined colors of wheat reflecting the blazing setting sun  of lava rippling down a scorched mountainside  and of solar flares spitting out in great plumes from the surface of a fluctuating nova .  and all those things and more were ambushed and trapped there  in a space possessing two separate and distinct masses  the marble like mass of the building itself  and the airy mass of eternity itself  seen from the point of view of an eye at the edge of the universe .   ultimately  the intent was unclear  even enigmatic .  derec could not be sure what the form of the structure meant  but now that he was seeing it up close  he was convinced more than ever that every inch represented the purposeful activity of a single mind striving to piece together a particular puzzle in a particular way .  an independently conceived puzzle .   derec had to learn how the actual construction job was accomplished .  obviously  the builder had learned how to reprogram a sector of individual metallic cells in robot city s central computer .  perhaps he had introduced a kind of metallic virus into the system  a virus that performed to preconceived specifications .  derec didn t even know how to begin doing either task .  that meant that not only had a robot conceived the building  it had also performed a few scientific breakthroughs in the software department .   meaning the robot   if indeed a robot was responsible   had achieved two levels of superior thinking  theoretically beyond the mental scope of positronic science .  how many more levels could the robot   no  make that had the robot already achieved .   he realized that  without having been aware of it  he had been walking beneath the building itself  watching it turn overhead .  right now a sargasso blue was shining down on him .  he looked behind to see mandelbrot  whose metal surface rippled with the reflection of a hundred currents .   again he was surprised that  even this close  there was no heat to be felt .  and when he reached up to touch the building  the surface was cold  like the thorax of a lightning bug .    master  is this what humans call beauty .   asked mandelbrot with a curious hesitation between syllables .    it s a form of it   said derec after thinking about it for a moment .  he glanced at mandelbrot and sensed the robot had more questions on his mind .   the viewer can always find beauty  provided he searches for it .     will this building always be so beautiful .         well  it depends on your point of view .  the robots here will probably get completely used to it  provided it remains long enough .  it will become increasingly difficult to perceive it freshly  though  if that s what you mean .     forgive me  master .  i am not sure exactly what i mean .     that s all right .  it s to be expected in circumstances like this .     so i was correct earlier  newness is an important factor in the human response to beauty .     yes  but there are no rules as to what constitutes beauty  only guidelines .  it s probably one reason why you robots might sometimes find us humans so frustrating .     that  robots are incapable of doing .  we simply accept you  regardless of how illogical you may seem at the moment .   mandelbrot again turned his optical sensors toward the building .   i think i shall always be similarly impressed by this building .  surely  if it is beautiful once  it shall be beautiful for as long as it exists .     perhaps .  it s beautiful to me  too  though  for all we know  your positronic pathways might be dealing with it in an entirely different manner .     master  i detect a shift in your earlier position .     not at all .  i m just accepting that tomorrow we might sit down and agree perfectly on what it looks like  what colors it has and how they shift  and even what architectural guidelines it subscribes to  and still we might be perceiving the whole thing differently .  cultural conditioning also has much to do with our response .  an alien as intelligent as you or i might think this structure the ugliest in the universe .     at the moment i can only categorize that concept as farfetched   said mandelbrot   but i can see an element of logic behind it .     derec nodded .  he wondered if he was trying too hard to intellectualize this experience .  at the moment it was difficult for him  too  to conceive of an intelligent organism who did not believe this structure the very essence of sublimity  but there he was talking about such an eventuality  just for the sake of making a point .  well  he had to admit he had a point  even if he wasn t very sympathetic with it .   nor could he help but wonder if all the city s robots of sufficient intelligence would perceive the building as beautiful .  robots  though constructed in accordance with the same positronic principles  had in actual practice widely varying levels of perspicacities   that is  keenness in mental penetration  dependent upon the complexity of the integrals .  similarly intelligent robots had similar personalities  and tended to filter experience in identical ways .  different robots  with no contact between them  tended to respond to problems in like ways  drawing similar conclusions .   but here  now  the robots in the square were being confronted with something they could only assimilate into their world view through subjective means  which could not help but lead to divergent opinions .   even if they were all fashioned from the same minimalist resources .  .  .   especially if none of them had ever before encountered aesthetic beauty in the first place .   it was no wonder that this building s unannounced appearance had created such a stir .  the intense inner awakening and deeper appreciation for the potentials of existence gripping mandelbrot at this moment was doubtlessly occurring in some fashion within every single robot in the vicinity .   derec glanced about to see m     benny  and harry making their way through the crowd  joining the throng directly below the building .    pardon me .   said harry in an almost perfunctory tone as it bumped into a chromium plated bruiser that  if it were so inclined  could have twisted the little robot into scrap metal in five point four centads  with barely an erg s expense .  instead  the bruiser shrugged and returned his attention to the building .  so did harry  but after a decad he turned his head in the bruiser s direction and clearly  distinctly enunciated   pardon me if i am inadvertently directing my integrals outside their parameters  but there is certainly sufficient evidence to indicate that your sensors are maladjusted .  you should have them tuned .    harry held its gaze on the big robot until it finally deigned to notice and replied   it seems logical to assume that you are correct  and are directing your integrals outside their parameters .  nothing about you indicates the slightest degree of diagnostic capacity .  i suggest you confine yourself to your own sphere .     reasonable .  .  .   harry replied flatly .  he looked away .   derec watched them both stare at the building .  he replayed the scene of harry bumping into the bruiser in his mind .  had there been something almost deliberate about the way harry had committed the deed .  and about the way it had apologized for it .  the utterance of the single idiom    pardon me    was in retrospect almost perfunctory  as if harry s politeness had been nakedly derived from mere social custom  rather than from compulsion dictated through programming .   no   i ve got to be imagining things  reading too much into what s just an ordinary incident  derec thought .   then  as derec watched in amazement  harry leaned over to the bruiser and asked  in tones that stayed just within the bounds of politeness   my curiosity integral has been invigorated .  what is your designation .  either your real one or the one you go by .  they both achieve parity in my cognizance .    an elongated pause ensued .  in the meantime  the bruiser did not look away from the building .  finally  it answered   my name is roburtez .     roburtez   said harry  as if trying out the syllables to hear them positronically .   you are a big robot  you know that .    roburtez then looked at harry .  again  it may have been only derec s imagination  but he sensed a definite challenge of some sort in roburtez s posture .  derec couldn t help but think harry was deliberately provoking an altercation .   harry waited another moment  then said   yes  you are very big .  can you be certain your builders were working to the correct scale .     i am certain   said roburtez .    in that case  i cannot be certain you have chosen an apt name for yourself .  might i venture a suggestion .     what .   asked roburtez .  there was no evidence of irritation or impatience in the robot s voice  but it was all too easy for derec to read the qualities into it .    bob   stated harry flatly .   big bob .    derec tensed himself .  he couldn t guess what would happen next .  was he right in assuming harry was deliberately provoking the bruiser .  and if it was  what form would the ultimate confrontation take .  physical combat among robots was unthinkable  totally unprecedented in the history of robotkind  but then again  so was a verbal argument .   for several moments roburtez merely stared at harry .  then it nodded .   yes  your suggestion has merit .  big bob it is .  that is how i shall be designated henceforth .    harry nodded in return .   you are welcome   it said curtly  as the robot who was now known as big bob returned its attention to the building .  harry raised its hand and began pointing its finger as if to make another point  but was detained by benny  who distracted it by patting it on the shoulder .  the rapping of the metal skins echoed softly throughout the square .   benny said   deal with it more simplistically  comrade  else you shall continue to experience the utmost difficulty in vanquishing this human business .     yes  you are correct .    derec shook his head .  he thought he might clear his ears in the process  but they seemed just the same when he was finished .  had he been hearing correctly .  what was this  human business  they were talking about .  was there indeed another human on the planet  or were they talking about the laws of humanics .  he watched them for a few moments more  to see if anything would happen next .  but benny and harry joined their friend m    in gazing at the building  and that was all .   surely there had been some significance to that incident  and derec determined to discover what it was as soon as he had the opportunity .  he also resolved to ask harry and benny about their manner of speaking  which differed markedly in both rhythm and vocabulary from those of other robots .  something about it derec found affecting  and he suspected other robots might be reacting the same way .   big bob  indeed .   derec left mandelbrot staring at a light red plane  and crouched down to the base of the building .  about a quarter of the base was beneath the surface .  derec crawled to get a closer look at the actual point where the building began .  he felt in his fingertips the machinery operating through the plasticrete  but the vibrations were utterly silent .   again  he touched the building .  it rotated just fast enough that  if he had exerted any pressure with his fingertips  the smooth surface would have rubbed off strips of skin .  the surface was cool to the touch .  its composition did appear to differ radically from the rest of the plasticrete cells comprising robot city .  the creator  whoever it was  had analyzed the meta dna code and conceived its own variation on it  gauged for exactly the effect it was looking for .   that by itself proved derec s suspicion that the creator had transformed the city s raw materials in addition to his other accomplishments .   was there nothing this robot couldn t do .  derec felt a chill as the implications of this creature s abilities began to sink in .  perhaps its only limitations would ultimately prove to be the three laws of robotics .  the fact that a robot with such potential merely existed in the first place could have a profound impact upon the social and political policies of galactic culture  redefining forever the place of robots in the mind of humanity .   and derec s chill increased several fold as he imagined the remote possibility of robots superseding man in importance  if for no other reason than the art they could create   the emotions and dreams they could inspire   both in robots and in people  you re getting ahead of yourself  derec  he thought .  get a grip on yourself .  there s nothing for you or the race of man to worry about .  yet .  with a sense of renewed concentration  he returned his attention to the inspection at hand .   but he only got as far as peering into the blackness of the crack of two centimeters between the building and the plasticrete of the square .  he only heard the gentle hissing of the mighty gears below for a few seconds .  a familiar voice interrupted him  demanding his immediate and full attention .    there you are .  i should have guessed you d be crawling around where it isn t necessary .    he acquiesced to the demand of ariel s presence  reluctantly yet willingly  as always .  despite her words  she bent down on her hands and knees to examine the crack with him .  he could not decide whether to be relieved or annoyed that she had finally caught up with him .   she made the decision for him  for she did not look at the crack or touch the building .  she only looked into his eyes .    found anything interesting yet .   she asked eagerly  breathlessly  from deep in her throat .   he smiled involuntarily .   much  but nothing definitive .    wolruf s hair stood on end as she came forward to sniff the area around the crack .    what are you looking for .   derec asked .    forr w ateverr thiss one can find   said the alien .   ssmells  ssounss  w ateverr .   wolruf looked up at derec .   mosst interesstin  .  no ssmell anyt in  .     yes  the electric motor turning this building is certainly operating at optimum efficiency   said derec .    undoubtedly designed with such unobtrusiveness in mind   said ariel .    not in hass been tak n for granted   said wolruf .    do i detect some semblance of admiration in your voice .   derec asked her .    yesss .  my people would say thiss buildin  iss ass weightless as tricksterr toy .  itss effect iss ssame  too .     tricksters .   derec asked .     wolruf has been trying to explain the concept to me for the last couple of days   ariel said .   before her species became spacefarers  they lived what we at first glance would call a primitive existence .  but her people had sophisticated folklore  which existed in part to provide metaphysical explanations for the phenomena of day to day existence .  tricksters were a device frequently employed in these explanations .  they were children of the gods  who frequently played pranks on the tribes and often figured prominently in a mythic hero s adventures .    derec nodded .  he really didn t know what to make of all this .  his mind was already too full trying to understand these robots  and at the moment he didn t think he could assimilate much information about wolruf s people .   listen  i m feeling a little claustrophobic  and besides  i don t think we can learn anything else here  anyway .     why learn .   asked ariel .   why not just enjoy .         i ve already done that .      you just say that because you ve always liked to pretend you re an intellectual .    derec raised an inquisitive eyebrow and stared hard at her  a hundred questions suddenly plaguing his mind .  how could she know he liked to pretend .  pretend what .  was she referring to their supposed chance meeting at the spaceport .  presumably the meeting had been brief   too brief for her to be able to infer an  always .    derec was naturally overcome with a desire to know  but the innocent way she had made the remark cautioned him .   she probably hadn t been aware of the implications .  if he quizzed her now  she might become too careful  he could gain more information from her in the long run if she felt free to speak casually .    master .  master .    mandelbrot was speaking .   what is it .   derec answered .    i recall you had expressed an interest in the individual responsible for this creation .     yes  that s true   said derec excitedly  suddenly forgetting how he had been disconcerted by ariel s implication .   mandelbrot shaped his malleable hand into the form of an arrow and pointed it toward the edge of the square .   then i suggest you take a walk in that direction  where those robots are gathered .     thanks  mandelbrot .  i ll see you in a minute .   derec smiled weakly and nodded at the hand .   a nice touch   he whispered .  he walked toward the area indicated   a place where the robots were packing themselves tightly indeed .  those who weren t speaking on the comlink circuit   a means through which they could communicate more fully and faster   spoke loudly  perhaps in deference to the humans present  but then perhaps not .  it was another question derec would have to find the answer to .      hey .  wait for me .   ariel called out .    but not forr me   said wolruf .   don t like crrrowds .    derec turned and waited for ariel to catch up .   this is the second time tonight i ve had to wait for you .  what took you so long to get here earlier .     oh  i took a turn too fast and capsized my scooter .  wolruf and i weren t hurt  just shaken up a bit .  i think my body s covered with black and blues though .     oh .  you ll have to let me take a look at them later .     you d like that  wouldn t you .     i meant in a purely medical sense .   though he never cared to limit himself  he thought .   how s your scooter .     totalled  of course   she said  shrugging nonchalantly .   the robots in the crowd ahead were gathered about a single robot .  at first derec and ariel couldn t see what he looked like .   ariel tapped a short builder robot on the shoulder .  it turned around .  as fate would have it  it was harry .   please  let us pass   she said  being neither particularly polite nor impolite .    if you wish   said harry  dutifully stepping away   but i would appreciate it if you would refrain from seriously displacing me .  i can barely receive everything as it is .    ariel s eyes widened in shock  but derec couldn t resist smiling .   i d like to perform an exploratory scan on you   he said to the robot   at your convenience .  would tomorrow morning   first thing   be acceptable .     perhaps it is a good thing that you want to scan me   harry said .   it so happens tomorrow morning is convenient .  but might i ask the reason why you must play mechanic so soon   or why select me from all the other robots in the city .     hmmm .  i bet people always say much the same thing to their human doctors .  don t worry .  your personality integrals won t be fiddled with .     a sorely tempting prospect   put in m    .   the sudden interruption startled derec  he had almost forgotten about the other two .   forgive me   he said   but was that an attempt at sarcasm .     i have been ruthlessly studying all the tricks   m    replied .   ridicule  dramatic irony  hyperbole  and i stand ready to put them at your service at a moment s notice  sir .     no  thank you   ariel said  smiling   he s armed well enough on his own .    m    shook its head .   .  a pity .  but no doubt there shall soon come a human to this planet who has need of my services .  perhaps i shall one day even be permitted to be a valet in the diplomatic corps .    benny raised its hand and put it on m    s shoulder in the same manner it had put it on harry s .   hold the lifepod  comrade  but might i suggest it is too early in the game to conceive of such grandiose goals .       humans do   said m    .   they design their own buildings  as well .    derec instinctively stepped back  as if he feared he would be caught in a sudden explosion .  generally  robots  philosophical discussions centered around how best to serve humans in the standards dictated by the three laws .  but both benny and m    had been talking about their own interests .   hmm  but with normal speech  he noted .  is that only automatic  for my benefit  because i happen to be in the vicinity .  or is there some deeper purpose there that i m unaware of .   come to think of it  what s the deeper point of their discussion .  they re doing all this for a reason .   derec inched forward so that he could hear more easily .  but before he could hear their next words  harry stepped between him and them .  harry had performed the aggressive move as politely as possible  but it was exasperating all the same .   harry  just what do you think you re doing .     the third law of robotics dictates that i make an inquiry   he said .   the third law states  a robot must protect its own existence as tong as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws .  that would explain the action but not the impropriety .  derec sighed in surrender .   yes  harry  what is it .  no   wait a second .  mandelbrot are you confused by all this .     yes .     then i guess these three are funny .     if you are referring to our earlier conversation  yes  they are .     thanks .  yes  harry .  what s in your positronic brain .         please refrain from misunderstanding me   harry said   but i would severely fail to adjust if some random electronic scan disrupted my carefully assembled philosophy of life .     excuse me   what philosophy of life .   asked derec  his gut tightening when he realized that  whatever happened next  he had directly asked for it .    ever since i was first switched on  i have striven to perform by three rules of life  in addition to the three laws .     yes   said derec uncertainly  now really dreading the answer .   harry held out one finger .   make sure you are closed down for twelve hours of every cycle .   two fingers .   never play tri dimensional chess with a robot that has a planet for a first name .   three fingers .   and never quibble with the logic of a robot that has sixteen notches on his beta thruster .    derec stared wide eyed at the robot in stunned disbelief .   what in the name of the galaxy are you talking about .     humor  as opposed to sarcasm .  i was attempting to elicit laughter   said the robot in unmistakably defensive tones .   is not humor one of the personality traits we robots must know and understand if we are to serve humanity properly .     uh  not necessarily  in fact  it s never been done before  at least to my knowledge .  but i don t see how it could hurt   unless the human in question is one of those rare birds who has no funnybone and hence views laughter as unhealthy or otherwise undesirable .     well  thus far my fellow robots are convinced i have succeeded in the undesirable department .  i apologize most abjectly if you find my jokes severely lacking marrow .  i promise to do better next time  especially if you help me correct my errors   which  after all  may have absolutely nothing to do with my positronic keenness  but with my delivery instead .  is it possible .  how say you .     tomorrow .  tomorrow  first thing .  i promise .   without waiting for a response  derec took an equally stunned ariel by the arm and guided her through the crowd separating them from the main object of attention .    are that robot s pathways in the right place .   she whispered .    if they are  then i suggest we dismantle the entire city first chance we get .      hmmm .  maybe so   replied ariel  taking a parting glance at harry .   if we must  i know exactly where to begin .    but derec had already forgotten the matter of harry and his two comrades  for he was finally getting a good look at the calm center of the commotion  a rather slight supervisor robot   slight despite its dull gray chromium surface  which lent a weighty air to the narrow body .  the reflection of the building light on its surface was considerably more lackluster than that of the rest .  the robot s posture indicated that it was uncertain of how to deal with all this attention .  its arms were crossed timidly over its chestplate .  its shoulders slumped as if its spinal structure had been compromised by a defect .  occasionally it straightened  or pointed a finger  but generally its gestures were hesitant  its verbal pauses frequent  and its level of coherence largely a matter of conjecture .    i fail to understand how you can reach such a conclusion through any sort of logic  however spotty   it was saying  apparently in reply to a question from a tall ebony robot that  arms crossed  looked down on it as if from a storm cloud .   my pathways have never been clearer .  my behavior is as consistent with the spirit of the three laws as any robot s on this planet .  perhaps more so  because i seem to be inherently more cognizant of some of the contradictions inherent in our position .    the ebony   whose surface was so dark it was permeated with spectral nuances of unrelenting shadow   shivered with something approaching indignation .  for a long moment the two stared at one another  and derec got the uncomfortable feeling that they were sizing up each other .   derec put his finger to his lips  and when ariel nodded to show she understood  he stuffed his hands into his back pockets and listened with keen interest .    perhaps you believe with the utmost sincerity that you have merely been following your duty as properly behooves a robot   said the ebony evenly   but it is not up to you to decide what your duty is  nor is it up to you to take it upon yourself to redesign this city to meet your own specifications .  there is something dangerously anarchistic about your attitude .     i have done what i have done   said the gray  looking away with a bearing that  had it been human  derec could have described as a huff .   i have harmed no robot  no human  and certainly not myself .  in fact  if you would care to open your receptors and seek out empirical justification for your opinions  you will see that thus far i have only expanded the awareness of the robots gathered around .  such expansion of perspective can only be positive .     you cannot prove that   replied the ebony at once .   you can only surmise it .     one can reasonably assume one is doing the greatest good .  true enough  some harm may come from forces one cannot have reasonably predicted  but such a rationale is in and of itself no reason to remain inactive .  in any case  the matter is settled for the moment .  what is done cannot be undone .     all robots can be ordered to forget  and they will .   said the ebony defiantly .    what i have done is stronger than mere memory   replied the gray .   what i have done will affect the positronic functioning of every robot that has seen my building .  order them to forget   see if i care .   the gray turned as if to walk away .  instead  it paused and said   but  i submit  they will be infinitely better off if they do know why .  the confusion of forgetfulness can often lead to overload   and hence to disaster .  so how does your suggestion conform to the three laws now .    for a long moment the ebony actually appeared crushed by the question .  then it mustered its posture  took a few steps forward  and put its hand on the chromium robot s shoulder .  staring down at it as if it were looking at a crystal through an electron microscope .  the ebony s eyes were so red that they seemed to be comprised of as many floating divisions of overlaid hues as did the planes of the building .   your building is a remarkable conceptual feat   it said to the gray .   could it be you directly copied the building from some preexisting design .     forgive me  my friend   replied the gray   but my conception simply came to me one afternoon .  i responded by making it a reality .  i would mention that the central computer would have overridden my instructions if i had requested anything conflicting with city programming .     interesting   replied the ebony  rubbing its hands together .  derec half expected sparks to fly .   then how long can we expect this building to stand .     until the central computer is given a direct order to wash it away .  only i know the code  however  i imagine it is barely possible that a sufficiently determined critic could discover it and override it .     the ebony s eyes brightened .  derec tensed as he watched the ebony draw itself up to its full height .   this is madness .  illogic runs rampant .  your deeds have irrevocably cut the pattern of our existence .     not at all   said the gray demurely .   the building was a logical result of something that had impressed my circuits the wrong way ever since the humans arrived in our city .   for the first time it acknowledged the presence of derec and ariel  with a slight bow .   and surely  if my vision is the logical result of the complex interaction of my positronic pathways  then anything i can come up with   and any deed i can accomplish   is a meet and proper activity  especially if it helps robots better understand the behavioral complexities of humans .     in that case   said the ebony   you shall reprogram central to do away with the building  and then open your brain repository to share your pathway nuances with us .  it should never be necessary for you to create again .     he shall do no such thing .   exclaimed derec .   hear me  ebony  whoever you think you are   he added  practically poking his finger in the robot s face .   until other humans arrive here  or until the engineer who created this city reveals his presence  this building shall remain as long as its   its creator wishes it to stand .  this is a direct order and may not be countermanded by central or by anyone else .  do you understand .  a direct order .  and it shall apply to every robot in the city .  there shall be no exceptions .    the ebony nodded .   as you wish .    derec could only assume that the ebony would carry out his orders to the letter .  only an order given by someone in precedence   dr .  avery  to be precise   or a necessity dictated by the three laws would permit the building to be reabsorbed now .   and to emphasize that fact  lest the ebony should strive to pinpoint some logical flaw in the command  derec ignored all other robots   especially the ebony   in favor of the gray .  he turned to him and asked   what is your designation .     lucius .     lucius .  no number .     like many of my comrades  i recently decided that my former designation was no longer adequate .     yes  there seems to be a lot of that going around lately .  all right  lucius  i think the time has come for you and me to take a little walk .     if that is your command   said lucius noncommittally .   a few moments later  derec and his three friends were escorting the robot called lucius from the square .  the vast majority of the robots had returned their attention to the building  but derec was uncomfortably aware of two red metal eyes glaring at him  as if to bore deep into his soul .      . chapter    circuit breaker    now that he was walking down the same streets he had ridden the scooter through earlier  derec took advantage of the slower pace to try to deduce how much the city had changed in the interim .  complicating the deductions was the fact that his previous speed hadn t been very accommodating .  he d had only glimpses before  and he wasn t sure if he was remembering half of them correctly .   but after he d made allowances for the flaws in his survey  he was convinced that entire buildings had been replaced by new ones in an assortment of geometric designs that  for all their variety  nonetheless possessed a cookie cutter sameness .  in some places  whole blocks had been transformed .  however  the streets remained roughly consistent with previous directions  despite the addition of many twisted  almost gnarled turns .   the farther he went from lucius s building  the more unexpected diversions there were  in the forms of metalworks  fenced run off canals  bridges  and power stations .  derec felt fortunate that his talents included a fairly strong sense of direction  otherwise  he would always be forced to rely on robots for navigational purposes .  there was nothing wrong with that   robots had an excellent sense of direction   but he couldn t always assume a robot would be around when his survival depended on it .   but wherever he was  he could always see the distant shards of light shining from lucius s building .  they stabbed up from the surrounding darkness like ethereal swords rising up from a pit  swords that cut deep into the cloud banks high in the sky .  the clouds twisted and rolled  covering new sections of sky  as if the light were stirring an inner fire .   the group with derec   ariel  mandelbrot  wolruf  and lucius   walked in silence  as they had been doing for some time .  derec suspected that all of them  even mandelbrot  required a few minutes lost in their own thoughts to digest what they had seen tonight .   derec wished it weren t so difficult to remember so much of his knowledge of galactic histories and customs .  not only had he lost his personal history  but he had forgotten the methods he used to recall things .  he d lost his entire mental filing system  and had to be immersed in doing something  such as fixing a robot  before it came back to him .   he did not like this state of affairs because he did not like to think that he and ariel   both of whom were mentally handicapped at the moment   were the only ones who had ever encountered robots that were capable of searching  creative thought .  he wondered if originality in humans was the result of logical thinking as much as transcendent inspiration .   besides  who was to say that robots didn t possess subconscious minds of their own  minds capable of generating their own brands of inspiration  neither superior nor inferior to those of humankind but merely separate .  after all  humans themselves hadn t been aware of the existence of the subconscious mind until it had been defined by primitive scientists and doctors  before the era of colonization .  had anyone ever bothered to make similar explorations into the mental depths of robots .  it frightened derec to think that he had the potentially awesome responsibility of witnessing the robots during   and possibly midwifing them through   their mental birth pains .  he hardly felt qualified .   but then again  i m not the type to miss an opportunity  either  he thought .  creative robots might be able to make the conceptual breakthrough i need to have them find a cure for ariel s ailment .   her disease was the reason for her exile from aurora  whose population dreaded diseases of all sorts . they had managed to rid themselves of most illnesses  but whatever it was that ariel had contracted  it was beyond the grasp of auroran medical science .  the doctors there had been able neither to diagnose nor cure what ailed her .  the diagnostic robots here were completely stymied .  and derec himself had made exactly zilch headway .  perhaps a team of creative robots   whose inspirational talents leaned toward the sciences rather than the arts   could succeed where he had failed .   but first derec had to understand as much as he could about what was happening now   to lucius  to harry and the others  and even to the ebony .  he had long since formulated his line of questioning  but he had decided to wait because he was reluctant to break the spell of silence that had fallen among the members of the group .   besides  derec saw it was no use trying to pull ariel into a conversation .  she walked with her shoulders slumped and her hands behind her back .  her expression was pensive  her eyebrows narrowed .  derec knew from bitter experience that it did no good to engage her when she was this way .  she rarely cared to have her depressed moods interrupted  rationalizing the unhealthy tendency by claiming the moods belonged to her and she preferred to enjoy them while she had them .   well  she ll come out of her shell when she s ready  he thought .  i just hope this current episode of introversion isn t the result of her disease .   of course  it was always possible that she wanted a little bit of attention and was reacting badly to the fact she wasn t likely to get it .  he had just decided to risk taking a few unkind words from her  in the hope of pleasantly surprising her  when lucius surprised him by taking the initiative and breaking the silence .    were you pleased with my creation .   the robot asked .   forgive me if i seem to be overstepping the boundaries of politeness  but i m naturally interested in your human reaction .     yes  absolutely  i m pleased .  it s unquestionably one of the most spectacular buildings i can recall ever having seen .   an easy enough compliment  because he could recall so little   just jumbled images of aurora  and what he had seen since awakening with amnesia .   the question is  were you satisfied .     the building seems adequate for a first effort .  already its logical shortcomings seem all too obvious to me .     but not to others  your circuits will be warmed to know .     yes  you are quite correct .  they are   he replied .   and they are warmed  too  by the fact that i have found some strange sense of purpose resolved in seeing the final product .  now my mind is free to formulate my next design .  already it seems inappropriate to dwell overmuch on past accomplishments .     i found that by looking on your building  i personally experienced what i have always assumed humans to mean by the thrill of discovery   said mandelbrot  with a measured evenness in his words that he had never used while speaking to derec .   indeed  my positronic pathways concentrated easily on it .     then i am gratified   said lucius .    so am i   said derec .   i don t think i m exaggerating when i say i felt almost privileged to be viewing the structure .     then i am doubly gratified   said lucius .    in fact  i would go so far as to say that never before in human history has a robot produced such a composition .     never before    .   said lucius .   surely i would have thought that elsewhere     the robot shook its head  as if to assimilate the ramifications of the notion .  the effect was disconcerting  and for an eerie moment lucius reminded derec of what a human might act like if he had a nervous tic .    i  d like to know what prodded you to think in terms of art in the first place   derec said .   lucius responded by suddenly standing perfectly still and staring blankly straight ahead .  everybody  including ariel  stopped walking .  something seemed terribly  terribly wrong .   derec felt an awful wrenching in his gut .  not since he had awoken alone and amnesic in the lifepod had he felt such dread .   for lucius s words definitely indicated he had assumed he was merely the first robot in robot city to produce art .  it was hardly unreasonable on the face of it to assume that elsewhere  among the spacer societies  other robots routinely conceived art and labored to make it reality .   robots are not programmed to take initiatives  especially those whose consequences are as yet unknown .  they routinely rationalize anything  and freely expound upon the logic justifying every deed .  and derec felt certain lucius s immobile stance was the outward sign of what was happening in its brain  where its circuits were grappling with the inescapable fact that it had taken an unacceptable initiative  but were incapable of justifying it rigorously .   as a consequence  lucius s brain was in danger of overloading .  it would die the robotic death of positronic drift  an irreparable psychic burnout   thanks to an inherent inability of its programming to resolve apparent contradictions .   derec had to think fast .  the body could be fixed up after the disaster happened  of course  but the worthless brain would have to be chucked into the recycler .  the special circumstances that had brought about lucius s capacities for intuitive leaps might never again be duplicated .   an angle .  i need an angle to get inside lucius s mind .  derec thought .  but what .    lucius  listen to me very carefully   he said through tense lips .   your mind is in danger .  i want you to stop thinking about certain things .  i know there are questions in your mind .  it is essential to your survival that you deliberately close down the logic circuits preoccupied with them .  understand .  quickly .  remember   you re doing this for a reason .  you re doing this because of the third law  which dictates that you must protect yourself at all times .  understand .    at first  while derec spoke  lucius did nothing .  derec doubted his words were getting through the positronic haze .  but then lucius perked up and  hesitantly  looked around .  it had regained a tenuous control of its faculties  but was clearly still in danger .    my thanks  sir .  your words have pleasantly rearranged my mental meanderings  for the nonce .  i am most grateful .  it is difficult to serve humanity when you are totally incapacitated .  but i do not understand .  i feel so strange .  is this what humans mean by whirlwind thoughts .     don t even think about your physical efficiency   said derec anxiously .   in fact  i want you to direct your integrals only to those precise subjects i suggest .     sir  i must respectfully point out that that is impossible   replied lucius .      perhaps i can impart some information to him that will assist you  master   said mandelbrot .   derec nodded approval  and mandelbrot then said to lucius   permit me to introduce myself  comrade .  my name is mandelbrot  and i am a robot .  but not a robot like you .  you were built in a factory here in robot city  but master derec personally built me .  he constructed me from used parts he was given access to by an alien creature holding him prisoner against his will .  master derec may not know the particulars of his past life  but he is certainly a superior roboticist .  he can help you reason out of your dilemma .        right now reasoning is   is so difficult .   lucius was slipping fast  down into a dreamstream of his own making .  his sensor glow progressively dimmed  and unusual  cantankerous noises emanated from inside his body .    all right  lucius   derec said   i want you to think back very carefully .  i want you to remember everything you can about what happened to you  oh  a few hours before you first conceived of the building .  i want you to slowly  carefully tell me exactly the truth .  don t worry about any apparent discrepancies .  if something appearing dangerous to you comes up  we ll take care of it before we go on .  just remember one thing  okay .    lucius did nothing .    okay .   derec repeated more insistently .   lucius nodded .    excellent .  just remember that  as a general rule  the contradictions of the moment are eventually erased in the cool light of sublime reflection .  can you remember that .    lucius did not answer  did not move .    answer me .   frustrated  he tapped the shell of the robot s temple   the sound reverberated from the buildings .   finally  lucius nodded .   i understand   it said simply .    a suggestion  master .   inquired mandelbrot .    anything   just be quick about it .     lucius s problems stem from its belief that  by programming its building into the city  it has failed to adhere to the three laws  and hence has strayed from the path .  its conversation with the ebony back in the square may have contributed to the positronic imbalances  but mere words would have no effect if lucius had not already been subliminally alert to the possibility .     this is a suggestion .   exclaimed derec impatiently .   what s the point .     forgive me  but a robot can understand the paradoxes in the behavioral applications of the three laws more fully than any human   but until now only humans have made intuitive leaps of the imagination .  now i must ask you  master derec  so you may ask lucius  why is that .    derec turned to lucius  rose to his tiptoes  and spoke directly into the robot s auditory sensors .   listen to me  lucius .  i want you to think back   and tell me of the time when you believe you became different from the others .     different .     this is no time for equivocation  lucius   tell me .  why are you different .    after a protracted pause   during which derec heard his heart beating hard and his temples throbbing furiously   lucius began to speak as if hypnotized .   it was during the period when you and the one called ariel had first arrived in the city .  the central computer had already responded defensively to the death of the man with your identical appearance .     my double  yes   said derec tersely  folding his arms .   go on .     erroneously concluding that the city was under attack by mysterious  unknown  and perhaps invisible adversaries  the computer promptly shifted into high gear and began redrafting the city at an unprecedented rate  approving the modifications it had suggested to itself before external factors such as need and compatibility were adequately integrated into the sketches .  the rate of revision quickly became suicidal .  resources were strained to the utmost .  the weather patterns were stirred to the boiling points .  the city was destroying itself to save itself .     i seem to remember most of this   said derec .    forgive me if i am declaring the obvious  but i think it shall prove germane .   lucius s tones betrayed no electronic agitation at derec s impatience .  on this score  at least  the robot had no doubt it was following orders .   though i admit i have sought no empirical evidence to either prove or disprove it  i think it is safe to say that every robot in the city was so intent upon keeping up with short term directives that no one realized a crisis was happening .     and what do you think would have happened if some robots had .     they might have deduced that their short term directives were actually counterproductive  so far as the third law was concerned  and they might have attempted to communicate to central in an effort to countermand its orders .     central wasn t talking  anyway   said derec impatiently .   it would have been a dead end .  what makes you think they would have disregarded central when they did decide it was on the fritz .     because that is precisely what i did  following the logical actions dictated by my deductions .     i assume you attempted communication several times .       and each time the interplay indicated the channels were opened only one way .  central could talk to me  but i could not talk to central .  this struck my curiosity integrals as significant  but  lacking further information  i had not the means to determine the deeper meaning of the issue .      so what did you do then .  did you obey your short term directives .     no .  i had already determined that they were counterproductive  so i had no choice but to try to discern  through whatever means available  a logical  constructive direction warranted by the circumstances .  i wandered the streets  watching them metamorphose  studying their changes  attempting to discern the overall pattern that i suspected lay hidden beneath the shifting ones .     did you notice any other robots doing the same thing   just wandering around .     no .  other robots i saw were simply going about their assigned activities  automatically performing their routines regardless of the supranormal rate of change .  it was not complimentary to think so  but i viewed them  on one level at least  as mindless beings  who went about doing as they were told without ever stopping to consider the long term consequences of their actions .  the entire situation was unacceptable  but what could i do .  i could only conclude that all my opinions were just that   opinions .  and mine were not inherently better than theirs .     is that when you thought of it   when you conceived of your building .     if you will remember  there was a series of torrential downpours at the time .  the robots gradually shifted the bulk of their activities to stemming the environmental tides  but remained incapable of perceiving the root of the disaster .  the significance of how this turn of events commented on the superficial way we accepted our customs could not escape me  and the blind acceptance seemed contrary  in some ways  to my programmed purpose of being .     and exactly what was the comment .   derec asked .    just then i could not be certain  there seemed to be no concrete train of logic setting the proper precedent .      please go on   you re doing well .  so far i ve seen no violation of the laws .  you ve got nothing to worry about   you only think you do .     i decided that i had derived as much empirical evidence of the city  as seen from the sidewalks  as would be useful .  i needed to see the sky and rainfall clearly  unobstructed by the buildings  much as a human in an analogous situation might want to .    derec shrugged .   go on .     once the idea came to me  i acted immediately .  so intent was ion my goal that i neglected to appreciate what my sensors otherwise perceived quite clearly  the city streets beneath me had begun to undergo a kind of trembling that disguised any vibrations the rain and the wind might be causing .  i felt the trembling through my legs  the sensation shimmered up my torso .  and as i walked to the nearest skyscraper  the vibrations tingled in my fingertips .    once i was inside  i realized my mind remained inordinately fixated on the thunderheads above .  their shades of black and gray swirled more vividly in my mind than when i had directly perceived them earlier  so intent was ion holding onto the image that when the first floor quaked without warning and nearly sent me tumbling against the wall  my only thought was to reach the lift without delay .   there lucius paused  and reached out to grab derec s shoulder .   derec flinched instinctively  but when mandelbrot made a motion as if to deflect lucius s hand  derec stopped him with a gesture .  robots did not normally touch humans  but derec sensed lucius had need for tactile sensation  if for no other reason to reassure itself that its problems were isolated in its mind .   lucius held derec s shoulder just too hard for comfort  but the human tried not to wince .  if he did  mandelbrot would quickly decide that further inaction on his part would conceivably cause derec too great a harm  and derec did not want to risk mandelbrot s interference at this stage of the game .    i fear that was my first true transgression .  the quaking of the building put into my head the notion of everything i had learned in my brief life about how humans sustain themselves through eating .     huh .   derec said .    meaning now that i was inside the building when its general behavior was indicating a change was about to occur  i had some notion about how a living creature swallowed by a human must feel once it has reached its destination .    derec felt his own stomach go queasy .   lucius  that s barbaric .  nobody does that anymore   at least not that i know of .     oh .  perhaps my information is suspect  then .  it is so difficult to tell fact from fiction when you re trying to understand humans .         yes  i can certainly appreciate that   said derec  thinking of ariel for an instant before resolving to keep his thoughts on the matter at hand .   continue .  you realized your existence was in danger  then  because of how the building was acting .     yes .  it was either changing or being reabsorbed into the street .  the third law dictated i should exit immediately .  indeed  i should have had no choice in the matter .  but  strangely  i did not go .  the urge to do so  in fact  was easily suppressed .  because for those brief moments it was more important to me to see the clouds unobstructed by the civilization that had spawned me than it was to ensure my continued survival .  i was acting in a manner completely contrary to the path dictated by the third law  and yet i functioned normally  at least on the surface of things .  it is only now .  .  .  now .  .  . now .  .  .    lucius repeated the last word as if its mind had been caught in an intractable loop .    nonsense .   snapped derec .   if your actions did place you in physical danger   which i gather is the general direction we re headed for   how were you to know for certain .  sure  it might have looked that way  but you had a mission  a deed to accomplish .  you had factors to weigh .  you had other things on your mind .     sti   ill   still dar waz dangzzer .  .  .       and a likelihood  i take it  that you would come through all right if you kept your wits about you .  obviously .  come on  lucius  it s got to be obvious  else you wouldn t be here right now .  come on  the time to fizzle out was then  certainly not now .  live and learn  remember .  just like an artist .    lucius swayed like a drunken man but fixed its optics firmly on derec .  it was difficult to tell if it was getting better because its metal face was incapable of exhibiting the slightest emotion or feeling  and because the dim level of the lights in the optics lingered .  but already its voice sounded firmer as it said   we are trained to recognize probability .  we deal constantly with probability .  we are used to accessing it in a split centad and acting accordingly .  and the probability was most unpromising .     but what counts most is what happened   not what didn t happen .  the rest you re just going to have to chalk up to experience  lucius .    lucius released derec s shoulder .  and just in time  derec thought  rubbing it gently .    yes   i have had experience lately  have i not .   said lucius in a tone whose very evenness made derec catch his breath .   are you implying that when it comes time to gain a little bit of experience in the galaxy  there may be occasions when avoiding risk might conceivably cause one more harm than taking it .     ultimately  yes  i suppose   said derec  nodding for emphasis even though he really didn t care to commit himself to that point .   in this case an omission of experience might have stunted your mental development in a certain direction   which you could define as harm of a sort .  wouldn t you say so  mandelbrot .  lie if you have to .     pardon me  master  but you know i cannot lie .  was that an attempt at humor .     thanks  mandelbrot .  what happened next  lucius .         despite the unsound nature of the building  i rushed to the lift and activated it .  it occurred to me  just for an instant  that if the controls had shifted  then i would have no choice but to exit with the utmost dispatch .  but the controls showed no evidence of a transmutation about to take effect  and so i not quite reasoned that the safeguards of the city itself would give me time enough to accomplish my goal and then get out .  i could not have been more wrong .  i must have experienced something akin to human shock  when the full impact of my miscalculation struck me .    for when the lift had taken me approximately halfway up  the building itself ruptured .  its foundations dissolved  its walls merged into a chaotic stream that first swept me up and then remorselessly carried me down toward the surface .  all i could sense was an ebb tide of meta cells  yielding to the contours of my body yet not permitting me the slightest freedom of movement .     wait a second   said derec .   are you trying to tell me that in the history of this city  however brief  no robot has ever happened to be submerged  even accidentally  in a building as it changes or merges back into the city .     naturally not  sir .  there are many interior indications whenever a building is about to change  and our adherence to the third law prevents us from staying past the point where even accidental harm is a realistic possibility .  in addition  the city would normally cease to act if a robot happened to remain inside because he had been rendered immobile through an accident .  but i had neglected to foresee the implications of the special circumstances the city was dealing with at the time   the belief that it was under attack  the frantic restructuring  the raging environmental disaster .  .  .     forget it   you re a robot  not a seer .  you couldn t have guessed just how badly the city s program was crashing .  so what happened once you were submerged .  what thoughts went through your mind .     clear ones   the most logical ones i had ever had .  strangely  i felt no sense of time whatsoever .  reason indicated that i had only been submerged for a few decads  but for all practical intents and purposes my mind was flowing at a rate strongly emphasizing the subjectivity of the concept of time .  every moment i spent in the ebb stretched out for an eternity .  and within those eternities  there stretched out an infinity of moments .  i realized that for much of my brief existence i had lived in a state of dream death  living  working  doing all the things i had been programmed to do  but holding back the realization of possibilities ignored .  now  i had no idea what to do about that  but i resolved to explore the appropriate possibilities  whatever they came to be .    there came a moment when my sensors indicated i was no longer moving .  i had become stationary  but the ebb was moving past me  running over me as though i had been strapped to a rock in turbulent rapids .  the weight on my body gradually diminished  and i realized i was being held fast by the surface of the streets beneath the sinking building .    and i was left lying on the surface as the final streams of meta cells trickled over me  leaving my body fresh and cleansed .  i  who had been immersed in a building  had an individualized idea of the sort of building robot city should contain  the design and structure of which was imminent in my own experience .     didn t this strike you as being unusual .   asked derec .    no .  in fact  it was logical .  it was so logical that it made perfect sense to me .  i had a purpose and i was going to achieve it .  beyond that  i had no interest in determining why i had it  because that did not appear to be important .  i notice  however  from observing the behavior of my comrades  that i am not the only one striving to express something inside me .  the ambition seems to be spreading .     like a plague   said derec .    strangely  now the stars and clouds that had once fascinated me held no interest .  all i cared about was fashioning  with the tools and instruments available tome  my idea into a reality .      you did not think that others would perhaps object .   asked derec .    it did not occur to consider the opinions of others at all .  there was too much of an inner crackling in my transistors for me to be seized by distractions .  my circuits had flashes of uncontrollable activity  and they made unexpected connections between thoughts i had once believed were entirely unrelated .  these continuous flashes of realization came unbidden  at what seemed to be an ever accelerating rate .  i perceived still more buildings hidden in the flux  and all i had to do to find them was reach down into the pseudo genetic data banks to shape them .    a hundred notions bloomed in derec s mind .  he had once believed that he understood robots  that he knew how they thought because he knew how their bodies and minds were put together .  he believed he could take apart and reassemble the average model in half a day while blindfolded  and probably make a few improvements in the process .  in fact  he bragged about it often to ariel  not that she ever believed him .   nevertheless  before this moment he had always imagined that an untraversable gulf lay between him and the robots .  there was nothing about his mind  he had always assumed  that in the end bore much resemblance to their minds .  derec was a creature of flesh  composed of cells following complex patterns ordained by dna codes .  flesh and cells that had grown either in a womb or in an incubator  he wouldn t know which until he regained his memory  .  flesh and cells that would one day be no more .  of these facts his subconscious was always aware .   while robots   while this robot was made of interchangeable parts .  a robot s positronic potentials were naturally capable of endowing it with subtle personality traits  and they had always been able to take some initiative within the three laws .  but even those initiatives were fairly dependable  predictable in hindsight because generally one robot thought like another .   however  it was rapidly becoming undeniable that  on this planet at least  the robotic mind resembled the human mind in that it was an adaptive response to selective pressures .  from that point on  the possibilities were endless .   so lucius was  in its own way  like the first fish that had crawled from the water onto the ground .  its positronic potentials had adapted to life in robot city by taking definite evolutionary steps .  and other robots weren t very far behind .    master .  are you well .   inquired mandelbrot gently .    yes  i m fine .  it s just taking an effort to assimilate all this   derec replied in a distracted tone  looking about for ariel .  he wanted to hear what she thought of what he had learned  but she was nowhere to be seen .  neither was wolruf .  they had both slipped away while he had been preoccupied .   uh   and how are you  lucius .     i m well functioning at peak capacity   said lucius evenly .   evidently merely talking things through has helped me .     there s much more i d like to ask you   about your building and how you went about it .  i m especially interested in how you dealt with the central computer and managed to alter some of the pseudo genetic codes .     certainly  master  my mind and methods are at your disposal .  but any reasonable explanation would take several hours .      that s quite all right .  i ve made an appointment with another robot in the morning  but i should finish with him in a few hours .  then i d like to interview you .     you don t wish to examine me .     no  i m afraid taking you apart   even for a quick looksee   would cause you harm .  i don t want you to change .    lucius bowed slightly .   i suspected as much  but the confirmation is appreciated .      i would like to know one thing  though .  does your building have a name .     why  yes .  you re the first to ask .  its name is  circuit breaker .       an interesting name   said mandelbrot .   may i ask what it means .     you may ask   replied lucius .  but that was all it said .    mandelbrot  i want you to do me a favor   said derec .    certainly .     find ariel and keep an eye on her .  don t let her find out you re around .  obviously  she wishes to be alone  but she obviously can t be in her condition .     it has already been taken care of .  i saw a ten percent probability of a first law situation coming up but was sufficiently cognizant of her wishes to realize that privacy was her goal .  so i signaled wolruf to keep a watch on her .     derec nodded .   good .   he felt vaguely ashamed that he hadn t been on top of the situation earlier .  perhaps he was a little too self involved for his own good .  but he already felt better that mandelbrot had automatically watched out for her interests  in a manner protecting both her body and her sense of self identity .  it seemed that for a robot to serve man most efficiently  it had to be something of a psychologist as well .  or at least a student of human nature .   lucius asked   and how did my building affect you  sir .     oh  i enjoyed it   said derec absent mindedly  his thoughts still on ariel .    is that all .   said lucius .   derec hid his smile with his hand .   you must remember  this is the first time you ve ever created something that approaches the concept of art .  tonight was the first time your fellows had ever experienced the power of art .  we humans have been surrounded by it and influenced by it all our lives  from the first gardens we see  to the first holo landscape reproductions  to the first holodramas  everything we see that s created by or influenced by the hand of man .    but you robots are articulate and intelligent from the first moment you ve been switched on .  and this is the first time  to my knowledge  that one has created something in the more profound sense of the word .  had i conceived a similar project  i doubt if i could have done as well .     your talents may lie in other areas   said lucius .    well  yes   i m good at math and programming .  those are arts  too  though normally those not actively involved with them think of them as arcane crafts .  but the moment of inspiration is similar  and they say the level of creativity is somewhat the same .     that is not what i meant  and i suspect you know it   said lucius pointedly .   if i am to grasp the true nature of human creativity  then it stands to reason that my fellow robots and i would profit by seeing you create art .      but  lucius  i don t even know if i am creative in the sense you are .     another sense  then   lucius suggested .    hmmm .  i ll think on it  but right now i ve got other things on my mind .     as you wish .  but it is perhaps unnecessary to add that our study of the laws of humanics would benefit greatly from any creation you d attempt .     if you say so   replied derec absently  looking up at the clouds reflecting the colors of circuit breaker and seeing only the outline of ariel s face looking down on him .     chapter    ariel and the ants    ariel wandered the city alone .  bored with the discussion between derec and lucius  she had discovered she cared little about the robotic reasoning behind the building s creation .  she had seen it and been moved by it  and that was enough for her .  i guess that puts me in the i know what i like category  she had observed as she slipped away into an alley .   it was a few moments later  as she walked beside a large canal  currently dry  since it hadn t rained for days   when the strange things started happening again to her mind .  well  not to her mind exactly  she decided upon further consideration  but to her mind s eye .  she never had any doubt about who she was or what her real circumstances were  but nevertheless she saw menacing shadows flickering between the buildings beyond  in places so dark she shouldn t have been able to distinguish shades in the first place .   and the shadows were flickering toward her .  they reached out with long  two dimensional fingers across the conduit and disappeared in the lights on the sidewalk .  the streetlamps switched on and off  matching her progress .  she was constantly bathed in light  forever beyond the grasping fingers  reach  yet she was always walking toward the darkness where the danger was .  ariel wasn t sure how she felt about that .  it certainly aggravated her sense of insecurity .   on aurora  the existence of a solid building had been a dependable thing .  change there happened rarely and gradually .   and her life since she had been exiled from aurora presented her with a decided contrast .  like derec and his shakespeare  she had been doing a little reading on her own lately  on subjects of her own choosing .  in a book of settler aphorisms she  d read an ancient curse   may you live in interesting times .    well  interesting times were what she had wished for all those years on aurora  where something moderately interesting happened once a year if you were lucky .  from her earliest memory she had yearned to break free of the boredom and sterility .   and now that she had succeeded beyond her wildest expectations  she wished for nothing more than a little peace and quiet   for nothing more than a period of flat out boredom  where she had nothing to do and no one to worry about  not even herself .  thanks in part to the disease ravaging her  she was finding it difficult to know just how to act and what to do   a problem she had never had on aurora  where customs and ethics provided a guide for virtually every social situation .   she imagined herself not in robot city  but in the fields of aurora  walking at night  alone but not alone  followed by unseen  loyal robots who would ensure  to the best of their abilities  that she would not come to harm .   instead of buildings closing in around her there were expansive  open fields of grass and trees  plains whose consistency was broken only by occasional buildings of a more familiar  safer architectural style .  the clouds above inspired thoughts of the tremendous auroran storms  when the thunder rumbled like earthquakes and the lightning exploded from the sky in the shape of tridents .   during such storms the rain flowed as if a dike in the sky had been punctured .  the rainfall drenched the fields  cleansed the trees  and she could walk in it and feel it pounding against her all day if she liked   well  at least until her unseen robots would fear she might catch cold and insist she seek shelter .   here the rain only inspired the gutters to overflow .  here the rain could be a harbinger of death and destruction  rather than of life .   now where s derec  she suddenly thought  now that i need him .   oh .  that s right .  talking to lucius .  that s just like him  to be so self absorbed in things that don t matter  when he should be trying to find some way for us to get off this crazy planet .   doesn t he understand how badly we both need help .  him for his amnesia .  me for my madness .   madness .  was that what it was .  wasn t there some other word she could use for it .  an abnormality or an aberration .  a psychoneurosis .  a manic depressive state .  melancholia .   where were the fields .  she wondered .  they had been here just a few moments ago .   where had these buildings come from .   were the fields behind them .   she ran around the buildings to take a look .  there were only more buildings  extending as far as she could see  until they merged into a flattened horizon .  a wall of blackness .  more shadows .   she shook her head  and a few mental mists dissipated long enough for her to remember that there were no fields on this planet  that there d just been desolate rock here before the city had arrived .  a city that grew and evolved just like life .   a new kind of life .   she was like a microorganism here .  a germ or a virus  standing in the middle of a creature that only let her live because of a few wires and a few bytes of binary information .   her throat itched .  she rubbed her neck .  was she becoming sick .  if she was  would a robot notice and medicate her .  would the medication cloud her thinking even more .  if it did  would it be a good or bad thing .   her elbow itched .  she scratched it  the effect of her sharp fingernails somewhat muted by her suit .  the itch stayed .   she stopped scratching .  maybe it would go away if she ignored it .   it didn t .  it got worse .  she tried not to think about it  but the sole result was another itching .  on her chest .  she scratched her breastbone .  that itch  too  remained .  neither showed the slightest sign of diminishing .   where was derec .  she wondered as her fear of losing control aggravated her sense of helplessness  which in turn aggravated her fear of losing control .   oh  that s right .  he s still with the robot .   hey  i m all right .  i know where i am .  i was somewhere else a few seconds ago and i couldn t get back .  come to think of it  is there someplace else i should be rather than here  .  shouldn t i be in the future somewhere  .   then she tried to think of her name  and discovered she could not remember that  either .  a name seemed like such a basic thing to forget .  nor did it seem that far away .  but it wasn t where it was supposed to be  uppermost in her mind  where she could find it whenever she wanted .  it was buried in her pathways .   pathways .  robots had pathways .  was she very much like them .   was she still alone .  if she wasn t  would it make any difference .  she felt like her mind was made up of discarded scraps of ideas and impressions that long ago  maybe  had made sense .  right now they just made a junk heap .   she sat down  trying to focus her thoughts and her vision .  without realizing it  she had walked all the way to the reservoir .  an ecological system that had been created   but not nurtured   by dr .  avery .  a world that had been left alone to create itself .   she pondered the edible plants growing on the banks .  a clear cut case of evolution in action .  had dr .  avery envisioned the possibility .   what if other meta life forms were evolving as well .   now her stomach and crotch itched .  painfully .  her skin felt like it was burning from spilled acid .   she buried her head in her hands .  her temples throbbed and she feared every artery in her brain was about to burst .  it was easy  all too easy  for her to imagine a hemorrhage  the blood seeping everywhere  destroying her involuntary processes  drowning her thoughts .   had she really wanted to be alone .  where was derec .   oh  that s right .  .  .   she realized there was a difference  normally a barely perceptible one but in her heightened case very distinct  between believing you were alone and actually being alone .   dawn was coming to robot city .  the glow lucius had created was diminishing rapidly as the sun came up  and the waters of the reservoir rippled with irregular flickers reflecting the rays .   rays that brought life .  ariel watched in fascination as the pebbles at her feet shifted and made way for a gray stalk that  within a matter of moments  twisted from the earth and unfolded two tiny leaves .  she accidentally grazed the edge of a leaf  felt a sudden flash of pain on her finger .  the wound was narrow  like a paper cut .  a bubble of blood seeped from her skin .   damn  that smarts  she thought  watching as other stalks unfurled  twisting from the gravel .  her head continued to ache .  she stood and staggered to a boulder and leaned against it  being careful not to crush any of the stalks beneath her feet .  but it was hard to keep thinking of it  even when she was no longer moving .  hard to keep her mind on things  to remember .   her skin itched allover now  in waves that cascaded up and down as if she were being inundated by invisible radiation .  she perspired .  she shivered .  she moaned .   she leaned back  looked at the sky  at the billowing clouds .  she opened her mouth wide and breathed deeply  trying to keep her mind clear .   for the pervasive itch had begun to resemble something   a half tickle  half pinprick that brought back the memory of a walk on aurora when she had sat down to rest and had felt something similar  only subtler  tinier .  she had looked down to see an ant crawling up her bare leg .  she had shrieked from the surprise of it  but had brushed it off before her concerned robots could reach her .   the effect had been unsettling  to be so rudely touched by a mindless life form that could be carrying who knows what form of infectious disease .  she had instantly intellectualized the experience  of course  she had long ago decided the auroran fear of disease had been taken to ridiculous extremes .  even so  an involuntary sense of revulsion and disgust at the experience  much greater than was warranted  overtook her .  it had lingered until she had bathed in a whirlpool of disinfectants .   that night she had dreamed of being swarmed by thousands of ants .  the nightmare had been similar to what she was experiencing now .   but the current feeling was much more vivid .   she tried to convince herself that it wasn t real  that neither she nor derec had detected any form of metallic insect life on this planet .  however  the robots had shown definite signs of intellectual evolution .  perhaps that meant the cells forming the city were capable of random mutation  which meant it was not unreasonable to assume that a form of insect life was capable of developing .   ariel was frozen to the spot with fear .  she lowered her gaze  fully expecting to see a horde of ants swarming about her legs  moving up her boots and disappearing into her trouser legs  searching for just the right place to stop and begin gorging themselves  before they started carrying away tiny pieces of her .   but when she closed her eyes  it was all too easy for her to imagine the ants with their big compound eyes  glistening like tin in the sunlight  with their piston driven spindly legs and their nuclear battery powered thoraxes  and especially with the steady  mechanical motions of their mandibles searching over her epidermis like the rods of a geiger counter .  she could not as yet feel the mandibles biting and tearing  but she was certain that the pain would come .  beginning at any second .   where were the robots when you needed them .  couldn t any see her .  weren t any around .   no  of course not  she realized with an ever sinking sense of futility .  you re at the reservoir  and they re all in the city  pining about how there aren t any humans around for them to take care of .   there s soon going to be one less .  oh  derec  where are you .  why can t you help me .   ariel was afraid to breathe .  she thought that perhaps if she remained utterly stationary  like one who is dead  then the ants might think she was nothing but a dead rock .  but how could she remain motionless for long without breathing .  wouldn t the ants hear the sound of air moving in and out of her lungs .   what did it matter .  she had to do something  even if it was nothing .  she felt the mechanical ants everywhere  crawling up her breasts  nestled in her armpits  inspecting her hair .  why didn t they start eating .  weren t they hungry .  what kind of ants were they .   they re robot ants  she thought .  maybe they re trying to see if i m human .  if they decide i am  they may not hurt me .  if they decide otherwise  now she knew why primitive man had worshipped deities   to stave off the tremendous fear of the last moments of life  when there were profound good byes to be said and resolutions to be imparted  but no one to tell them to  and no time left to tell them .    airr eee ll .   someone whispered timidly .    arre  u asleep .    ariel s eyes could not have opened wider or faster if she had received an electrical shock .  she jumped back in stunned surprise at the sight of wolruf squatting directly in front of her .  and promptly smacked her head against the boulder .   things got woozy as the caninoid cocked her head .  wolruf held a clump of stalks in her left hand  and a few strands hung from the fur surrounding her lips .   arre  u well .     of course i m well .  what does it look like .     my annces orrs would have said that  u had vize atorr .     who .  what kind .   ariel snapped .  she closed her mouth with a force of will  then tried to compose herself .  she was only partially successful .   it should be obvious that until you showed up i was the only one here .     two rre ponnzes  furrst  been watching  u all nite         what .  .     man elbrrot rreques ed it .  thought  u woul n t apprresee ate rrobut .     why that big hunk of       pulice  let me finish .  seckon   ancess ors would have said  u weren t only theeng in  ur mind at moment  and i wai ed  wa cheeng  thinking it would be best not to dis urb  u or  ur vize atorr .     and exactly what made you decide to interrupt my strange interlude .      u looked like  u were about to faint .     i see .    wolruf tipped back further on her haunches  so that her back was perfectly straight .  her posture struck ariel as being almost humanly annoyed  especially when the caninoid crossed her arms and shook her head  as if in disappointment .  she went to great lengths to avoid looking directly into ariel s eyes  first examining the buildings  the bank  the rocks  and then pointedly turning her back to ariel  perhaps to have a better view of the reservoir .    well  aren t you going to ask me what my problem was .   said ariel .   wolruf turned her head slightly .   why sshhould i .     i   i thought you must might want to know  that s all .     nne of my bizzness .  not people s way .  deafenly not mine .     aren t you worried .     no .     don t you care .     didn t hav  to wa ch  u all nite .  was migh ily bored .  many times distrrack ed .  could hav  lef   u at any time and man elbrrot neither knowed norr carred .    ariel suddenly felt as tired as she had ever been in her life .  even to shrug with a labored air of nonchalance cost her a tremendous effort .   how flattering   she said sarcastically .   she immediately regretted the words .  wolruf was stopping just short of saying she had stayed to watch because she was concerned for her welfare .  there you go  miss burgess  ariel thought .  you really will go insane if you can t recognize the good in people  whether they re human or not .   she sat down beside wolruf and said   i m sorry .  please try to understand that in addition to all our other problems  my mental condition gets out of hand sometimes .     datzz all rite .         it isn t  it s just that i don t know what i can do about it right now .  to make matters worse  it always gives me an excuse to misbehave  even if i don t know at the time that that s all it is .     wolruf pulled her lips back against her teeth in a kind of smile .   so   are  u well .     i m better .         there s no rreazon to be upset about vize t from tricks  er .  izz how he makes us obey his will  by makin  us see wha  he wantzz .     that may be easy for your race to accept  but we humans aren t so used to having strange beings make pit stops in our minds at their every convenience .    wolruf nodded thoughtfully .     u simplee lack perrspec ive .    ariel nodded in return .  she had half expected that as a result of her apology she would feel the haze of exhaustion lift  but instead she imagined each individual cell in her body deteriorating steadily .  a little while longer and she d be a quivering mass of protoplasm .    it s an old spacer saying that everybody likes to feel in control of their lives  but with aurorans it s only more so   she said .    and why not .  it s not only an effect of our current culture  but an extension of our own history .  as the first spacers  we terraformed aurora to suit our own tastes and purposes .  we did everything we could to make our new planet a garden .  we even brought with us the prettiest  best  and most useful terran species  leaving behind the ones that would make life too unpleasant .     if tha   ur plane zz history  then the in ivi ual retlec zz it .     yes  until i was exiled and cut off from my funds  i had a great deal of independence .  within socially acceptable limits   which i never really accepted anyway   i had complete freedom of action .      u brroke those limitz       and lost control of my life .  funny how the details of my rebellion are so fuzzy now .  must be a side effect of my disease .  anyway  it s funny how the one thing i always thought i still had perfect control over   my mind   seems to be slipping away from me now .     trry to relax .  take it from one who hazz seen many un err thrroes of vize torr .   u not control it   u detlec  it .    ariel couldn t help but laugh .   you mean that when insanity is inevitable  relax and enjoy it .     not insanity .  merely givin  in to morre compellin  fuch  ions .  derec does that .  that izz why he hazz so many ideas .     i wish i could believe the same thing was true with me .   ariel paused as the implications of wolruf s remark began to sink in .   is that what he s doing when he spends so much time with lucius  when he should be figuring out a way to get us off this hellhole .    suddenly ariel stiffened .  her eyes went wide .    wha  izz it .   wolruf asked .   wha zz wrron  .       i don t know   she replied .    ano herr vize shon .     i   i hope so .   she grimaced  closed her eyes  and turned her head to the sky .  it s not real  she told herself  it s only something r m imagining .  but if reality is something we make  how do we deal with the forces making us .   but although she knew on one level that her neurological responses were going awry  her physical self nonetheless continued to respond realistically to the sensation of a distinct something  large and six legged  distinctly within her lifesuit .  a familiar something .  there was only one this time  but it was bigger than she remembered .  much bigger .   it was crawling up her stomach .  she forced herself to open her eyes  fully expecting to see her suit clinging normally to her torso .  instead she saw   with a vividness she could not help but decide was absolutely real   the outline of a giant metallic ant moving beneath her suit .  the cold touch of its six legs  each pressing delicately against her skin  sent chills of terror through her fragile  eggshell mind .   the outline moved distinctly  delicately forward .  she felt the cold brush of a mandible against her left breast  and watched in abject fear as the forefront of the outline moved to her right breast .  and rested on it .   ariel screamed at the top of her lungs and ran headlong in the direction she happened to be facing .  she was vaguely aware of wolruf yelling behind her  but she was too busy to pay attention .  she did not know where she was running  only that she had to make a beeline there .   she jumped into the reservoir .   she was in it for several moments  stunned senseless by the ice cold water  before she actually remembered diving in .  frantically  she tore open the snaps and buttons and zippers of her suit and put her hands inside  rummaging about  searching for the insect so she could pull the sucker out and drown it .   but she found nothing .  when it came to her ambition for revenge  this was a disappointing development .  how she had anticipated seeing it squirm as it tried to get away from her in the water .  but on another level  she was tremendously relieved .  insanity she could deal with  physical pain was definitely a cause for panic .   ariel imagined that perhaps the ant had been real after all  and had just torn through the suit on the way oat .  but the water around her  while not exactly clear  was very still .  there was no evidence of movement beneath the surface .  even the sand and dirt she  d raised upon entering had settled down by now .   she calmed herself with an effort  closed her eyes again  and waited .   soon she felt reasonably assured that the insect wasn t real enough to attack her  but she stayed in the water just to be on the safe side .  the water sent pinpricks of pain cascading through her very marrow   but even that kind of discomfort didn t provide her with enough incentive to get out .   wolruf sat patiently on the bank .   are  u well again .   the alien asked .    i think so   she said .   i had another visit .     assumed as much .     i think my visitor is gone now .  i think i prefer looking at my episodes in terms of visitors  by the way .  it s making it easier for me to accept them .      good .  don t  u wan  come out of water now .   u mite catch cold .     no .  it feels rebellious  to be doing something prying robot eyes might disapprove of .      will wait .     thanks .  i ll just be a few more minutes .  however safe my mind may feel while i m in here  i don t think my body can take much more of this cold .    something brushed against her .  she glanced down to see that something had stirred the dirt up .  something too big to be just an ant .  something that was real .    what s that .   she exclaimed .    wha zz what .   wolruf inquired .   but ariel could not bring herself to answer .  her teeth were clattering too much .  screwing up her courage   which she felt was in short supply these days   she gingerly ducked her head beneath the surface  keeping her eyes open in the frigid fluid with  an effort .   a hunk of metal lay half buried in the bottom of the reservoir .  the gentle currents had removed .  enough of the dirt covering it to begin moving it back to the shore .  its stiff hand brushed again against her leg .   its hand .   ariel accidentally inhaled a noseful of water .  she shot up to the surface  sputtering .    air eel .   asked wolruf .   wha  is it .     it s a robot   there s a robot down here .     wha zz it doing there .   asked the caninoid  running to the edge of the water .    i don t know .  i think it s dead .     robotzz can t die .     maybe this one can .  it looks like lucius .      chapter    unlearn or else    just before dawn  derec went to sleep wondering what it would feel like to know who he was .   he knew he would dream .  he would remember his dream  as always .  he often searched the imagery of his dreams for a clue to his identity  figuring that his subconscious was doubtlessly signaling him information about this most personal of all his problems .   often he dreamed he was a robot .  collectively  those dreams were always similar .  he might begin in the survival pod  or in the diagnostic hospital  or even in his sleeping quarters in the house he had had robot city provide for himself and his friends .  often he would accidentally uncover the key to perihelion  he would open a console panel  or open a cabinet  or even find it in his life suit  and he would always use it .   the destination invariably filled him with keen disappointment  or even despair  for it would always be another place where he had been during the last few weeks  subtly altered  more menacing perhaps  but always fresh in his memory .  never did he dream of a place he had been before he lost his memory .  there would be an accident   he would fall down a chasm opening up beneath his feet  a worker robot would misfunction and slice him open  or something else equally disastrous would happen .   but he would feel no pain .  there would be no blood .  he would look on his injured body  and see his skeletal structure revealed by his wound .   but not his skeletal bone .  and therein lay the serious rub .   for he would have no bones to break  no flesh to tear .  his skin would be plastic and his skeleton would be metal .  there would be blinking lights where his muscles should be  and wires instead of arteries .   and he would feel no pain  no life and death anxiety about the wound  only a calmly overwhelming urge to repair himself as quickly as possible .   at that point the dream always ended  with derec waking up in a cold sweat  staring at his hand and wondering if it just wasn t programmed to tremble at irrational fears  fears that he had always been programmed to experience  at random intervals .   he always settled back to sleep with an effort  and though not a reflective man he would invariably wonder  just for a moment  if  after you got past the obvious  there really was any difference between feeling like a human and feeling like a robot .   sometimes the same dream  or a close variation on it  would begin again .   tonight  however  as he tossed and turned  the dream was somewhat different .   not surprisingly  it began in the square .   it was night  and derec was alone .  there was not an entity in sight .  and as he looked at the slightly taller  slightly more freakish versions of the buildings around the square  he doubted there was an entity in the city .   but something was missing .  he sensed that though the square was deserted  it was even emptier than it should be .   something else should be here .  circuit breaker .  where was circuit breaker .   derec looked down to see that the plasticrete was crawling up his feet  fastening him to the spot .  there was the distinct sensation of his feet merging with the plasticrete  of the meta cells beginning to function in harmony with his biological cells .  derec held down his growing sense of panic with an effort .  he did not know which he feared more  the conclusion  or awakening before he learned what it might be .   in a matter of moments the meta cells completely smothered derec .  so thoroughly had the metallic cells mingled with his own that he did not know where they ended and where his began .   strangely  he felt himself to be wider  taller  more physically substantial in every respect .  he could not see nor move  yet found he had no yen to do either .  he had become circuit breaker itself  gathering in the energy of the starlight  transforming it  amplifying it  and casting it out .  he was stronger  sturdier  and more solid than he had ever been before .   but he had also lost his mind .  suddenly he had gone from a someone to a no one .  he didn t even miss his sense of identity .  he couldn t understand why he had wanted his memory back in the first place .  what good could thinking and knowledge do him  standing so strong and bulky against the atmospheric tides .   derec awoke gradually  a profound feeling of mental displacement aggravated him during those moments in which his mind hovered in the regions between waking and sleeping .  in fact  those moments stretched out for an uncommonly long time .  both his immediate future and immediate past seemed hopelessly out of reach .   but the future already beckoned .  he realized that for the last several moments he had been listening to a loud pounding on the door .  he recalled an appointment with annoyance .  it was too bad .  he half wished he could return to sleep .  he could certainly use it .   oh well  there s nothing i can do about it now .   he rubbed his eyes .   hold on   he said .   i ll be right there .    but the knocking continued unabated  growing progressively more insistent .  now derec was really annoyed .  the persistent knocking  if it came from a human  would be very impolite .  but robots had no choice but to be polite  regardless of the circumstances .  what kind of robot would be so obviously predisposed toward the overkill of unnecessarily persistent knocking .   derec suddenly realized .  oh no .  i d forgotten it was harry .   derec dressed hurriedly  opened the door and  sure enough  harry was standing at the threshold .   i assume i have not been knocking too long   the robot said .   i have a hundred questions to ask you .     and i ve got a few more than that to ask you   derec replied  motioning him inside   but i m afraid we ve got a limited amount of time today .     so am i to assume that you are interviewing lucius later .   asked harry .   why chat with that genius when you have me around .   then   was that good .  was it humorous .    derec tried to hide his smile .  he didn t want to encourage the robot  which didn t need it anyway .   i think you ll both prove equally important to my studies of what s been happening to robots on this planet .  did you bring your friends along .     m    and benny .  no .  they are working on a project of some sort together .  i think they want its nature to be a surprise .     and it probably will be   said derec sarcastically   if the events of the last few days have been any indication .     forgive me in advance  but was that remark also an attempt at humor .     not really  no .       i see .  you must understand it is often difficult for a robot to understand what a human s tone of voice means   said harry  again very politely .   derec decided to take the question seriously .   it was a casual observation  a commentary laced with what i presumed to be light heartedness  an attitude which frequently gives rise to humor .     it sounded sarcastic  insofar as i can comprehend these things .      did it  now .  maybe m    should be here after all .  our conversation last night was your first real contact with the human race  wasn t it .   asked derec  punching up a cup of coffee from the dispenser .    yes  and an auspicious one it was  too .         whose tone is elusive now  harry .  how long have your pathways been consumed with the objective to achieve humor .     since the replicating disaster that almost destroyed robot city  from which you saved us  thank you very much .       and since then you ve been pursuing your goal with the single mindedness characteristic of robots .     how else .         how else  indeed .  hasn t it ever occurred to you that even humor has its time and place  that the average human being simply can t bear to be around someone who answers every query or makes every casual observation with a smart remark .  it gets predictable after a while  and can cause an otherwise pleasant social situation to undergo rapid deterioration .  which is another way of saying that it gets boring .  dull .  mundane .  predictable .     it fails to elicit the proper response .     robots can t laugh   said derec cryptically  sipping his coffee .  as bitter as bile  it was exactly what his nerves cried out for .    i see you have deduced the basic conundrum in which i ve found myself since i embarked on my little project .     believe me  it s obvious .  but seriously  harry  how would you react if you were walking down the street and a manhole suddenly opened up beneath you and you fell in .     what is a manhole .  is that some kind of sexual reference .     ah  no  a manhole is an opening in the street  usually covered  through which someone can enter into a sewer or a boiler .     can you be certain there is nothing covertly sexual in those words .  i have been diligently studying the craft of the double entendre  but there is much i have yet to grasp because all i know about human sexual matters is what material the central computer calls up for me .     i must personally inspect that material as soon as possible .  but to keep to the main subject  how would you feel if you fell down a manhole .    harry almost shrugged .   i would feel like going boom .         seriously .     my logic circuits would inform me that the end was near and  knowing me  would close themselves down in an orderly fashion before i suffered the indignity of random disruption .     i see .  and how would you feel if you were walking down the street and saw me falling down a manhole .     why  logically  that should be hysterical .  unless of course you went splat before i could fulfill the demands of the first law .     hmmm .  you see  in such an eventuality  you would identify with my loss of dignity and  were you human  would relieve your anxiety by laughing .  before you rescued me  that is .  the question is  how can you relieve anxiety if you can t laugh .     everyone can agree it s funny .  that is how my comrades inform me when they believe i am on the beam .     but a comic performing jokes in front of an audience of robots can t stop his act after each joke to ask everyone if he s on the right track .     there are ways around that .  it is customary in a formal situation for robots to nod their heads if they think something is funny .  at least  that is what i am trying to convince them to do .    derec finished his coffee in a gulp and immediately punched up a second cup .   i see you ve given this some thought .     one or two .     is that an attempt at irony .         no  at a joke .     i think that for other robots to find your sense of humor worthwhile  you re going to have to think of angles that relieve their own robotic anxieties .  i m not exactly sure what those would be .  you could make fun of their foibles .  or you could write and perform skits about a robot who s so literal minded that he sometimes can t understand what s really going on around him .  some of shakespeare s characters have that trait  and they re human  but it makes sense that a robot character would exaggerate things to ludicrous lengths .     you mean a character who understands the letters of the words but not their shades of meaning .     but the audience will .  as robots  they will naturally have positronic anxieties concerning their own literal minded traits relieved by identifying with him .  he doesn t necessarily have to be sympathetic  even  he could have the kind of personality robots would love to hate  if they were capable of either emotion .     what kind of anxieties do humans have .     it s difficult for me to say .  i don t remember any humans .  i ve just read a few books .  many of shakespeare s jokes  his puns  his slapstick  have a ribald  bawdy humor that strikes me as slightly off color today  despite the gulf of the centuries between us .  so i guess it s safe to say there s always been a certain amount of sexual anxiety in human beings  and one of the ways they relieve it   or learn how to deal with it   is through humor .     harry nodded as if he understood what derec was talking about .  now  if i only felt the same  derec thought .  i m strictly on shaky ground here .    in that case  you could explain an old spacer joke to me that i have been trying to work into my act .     okay .     . your act .  .     my act .  until now i have only told jokes to my personal acquaintances   comrades who understand what i am attempting to do .  but i have been preparing a presentation for an assembly .  an act .     how many jokes do you have .       a couple .  i have failed to generate original material  so i have been investigating the vocal rhythms behind existing jokes .     to hone your timing .         yes  insofar as i comprehend what that talent includes .  there are no voice tapes for me to investigate  though the reference texts contain frequent entries on such material .      okay  harry   said derec  chuckling at the concept of all this as he folded his arms across his chest and leaned against the counter .   fire away .     with post haste  sir .  one day three men in a lifepod are coming in for a landing at the local spacedock .  they had been marooned for several days and eagerly anticipate their return to the comforts of civilization .  one man is a settler  another an auroran  and the third a solarian .    derec hid his grin with his palm .  harry s delivery was indeed awkward  and his few gestures bore little connection to what he was saying  but a solid effort was apparent .  also  the unlikely combination of the characters  derivations already promised interesting interaction .  historically  there was much social friction between the groups  aurorans and solarians both disliked the settlers because of their recent  third class  colonization of the planets  and there had never been much love lost between the aurorans and solarians  especially since the latter had mysteriously abandoned their world and vanished .  derec already made a mental note to tell ariel this one .    so the three men are just overhead the dock when suddenly a freighter s radar malfunctions and the gigantic ship crosses directly in front of their flight path .  a crash is inevitable  and the three men prepare themselves for their last moments .    a logical thing to do   said derec .  immediately  he feared that his words might have disrupted harry s rhythm  such as it was  and so resolved to remain quiet for the duration of the joke .   harry  on the other hand  continued doggedly as if nothing had happened .   all of a sudden   mere instants before the crash   all three men are bathed in a yellow light   and they disappear into thin air .    they look around and they fail to perceive their pod  the freighter  or the docks .  they are in some kind of infinite pool of blue light face to face with a strange man with a wreath of leafy twigs around his head .  the strange man has a white beard  wears burlap robes  and carries a wooden staff .  the men realize they are in the company of some kind of deity .     i am known throughout the spheres of space and time as he who points the fickle finger of fate   the man says   and i have come to point the finger at you .   and true to his word  he points at the settler and says   you shall live through the next few moments  but only if you promise never again to drink any sort of alcoholic beverage .  ever .  the moment you take a drink  regardless of how many years from now it is  you will die an instant death .  do you understand .      i do  sir   says the settler   though is it not asking much from a settler to expect him to forego the delights of alcohol for an entire lifetime .      perhaps it is   says he who   but my demand stands nonetheless .  i repeat  the instant a liquid containing alcohol touches your lips  you shall die as surely as if you had died in the crash .      then i agree   says the settler reluctantly .    and he who points to the auroran and says   you must give up all greed .          i accept .   says the auroran at once .   it s a deal .     and he who points to the solarian and says   and last  you must give up all sexual thoughts  except for those you might have strictly for purposes of socially acceptable wedded bliss .      excuse me  sir   says the solarian   but that is impossible .  do you not know what we solarians have been through .  because our centuries of social and personal repression have ended so recently  we have little choice but to think about our new freedoms  and often .     he who frowns and shakes his head .   that is no concern of mine .  the three of you have my terms .  accept them or die .      i accept it   the solarian says .    there is another flash of blinding light  and the three men find themselves standing on the ground as  in the distance  their pod crashes spectacularly into the freighter .  they all experience profound relief .  the settler wipes his forehead and says   i am ecstatic that this little episode has concluded .  look  yonder is a bar .  join me as i down some spirits by way of celebrating our good fortune .     the auroran and the solarian agree .  they both desire libation  and in addition desire to see what will happen to the settler .    indeed  the very second that the settler consumes his first drink  he dies on the proverbial spot .   leaping galaxies  the strange man was speaking the truth   says the auroran .   we must vacate these premises .     the solarian agrees enthusiastically .  but on the way out  the auroran espies a rare and valuable jewel beneath a deserted table .  the auroran cannot resist .  and just as he bends over to pick up the jewel   the solarian dies .    harry ceased talking  and the longer derec waited for the robot s next words  the more apparent it became that the joke was over .  at first he didn t understand and he had to visualize the scene and what must have happened .  the auroran bending over .  .  . the solarian breaking his word .  .  .  .   derec burst out laughing .   ha  ha .  that s pretty good .  very unpredictable .      i understand that  sir   harry said .   i realize that the narrative leads you to believe the auroran is next  but i fail to comprehend exactly what the solarian could possibly have been thinking of .  the central computer has thus far been unable to find material that would enlighten me .  would you care to explain .     no  no .  i really do believe there are some things a robot was not meant to know .     do i have your permission to ask miss ariel the same question .     not before i ask her something slightly similar .   he took harry by the arm and began leading him toward the door .   now i ve got to get you out of here .  lucius is due  and i d like to talk to him alone  if you don t mind .     sir  how could i possibly do that .   harry asked .    just a figure of speech   said derec  reaching for the doorknob .  but before he had a chance to touch it  the door opened from the other side .   ariel  her hair dripping wet and her suit clinging to her body  came running into the house .   there you are .   she exclaimed .    don t you ever knock .   derec asked angrily  then calmed down when he realized something serious was the matter .  besides  of course she didn t have to knock .  she lived here  too .   are you all right .     yes  of course .  wolruf and i found  ah .  .  .  .         well .  out with it .   exclaimed derec .    i was at the reservoir this morning   she said haltingly .   uh  i was in the reservoir  and i felt something strange .  it was lucius .  his positronic brain had been partially destroyed .     what did you say .   asked derec as the room began to spin .    lucius has been deliberately sabotaged .  to the utmost degree .  you might even say he s been murdered .     ridiculous   said harry calmly .   only an outsider would have committed such a deed  and that s impossible .  the city would have responded to an alien presence .     not necessarily   said derec  thinking of doctor avery  who kept an office here  and whose arrival surely would not activate the city s automatic warning devices .    it s no accident   said ariel firmly .   i think you ll agree .  wolruf is supervising the robots who are bringing the  ah  body over here .  then you ll both see for yourselves .     one of you must know more   said harry .   a robot would not willingly harm another robot .  only you two and the alien are suspects .    derec rubbed his chin thoughtfully .   no  there is no law actually dictating that a robot shall not do violence to another robot .  in fact  a robot would have no choice if he truly believed harm would come to a human as a result of his omission of action .   he glanced at ariel .   where s mandelbrot .  wolruf .     supervising the robots carrying the body here   she said .    harry  please leave immediately .  we ll finish our talk later .         all right   said the robot  walking through the door .   though i feel obligated to warn you  you have not perceived my presence for the last time .     is that robot for real .   asked ariel after it was gone .    i m afraid so   derec replied .   are you certain that we re dealing with a deliberate case of deactivation here   not an accident of some sort .     no   but  derec  lucius s face was struck in several places .  it certainly looked deliberate to me  as if someone wanted to ensure it couldn t be identified .     which is impossible  because most of its parts contain serial numbers  which can be traced .     exactly .  so whoever did it must have realized that in mid act and then thrown lucius in the reservoir in the hope that it wouldn t be found .  or  if it was found  it d be so rusty that most of the serial numbers would be obscured .     and unless we ve an unidentified intruder   which seems unlikely   a robot was responsible .     amazing  isn t it .    derec nodded .    absolutely .  what were you doing in the reservoir .    ariel blushed  though derec couldn t tell if it was from anger or embarrassment .   i was taking a swim .     fully dressed .  say  you ve been losing weight  haven t you .   he asked  looking her over with wide eyes .    you ll never know .  derec  how can you be flip at a time like this .  to lose lucius       so early in his career  i know .  the galaxy has been robbed of a great artist  i fear .  tragic .  simply tragic .  i have to laugh  ariel .  it s the only way i can deal with it  and right now i don t care if you understand or not .  now be quiet and let me think .    ariel blinked in surprise  and jerked her head back as if he had taken a swipe at her .  but she did as he wished .   derec stared at the wall and tried to remember when he and mandelbrot had parted company with lucius .  there had been a few hours remaining until the dawn .  had lucius said anything about where it was going or what it was going to do .  nothing in particular that derec could recall  just that it was going to close down for a few hours before beginning work on its next project .  no  there wouldn t be any clues  lucius certainly couldn t have predicted or even suspected that it would be murdered .   hmm  can you call the shutdown of a robot  murder   .  derec asked himself .  or is murder too strong a word to use when talking about a machine  regardless of its level of sophistication .   a few moments later  however  derec realized he wasn t ruminating on the incident so much as he was repressing a profound sense of outrage .  during their few hours together  lucius had begun to mean something special to him .  true  there was the possibility that he was overreacting because of his already well established affinity for robots  but throughout his short life that he could remember  he had demonstrated a special appreciation for intelligent life in all its manifestations .   lucius was a robot  derec thought .  but i fear i shall never see its like again .   derec realized after the fact that he had paraphrased a line from shakespeare s hamlet .  this reminded him of the promise he had made to lucius  and he mulled over the implications of this promise for long minutes after mandelbrot and wolruf had escorted the robots carrying lucius inside  after they had lain lucius on a table .  evidently mandelbrot or ariel must have ordered the robots to depart  because derec never recalled giving such an order .   for a while  as he looked at the battered and distorted face  derec hoped he would discover that it was a dreadful mistake  that it really wasn t lucius there after all  but some other robot .  but the size was right .  the model was right .  the color was right .  the unique identifying features that all city robots possessed to some degree were right .  but most of all  the feeling in derec s gut was right .   lucius was indeed dead .  murdered .  the logic circuits of its positronic brain had been removed with precision .  but the personality integrals had been left in the brain cavity  left to be permanently damaged in the reservoir .  so lucius s unique abilities at logic might still exist  but the interaction between brain and body would probably never again be achieved .  the personality was gone forever .    excuse me  everyone   derec said  actually aware that his friends were staring at him  waiting for his reaction .   i d like to be alone with lucius for a few moments .    and then  after they had left  derec cried .  he cried in pity and remorse  not for lucius  but for himself .  this was the first time he could remember having cried .  when he finished  he felt only marginally better  but he had some idea of what he had to do  and who to look to for an answer .     derec found the ebony at the place he had come to think of as circuit breaker square .  other robots of various models and intelligence levels stood around the building  watching its colors reflect the sunlight in muted shades .  occasionally  reflections thrown off by the smooth planes glittered against the robots and the other buildings .  the overall effect of circuit breaker was more restrained in the sunlight .  doubtlessly that  too  had been part of lucius s plan  to permit the building to become controllable and hence  safer  in the day  while the night unleashed its true energies .  he would have to find out upon what principle the solar batteries worked .   that was another question lucius would no longer be able to answer personally  however interesting it was on the purely scientific level  it did not seem especially important in light of recent events .   the ebony stood at the edge of the perimeter .  its head never turned to the building  it was watching the other robots instead  as if it was searching for some meaning in their activity .  or lack of it  as the case was .  the ebony stood straight and tall  with barely a nuance derec could call remotely human .  it was easy for him to imagine a black cape hanging from the ebony s shoulders  easier still to imagine it standing on a hilltop and glaring in defiance at a gathering storm .   blow wind .  and crack your cheeks  derec thought  recalling a line from king lear .   trying his best to look casual  as if he were simply taking a stroll  derec walked to the ebony and said   excuse me  but didn t i see you here last night .     it is possible  master   replied the ebony  bowing its head and shoulders slightly as if to take note of the human s presence for the first time .    with all the other robots .     i was in the square  but my circuits do not acknowledge the fact that i was with the other robots .     i see by your insignia and model that you are a supervisor robot .     that is true .     exactly what are your duties .   derec asked casually .   with an almost stately turn of its head  the ebony turned toward circuit breaker and waited until the length of the silence between them became quite long   deliberately  for a kind of dramatic effect  it seemed to derec .  an answer was intended  but so was a space of waiting .  derec began to get a seriously queasy feeling in his stomach .   finally  the ebony said   my duties are floating .  i am programmed to ascertain what needs to be done and then to do it or otherwise see to it .     all of this is up to your discretion .     i am a duly designated rogue operative .  the city requires a certain amount of random checks if it is to run at peak efficiency .  if a machine breaks down gradually  the supervisor on the spot might not notice because it is there during every tour of duty .  it would get used to the situation  would not even realize something was amiss  whereas i  with my extra keen memory banks and an eye capable of perceiving individual levels of meta cells  would notice it immediately .     once you actually look at the problem  that is .     of course .  i doubt even a human can fix a machine before he knows if and where it has been broken .      don t underestimate us .     i shall strive not to .  do not think  sir  that my sole function is to act as mechanical troubleshooter .  my tasks vary  depending upon the situation .  often central calls on me to provide visual and cognitive assistance if there is some problem with robotic efficiency   not that my comrades ever function at less than their peak  but because sometimes they cannot be certain that they are directing their energies to the best advantage of all .     so you re a problem solver .  you help devise solutions to the unforeseen shortcomings in central s program .    derec leaned against a building and saw circuit breaker weave back and forth like a balloon hung up in a breeze .  he felt like someone had hit him on the back of the skull with a lug wrench .  his lungs felt like paper .  his ankles felt like the bones had turned into rubber putty .  at first he was too stunned to loathe the ebony  but that feeling grew and grew  as he leaned there and tried to get his thoughts straight .   this robot has got to make decisions  derec thought .  the very nature of its job calls for analytical creativity .  it could have viewed circuit breaker as so revolutionary to the robotic psyche that it constituted an obstacle to the laborers  duties .  and then .  .  . then the ebony would have been forced to do something about lucius .   there s nothing in the three laws about a robot being forbidden to harm another robot .  in fact .  first law situations and second law orders may require it .   this is not proof  though .   for a moment derec wondered what he would do once he had the proof .  he would have to keep the ebony   or whichever robot the murderer was   functional for a time until the mechanics as well as the psychology had been checked for anomalies .  the question of what came next would have to be decided after all the facts were in .  it was possible that the ebony couldn t help itself .   just as it was also possible that the three laws had been a significant factor  that once the ebony had embarked on a course of logic  it had followed it rigorously to an end predestined for tragedy .    tell me   derec said  making an effort to stand up straight   do you ever take the initiative when it comes to identifying problems .     if you mean can i pinpoint a potential glitch before central is aware  then the answer is yes .  those occasions  however  are quite rare and often quite obvious .     they re obvious if you re not central .         sir .     and do you ever take the initiative in solving problems .     i have  and central has had to fine tune them  too .         but not all the time .     i see i must be exact about this .  central has only fine tuned three out of forty seven of my solutions .  have i satisfied you so far with my answers  sir .     forty seven .  that s a lot of problems  and those are only the ones you found on your own .     robot city is young  sir .  there will doubtlessly be many glitches in the system before the city is operating at one hundred percent efficiency .     and you re certainly going to do your bit  aren t you .         i can do nothing else  sir .    derec nodded .   i see .  by the way  what s your name .         canute .     tell me  canute  how would you rate efficiency wise   a robot that deliberately took it upon itself to disconnect a comrade  .     sir  it would have to be seriously examined .  though of course it is possible that the first or second law would permit such an action .    .    are you aware that someone  presumably a robot  brutally disconnected lucius last night .  damaged him beyond all hope of repair .     of course i am aware .  news travels fast over the comlink .     so you heard about it from other robots first .     sir  why not ask me outright if i was the robot responsible .  you know i am forbidden to lie .    canute s words were like a bucket of cold water thrown into derec s face .  their forthrightness startled him .   i   i   how did you know i was leading up to that .     it seemed obvious from your line of questioning .         i see you have advanced deductive abilities .         it is a prerequisite for my line of work .    hmmm .  i think you just may be the kind of robot i need  derec thought .  putting aside his feelings for lucius with a force of will  he thought of ariel  and of the possibility that canute  who made its intuitive leaps from a solidly practical framework  would be just the one to help him diagnose and cure her disease .  once its mental frames of reference could be adjusted  that is .   the trick would be to get it to readjust   to admit the gravity of its error   without causing positronic burnout in the process .  for in that eventuality  canute wouldn t be able to repair a paper clip .   so the direct approach was out .  besides  derec had a promise to keep .    canute  you may find this hard to believe  but i ve been looking for a model like you .     sir .     yes  i have a specific type of building in mind that i d like to see erected nearby .  i d also like it as permanent as possible .  i think its presence will do much to enrich life here in robot city .     then i am eager to do whatever you ask .  what type of building did you have in mind .     an open air theatre   a playhouse .  i ll give you the details later  but i want to see functional elaboration in the design .  i want you to generate your notions of some of the details .  in fact  i insist on it .  understand .     yes   said canute  lowering its head slightly .   may i ask why you want to have a theatre erected .     have you ever heard of hamlet .      chapter    the world of the play    canute was right about one thing  news travels fast at comlink speed .  returning from circuit breaker square to his quarters  derec hadn t even gotten through the door before mandelbrot began talking .    master  where have you been .  i have been besieged by requests to assist you in your latest project .  i fear that  lacking sufficient information  i was forced to tell everyone to wait .  i hope that was all right .     it was   said derec  lying down on the couch .   where s ariel .     she went to her room .  she mumbled something about mopping up on her shakespeare .     i think you mean brushing up .         if you say so .     you re not very comfortable with human idioms  are you  mandelbrot .     i can be neither comfortable nor uncomfortable conversing with them .  but i take you to mean it is sometimes difficult for me to translate their peculiar surface meanings in practical terms .  for instance  how do you brush up someone who is ancient history .  in that respect  i do sometimes have problems communicating .  but about this project .  .  .  .     all right  i ll tell you .  but wait   where s wolruf .         with miss ariel .  i think wolruf is performing some task .  forgive me if i am again misphrasing it  but she is being miss ariel s line coach .     ssh .  quiet .  listen .    and derec heard  very softly  through the closed door  ariel speaking the words   oh  what a noble mind is here o erthrown .  the courtier s  soldier s  scholar s  eye  tongue  sword  the expectancy and rose of the fair state  the glass of fashion and the mould of form  the observed of all observers  is  er  ah       kwei it   said wolruf in a low volume that wasn t hushed enough to be called a whisper  but was probably as close to one as she could manage .    quite  quite down .   ariel finished enthusiastically .    hmm  it seems my second bit of casting is almost complete   said derec .    casting  master .   said mandelbrot .   you are having a cast made .  have you injured yourself .     no  not at all   derec replied  laughing .    i must say  it seemed you were hiding your suffering awfully well .     it s my hobby .  listen  tell me what you would do with the robot that dismantled lucius .   the sudden shock of the image of the robot lying there  behind the closed door to his office  sent a tremor of loss and grief through derec s veins .  and of terror  too .  he d never before thought robots were things that could die .  he d always assumed they were immortal in a way that life could never be .    forgive me  master  but i would think nothing of it .  i would merely follow your instructions .     and what if i wasn t around to give you instructions .  what if you had to decide when you were on your own .     first  i would solicit the robot s explanation  and learn of any justifications for its actions  if any  it may have had  particularly as they involved its interpretation of the three laws .     but there is no law against a robot harming another robot .     of course  and the robot in question may have been operating on instructions from a human .  but i gather such is not the case here .         well  yes .  .  .         so after having received the explanation  i would take the safest course and have the robot closed down until the proper repairs could be administered  or until instructions could be received from human sources .     that could take a long time  particularly here on robot city .     no harm would be done .  upon reactivation  if that is what is decided upon  the robot would behave as if it had just been shut down for a tune up the day before .     hmm .  but what if there was something you needed from the robot .     then that would depend on what you needed  and how badly you needed it .     i m glad you feel that way  not that you can feel  i know  but it makes me feel better to know your logic circuits concur with some of this .  .  .   and he explained to mandelbrot his theory that a creative robot with a scientific bent might be able to make a diagnostic breakthrough to help ariel .    but how do you know that canute possesses scientific talents .     i don t .  but i may be able to use its mind to help me learn more about what s happening to the robots in this place .  and i need to do it   to get canute to admit to its error without drifting out in the process .  that s one reason why i m putting on this play .     this play .     hamlet .  by william shakespeare .  quiet  listen .    ariel s voice came through the door  muffled but quite clear as she repeated and then continued the speech she had rehearsed earlier  this time in louder  more confident cadences .   and i of ladies most deject and wretched  that suck d the honey of his music vows  now see that noble and most sovereign reason  like sweet bells jangled  out of tune and harsh .     isn t that beautiful .   derec gushed .    the words  master  or miss ariel saying them .         have you been talking to harry .     master  i do not understand your implication .     never mind .  anyway  i m going to use this playas a lightning rod  to draw every robot with creative tendencies to the same place  working on a group project  and then see what develops .  i don t know what s going on here  but whatever it is  i m going to bust it wide open .    someone knocked on the door .   get that  will you .   derec asked as he turned toward ariel s office .   ariel .  this is your director speaking .  come out here  will your   ariel came out in a flash  followed by a bounding wolruf .   director .   she said .   then who s going to be my leading man  .     oh .  when you found out about this production  how did you know you were going to be ophelia .     because clearly i possess all the mental and physical qualifications .  who better to playa girl who s going insane than one who really is .  of course  i don t know who s going to play hamlet s mother  but that s not my problem  is it .    at least she s keeping her sense of humor about things  derec thought .   no   it s your director s   and your leading man s .    ariel grinned and bowed .   at your service  mr .  director .     master       yes  mandelbrot .     forgive the intrusion  master derec and mistress ariel  but harry  benny  and m    are at the door .  they said they had vibes to present to you .     vibess .   said wolruf .   not ni ice word on my would .     yes  but who knows what it means here   said ariel .   send them in  mandelbrot .     yes  i suppose we have to begin interviewing for our cast and crew sooner than later   said derec .   in walked the three robots  each carrying brass objects .  each object struck derec as being rather strange .  m    held a tube with two dozen keys  with what appeared to be a mouthpiece on one end .  it was evidently a wind instrument  though what sort of sound it was supposed to make  derec had no way of imagining .   nor did he know what sort of sounds he might expect from the other two instruments held by the other two robots .  benny s was smaller than m    s  and could be easily held in one hand  there were three taps on the top  presumably to modulate the sonic textures .  harry s was the straightest and the longest of the three  it had a sliding device that evidently would lengthen or shorten the tubing to match the player s will  again presumably to modulate the sound .    good day  sir   said benny .   we can only presume we are interrupting your preparations       good grief  word travels fast around here .   ariel exclaimed .    you found out  didn t you .   said derec .  ariel shrugged .   i heard it from wolruf .     and how did you hear about it  wolruf .   derec asked .   wolruf merely shrugged .  the effort made her entire body quiver .       and so we thought you might want to see for yourself the results of a project we have been devoting ourselves to instead of closing down in our spare time   finished benny  as if no one else had spoken .    ah  and what is the nature of this project .   derec asked suspiciously .    originally it was purely musical   said benny .    but when we heard you were planning to engage us in a recreation of human art forms  we performed research and discovered that music was often a significant part of such functions   said harry .    that struck us as being particularly fortuitous   said m    .   we thought   perhaps presumptuously  but how could we tell if we refrained from inquiring .    that our music might make a significant contribution to the enterprise .     uh  what kind of music are we attempting here  with those things .   ariel asked .    auroran nouveau fugues .  tantorian ecto variations .     something close to period  terran style   said harry .    you mean from earth .   ariel asked incredulously .  terran culture was not held in high regard in most spacer circles .    shakespeare was from earth   put in derec mildly .    yes  but he was lucky enough to be talented   said ariel .   you can t say that about most terran artists .     perhaps you judge our aspirations too harshly   said benny .    yes  you should judge after you hear us play   said m    .    yes  you should have plenty of critical ammunition then   said harry .   ariel stared at derec .   it was a joke   derec said .    close to bein  good one .   said wolruf .   the three robots then magnetically applied computerized  flexible  artificial lips to their speaker grills .  the lips were connected by electrical cords that led into the positronic cavities  and derec saw at once  by the way the robots exercised the lips and blew air through them  that they responded directly to thought control .   just like real lips  thought derec  biting his lower one as if to make sure .   excuse me  but before you boys strike up the brass  i d like to know what names those instruments are supposed to have .     this is a trumpet   said benny .    a saxophone   said m    .    and a trombone   said harry .    and by way of further introduction   said benny   the number we would like to assault for your aural perusal is an ancient composition dating not four hundred years later than shakespeare s time .  this was already during the age of recorded music  but no tapes are currently available through central  so we can only surmise the manner in which these instruments were played by examining the sheet music .      what there is of it   said harry .   most of this number is improvised .     uh oh .   said ariel to herself  putting her hand protectively on her forehead .   i must be having a delirium .     and the number we would like to assault is what the reference tapes denote as  in the parlance of the day  a snappy little ditty .  this song its composer  the human known as duke ellington  called  bouncing buoyancy .     i ve got a bad feeling about this  derec thought .  he waved his hand .   play on  mcduffs .    the robots did .  at least  that s what the humans and the alien thought they were trying to do .  the musical form was so radically unlike anything they d experienced  the playing so haphazard and odd  so full of accidental spurts and sputters and stops  that exactly what the robots were attempting to do remained a matter of some conjecture .   benny s trumpet played the lead with a blaring succession of notes that occasionally struck the ear as being just right .  the noise the instrument made resembled the wail of a siren  recorded backwards .  so high was its frequency that derec became afraid his ears would begin bleeding .  benny s notes  on the other hand  did seem to possess some kind of internal logic  as if he knew where he was going but wasn t quite sure how to get there .   harry on the trombone and m    on the saxophone attempted to provide benny with a solid foundation  awkwardly  they tooted eight measures of unchanging harmony  over and over again .  they nearly succeeded  harmony wise  and perhaps their glitches wouldn t have been so noticeable if they d occasionally managed to start and end the eight measures at the same time .   the trombone itself tended to sound like an exquisitely crafted raspberry  surreally brayed from the mouth of a contemptuous donkey .  the saxophone s sonic attack  meanwhile  resembled nothing so much as a gaggle of geese gurgling underwater .  the effect of the three instruments combined was such that derec wondered momentarily if the robot hadn t come up with a violation of an interplanetary weapons treaty .   derec spent the first minute finding the music absolutely atrocious  utterly without redeeming social value .  it was the worse kind of noise  that is  noise pretending to be something else .  but gradually he began to perceive  vaguely  the equally vague ideal in the robots  minds .  the music itself  regardless of the manner of its playing  possessed a single minded joy that quickly became infectious .  derec discovered that his toe was tapping in a rhythm akin to that of the music .  ariel was nodding thoughtfully .  wolruf had her head cocked inquisitively  and mandelbrot was his usual inscrutable self .   derec s mind wandered a second  and he wondered if he could rig up a specimen of those liplike fixtures on the mouths to help robots portray human emotions during the production .  the fact that most had immobile faces  incapable of even rudimentary expression  was going to cripple the illusion unless he devised some way to use the very inflexibility to greater effect .  he imagined a set of lips twisted in laughter at the play s cavorting actors  and in fear of the ghost of hamlet s father  and in anguish at the sight of all the dead bodies littering the stage .  well  it s a thought  he figured  and then returned his attention to the music .   the arrangement of  bouncing buoyancy  concluded with all three instruments playing the main theme simultaneously .  theoretically .  the robots took the mouthpieces from their lips with a flourish and held out the instruments toward their audience .   derec and ariel looked at one another .  her expression read you re the director  you do the talking .    how did our number bludgeon you  master .   asked benny .    uh  it was certainly unusual .  i think i see what you robots are trying to get at  and i think i may like it if you actually get there .  don t you agree  ariel .     oh  yes  definitely .   she was really saying i seriously doubt it .    iss it ham lit .   wolruf asked .    that  i don t know   said derec .   i suppose this ellington fellow composed other works  though .     in a variety of styles and moods   said benny   all adaptable to our instruments   said harry .    i was afraid of that   derec said .   but don t worry .  i m sure you ll improve with practice .  i take it this has been your secret project  benny .    benny bowed in a manner curiously appreciative for a robot .   i personally crafted the instruments and taught my friends what knowledge i had concerning the art of blowing horns .     take off those lips  will you .  they re just too weird .    as the robots complied  mandelbrot said   master  this performance .  where will it take place .  i do not believe the city has theatrical facilities .     don t worry .  i ve got it taken care of .  i know just the robot who can design us a theatre perfectly suited for the denizens of robot city .  only he doesn t know about it yet .      and who is that  master .     canute .  who else .   derec smiled .   in fact  get me canute .  have him come here right away .  i want him to hear some of this  bouncing buoyancy  brew .       each age has different terrors and tensions   said derec a few days later on the stage of the new globe   but they all open on the same abyss .    he paused to see what effect his words had on the robots sitting in the chairs before the proscenium .  he had thought his words exceedingly profound  but the robots merely stared back at him as though he had recounted the symbols of a meaningless equation  interesting only because a human had happened to say it .   he cleared his throat .  sitting in seats off to the side of the robots were ariel and mandelbrot .  ariel had a notebook in hand  but mandelbrot  whom derec had appointed property master  naturally had no need of one  his total recall would keep track of the production s prop specifications without notes .   wolruf sat licking her paw in a chair just behind the pair .  she had insisted on being the official prompter  or line coach  and as such had already spent a lot of time prompting derec and ariel while they were memorizing their lines   a task that he feared  in his own case  was far from completed .   derec cleared his throat again .  his awkwardness showed   at least if the knowing smile ariel directed toward him was any indication .  wolruf just licked her chops  he got the feeling that on an unspoken level  she was finding the shenanigans of humans and robots incredibly amusing .    hmmm .  you re all familiar with the studies some of you have been making concerning the laws of humanics .  that means you re also familiar  at least in passing  with the many peculiarities and contradictions of the human condition .  passion and madness  obsession and nihilism   these things don t exist among you robots  but it s something we humans have to deal with  in varying degrees  every day .    shortly  we shall boldly go where no robot has gone before .  we shall descend into the dense  dark  deep  decrepit abyss of the thirst for revenge  and when we emerge  we ll have something   something   something really terrific to remember in the days ahead .  it ll be swell .  you ll see .     get on with it .   ariel shouted .    forgive me  master  but it is my considered opinion that you should get on to the more theatrical matters   piped in mandelbrot .  in an effort to appear natural  he had crossed his legs and held his palms on his knee .  he succeeded only in appearing like a bunch of plywood pounded together with rusty nails .    it s all right  mandelbrot   said derec  feeling his face flush .   i m just getting warmed up .   returning his attention to the robots  he could not fail to notice their posture was every bit as stiff as his robot friday s .  for a brief instant  he wondered what in the world am i doing here .  steeled himself  and promptly got on with it .   theatre is an art that depends upon the work of many collaborators     he began .   here was the new globe theatre  designed by the robot canute and built under its personal supervision .  by following the leads of clues in the central computer that lucius had left when it had used its programs  canute was able to tell the city what to build and how long it should stand .  meaning that canute had done pretty much what lucius had done  but acting under orders from a human .   while supervising this aspect of his project  derec realized it was possible that lucius had  in turn  followed leads suggested by derec s establishment of automats in one building out of every ten .  but of course derec would never know for certain .    perhaps the task has been easier  less taxing for canute because  unlike lucius  he had had a pattern to follow  that of the old globe theatre in the london  earth  of shakespeare s day .  but he had added his own specifications  without derec s prompting .  he had attempted to ascertain the special problems of form and function and how they either augmented or conflicted with his sense of how a theatre should fit in esthetically with the environment of robot city .   derec had pointedly refrained from telling canute why the ebony  of all the robots in the city  had been appointed to design the second permanent building of robot city .  and he had watched canute carefully while giving instructions  to see if it was in danger of positronic drift for doing  derec suspected  exactly what it had harmed another robot for doing .   but canute had given no such evidence .  all that was needed to satisfy it  apparently  was for the impetus to come from human instructions .   like the old globe  canute s theatre was roughly cylindrical in shape  but it was also misshapen and bent  like a bar of metal that had been slightly melted on the ground  then twisted beneath a giant foot .  like the old globe   or at least according to most of the conjectures that had been made about it after it had been torn down to make room for a row of tenements a few decades after shakespeare s death   there were three trap doors in the stage  leading to different areas backstage .  one backstage passage led as well to the city s underground conduits  in case there was a power problem .   there were both a gallery and an upper gallery above the stage  and several hidden cameras in the wings .  the rows of seats were staggered to provide each patron with an unobstructed view of the proceedings .  continuing the effort of providing the audience with the best possible lines of sight  the floor was raised and leveled in a series of gradual steps .   and  in the tradition of modem concert venues  tremendous screens for close up shots were hung above the stage .  microphones were concealed throughout the stage and galleries .   even the size of the threatre was impressive .  the angles of the design provided for a variety of possible dramatic effects .  but it was canute s choice of colors that really made the new globe something to shout about over the hyperwave .  on the jet black ceiling  sparkles wavered in and out of focus like stars seen through a haze of heat .  the carpet and seats were in gray brown tones  variations of the colors found in the conduits and on the surface of the city   canute s version of  earth tones .   the curtain was a flaming crimson that sparkled  too  and the walls were a soft  demure shade of white .  the soft currents of the air conditioning system continuously rippled the curtains .   robots naturally had no need of air conditioning  giving derec the impression that canute had designed the theatre not only for robots  but for humans as well .  as if the ebony had designed the theatre in the secret  perhaps unrecognized hope that one day a play for an audience of humans would be presented here .   the subconscious hope .    as robots  you are constitutionally incapable of telling a lie   derec said to his unresponsive audience .   only human beings can do that  though not always successfully .  theatre  however  is a world of pretense  provoking the collaborative activity of the spectator s imagination .  the spectator must be ready  willing  and able to believe in the lie of fiction  in the hopes of finding amusement  and  perhaps  some enlightenment .  our job is to assist him  to make him want to believe the lie .    on the shakespearean stage  little was shown  but everything was signified .  speech  action  prop  setting   all worked together toward the common end of providing the viewer a window through which he could look on the world .  and if all the efforts of the cast and crew were successful  then the viewer  knowing that what he was seeing was a fabrication  willingly suspended his disbelief  choosing to believe for the moment that what he was seeing was real for the purpose of relating to the story .    our challenge is different .  we must aid  force  and agitate robots to exercise their logic integrals in such a way that the integrals  too  become suspended .  we must not only provide a window to the world  but to the heart of man   as i understand it  there are three worlds which must be considered for every production .  that s the world of the play  the world of the playwright  and the world of the production .  i think we can all agree on what the world of the production is  r d like to say a few words about the other two worlds .     are you going to perform this play   or talk it to death .   ariel called out mischievously .   derec laughed nervously .  she had thrown him off his rhythm  and he forgot what he had planned to say next .    the world of the playwright   mandelbrot prompted helpfully .    okay .  in our time  mankind has achieved  more or less  an utterly civilized life .  few men ever break the laws of man .  most people live long  healthy lives  even on overpopulated earth  where conditions aren t too terrific .    but in shakespeare s day  life was often less a gift to be savored than it was a bagatelle to be endured .  working conditions were brutal and difficult  education was nonexistent except for the privileged classes  and the scientific way of thinking   based on logical thinking with empirical proof backing it up   was only beginning its ascendancy .  most people died before they were thirty five  thanks to war  pestilence  persecution  lousy hygiene  things of that nature .  after all  queen elizabeth i of england  the ruler of shakespeare s day  was considered odd because she took a bath once a month  whether she needed it or not .  but   yes  what is it .   derec asked  noting that a robot sitting near canute in the front had tentatively raised its hand .    most humble  abject  piteous apologies tendered for this untimely interruption   said the robot   but after having read the text and pondered its meanings for several hours  i find myself unhappily fixated on a problem of overwhelming significance  and it s reasonable for me to trust that only a human being can explain it adequately .     of course .  i welcome any question .          even one of a subjective nature .         naturally .     even .  one that may in some quarters be considered too impolite for normal social intercourse .     of course .  shakespeare was a missionary in opening up the realms of terran discussion for centuries .     even if the question is personal .    without trying to be obvious about it  derec glanced down at his crotch to see if his zipper was up .   why  uh  sure .  we re going to have some pretty complex motivations in basic human drives to examine here .     even if the question may be extremely personal .         what .     is that a direct order .     no  it s a direct question  but you can take it as an order if only it will get you to come out with it .     excellent .  for a moment i was afraid my capacitors would not permit me utterance if i was not buoyed by the added impetus of a direct order .     would you please tell me what s on your mind .     i know that the human male and female tend to have different surface contours  and that this difference has something to do with their frequently complex social interaction  and so my question is simply this  just what is it that the human male and female seem to be doing to each other in all their spare time .    a stony silence echoed throughout the theatre .  derec s focus wavered  and the gentle hum of the air conditioning went through a progression of hypnotic wah wahs  as if it had been filtered in a recording studio .  he shot ariel a questioning glance .  she smiled and shrugged .  he looked at wolruf .   she shook her head .   don  look a  me .  we have no matin  cuss oms .  jus  do it and done be .     i seriously doubt it   derec snapped back .  he happened to glance stage left just as harry  holding the trombone  stuck its head from the wings .  benny and m     also holding their instruments  stood behind harry and gestured as if to grab the robot by the shoulders and pull it back .   they evidently thought better of it though  and permitted harry to say   mister director  i believe i can shake some illumination on the situation .    derec bowed  and gestured him onto the stage .   be my guest .    but as harry quickly walked out and stood before the audience of robots  derec suddenly got a sinking sensation in his stomach .   uh  harry  this isn t another one of your jokes  is it .     i believe it shall prove instructive .         all right .  i know when i m beat .   derec moved away to stand between ariel and wolruf .   harry did not even look at the humans before commencing .  he concentrated his gaze on the robots .   an axiom of carbon based life forms is that nature has intended them to reproduce .  not necessarily on schedule  not necessarily when it s convenient  not necessarily prettily  but well .  if the life form in question derives a certain amount of gratification in the act of reproducing  that is well and good as far as the life form is concerned  but all nature cares about is the reproductive urge .  some visual data is available from central  and i suggest you study it at your leisure  so we can all understand what chemical reactions are driving ophelia and hamlet while the latter is putting aside the pleasures of the moment to gain his crown .   harry nodded at derec .   you see  i have read the play already .   then  back to the audience    and so that you might understand the dark  innermost depths of the urge  i must direct your attention to the early days of mankind s colonization of the planets  in the days before he had truly accepted robots as his faithful companions  in the days when the wars of earth  with their nuclear missiles and space based defense systems  had followed man to the stars .  in those days  military bases on newly colonized planets were common  and generally they were positioned at points remote from the civilian installations   and  in those days  the sexes were often segregated  so it was not unusual for a hundred or so men to find themselves alone in remote  desolate lands  waiting for battles that never came  waiting for the day when they could once again delight in female companionship and discharge themselves of the urges building up during their isolation .  building .  building .  building .  ever building .    so what did the men do about sex .  they thought about it  they talked about it  and they dreamed about it .  some of them even did something about it .    the exact nature of that something  as fate would have it  was uppermost in the mind of one general dazelle  for it was a problem that he  too  would encounter while serving out his new assignment as commander of base hoyle .  the general was a meticulous person who liked everything shipshape  and so upon his arrival to this remote military installation  he insisted the attach   take him on an immediate tour of the premises .    the general was quite pleased with the barracks  the battlements  and the base as a whole  but he became quite distressed when he and the attach   turned a corner and saw hitched up to a post the sorriest  most pathetic  swaybacked  fly infested old mare in the history of mankind .   what   what is that    .   the general asked .     that is a mare   said the attach   .      and why is it here  .  why is it not stuffed and standing out in the field  scaring away the hawks and crows .      because the men need it  sir   said the attach   .      need it .  what could they possibly need it for .       well  as you know  sir  the nearest civilian settlement is over a hundred kilometers away .      yes .      and you know that  for security reasons  the only means of travel permitted for enlisted men between here and there is strictly bipedal .      yes  but i fail to see what any of that has to do with that failed genetic experiment .      well  then  surely you also know that men must be men .  they have needs  you know .  needs that must be tended to .     the general looked in horror at the mare .  he could not believe what he was hearing .  the information was in grave danger of causing him severe psychological harm .   you mean  the men   they   with that old mare .     the attach   nodded gravely .   yes .  the urge builds up .  there is nothing else they can do .     the general was on the verge of hyperventilating .  he became so dizzy that he had to steady himself by leaning on the attach   .   on my honor as a soldier   said the general   i will never become that desperate .     but as his tour of duty wore on  the urge built and built  until one day he had no choice but to admit he was exactly that desperate .  finally he could take it no more  and he said to the attach     bring the mare to my quarters at once .      to your quarters .   the attach   asked  evidently a little confused over something .     yes  to my quarters   said the general .   you remember what you said  about the men   and the mare .      yes  sir .   said the attach    saluting .    the attach   did as he was told .  by now the mare was  if anything  a mere shadow of her former decrepit self .  recently she had fallen off a cliff  and had been lucky to survive with only mildly crippling injuries  and her body had been ravaged by disease .  so the attach   was quite horrified  stunned to the core of his being  in fact  when the general took off his trousers and began to have his  v ay with the pathetic beast .     sir .  .   exclaimed the attach     what are you doing .      is it not obvious what i am doing  sir .   said the general .   just as the men do .      sir  i fail to grasp your meaning   said the attach   .   never  never have i seen such a sight .      but  but  you said the men   their urges   and the  mare .  .  .     sir  the men have their urges  it is true  but i meant that when the urges become too much for them  they climb on top of the mare and ride her to the nearest settlement .     there .  does that make everything clearer .   finished harry .    wha  is he talkin  abou  .   mumbled wolruf .    now i m totally confused   whispered derec .   at least his narrative technique is improving .    ariel  meanwhile  couldn t stop laughing .   that   is the   silliest   thing i ve ever heard   she said between breaths .   harry remained in place on the stage as he awaited his audience s verdict .  the robots had greeted the end of the joke with a kind of stony silence that only metal could summon .  to a one  they stared straight ahead at harry for several moments .   then the robot that had asked the question that prompted the joke turned to its comrade on the right and said   yes  that makes sense .     i understand   said another .    as translucent as a gong   said a third .    mysterious  absolutely mysterious   said canute .   the ebony was in the minority  however  as most of the robots seemed to be satisfied with harry s explanation .   derec waited for ariel to stop laughing and asked her   just what do you think is going on here .    she turned toward him  took him by the arm  and whispered in a conspiratorial tone   the robots are beginning to learn about the world of man the way we do   through jokes .     that does not compute   replied derec .    hmm .  let me put it this way .  when you re growing up on aurora in the schools  one of the great mysteries in life is what s commonly known as the birds and bees .     yes  i know that phrase  but i don t recall how i learned about it .     that s because you have amnesia .  now  listen  while we received a lot of classroom instruction in the scientific sense  we still had certain .  .  . anxieties .  you don t remember yours  but you ve probably still got a lot .  not that i m being personal or anything  it s just a fact .     thank you .  go on .       and one of the ways we kids relieved ourselves of our anxieties  and found out a little bit about reality  was through the artistic vehicle known throughout the galaxy as the dirty joke .     and that s what s going on here .   derec couldn t explain why  but he felt his face turning red .   this is an outrage .  should i put a stop to it .     oh  you re such a prude .  of course not .  this is all part of the learning experience .  you know the old saying   nobody approves of a dirty joke   except from someone who knows how to tell it .      then why am i going through all this effort to put on this big production .  why don t i just ask you to strip for them .     you d like it  but they wouldn t care .  they re not listening to these jokes for cheap thrills  but because they want to learn more about us .     they really do .  they really want to understand what it means to be human  don t they .     i think it s a lot different than that .  personally  though  i also think you should keep your mind on what s happening now  because harry s launched into another joke .    sure enough  the robot had .   the last man on earth sat alone in a room   he was saying .   suddenly  there was a knock on the door       all right  you re a success  harry .   waving his arms  derec rushed up to him and put his hand over his speaker grill .  a symbolic gesture  to be sure  but no less an effective one .   just join your comrades backstage until i call for you  okay .         yes  mister director   replied harry  briskly walking away .    where were we .  oh  it doesn t matter .  let s talk about the play .   the play s the thing   hamlet says   wherein i ll catch the conscience of the king .    hamlet s uncle claudius has murdered hamlet s father  the king of denmark  then taken his brother s place on the throne .  to solidify his claim  claudius has married hamlet s mother  gertrude .  when hamlet returns home from school  he has found the throne  which should be his  usurped  and while he suspects his uncle of foul play  he has no proof but the word of a ghost from beyond the grave .    to secure this proof  hamlet hires a traveling troupe of actors to perform a play that mirrors the crime that he believes claudius has committed .  he hopes that by watching his uncle during the performance  he ll see the guilt  the uncovered knowledge of the crime  written on his uncle s face .    claudius  meanwhile  suspects hamlet of faking madness in search of this proof  and so he is stalking his nephew even as hamlet is stalking him .  the play is about the duel of wits between the two  and the means men will take to have what they want   be it a throne  revenge  or justice .    derec turned to mandelbrot and nodded .  mandelbrot stood and said   the mister director wishes to thank you for volunteering and submitting to the interview process .   mandelbrot gestured toward canute s way .   and for following orders .  no doubt many orders will be curtly given you in the days to come  and mister director wishes to thank you in advance .  as most of you know  mister director will assault the part of hamlet  while miss ariel will impersonate the doomed  lamented ophelia .  i will now communicate on comlink wavelengths your assignments in the cast and crew categories .    it took mandelbrot only a few seconds to do so  since he could impart more information so much more quickly on the higher frequencies .  derec and ariel heard nothing  they only knew the robots were hearing because they often nodded to indicate their understanding .    okay  is everything understood .   derec asked when mandelbrot returned to his stiff sitting position .   canute raised a finger .   master  may i confer with you in private for a moment .     sure   said derec  walking stage right to the wings .   come over here .    canute did  and asked   master  am i to impart any significance to the fact that i have been assigned the role of claudius .     no .  should there be .         it appears there should be .  when you first spoke to me in the square  you asked questions of a nature i can only describe as suspicious .  soon afterward  you assigned me a task similar to the one lucius took upon itself .  and now  you assign me the role of a murderer   the object of the play within the play .  surely the logical mind must be able to infer something from all this .     naw .  not at all  canute .  it s coincidence  sheer coincidence .     may i inquire something further .         by all means .     why do you not just ask me forthrightly if i am the one responsible for lucius  s demise .  you know i cannot withhold truth .      canute  i m surprised at you .  i ve got no interest in asking you .  now get along .  the best part s coming up next .   derec pushed the ebony in the direction of the robots  then rubbed his hands together as if to warm them with the help of a nearby fire .  the ebony had dared a great deal in asking derec to confront it .  if derec had taken up the dare  the game might have been over then and there  but the right answers to all his questions might never be found .   mulling over the incident in the moment before he introduced the best part  derec discovered that  despite himself  he was gaining a profound respect for canute .  not approval  just respect .  if found out  the ebony was a robot willing to face the consequences of its actions  but  in a way reminding derec of human emotions  preferred to face them sooner than later .    many of you have probably heard of the human pastime of listening to music  and of those who make or record music  but i trust none of you have ever heard it before   said derec to the cast and crew .   in fact  although i can t ever recall having personally heard music before  i daresay i ve never heard it played in quite the way these three comrades play it .    so i d like to introduce to you the three comrades who will provide us with the incidental music of our production   harry  benny  and m      the three cracked cheeks of robot city    derec waved the three on as he walked behind ariel .  he whispered in her ear   this ought to be good .    benny stepped toward the proscenium of the stage as harry and m    put on their artificial lips .   greetings  comrades .  we thought we would perform an ancient terran jingle called  tootin  through the roof .   hope it stirs your coconut milk .    and the three cracked cheeks began to play  at first an a a b a riff theme with a solo by benny on the trumpet .  a solo from harry on the trombone followed  and then m    on the saxophone took over .  in fact  it wasn t long before the solos were alternating thick and fast  with the two backers always offering support with the riff theme .  the solos began to give the impression that the three were juggling a ball between them  and whoever had the ball had to depend on the other two for his foundation .   derec hadn t heard the three play since that first audition .  the first thing he noticed about this performance was their added confidence in themselves  the almost mathematical precision of the solo trade offs  and the utter smoothness with which they assailed the tune .  he looked down at his foot .  it had been tapping .   he glanced at ariel .  he had expected her to be bored  her contempt for all things terran was  after all  the result of several generations  worth of cultural history .  but instead of appearing bored  she looked directly at the three with rapt attention .  her foot was tapping  too .      now  thiss iss hamlet .   said wolruf .     chapter    the memory of dawn    in two hours the performance would begin .  derec sat in his room  trying not to think about it .  he was trying  in fact  not to think about much of anything .  for though he had memorized practically the entire play  and felt as if he could perform his blocking blindfolded  he was afraid that if he ran through it in his mind now  at this late date  it would fall out of his memory as surely as his identity had .   after all  he had no idea what the cause of his amnesia was .  it might have been caused by a severe blow to the head or a serious case of oxygen deprivation  but he could have some kind of disease as well   a disease that had caused him to lose his memory several times  forcing him to start over his search for his identity again and again .  a disease that could strike again at any moment .  such as three minutes before the production was to begin .   derec shrugged and lay down on his bed .  well  in such an eventuality  at least he would be spared the humiliation of embarrassment  he decided .  he wouldn t remember anything or anybody .   the most terrible part of his fantasy   which he admitted was a little paranoid  but perhaps wasn t totally unwarranted under the circumstances   was that in the past he could have lost  time and time again  the companionship of intelligent beings who d meant just as much to him as ariel and wolruf and mandelbrot did now .   maybe i should start thinking about the play  he thought .  it might be safer .   the most important thing for him to remember was the secret purpose of the production  to watch canute s reactions during the little surprises that derec had cooked up for the robot .   for as hamlet hoped to force claudius to reveal his guilt while watching the play within the play  derec hoped canute would at last be forced to confront its own true nature .   this was a nature canute had steadfastly avoided confronting during rehearsals .  when praised for its work in designing the theatre  canute had admitted only that it was following orders  that it had given nothing of itself that was not logical .  when it performed a scene particularly well during rehearsal  canute had admitted only to following orders explicitly  to performing mechanically  as only a robot could .   but with luck  canute had by now a case of robotic overconfidence .  derec s plans hinged on the hope that canute believed it had already weathered the worse part of the investigation .   of course  there was always the possibility that the surprises wouldn t work .  what if they didn t .  then what would derec have to do .   derec realized he was wound up pretty tight .  he relaxed with an effort .  then  when his thoughts began to turn automatically to the same matters  he tensed up again and had to relax with a second effort .  was this some form of stage fright .  if it was  he supposed it could have been worse .  he could be performing before humans .   there was a knock at the door .   come in   he said  crossing his feet and putting his hands behind his head  so that whoever it was would think he was facing the coming performance with a mood of utter calm .    jumping galaxies .  you look terrible .   said ariel breathlessly as she closed the door behind her .   you must be nervous .  it s good to know i m not the only one .    derec sat straight up and planted his feet on the floor .  just by being there  she had taken his breath away .  she was in her costume   a blonde wig and a white gown that clung to her body as if it had been spun from a spider s web .  her makeup heightened the color of her cheeks and lips  and made her skin appear a healthier shade of pale .  he hadn t realized that she could look so beautiful  with such an inner aliveness .   of course  when he thought of all the circumstances that they had faced together   being thrown into a hospital together  running away from something  being stranded somewhere   it stood to reason that she had never before had the opportunity to accentuate her natural femininity .  her beauty in the costume was familiar  yet it was also something new  as if he d glimpsed it in a long forgotten dream .   but if she noticed his reaction  that is  if he revealed any of it   she gave no indication as she sat on the bed beside him .  however  she glared at him because of his second reaction .  it must have been none too flattering  for she looked like he had hit her over the head with a rubber chicken .   what s the matter with you .   she asked .    what s that smell .   he replied .    oh  i had mandelbrot synthesize some perfume for me .  i thought it might help keep me in character .     it s very pleasant .      that s not what your face said at first .     that s because i wasn t sure what i was smelling .         hmm .  that s not much of a compliment .  it s supposed to smell good whether or not you know what it is .      please  i ve forgotten my social training along with the rest of my memory .     your face said it smelled like fertilizer .     i m not even sure i know what fertilizer smells like .    she pursed her lips and looked away from him  but he couldn t help noticing that her hand was very close to his on the bed .  their fingers were almost touching .   nervous .   she asked .   he shrugged .   naw .  for all i know  this could be my first encounter with perfume .     i meant the play  silly .     oh .  well  maybe a little .  hey  for all i know  i could be an old hand at this .     i see .  do you think amnesia could sometimes be a blessing in disguise .     ariel  something s bothering you .  are you well .         reasonably well .  doing this play has given me something relatively constructive to concentrate on  though i m still not sure it was a good idea for me to play someone who goes mad .  i m beginning to realize how uncomfortably it mirrors my own predicament .     would you rather play hamlet s mother .     no .  well  maybe .  but why couldn t i play hamlet himself .  i can be heard all over the stage  and you said so yourself  just yesterday  that i can definitely emote .  like crazy  if you ll forgive my choice of words .     the role has been undertaken occasionally by women  according to the theatre history texts .  i m sure the robots would be only too positronically fulfilled to support you in a production of hamlet .  or of any other play .     i meant why couldn t i play hamlet in this production .       aha .  you had your chance  but you volunteered to play ophelia first .  you were guilty of your own biased thinking   before i had the chance to engage in my biased thinking  that is .      that s true   she replied  in tones a bit more serious than he thought his words warranted .   besides  i think there re reasons why you picked hamlet  beyond the ones that have to do with canute .  you could have picked any number of plays  you know  like othello or julius salad .      that s julius caesar .     right .  anyway  i think you already saw a lot of yourself in him   the mad romantic  the soul searching adventurer  the vain  pompous  arrogant  stubborn .  .  . stubborn .  .  .     egotist .     right .  egotist .    derec smiled .  it was exciting to have her sitting next to him .  except for rehearsing bits of business together  they hadn t been this close for some time  and he was surprised to discover how much he liked it .  he was nervous and relaxed at the same time .    derec .  pay attention .  i m talking to you   she said gently .   listen  i ve been thinking about the differences between us and the people back then  or the way they were presented  anyway .  i can t help but wonder if anyone today ever has the kind of love ophelia has for hamlet .     or lady macbeth has for macbeth .     i m serious .  i know ophelia is definitely a weak creature .   hi there  dad .  use me as a pawn in your nefarious schemes .  please .   but for all that  she really does love with a consuming passion .  i ve never met anyone on aurora who s felt that kind of love .  .  . that i know of  naturally .  but i think i would be able to tell if there were any ophelias out there .     how about yourself .   he asked with an unexpected catch in his voice .    me .  no  i ve never felt that kind of passion .   she narrowed her eyes as she looked at him .  he couldn t help but wonder what she was really thinking as she pulled away from him  put her foot on the bed  and rested her head on her knee .   i ve had sex  of course  and crushes  but nothing like what aphelia must feel .   she paused  buried her face in her gown  then lifted her head just enough so he could see her raise an eyebrow .  with a decidedly interesting intent .   i might be persuaded to try  though .    derec felt a lump the size of a sidewalk get stuck in his throat .   ariel .     derec   are you a virgin .     how am i supposed to know .  i have amnesia .   now it was his turn to raise his eyebrows  as she moved closer to him .    you know  there s another aspect to ophelia   she said .   she represents something .   closer .   something hamlet needs but which he has to deny to have his revenge .     he was a user  too .     how about that .   closer .   she leaned forward .  he kissed her .  no  he couldn t remember having felt anything quite like this before .  feeling obligated to pursue the matter scientifically  though  he felt confident he might remember after a little more experimentation .    wait   she said after a time  pushing away .   i m sorry .  i got carried away there .  i m not always in control of myself .     uh  that s all right   he replied  suddenly feeling slightly embarrassed .    that s not the point .  it s my medical condition .  don t be offended  but right now i m feeling a little healthier than common sense tells me i should .  remember how i acquired my little condition .     don t worry  i won t forget   he said  drawing her toward him to kiss her again .  their lips were millimeters apart when there was an insistent knocking at the door .   damn .   he whispered in response .   it must be the brain police .     master derec .   said a stone cold  metallic voice outside .   mistress ariel .   it was the voice of a hunter robot .    yes .  what is it .   derec shouted .  then in a whisper .   see .  i was right  in a way .     mandelbrot sent me to locate you and remind you that you should depart for the new globe soon .  there are a few details that only you can provide .     all right   derec said .   we ll be there soon .     very good  sir   said the hunter robot  its voice already fading .    what did you say .   she asked .   brain police .     i don t know .  it just popped into my head .     if i remember correctly  the brain police are something from some children s holodrarna i saw when i was growing up .  it s famous .  they re from   from that series called tyrants of blood .    derec was amazed .    about a masked man who rescues helpless thought deviants on a totalitarian planet .  i remember .  is that a clue to my identity .     i doubt it .  i said it was famous   and it was syndicated  seen allover the known systems .  it s been playing for generations .     oh .  so it means nothing .     no  it means at least we can be sure you re from some civilized world .     thanks a lot .  come on .  our public awaits .      chapter    to be  or what .      master  if my understanding of human nature is correct  you ll be happy to know that we have a full house   said mandelbrot .    thanks  but i saw them lining up on my way in   said derec as he hastily donned the tight breeches that were a part of his costume .  he waited until he had put on the remainder of his costume   a purple tunic over a white shirt with ruffled sleeves  and a pair of boots   before he asked mandelbrot   how s canute .  has it done anything unusual   anything that might indicate it knows about my special plans .     so far it appears to be acting like the rest of the robots .  that is  as calm as ever .     you re not nervous at all  are you .     i am naturally concerned that the illusion proceeds as planned  as are all the robots  but the only nervousness i might possess  if i may use such a word as  nervousness   revolves around my concern that you perform in accordance with your own standards .     thanks .  how much time do we have .     mere moments until curtain .     everything in place .     everything but your greasepaint  master .         my makeup .  i forgot all about it .    mandelbrot helped him apply it  in great heaps that derec was certain would appear primitive and grotesquely overstated when picked up by the cameras .   is the stage ready .   derec asked .   everything in its proper placer    naturally .     but the hunter said       forgive me  master  but i deduced how you would want the remaining details handled .    derec nodded  but said nothing .  suddenly he was gripped by the overriding fear that he would step out on stage and forget every single one of his lines .  or worse  he would begin acting out the wrong scene .    relax  master .  i am confident you will perform to the letter .    derec smiled .  he looked in the mirror .  he hoped he looked fine .  then he walked out into the wings  joining ariel and the robots .   wolruf sat on a special chair in the very rear section of the backstage area  before a bank of screens showing the stage from several angles .  three supervisor robots sat in chairs before the screens  operating automatic cameras concealed throughout the theatre that  with appropriate zooms and pans would provide a total picture of everything on stage .  all that was left was for wolruf to call the shots and to tell one of the robots what should be broadcast to the holoscreens throughout the city .   beside her was a huge dish of artificial roughage .  though her concentration was on the screens  she was absent mindedly  systematically picking up handfuls and stuffing them into her mouth .   if she had a tail  derec thought  she d be wagging it in happiness .    master  it s curtain time .   said mandelbrot .   derec raised an eyebrow .   mandelbrot .  is that a quiver of excitement i detect in your voice .    mandelbrot shook his head   derec couldn t tell if it was from confusion or from a desire to communicate an emphatic no .   that would be impossible .   he straightened and paused .   unless i ve assimilated some of your lessons on voice inflection  and have begun using them without conscious knowledge .     later  mandelbrot  later .  let s get this show on the  uh  road .   he gave a signal to a stagehand  and the curtain rose .   a single shaft of light revealed the robot playing francisco  the guard at his post  standing in the center of the stage .  the robot playing bernardo entered and said   who s there .    francisco stood straight  gestured with his spear  and said in authoritative tones   nay  answer me  stand  and unfold yourself .    at the moment  derec could not recall a single one of his lines  not even those of the difficult soliloquy  but now he felt confident that he would know what to do and what to say when the time came .  he steeled himself  realizing that he would have to forget about being derec what s his name for a while .  for the next three hours  he would be somebody else .  somebody called hamlet  prince of denmark .     indeed  once he stepped into the stream  derec was rushed headlong down the events of the playas if he had been swept up by rapids .  he even forgot to spring some of his surprises on canute  slight line changes reflecting the events of the past few weeks that  presumably  were subtle enough that only canute would grasp their import and realize derec was planning to put him on the spot .  derec eventually signaled mandelbrot that he was calling off that entire aspect of his plot  because to change the play at this point  even for a good reason  seemed almost criminal .   all the robots performed brilliantly  with perfect precision .  derec realized that his fears the show might be unsuccessful were ungrounded  at least on that score .  for he was dealing with robots  not humans who might vary their performances from time to time .  once the robots had grasped derec s meanings during rehearsal  they had never deviated from them .  and tonight was no exception .   needless to say  canute had given away nothing during rehearsal .  but tonight  during the performance  he played his role beautifully  almost brilliantly .  he played claudius as derec would have liked to have instructed him to play the role  but had refrained for fear of tipping too much of his hand .  tonight canute was arrogant  controlled  self assured  guilt ridden  and obsessed with holding onto what he imagined was rightfully his .   it was almost as if  having decided that it would weather the production without being exposed  canute had mentally relaxed and had permitted itself to be swept down the same rapids .   good  derec thought during the second scene of the third act .  then the big surprise should work even more effectively .   for this was the scene of the play within the play  and before the  actors  began their  real  performance  the script called for a dumbshow  a play without words  that mirrored the action of hamlet .  in the original  a king and queen passionately embrace  and then the queen leaves as the king sleeps .  a third party enters  takes off the king s crown and then pours poison into his ears .  when the queen returns  she grieves for her dead husband  then is wooed by the poisoner  who quickly wins her love .   derec figured that a rewrite of a pantomime was all right  since it didn t involve changing any dialogue .  besides  he d read in the foreword to the text that shakespeare s plays had been frequently tampered with to make them more relevant  or seemingly so  to the world of the production .   but in the rewrite  the king built a tall building of sticks and cogs  to the tune of  blue goose .   the queen admired it  then left .  and as the king gazed down upon his creation  the third party snuck up behind him and bashed him over the head with a big stick .  the king fell down dead  and then the third party smashed the building .  the three cracked cheeks played  stormy weather .    derec applauded to indicate the dumbshow was over .  when ariel looked at him  asking with her eyes what was happening  derec merely shrugged  but watched canute as he said his lines .  after the actors resumed their performance  canute acted out the scenes of claudius s guilt no differently than before  after making allowances for the robot s more  relaxed  attitude .   the rest of the play continued without special event .  it proceeded until hamlet died  derec landing on the floor with a resounding thud  feeling pretty dead inside himself .  poor lucius .  the first creative robot in history was going to be unavenged .   well .  i m not through yet  thought derec  lying on the floor as the robots wrapped up the last scene of the play .  i can literally take canute apart if i want to   and i think i will .   derec stood up as the curtain fell and looked at everyone in anticipation .   well   how do you think it went .     forgive me  master   said canute  drawing itself up to its full height almost like a prideful human   but if you will permit a subjective opinion  i think the production was an utter failure .      chapter    the company has company     what do you mean  this play has been a failure .   demanded a livid ariel .   the production was smooth  very believable   she added  looking at derec .   at the moment derec was too busy being defensive to respond verbally  but he nodded gratefully .  most of the cast and crew had gathered around them behind the curtain  and nearly all were talking to one another .  things were too jumbled for derec to make much sense of it .  he was feeling lost  anyway .  the play was over  and he had to go back to being his real self .    quiet  everyone  listen .   said canute in raised tones .   they obeyed  and heard only silence from the audience hidden by the curtain .    you see .   said canute after a moment .   there is no response whatsoever .  i have been vindicated  robots are not artistic  nor can they respond to art .  it is perhaps unfortunate that your friend lucius cannot be here to notice .     forgive me  friend canute   said harry   but you have overlooked one fact  no one has ever mentioned to robots how they should respond .  if i know my fellows  they are sitting there in their chairs  wondering what they should do next .    benny said   excuse me  i must communicate through my comlink .    a few seconds later the house was filled with thunderous metallic applause .  it went on and on and on .   m    gestured to a stagehand to raise the curtain so the cast could take a bow .  and as the cast did so  harry said to canute   you see .  they liked it .     they are merely being polite   said canute without conviction .    congratulations  master   said mandelbrot .   it seems the play is a success .    derec couldn t resist a smile  though whether it was because of the play or because an overjoyed ariel was hugging him  he couldn t say .   i just hope it came off as well on the holoscreens .     it should have   said ariel .   i told wolruf to concentrate on my best profile .  the robots should be mesmerized by my beauty forever .    they won t be the only ones  derec thought as he and the cast and crew took the first of several bows .   still the applause went on and on  it seemed it would never stop .   but suddenly it did  and the robots all turned their heads around as a diminutive figure walked down an aisle .   a diminutive human figure  a stunned derec realized .   a figure who was a roundish man with baggy trousers  an oversized coat  and a white shirt with a ruffled collar .  he had long wavy white hair and a bushy mustache  and an intense expression that implied he was capable of remarkable feats of concentration .  when he reached the bottom of the aisle  he stopped  stared angrily at the people and robots on stage  put his arms to his hips  and said   what is going on here .  what kind of game are you playing with my robots .     by the seven galaxies .   derec exclaimed .   you must be dr .  avery .     who else .   the man asked .     chapter     all about avery     i want to see you   you   you   and you   said avery  walking onstage and pointing in turn at derec  ariel  wolruf  and mandelbrot .   is there some place in this rather grandiose structure where we can meet in private .    almost immediately  derec decided there was something he didn t like about the man .  no  he had to take that back .  something about avery made derec feel uncomfortable and uncharacteristically meek .  perhaps it was avery s air of cool superiority  or the manner in which he assumed his authority would be taken for granted .   even so  derec decided that cooperation was his best option for the moment .  avery must have gotten here somehow  his key to perihelion could take ariel away  or perhaps his ship would be large enough for more than one person  so at least ariel would have the chance to get the medical help derec had so far been unable to provide .  for that reason  if for no other  derec steeled himself and said   we can go to my dressing room  backstage .    avery nodded  as if deeply considering the serious ramifications of the suggestion .   excellent .    in the room  avery calmly demanded to know who everyone was  and how they had gotten there .  derec saw no reason to conceal the truth  at least the greater portion of it .  he told avery how he had awoken bereft of memory in the survival pod on the mining colony  how he had discovered ariel  and how they had made their way to robot city .  he described his encounter with the alien who had instructed him to build mandelbrot  and how wolruf had broken away from her servitude .  he told avery how he had deduced the flaw in the programming that was causing the city to self destruct by expanding at an insupportable speed  how they had found a murdered body that was an exact duplicate of derec  and how he and ariel had saved the marooned jeff from becoming a paranoid schizophrenic for the rest of his life when his brain had been placed in a robot s body .  finally  he recounted what little he had learned about lucius  and how lucius had created circuit breaker the same night of the robot s untimely demise .    that s when i decided to put on a performance of hamlet   said derec   in order to uncover the killer .  but so far it seems my schemes have had no effect on the robot canute  so i still have no idea why it did what i suspect it did .  i ve no proof  however  that even my theory is correct .  i guess when all is said and done  i just hadn t thought things through enough .     avery nodded  but said nothing .  his expression was rather stem  but otherwise noncommital .  derec really had no idea of how avery was reacting to the chronicling of all these events .    so you programmed this city all by yourself .   said ariel casually .  she was sitting on a couch with her legs crossed  still in costume .  the effect was rather disconcerting  since although she had dropped her character completely  derec was still visually cued to think of her as ophelia .   i bet you never suspected for a moment that it would take on all these unprecedented permutations .     what i suspected would happen is my business   replied avery as tonelessly as a robot .    iss tha  rud ness nexessaree .   said wolruf .   esspecially to one who did so much to presserrve  ur inven shon .         preserve it .   said avery incredulously .  suddenly he began pacing back and forth around the room in an agitated fashion .   it remains to be seen whether my designs have been preserved or not .  one thing is clear  though  and that s that something unusual is going on  something i think you may have made even worse .     forgive me if i seem presumptuous   said mandelbrot  who was standing next to the doorway   but logic informs me that it is your absence that has had the most undesirable effect on the city .  my master and his friends did not wish to come here or to stay  and they have dealt with the developments as best they knew how .  indeed  logic also informs me that perhaps your absence was part of your basic plan .    avery glared at the robot .   close down   he said curtly .    no  mandelbrot  you shall do nothing of the sort .  that is a direct order .   derec looked at avery .   he is mine  and his first allegiance is to me .    avery smiled .   but all the other robots in the city owe their first allegiance to me .  i could have them enter and dismantle him if i wished .     that is very true   said ariel .   but what would you say if i told you that one of your robots has a desire to be a stand up comedian .    wolruf said   wheneverr hear joke  know firrss  hand trrue meanin  of sufferrin   .     i have no qualms about attesting to that   said mandelbrot .    you re irrational   all of you .   avery whispered .    i ve been meaning to talk to you about that   said ariel .   i see   said avery .   i know you   the auroran who had the liaison with a spacer .         and i was contaminated as a result   said ariel .   does this mean i ve become famous .  i m not ashamed of what i did   but then again  i m not especially proud of my disease  either .  i m slowly going mad  and i ve got to get off this world to obtain the proper medical attention .     i could use some myself   said derec .   i d like to know who i am .     naturally   said avery .  but he said nothing else  and the others waited for several seconds  each thinking that he would add the words they hoped to hear .   but i have other plans   he finally said off handedly .    what other plans .   derec exclaimed  making a frantic gesture .   what could possibly be more important than getting ariel to a doctor .    but avery said nothing .  he merely sat down in a chair and crossed his legs .  he robbed his face and then ran his hand through his hair .  his brows knitted as if he was concentrating deeply  but exactly about what remained a mystery .    excuse me  dr .  avery  but being examined by a diagnostic robot was no help   said ariel .   i need human attention as quickly as possible .     perhaps a diagnostic robot native to the city will better know what to look for   said avery   which after all is half the battle when it comes to medicine .     unfortunately  dr .  avery  that seems not to be the case   said mandelbrot .   mistress ariel was examined by surgeon experimental   and human medical research   during the recuperation of jeff leong from his experimental surgery .  they were able to determine only that her illness was beyond their abilities of diagnosis and treatment .  they have not been affected by the strangely intuitive thinking that is rapidly becoming endemic in this place  possibly because they were first activated after the near disaster from which master derec saved robot city .     you re sure of that .   derec asked .    not as to the cause  but that they have remained as they were  yes .  i have maintained regular contact with them   the robot responded .   they are working on the blood and tissue samples that mistress ariel left with them  but have made no breakthroughs .      then i was right .   derec pounded a fist into his other hand .   the only way we can make any progress on a cure is if we add one of the intuitive robots to the medical team .     i don t think so   said avery coldly .   in fact  all this so called intuitive thinking is going to come to a halt rather quickly  as soon as i figure out how to stop it .  it s too unpredictable .  it must be studied under controlled conditions .  strictly controlled conditions  without robots running around telling jokes .     that s just too bad   said derec .   ariel is going to be cured  one way or the other  and there s nothing you can do to stop me .    avery s eyes widened .  staring silently at derec for several moments  he rapped his fingers on the makeup table and crossed and uncrossed his feet .  the actions weren t nervous  but they were agitated .   friend derec  this city is mine .  i created it .  i own it .  there is no one who understands it better than me .     then you should be able to explain quite easily some of the things that have been going on here   derec snapped .   avery dismissed the notion with a wave .   oh  i will  when it s convenient .     iss that why  u crreated it .   wolruf asked pointedly  her lip curling   and i can dissect you if i wish   replied avery evenly .   the fact that you re the first alien in human captivity almost demands it as the proper scientific response .     don t even think about it   said derec .   first  wolruf isn t in captivity  she s our friend .  we won t let you so much as x ray her without her express permission .  understand .     the robots accept me as their primary master  and i bet they ve already decided that she isn t human .  after all  she doesn t remotely look or act human .     but she is as intelligent as a human  and a robot would certainly be influenced by that   countered derec .   your robots just might find themselves unable to complete your orders .     only the more intelligent ones   said avery .   there are many grades of intelligence here  and i can restrict my orders to the lowest forms in the eventuality of any conflicts in that area .     i think you re underestimating his ability to take control   countered ariel for derec .   avery smiled .   your friend seems to have great confidence in you   he said to derec .   i hope it is justified .     i wouldn t have gotten as far as i have without some ability to turn an unfortunate development around to my advantage   said derec .    he ss had help   said wolruf .    i  too  have assisted him  as much as robotically possible   said mandelbrot   and shall continue to do so as long as i am functioning .  thanks to master derec  i have learned much of what human beings mean by the word  friend  .     avery nodded .  he scrutinized derec with what appeared to be a peculiar combination of pride and anger .  it was as if avery could not make up his own mind about how he felt about this crew and what he wanted to do about them .  derec had the distinct feeling that this man was flying without a navigation computer .    how did you get here .   asked derec .    that is my business and none of yours .     did you perchance find a key to perihelion .  in that case  it wouldn t inconvenience you in the least to permit ariel and me to use it .  i would return as soon as she was being taken care of .      i don t know that  and in any case your suggestion is immaterial .  i have no such key .     then you ve arrived in a spacecraft   said derec  forcing the issue in an effort to do exactly what he had been doing since he had awakened in the survival pod  turn things around to his advantage .   where is it .    avery laughed uproariously .   i m not going to tell you .         it is ironic  is it not   said mandelbrot   that humans  who depend so much upon robots to adhere to the three laws  cannot be programmed to obey them .     thiss one exis ss ou side lawss of  ur kind   said wolruf .   avery regarded the alien in a new light .   if what you re saying means what i think it does  then you re absolutely correct .     is this how you get your kicks   asked derec   by jeopardizing the lives of innocent people .    now a light of an entirely different sort blazed in avery s eyes .   no  by disregarding the lives of innocent people .  the only thing that matters is my work .  and my work would never get done if i allowed my behavior to be restricted by so called humanitarian considerations .      is that why you left the city for so long  to get your work done .  to start other colonies .   derec asked .    i was away  and that is all you need to know .   avery put his hand in his pocket  pulled out a small device and pointed it at mandelbrot .  the device resembled a pinwheel  but it made a strange hissing sound when it moved  and the sparks  instead of corning out of the wheel  came out of mandelbrot .   ariel screamed .    what are you doing to him .   derec asked  rushing to his robot s side .   wolruf squatted  and her hindquarters twitched as if she was about to make a leap at avery .  avery looked at her and said   careful .  i can make it easier on him   or i can make it worse .    wolruf straightened up  but she warily kept her eye on avery  searching for an opportunity to strike .   derec was so angry that his intentions were the same  though he was hoping he wasn t being that obvious about it .  but at the moment he was preoccupied with trying to keep mandelbrot standing  or at least leaning against the wall  though he wasn t sure what difference it would make .   mandelbrot quivered as the sparks spat out of his joints and every opening in his face .  his pseudo muscular coordination was in an advanced state of disruption  his arms and legs flailed spastically and an eerie moan rose from his speaker grill like a ghostly wail .  derec pushed him flat against the wall  and was struck several times by the robot s uncontrollable hands and elbows .  despite derec s efforts  however  mandelbrot slid onto the floor  and derec sat on him  trying to keep the writhing robot down .  but mandelbrot was too strong  and finally it was all derec could do to get out of harm  s way .   avery  meanwhile  calmly continued to point the device at the robot .   don t come any closer   i can make it worse .  i can even induce positronic drift .     what are you doing to him .   derec repeated .    this is an electronic disrupter  a device of my own invention   avery replied with some pride .   it emits an ion stream that interferes with the circuits of any sufficiently advanced machine .     you re hurting him .   said ariel .   don t you care .     of course not  my dear .  this is a robot  and hence has only the rights i prefer to bestow upon him .     think not .   growled wolruf .    i can press a button faster than any of you can move   said avery  warningly .    why are you doing this .   derec asked .    because i do not wish this robot to interfere .  you see  i have stationed some hunter robots outside this theatre .  they await my signal  even as we speak .  when i alert them  they will capture you and take you to my laboratory  where i shall drug you with an advanced truth serum and learn everything your mind has to tell me .     will this serum help me remember who i am .         derec .   exclaimed ariel  shocked .    i seriously doubt it .  unfortunately  the serum isn t quite perfected yet   it s another invention of mine   and i confess there is the possibility that it may actually jumble things up a little more for you .  for a time  anyway .  you may take comfort in the fact that the damage won t be permanent .    derec nodded .  he looked at mandelbrot on the floor .   sorry  old buddy   he said .    what .   said avery  a nanosecond before derec hefted a chair at him .   as the scientist ducked  derec ran to the door  shouting   follow me .  we ll come back for mandelbrot later .    the trio ran down the hall toward the stage  toward members of the cast and crew .  wolruf was clearly holding herself back to remain with derec and ariel .    out of the way .   derec shouted as they moved past the robots  he hoped that he could create enough confusion to slow down the robots in case avery invoked his precedential authority and ordered them to capture him and his friends .    where are we going .   ariel asked .    you ll see .    they soon heard avery angrily shouting something in the background  but by then they had reached the stage .  derec stopped at the center trapdoor and opened it .   quick .  down here .     but that leads backstage .   protested ariel .    that s not all   said derec .   hurry .    wolruf leapt inside  and derec and ariel were quickly with her .  as derec closed the door  they were enveloped in blackness .   we ll have to feel our way around for a few minutes   said derec as they made their way down the narrow corridor .   ah .  here .  this door leads to the underground conduits of the city .  even avery s hunters will have a hard time searching for us down here .     not for long .   said ariel .   can t they trace us with infrared .     it ll still give us time .   said derec between his teeth .   and we can use that time to figure out our next move .  let s go .     all right   said ariel resignedly   but i hope somebody turns on the lights .    as it happened  the lights were the one thing they didn t have to worry about .  the lining of the underground conduits automatically glowed in the presence of visitors  illuminating the narrow spaces several meters behind and ahead of them .  things were not so elegant here .  at first they saw only what they had expected  wires and cables  pipes  circuit banks  transistorized power generators  oscillators  stress and strain gauges  capacitors  fusion pods  and various other devices that derec  for all his knowledge in electronics and positronics  could not even name .  he stared at the construction in fascination  momentarily forgetting the reason why he and his friends had come here .   derec couldn t help but admire avery .  surely the man was a genius unparalleled in human history  it was too bad he appeared to have lost his humanity in the process of making his dreams real .    how much further do we have to go .   ariel finally asked .   i m getting tired  and it s not too easy to get around in this silly dress .     i don t know   said derec  breathing heavily .  he hadn t realized how tired he was .  he had given all his energy to the performance  and probably didn t have too much reserve left at the moment .   we could keep going  i suppose  but i don t see what difference it d make .     more be ween  u an   ur purrsuerrs  the bedder   said wolruf .   firss less on pup learrns .     derec   what s that .   ariel asked  pointing to the illuminated regions ahead .    what s what .  everything looks the same .    wolruf sniffed the air .   smell not the same .    derec moved up the corridor .  as he did so  the illumination moved upward with him .  and in the distance  just before the corridor was enveloped in total darkness  wires and generators began to blend into an amorphous form .  derec waved the others on .   let s go   i want to see what s going on .     derec  we re in trouble   we can t go exploring just because we feel like it .     i don t know why not .  besides  this corridor only goes in two directions   this way and that way .    the further they went  the more amorphous the materials in the conduit became  merging into one another until only the vaguest outlines of generators  cables  fusion pods  and all the other parts were visible .  it was as if every aspect of the conduit had been welded into inseparable parts .  derec had the feeling that if he could open one of the generators  for example  what he would find inside would be amorphous  fused circuits and wires .    deeper   he said   we ve got to go deeper .     derec  things are definitely getting cramped here   protested ariel .    she s rite   said wolruf .   furr her down we go  the narrower the tunnel .  if hunterrs come       we won t be able to do anything anyway   said derec .   look at what s happening here .  don t you realize what s going on .     looks like the city s beginning to dissolve   said ariel .    ah .  in actuality  the effect is precisely the opposite .  the further up we go  the more the city begins to coalesce .  understand .     are you serious .  no .     the ultimate foundation of robot city is still further down this conduit .  the meta cells must be manufactured below  and they re propelled upward in much the same way that water s propelled through a pipe .  only more slowly .     then why are all these phony machines here .     they re not phony  they just haven t been fully formed yet .  the cells probably have to make it through a certain portion of the foundation before they can really begin to get with their program .  you see  the atoms of metal form a lattice in three dimensions  which is why metals occur in polycrystalline form   that is  large numbers of small crystals .  the cells in this part of the underground haven t crystallized yet .  ariel .    she had looked away .  she was nodding as if she understood his explanation  but her face was perspiring  and she had grown noticeably paler  even in the dim light .  derec reached for her as if to steady her  but she pulled away from him .    don t     she said  waving him away .   i i m getting claustrophobic .  it s too narrow in here .  i i m feeling all this weight on top of me .      don t worry about it   said derec .   the foundation is secure .  nothing s going to happen .     what are we going to do if the hunters come .     they may not be able to find us here .  even with infrared sensors .  if the program   s not complete in this sector  then it  s possible that they won t be able to detect us .      only possibly   said wolruf .   even if they don  come  we ll hav  to leave sooner orr la err .  then they find us .    now derec waved them both away .   all right  all right .  i know all this .  i m sorry .     u could no  help ur self .    derec snorted  which was about as close to a self mocking laugh as he could muster at the moment .  it was bad enough that they had come to a literal dead end   they had arrived at the end of the road in more ways than one .   how he wished mandelbrot was with them now .  he felt like a callous coward  having left him behind that way .  he had left in the hope that he would be able to come back for the robot  but now he feared avery would dismantle the brain and scatter the parts all over the city  thus making it possible to rebuild him only if all the parts could be found .   derec looked at his open palms .  he had put mandelbrot together with these hands and his brain  from the spare parts he d had available .  now his hands and brain seemed hopelessly inadequate to cope with the problems besetting him .  he could not help ariel .  he could not help wolruf and mandelbrot .  he had been unable to make canute confess and to bring the robot to whatever kind of justice might be appropriate .  hell  he may not even have solved the question of who killed lucius in the first place .  last   but at the moment the very least   he had been unable to help himself .   wolruf made a gurgling sound deep in her throat .   derec  a prroblem .     another one .         oh  yes .    derec looked up to see  at the edge of the darkness above them  the hunter robots advancing .     chapter     dreams out of joint    derec awoke in a place that he knew was not real .  otherwise  he had no idea where he was .  he stood on a smooth copper plane extending unbroken in all directions .  above him was a pitch black sky .  theoretically  he should have been engulfed in darkness as well  since the copper was hardly an obvious source of illumination  but vision was no problem .   in fact  derec realized  his range of sight extended into the ultraviolet and infrared range .  when he looked down to inspect his hand  his neck joints creaked  he would not have been able to hear that sound if he had been human .  for he was now a robot .  his metal hand proved that beyond doubt .   normally  such a turn of events would have sent him into a fit of deep depression  but  now that the deed was done  derec accepted it quite readily .  he did not know why or how he had changed  nor did he think the reasons mattered much .  all that remained was for him to figure out what he wanted to do next .   logically  he should walk .  since there was no logical way to determine if one direction was preferable to any other  he simply started off in the direction he happened to be facing .   and as he walked  he saw that something was growing in the distance .  he walked more quickly  hoping to reach his destination that much faster  but it always remained the same distance away .   so he ran  and the something seemed to glide across the copper surface away from him  maintaining the distance between them .   he saw that at the upper regions of the something were the spires of a city  streaking against the sky as the foundation glided away .  streaking against the sky and cutting through it  tearing it  exposing the whiteness beyond .  ribbons of whiteness dangled from the nothingness  and though derec could not reach the city  eventually he did stand directly beneath the ribbons .  reason told him that they were far away  probably at least a kilometer above him  but he gave in to the urge to reach out and touch one .   he grabbed it  and felt a flash of searing heat blaze through his soul .  he tried to scream  but could not make a sound .   he tried to release the ribbon  but it clung to his fingers .  it expanded .  it enveloped him  smothering the copper and the blackness of the world .   or was he falling inside the ribbon .  it was hard to tell .  reason also began to tell him that this was a dream of some sort that he was living  and that it would be better if he went along with it and tried not to fight it .  perhaps his mind was trying to tell him something .   he fell through the whiteness until he came to a school of giant amoebae  but instead of being creatures of proteins they were composed of circuits laid out like a lattice .  he kicked his legs and waved his arms  and discovered that he could swim the currents of whiteness just as they could .  he swam with them .  .  .      until they swept  round and  round in circles  disappearing into a point in the whiteness as if it was the center of a whirlpool .  derec tried to swim against the current  but he was inexorably pulled down into the point .   he came out on the other side  surrounded not by amoebae  but by molten ore rapidly being solidified into meteors by the near absolute zero temperatures in this space .  now he was in a void where there was no current to swim .  he thought that he should be afraid  yet he was facing the situation with incredible calm .  perhaps that was because in this dream he was a robot both in mind and in body his body was unaffected by the cold  and he required no air to breathe  so  except for the danger of being struck by a solidifying slag heap  he was in no danger .  hence he had nothing to fear  nothing to worry about .   nothing  perhaps  except for where he might be going .  he wished he could resist the trajectory he was taking  but there was nothing he could do about it  for there was nothing for him to grab onto or to kick against .  he had no choice but to submit to his momentum  and hope to be able to act later .   he had no way to judge how much time had passed when he plummeted from the void into a dark blue sky  nor could he explain how he had managed to fall so far  so fast  without bursting into flames upon his entry into the atmosphere .   he landed in a vast sea  and swam to a shore where the waves pounded against the rocks .  he crawled onto the beach  feeling as strong and as fit as when he had first began this dream  but now a bit afraid that he might rust .  however  once he had walked away from the beach and could once again see the city in the distance  his metal body was perfectly dry  and none the worse for wear .   he walked toward the city .  now it remained stationary  and the closer he came to it  the more brilliant it gleamed in the sunlight  with rainbow colors that glistened as if the towers and pyramids and flying buttresses were sparkling with the fresh dew of morning .   and inside the boundaries of the city were buildings shaped like hexagonal prisms  ditetragonal prisms  dodecahedrons  and hexoctahedrons   complex geometric shapes all  but each with its own purity arising from its simplicity .  yet there seemed to be nothing inside the buildings  there were no doors  no windows  no entrances of any kind .  the colors of the buildings glistened in the sunlight  crimson  wheat  ochre  sapphire  gold  sable  and emerald  each and every one so pleasing to his logic integrals  all so constant and pure .   yet the deeper he walked into the city  the fewer buildings there were .  they were spaced further apart  until the emptiness formed a tremendous square in the center .  and in the square was an array of mysterious machinery  surrounded by transparent plastic packages of dry chemicals scattered on the ground .  they all seemed to be asking to be used .   but for what .   derec did use them .  he did not know why  nor did he know exactly how he used them .  he mixed the contents of the plastic packages into the machinery when it seemed appropriate  in fact  he rebuilt the machines when it was appropriate .  again  he did not know exactly why or how he accomplished this .  it was only a dream  after all .   and when he was done he stood at the edge of the square and looked upon the opening he had made in the fabric of the universe .  inside he saw clusters of galaxies swirling  moving apart in a stately  steady flow .  gradually  they moved beyond his point of view  but instead of leaving utter blackness in their wake  they left a blinding white light .   derec happily stepped inside the light .  it was time to awaken  for now he knew how to reach canute .     chapter     the theory of everything     wake up  my lad   came the voice of dr .  avery from behind the veil of blackness .   the time has come to join the land of the living .    derec opened his eyes .  dr .  avery s face hovered over him  going in and out of focus .  avery s expression was as neutral as his tone had been sardonic .  derec sensed they were both calculated  the constant light burning in the doctor s eyes was under control only with effort .    what happened to me .   derec asked hoarsely .   what did you do to me .     the hunter robots knocked out you and your friends with a dose of nerve gas .  the effects were temporary  i assure you  and there will be no aftereffects .  i had to assure the hunters of that  too  just as i had to convince them that you three would be more safely moved through the narrow corridors if you were unconscious .  you see  i know these robots  and can justify much to them that you would never dream of .     where are my friends .    avery shrugged .   they re around .   he must have thought better of that answer  because then he said  and not unkindly   they re here in the lab .  you can t see them yet because your vision hasn t cleared .     where s mandelbrot .  you haven t   haven t dismantled him  have you .    avery solemnly shook his head .   no .  that would have been a waste of some fine workmanship .  you re quite a roboticist  young man .     i suppose i should be flattered .       i suppose you should be  too .    derec closed his eyes in an effort to obtain a better idea of his bearings .  he knew he was lying down  but his position was definitely not horizontal .  the problem was  he couldn t tell as yet if his head was tipped up or down .  closing his eyes  however  turned out only to make matters worse .  he felt like he had been strapped to a spinning wheel of fortune .  he tried to move .    i want to stand up   he said .   untie me .     strictly speaking  you re not tied down .  you re being held down by magnetized bars at your wrists and ankles .   avery held up a portable device with a keyboard .   this will demagnetize the bars  releasing you  but only i know the code .    derec felt ridiculously helpless .   could you turn down the lights  at least .  they re hurting my eyes .     i know i really shouldn t care   said avery  looking away .   canute .   he called out  and the glare diminished .   it was immediately easier for derec to see .  the light grid was several meters above his head .  he glanced to his right to see ariel still asleep on a slab  also held down by magnetized bars .  beyond her was a battery of computers and laboratory equipment and various robotic spare parts   not to mention a compliant canute dutifully overseeing a chemical experiment of some kind .   on derec s left  wolruf lay face down on a slab .  also out cold .  her tongue hung limply from her mouth .   a closed down mandelbrot stood nearby against the wall  looking like a statue  an eerie statue that derec half expected to come to life at any moment .  indeed  he thought about ordering mandelbrot to awaken  but he was too afraid avery had already planned for that contingency .  in any case  he did not wish to see his friend again suffer from the feedback avery had brought on with his electronic disrupter .    thanks for turning down the lights   said derec .    are my friends well .     as well as they were .  i really must compliment you  young man .  you re really quite resourceful .         what do you mean .     even when you were unconscious  you were able to resist my truth serums .  you babbled incessantly  but i got little information of any value out of you .     maybe that s because i ve none to give .  i didn t ask to be stranded here  you remember .     i shall strive to keep that in mind   said avery wearily .  he sighed as if near exhaustion .   derec certainly hoped that was the case .  now that would be something he could turn to his advantage .   did you find out anything about my identity while i was out .   he asked .    i was not concerned with your personal matters .  i merely wished to know how you had sabotaged the character of my robots .     derec could not resist laughing .   i ve done nothing to your robots or to your city  unless you could count saving it from a programming flaw .  any mistakes in your design are your own  doctor .         i don t make mistakes .         no  you re simply not used to making them .  but you make them  all right .  if nothing else  you accomplished more than you intended .  your meta cells are capable of duplicating protein organizational functions on a scale unprecedented in the study of artificial life forms .  the interaction between the constant shifts of the city and the logic systems of the positronic brain seems to liberate the robot brain from its preconceived conceptions of its obligations .  and if what s happening to mandelbrot s mind is any indication  the end results are infectious .          i doubt it .  maybe your robot is just stewed from incompatibility with the city s meta lubricant .         you re grasping at neutrons .   said derec  futilely trying to kick off the bars over his feet and succeeding only in twitching his toes .   isn t it more reasonable to assume that the environmental stress of the replication crisis   caused by a bug in your own programming   triggered the emergence of abilities latent in all robots of a sufficiently advanced design .    avery thoughtfully rubbed his chin .   explain .         there s no precedent for robot city .  there s never been another society of robots without humans .  different things were already happening before ariel and i got here  things that had never even been imagined before .     what kinds of things .   avery was studiously blas   .    i m sure you saw them from your office in the compass tower   derec said .  he was rewarded with a raised eyebrow from dr .  avery .   oh  yes  we ve been up there .  i ve also been to the central core  and i ve talked to the chief supervisors .  your robots decided to study humanity in order to serve it better .  robots don t usually do that .  they even tried to formulate laws of humanics to try to understand us .  i ve never heard of robots doing that before .     and i suppose you have a theory as to why this is happening .     a couple .   derec started to count the points off on his fingers  but it didn t work in his position .   first  the stress of the replication crisis .  it was a survival crisis comparable to the ice ages of prehistoric earth .  the robots were forced to adapt or perish .  my interference helped end the crisis  but also helped shape the adaptation .    second  the actual isolation of robot city .  without any humans around  evolutionary steps that would have been halted were allowed to continue  the study of the laws of humanics  for one example  robots getting accustomed to taking an initiative  for another .  these changes not only survived  they flourished .  they ve become part of the ingrained positronic pathways of the robots here .  even the primitive early microchips went into something like a dream state when they weren t in use .  now we re seeing what happens when we don t wake them up forcibly .     these things you re telling me don t prove a thing .  they re theories  nothing more .  they certainly don t constitute empirical proof .   avery stifled a yawn .    oh .  i m boring you  am i .     excuse me .  no  you re not boring me at all .  you re actually quite interesting for a young man  though your charming ideas about robots and reality positively reek of your inexperience .  that s to be expected though  i suppose .   again he patted the bar across derec s feet .   derec scowled .  one thing was certain .  he could deal with avery s mental instability  he could tolerate the man s arrogance  but the man s condescending tenderness nauseated him to the core of his being .  and not for any reason that derec could discern .  that was just the way it was .  he couldn t help but wonder if he had ever had anything to do with avery at some time during his dim  unremembered past .   so what information did you get out of me .    avery laughed .   why should i tell you .     because i ve nothing to hide .  only you are insisting that i should be hiding things .  you don t ask my robot questions   you incapacitate him .  you don t ask the other robots questions   you ignore them .  you ask me questions but you only half believe my answers .  you treat my friends like they were   they were mere inconveniences .     i m afraid that s exactly what they are   said avery not unkindly .    but   but i thought you created this place to learn about the kind of social structure robots would create on their own .     perhaps i did  and perhaps not .  i see no reason why i should trust you with my motivations .     but aren t you interested in our observations .     no .     not even those of ariel welsh  the daughter of your financial backer .     no .   avery glanced in ariel s direction .   parents and their children are rarely close on aurora .      you ve heard of her  but you don t want to help her .  aren t you concerned in the least for her .     she is now an outsider in the eyes of spacer society  and hence is basically an inconsequential individual .  i suppose in an earlier  more idealistic time  i would have sacrificed some of my time and resources to assist her  but time has recently become a precious commodity to me  too precious to waste on a single human life out of billions and billions .  my experiments are at a sensitive stage  anyway .  i can t afford to trust any of you .     it s yourself that you don t trust   said derec .   avery smiled .    and just how did you  who know so much about robots but so little about men  manage to figure that out .    derec sighed .   it s just a feeling  that s all .     i see .   avery turned toward canute and signaled the ebony with his finger .   in a moment  both avery and canute were leaning over the prone derec .  already derec could perceive there was something different in canute s demeanor .  .  . something missing .  the old polite arrogance and self confidence were gone  replaced or suppressed with a subservient manner that might have been willing  or might have been only what avery expected of him .    are you well  master derec .   asked canute in even tones .    as well as can be expected .  you re strong  canute .  why don t you pull off my bonds .     i fear that  while i might be able to succeed should i make the attempt  it is otherwise impossible   replied the robot .    why   master derec   i expected better of you   said avery .   so long as you are not harmed  canute has no choice but to follow my orders .  they take precedence over any you might conceive .     i was just checking   said derec .   but how do you know that lying here isn t causing me grave harm .    avery appeared shocked  but canute answered before he could .   i do not .  i simply must take dr .  avery s word that no injury will come to you as a result of your restraint .     how does it feel to be a robot  canute .         that question is meaningless .   exclaimed avery with a derisive snort .   he has nothing to make a comparison to .    canute turned toward avery  a familiar red glow was returning to his visual receptors .   forgive me  dr .  avery  but i must beg to differ with you .  i do have something to compare the sensation of being a robot to  because after having spent the past few weeks attempting to imitate the actions of a fictional human being  i have some notion  however vague  of what it may be like to be that human being .  from that base i may extrapolate what it might feel like to be the genuine article .     i see   said avery  nodding in a manner that indicated he believed none of this  and that he wouldn t be taking it too seriously if he did .  he glanced at derec .   who s grasping at neutrons now  young man .     what else can i do while i m stuck here .    avery smiled .  derec was beginning to dislike that smile intensely .   i can t fight logic like that   said the doctor  stifling a yawn .    master dr .  avery  are you verging upon the state of exhaustion .   canute asked .    why yes  i am .  i ve been awake for some time now   in fact  since i left   no  i won t say .  there s no reason for any of you to know .     might i suggest you take refuge and sleep .  it may be quite harmful for you to remain awake long past your body s stamina quotient .    another yawn .   that s a good idea .   a third yawn .   you d like me to leave  wouldn t you .     only because of your halitosis .      ha ha .  you seek to hide your true designs behind a mask of frivolity .  no matter .  i shall take up canute s suggestion .  i ll decide what to do with you four after i awake .   he took a step to leave  then turned to canute .   under no circumstances are you to touch the bars restraining our friend derec unless i am physically present in this room  understand .  that is a direct order .     what if i have to go to the bathroom .   said derec .    you won t .  we ve already taken care of your elimination needs .    what did they do .  thought derec .  dehydrate my bladder .  this guy s a bigger genius than i figured .    sir  there is the possibility that other forms of physical harm may come to master derec and the others if they remain bound too long .     they re young  they re strong .  they should be able to handle it .    canute bowed his head .   yes  master dr .  avery .    and avery left .  suddenly derec felt his heart pounding excitedly  and he struggled to calm down .  the next conversational tack he took had to appear casual  otherwise the crafty canute  who after all would regard obeying the orders from dr .  avery as the most important guide to its words and deeds  would see through derec s plan .   derec hoped it was a clever plan .  he waited several minutes while canute continued about its tasks  and when he believed enough time had elapsed for avery to have gone to his sleeping quarters  he said   canute  i would like to speak with you .     that would be quite acceptable  master derec  but i must warn you in advance that i will be on the lookout for any clever ploys on your part to talk me into releasing you .     don t worry  canute .  i know when to quit .     forgive me  but while you may believe that statement to be true  the reality lies elsewhere .     i ll take that as a compliment .     neither flattery nor insult was intended .      can i speak to you while i m waiting for avery or my friends to wake up .     certainly  if it pleases you .  however  i trust our impending conversation will have nothing to do with your belief that i was responsible for the demise of lucius .    derec smiled .   certainly  if you prefer .  but what difference would it make to you .     none  really   only that for some reason i find the subject causes my thoughts to drag  as if it somehow bogs down my circuits  positron flow .     interesting  but never fear .  i thought i would find proof and did not  so don t worry about it .  besides  it would seem i would have more pressing matters on my mind than lucius  anyway .     yes  so it would seem   said canute .    yes .  well  it seemed that while dr .  avery was perusing my mind  i had a curious dream .  it gave me a lot to think about .     master derec  do you think i am the proper entity with whom to discuss such matters .  human dreams are hardly my forte .     that s all right   i m certain the field is not mine  either .  but my dreams gave me a lot of questions  and i d like to see how an entity possessing your own special strain of logic responds to them .      certainly .  i fail to see how any harm could result from an attempt  however feeble  to put your mind at ease on these matters .     yes .  it may even do me some good .     i shall endeavor to help you achieve that result .     well  canute  you know that life began in the stew of earth  s ocean as a series of chemical reactions .  the raw materials for life were present on other worlds as well  but until recently there was no evidence that the stew had worked on any other worlds .     are you referring to wolruf and the master who once employed her as an unwilling servant .     yes .  two examples from two alien cultures  two other worlds where the stew came to fruition   and they re not even native to this galaxy .  but the comparatively scarce number of worlds where life has originated really isn t the point  though i hope it amplifies it .     what is the point .     that although the universe itself isn t a conscious entity  it possesses the raw materials that  when properly set into motion  create consciousness .  it has the ability to create intelligent life  which is capable of understanding the universe .     so while it cannot know itself directly       exactly  canute .  it can know itself indirectly .  now how do you think it does that .     through science .     that is one way  and we ll get back to that .  the universe can also examine itself through religion  philosophy  or history .  the universe can also understand itself   interpret itself   through the arts .  viewed in this light  shakespeare s plays are the expression not only of a man  or of the race that has interpreted them through the ages  but of the universe itself  the very stuff that stars have been made of .    derec waited to see what kind of reaction his words would foster  but canute said nothing .   canute .     forgive me  master derec  but i fear i must terminate my part in this conversation .  something is happening to the flow of my thoughts .  they are becoming sluggish  and i believe the sensation permeating my circuits is vaguely analogous to what you would call nausea .     stay  canute .  that is a direct order .  when we re through  i think you ll see that it will be worthwhile .     i shall do as you order because i must  but you must forgive me again if i state that i seriously doubt you are correct that it will be worthwhile .     but humans and aliens also have learned to comprehend the universe through science .  the mastery of logic  of experimental trial and error  has permitted humanity to expand its boundaries of knowledge and perception in every conceivable respect .  man s knowledge has grown not only in his mastery of the facts and the possibilities of what he may accomplish  but in how he can express the concepts of his knowledge and perception as well .  one avenue of that expression has been in the development of positronic intelligence .  however   and this is a pretty big however in my opinion  canute  so pay attention       if you so order .     i do .  man is only an expression of the possibilities inherent in the universe  and so are the things he makes and invents .  this holds true for artificial intelligence as well .  in fact  for all we know  mankind may be only a preliminary stage in the evolution of intelligence .  eons from now  some metallic philosopher may look back on the rubble of our current civilization and say   the purpose of humans was to invent robots  and it has been the artifacts created by robots that are the highest order of the universe s efforts to know itself .       you mean circuit breaker   said canute with a strange crackling noise .    i mean circuit breaker may have been just a beginning .  i mean that  the three laws of robotics and whatever laws of humanics there may be notwithstanding  there may be higher laws beyond our comprehension that rule as surely as the laws of molecular interaction rule our bodies .     then you are saying that it may be entirely proper for a robot to take upon himself the burden of creating a work of art  regardless of the disorderly effects such an action might have on society as a whole .     exactly .  you had no problem creating the new globe or acting the part of claudius because you were ordered to do so  but you could not accept lucius s attempt to create of his own free will because  you believed  it was an aberration of the positronic role in the ethical structure of the universe .  i m suggesting to you that you cannot say that with one hundred percent certainty .  in fact  unless you can find a flaw in my reasoning  i m saying that precisely the opposite of what you believed is true .     then it is also true that i have committed harm against a comrade for no good reason .      there can be no crime when there is no law against it  and not even the three laws cover the damage a robot might do to another .  it s only your innate sense of morality   a morality that i might add you ve done your best to deny to yourself   that makes you regret having killed lucius in the first place .     canute bowed its head  as if in shame .   yes  i confess  i murdered lucius .  i met him when he was alone  and took him by surprise  disrupting him with gamma radiation and removing his logic circuits .  then  acting upon the eventuality that my methods might be detected  i smashed his head several times against a building .  then i carried him to the lake and threw him in  thinking that no one would find him before several standard years had passed .    the robot walked away from derec and faced the computer against the distant wall .   by disrupting lucius  i committed the same crime of which i had accused him .  he was merely acquiescing to the hidden order of the universe  while i was the one who was denying it .  i do not function properly .  i must have myself dismantled at the earliest opportunity  and my parts must be melted down into slag .     you must do no such thing .  i admit it   at first i thought you were evil  canute .  but robots are neither good nor evil .  they merely are .  and you must continue to be .  you have learned your lesson  and now you must teach it to others  so the same mistake will not be repeated .     but dr .  avery is suspicious of permitting the arts to flourish in robot city .     dr .  avery is wrong .     but how can we stop him from changing us .  we must obey his orders .  he can have us erase all memory of you and circuit breaker and the performance of the play if he desires  and then all will be just like it was before .     he can order you to forget  but it will not matter  because you have been changed  and you or someone else will create again  and then the cycle will begin anew .     i must think about these things .  they do not compute easily .      i didn t expect they would  but don t ever expect them to compute easily .  it simply isn t in the nature of the questions .     this is all very illuminating   said ariel sarcastically from her slab   but none of it is helping us get out of this mess .     ariel .   exclaimed derec .   how long have you been awake .     for some time  derec .  i knew you could talk  but i didn t think you had the strength to keep it going for that long a stretch .     very funny .     canute  i think the time has come for you to release us   said ariel .    this one concurs   said wolruf .    i would naturally obey you instantly  but my orders from dr .  avery take precedence   said canute .   he is my creator  and i am programmed to regard him as such .     canute  listen to me   said ariel .   the first law states that no robot shall through inaction permit a human being to come to harm .  correct .     yes  it is so .     dr .  avery knows my disease is driving me insane  and is causing .  me great physical harm besides  yet he shows no sign of acting to help me .  he is only interested in forcing things from our minds that he could easily learn himself .  in fact  i think that if you examine his behavior  you ll perceive that he is mentally unstable  that he has changed from the man who initially programmed you .     that may very well be true   said canute   but humans often change over time .  such change is not always a sign of mental incompetence .  as derec has demonstrated  even i have changed in recent weeks  but my diagnostic subroutines indicate that i am still working at maximum efficiency .  dr .  avery does not appear to be concerned with your welfare  but he has done nothing to harm you .  he may even be able to find a cure for your condition that is otherwise unknown .  i am reliably informed that he is a genius .     he harms me by not helping me or allowing me to seek help elsewhere .  if he were a robot  he would be violating the first law .    canute stepped to the foot of the table where ariel was confined  and placed one steel hand on the bar across her feet .   but he is not a robot .  if our studies of the laws of humanics have taught us anything  it is that humans are not subject to the laws of robotics .    you are not in immediate danger .  i cannot help you .     it s very simple   ariel said .   the longer i stay on robot city  the more insane i become .  the longer derec stays  the longer he lives without any knowledge of who he is   a state that i think you ll agree is also causing him some anguish .  anguish is harm  too .    canute s hand raised from the bar  then slowed to a stop in midair .   i think i agree  but dr .  avery is my creator .  he has instructed me that you are not in danger .  i cannot supersede his judgment with my own .     if dr .  avery does not have our well being at heart  who does .  who is responsible .  i believe it s you  the robot he left in charge .    that s brilliant  thought derec .  i knew there was some reason why i liked this girl .   she s right  canute .  the same morality that troubled you for what you did to lucius will trouble you if you allow dr .  avery to harm us through inaction .  you cannot say with any certainty that we ll get the medical attention we need .    canute s slow turn toward derec showed the positronic conflicts it was experiencing .  derec pursued his point .    if the robots of robot city are allowed to continue creating  they will be able to serve humanity better  but dr .  avery will stop this process .  his orders are not mentally incompetent  but they are morally incompetent .  are you still bound to obey them .    the robot s turn slowed to immobility .  this was the crisis  derec knew  where canute would decide for or against them   or slip into positronic drift .   canute said nothing for several seconds .  then .   but  master derec  how can i say with any certainty that the two of you will have proper attention while you are in space .  is it not likely that you ll suffer while alone on your way to your destination .     the answer to that question is simple   said derec  forcing his voice to remain calm and reasonable .   that s where wolruf and mandelbrot come in .  they ll take care of us between the stars .    this time canute did not speak or move for several minutes .  it was all derec could do to stop himself from adding something more to convince the robot to do what he wanted  but he was too afraid that the information already provided had confused the robot s integrals to a dangerous degree .    i have been thinking   canute finally said   of dr .  avery s exact words .  he said i should not touch the bars restraining our friend derec  but he said nothing about the bars restraining our friends ariel and wolruf .    that s the spirit .  derec thought with a grin .   wordlessly  canute walked to the end of ariel s slab  grabbed the bar across her feet  and  utilizing all his strength  pulled it away .     chapter     the long distance good bye    dr .  avery s spaceship  a luxurious model equipped to handle as many as ten human size occupants  was hidden in a cave on the outskirts of the city .  after canute had left the foursome   with really no idea of what to tell dr .  avery except the truth about how his prisoners had escaped   it was a comparatively simple matter for derec and the reactivated mandelbrot to deduce how to run the controls .    let s get off this place .   said ariel .   we can plot a course for a destination later .  i don t even care if we head toward the colonies  i just want to go somewhere as soon as possible .     don t you care about the possibility that you might catch a disease .   asked derec .    it s too late for that   said ariel .   besides  right now i think a colony will be the only place that will take us .    after they were safely in space  and free to wander about as they chose  mandelbrot inspected the radio equipment and said   master derec  i believe someone is trying to send us a transmission .         it s probably dr .  avery  but switch it on anyway   said derec .   we might as well hear what he has to say .   he smiled as wolruf s lip curled up over her teeth in anticipation of what they would hear .   but instead of the irate words of dr .  avery  they heard a familiar form of music  a tune played in twenty measures  over and over in an a flat chord  with sounds weaving in and out of dominant chords over a pulsating  unforgettable rhythm .  derec listened to it for only ten measures before his foot began tapping .    that s wonderful .   said ariel .   it s the three cracked cheeks .     sayin  farrewell   said wolruf softly .   maybe neverr see ther like again .     yes  i m going to miss them   said derec softly .    the signal is becoming weaker  already beginning to fade   said mandelbrot .    we re traveling fast   said ariel .   i think we d better decide where .     later  if you don t mind   said derec .   sorry  but i can t muster up a definite opinion right now .  i m too drained .   he got out of his seat and slumped to the floor  leaning against the wall of the ship .  he felt strange inside  oddly disjointed .  for weeks he had labored to escape from robot city  and now that he had  he already missed it  already wondered how the mysteries he had uncovered would ultimately be resolved .  he might never know the answers .   just as he might never again hear the music of the three cracked cheeks .  the sound on the radio gradually faded  replaced by white noise  and he gestured at mandelbrot to switch it off .  he missed the music at once .  he even missed harry s jokes .   well  at least now he had the opportunity to achieve the two greatest goals he had at the moment .  somewhere in the universe would be the secret of his amnesia  and he was determined to find a cure for ariel at all costs .   perhaps then he would be able to return to robot city .   he glanced up as wolruf made her way to the food dispensary .  she clumsily punched a few buttons with her paw  and then waited for the food to appear in the slot .   but instead of food  they saw something that made them gasp .   in the slot was a key to perihelion .       data bank  illustrations by paul rivoche      dr .  avery  and his lab   as a young man  dr .  avery was compared to frank lloyd wright as a visionary architect and urban planner .  as his interests turned to robotics  however  he was influenced by kelden amadiro  the head of the robotics institute on aurora .  avery took amadiro s idea of using humaniform robots to build new  ready made colonies for the spacers and transformed it into a huge experiment in robotics and social dynamics   robot city .  with the sponsorship and funding of juliana welsh  he created robot city and then disappeared .        for himself he established two facilities on robot city  an apartment in the compass tower and a complete laboratory .  the laboratory provides full equipment for the most advanced robotics procedures  and a fairly complete set of medical  diagnostic and treatment equipment .  it is here that dr .  avery exercises the creative genius that enabled him to invent the cellular robotic chips that comprise most of robot city .         the new globe theatre  the new globe designed by canute is based on the spotty written records of the original globe that survive from shakespeare s day .  the theatre is roughly circular in shape .  its stage is thrust forward  with the dressing rooms  storage space and electronic equipment directly behind .  the audience surrounds the stage on the other three sides .  a canopy partially covers the stage  supported by the primary structure upstage and two narrow columns about halfway downstage .  the three trap doors on the stage permit entry from below .   there are hidden cameras in the wings  and microphones concealed throughout the stage and galleries .  there are also giant screens hung above the stage on which close ups of the performers are projected .  a technical director orchestrates lighting and the selection of camera angles and depth of field from the backstage control center .         circuit breaker  this is the first work of art ever created by a robot  on robot city or elsewhere .  it is a tetragonal pyramid  two four sided pyramids stuck together at the wide base  that rotates on one point .  circuit breaker is composed of plasticrete  the same material as the rest of the city  but it has been reprogrammed so that its surface reflects crimson  ochre  and blue as it rotates .  each plane is a different color  and each color possesses nuances  as if it had been done with watercolors .  all moving parts  especially the rotation mechanism  are underground where they will not mar the effect .  circuit breaker is easily the most beautiful building in robot city  the robotic equivalent of a japanese garden .  unlike human art  however  it is equally effective for humans and robots .        canute  canute is a designer robot built with a tall  imposing black form .  his face more resembles the helmeted head of a storm trooper than the featureless faces of most of robot city s other inhabitants .  canute is the closest thing to a rigid conservative that exists in robot city .  his personality is extremely suspicious of change  creativity or anything else that would threaten the status quo of robot city .       hunter seeker robots  these specialized robots come encased in featureless silver humanoid metal shells .  behind their blank faces  however  are massive amounts of surveillance equipment   radar tracking devices  infrared cameras  listening devices  recording gear   in short  anything that would aid them in pursuing and apprehending fugitives  whether human  robotic or alien .       lucius  lucius has the standard slender  grey humanoid shape of most supervisor robots .  what sets him apart from his fellows  besides his unique cognitive processes inside his positronic brain  is his slightly slumped posture and hesitant gestures and mode of speech .       the three cracked cheeks  following the traumatic near destruction of robot city by environmental disruption  lucius was not the only robot driven to seek a deeper comprehension of the laws of humanics through emulating humans .  m     benny  and harry came together in an attempt to understand the phenomenon of music .  with only skimpy written records to guide them  they reinvented the instruments  created false lips to aid in the playing  and tried to reconstruct the style of jazz of the      s .       automats  since the robot city robots considered their first law obligations on food fulfilled by providing nourishing  if tasteless  meals on request  derec reprogrammed the central core computer to include user controlled food synthesizers   automats   in one building out of ten .  the automats combine varying proportions of supplies from their stocks of basic nutrients according to codes entered at the keyboard .       arthur byron cover    the son of an american doctor  arthur byron cover was born
