life and times of multivac     the winnowing     the bicentennial man     marching in     old fashioned     the tercentenary incident      birth of a notion        dedicated to   judy lynn del rey       and the swath she is cutting in our field     here i am with another collection of science fiction stories  and i sit here and think  with more than a little astonishment  that i have been writing and publishing science fiction now for just three eighths of a century .  this isn   t bad for someone who only admits to being in his late youth or a little over thirty  if pinned down .    it seems longer than that  i imagine  to most people who have tried to follow me from book to book and from field to field .  as the flood of words continues year after year with no visible signs of letting up  the most peculiar misapprehensions naturally arise .    just a few weeks ago  for instance  i was at a librarian   s convention signing books  and some of the kindly remarks i received were       i can   t believe you   re still alive .          but how can you possibly look so young .          are you really only one person .       it goes even beyond that .  in a review of one of my books  asimov on chemistry  doubleday         and it was a very favorable review .   in the december      scientific american  i was described as     once a boston biochemist  now label and linchpin of a new york corporate authorship        dear me .  corporate authorship .  merely the linchpin and label .    it   s not so .  i   m sorry  if my copious output makes it seem impossible  but i   m alive  i   m young  and i   m only one person .    in fact  i   m an absolutely one man operation .  i have no assistants of any kind .  i have no agent  no business manager  no research aides  no secretary  no stenographer .  i do all my own typing  all my own proofreading  all my own indexing  all my own research  all my own letter writing  all my own telephone answering .    i like it that way .  since i don   t have to deal with other people  i can concentrate more properly on my work  and get more done .    i was already worrying about this misapprehension concerning myself ten years ago .  at that time  the magazine of fantasy and science fiction   commonly known as f   sf  was planning a special isaac asimov issue for october      .  i was asked for a new story to be included and i obliged  that story was the key  and it appears in my collection asimov   s mysteries  doubleday        .     but i also wrote a short poem on my own initiative .    that poem appeared in the special issue and it has never appeared anywhere else until now .  i   m going to include it here because it   s appropriate to my thesis .  then  too  seven years after the poem appeared  i recited it to a charming maiden  who  without any sign of mental effort  immediately suggested a change that was so inevitable  and so great an improvement  that i have to get the poem into print again in order to make that change .    i originally called the poem i   m in the prime of life  you rotten kid .  edward l .  ferman  editor of f   sf  shortened that to the prime of life .  i like the longer version much better  but i decided it would look odd on the contents page  so i   m keeping the shorter version .   heck .        the prime of life     it was  in truth  an eager youth who halted me one day .   he gazed in bliss at me  and this is what he had to say        why  mazel tov  it   s asimov  a blessing on your head .   for many a year  i   ve lived in fear that you were long since dead .     or if alive  one fifty five cold years had passed you by   and left you weak  with poor physique  thin hair and rheumy eye .     for sure enough  i   ve read your stuff since i was but a lad  and couldn   t spell or hardly tell the good yarns from the bad .   my father  too  was reading you before he met my ma .   for you he yearned  once he had learned about you from his pa .   since time began  you wondrous man  my ancestors did love  that s . f .  dean and writing machine the aged asimov .        i   d had my fill .  i said     be still .  i   ve kept my old time spark .   my step is light  my eye is bright  my hair is thick and dark .        his smile  in brief  spelled disbelief  so this is what i did   i scowled  you know  and with one blow  i killed that rotten kid .      the change i mentioned occurs in the first line of the second stanza .  i had it read  originally     why  stars above  it   s asimov     but the aforementioned maiden saw at once it ought to be    mazel tov .     this is a hebrew phrase meaning    good fortune    and it is used by jews as a joyful greeting on jubilant occasions  as a meeting with me should surely be .   .    ten years have passed since i wrote the poem and  of course  the impression of incredible age which i leave among those who know me only from my writings is now even stronger .  when this poem was written  i had published a mere    books  and now  ten years later  the score stands at      so that it   s been a decade of constant mental conflagration .    just the same  i   ve kept my old time spark even yet .  my step is still light and my eye is still bright .  what   s more  i   m as suave in my conversations with young women as i have ever been  which is very suave indeed  .  that bit about my hair being    thick and dark    must be modified  however .  there is no danger of baldness but  oh me  i am turning gray .  in recent years  i have grown a generous pair of fluffy sideburns  and they are almost white .    and now that you know the worst about me  let   s go on to the stories themselves or  rather  for you are not quite through with me   to my introductory comments to the first story .   the beginning of feminine intuition is tied up with judy lynn benjamin  whom i met at the world science fiction convention in new york city in      .  judy lynn has to be seen to be believed an incredibly intelligent  quick witted  hard driving woman who seems to be burning constantly with a bright radioactive glow .    she was managing editor of galaxy in those days .    on march           she married that lovable old curmudgeon lester del rey  and knocked off all his rough edges in two seconds flat .  at present  as judy lynn del rey  she is a senior editor at ballantine books and is generally recognized  especially by me  as one of the top editors in the business .   you may have noticed that this book is dedicated to her .     back in       when judy lynn was still at galaxy  we were sitting in a bar in a new york hotel and she introduced me  i remember  to something called a    grasshopper .     i told her i didn   t drink because i had no capacity for alcohol  but she said i would like this one  and the trouble is i did .    it   s a green cocktail with creme de menthe  and cream  and who knows what else in it  and it is delicious .  i only had one on this occasion  so i merely graduated to a slightly higher than normal level of the loud bonhomie that usually characterizes me and was still sober enough to talk business .   a year or so later during the course of a science fiction convention  judy lynn persuaded me to have two grasshoppers and i was instantly reduced to a kind of wild drunken merriment  and since then no one lets me have grasshoppers any more .  just as well .     judy lynn suggested i write a story about a female robot .  well  of course  my robots are sexually neutral  but they all have masculine names and i treat them all as males .  the turnabout suggestion was good .    i said     gee  that   s an interesting idea     and was awfully pleased  because ed ferman had asked me for a story with which to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of fantasy and science fiction and i had agreed  but  at the moment  did not have an idea in my head .    on february          in line with the suggestion  i began feminine intuition .  when it was done  ed took it and the story was indeed included in the october      fantasy and science fiction  the twentieth anniversary issue .  it appeared as the lead novelette  too .    between the time i sold it  however  and the time it appeared  judy lynn said casually to me one day     did you ever do anything about my idea that you write a story about a female robot .       i said enthusiastically     yes  i did  judy lynn  and ed ferman is going to publish it .  thanks for the suggestion .       judy lynn   s eyes opened wide and she said in a very dangerous voice     stories based on my ideas go to me  you dummy .  you don   t sell them to the competition .       she went on to expound on that theme for about half an hour and my attempts to explain that ed had asked me for a story before the time of the suggestion and that she had never quite made it clear that she wanted the story for herself were brushed aside with scorn .    anyway  judy lynn  here   s the story again  and i   m freely admitting that the suggestion of a female robot was yours .  does that make everything all right .   no  i didn   t think so .        feminine intuition     the three laws of robotics     .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .    for the first time in the history of united states robots and mechanical men corporation  a robot had been destroyed through accident on earth itself .    no one was to blame .  the air vehicle had been demolished in mid air and an unbelieving investigating committee was wondering whether they really dared announce the evidence that it had been hit by a meteorite .  nothing else could have been fast enough to prevent automatic avoidance  nothing else could have done the damage short of a nuclear blast and that was out of the question .    tie that in with a report of a flash in the night sky just before the vehicle had exploded  and from flagstaff observatory  not from an amateur  and the location of a sizable and distinctly meteoric bit of iron freshly gouged into the ground a mile from the site and what other conclusion could be arrived at .    still  nothing like that had ever happened before and calculations of the odds against it yielded monstrous figures .  yet even colossal improbabilities can happen sometimes .    at the offices of united states robots  the hows and whys of it were secondary .  the real point was that a robot had been destroyed .    that  in itself  was distressing .    the fact that jn   had been a prototype  the first  after four earlier attempts  to have been placed in the field  was even more distressing .    the fact that jn   was a radically new type of robot  quite different from anything ever built before  was abysmally distressing .    the fact that jn   had apparently accomplished something before its destruction that was incalculably important and that that accomplishment might now be forever gone  placed the distress utterly beyond words .    it seemed scarcely worth mentioning that  along with the robot  the chief robopsychologist of united states robots had also died .    clinton madarian had joined the firm ten years before .  for five of those years  he had worked uncomplainingly under the grumpy supervision of susan calvin .    madarian   s brilliance was quite obvious and susan calvin had quietly promoted him over the heads of older men .  she wouldn   t  in any case  have deigned to give her reasons for this to research director peter bogert  but as it happened  no reasons were needed .  or  rather  they were obvious .    madarian was utterly the reverse of the renowned dr .  calvin in several very noticeable ways .  he was not quite as overweight as his distinct double chin made him appear to be  but even so he was overpowering in his presence  where susan had gone nearly unnoticed .  madarian   s massive face  his shock of glistening red brown hair  his ruddy complexion and booming voice  his loud laugh  and most of all  his irrepressible self confidence and his eager way of announcing his successes  made everyone else in the room feel there was a shortage of space .    when susan calvin finally retired  refusing  in advance  any cooperation with respect to any testimonial dinner that might be planned in her honor  with so firm a manner that no announcement of the retirement was even made to the news services  madarian took her place .    he had been in his new post exactly one day when he initiated the jn project .    it had meant the largest commitment of funds to one project that united states robots had ever had to weigh  but that was something which madarian dismissed with a genial wave of the hand .       worth every penny of it  peter     he said .     and i expect you to convince the board of directors of that .          give me reasons     said bogert  wondering if madarian would .  susan calvin had never given reasons .    but madarian said     sure     and settled himself easily into the large armchair in the director   s office .    bogert watched the other with something that was almost awe .  his own once black hair was almost white now and within the decade he would follow susan into retirement .  that would mean the end of the original team that had built united states robots into a globe girdling firm that was a rival of the national governments in complexity and importance .  somehow neither he nor those who had gone before him ever quite grasped the enormous expansion of the firm .    but this was a new generation .  the new men were at ease with the colossus    they lacked the touch of wonder that would have them tiptoeing in disbelief .  so they moved ahead  and that was good .    madarian said     i propose to begin the construction of robots without constraint .          without the three laws .  surely           no  peter .  are those the only constraints you can think of .  hell  you contributed to the design of the early positronic brains .  do i have to tell you that  quite aside from the three laws  there isn   t a pathway in those brains that isn   t carefully designed and fixed .  we have robots planned for specific tasks  implanted with specific abilities .          and you propose           that at every level below the three laws  the paths be made open ended .  it   s not difficult .       bogert said dryly     it   s not difficult  indeed .  useless things are never difficult .  the difficult thing is fixing the paths and making the robot useful .          but why is that difficult .  fixing the paths requires a great deal of effort because the principle of uncertainty is important in particles the mass of positrons and the uncertainty effect must be minimized .  yet why must it .  if we arrange to have the principle just sufficiently prominent to allow the crossing of paths unpredictably           we have an unpredictable robot .          we have a creative robot     said madarian  with a trace of impatience .     peter  if there   s anything a human brain has that a robotic brain has never had  it   s the trace of unpredictability that comes from the effects of uncertainty at the subatomic level .  i admit that this effect has never been demonstrated experimentally within the nervous system  but without that the human brain is not superior to the robotic brain in principle .          and you think that if you introduce the effect into the robotic brain  the human brain will become not superior to the robotic brain in principle .          that      said madarian     is exactly what i believe .     they went on for a long time after that .    the board of directors clearly had no intention of being easily convinced .    scott robertson  the largest shareholder in the firm  said     it   s hard enough to manage the robot industry as it is  with public hostility to robots forever on the verge of breaking out into the open .  if the public gets the idea that robots will be uncontrolled .  .  . oh  don   t tell me about the three laws .  the average man won   t believe the three laws will protect him if he as much as hears the word    uncontrolled .              then don   t use it      said madarian .     call the robot  call it    intuitive .              an intuitive robot      someone muttered .     a girl robot .     a smile made its way about the conference table .    madarian seized on that .     all right .  a girl robot .  our robots are sexless  of course  and so will this one be  but we always act as though they   re males .  we give them male pet names and call them he and him .  now this one  if we consider the nature of the mathematical structuring of the brain which i have proposed  would fall into the jn coordinate system .  the first robot would be jn    and i   ve assumed that it would be called john    .  .  .  . i   m afraid that is the level of originality of the average roboticist .  but why not call it jane    damn it .  if the public has to be let in on what we   re doing  we   re constructing a feminine robot with intuition .       robertson shook his head     what difference would that make .  what you   re saying is that you plan to remove the last barrier which  in principle  keeps the robotic brain inferior to the human brain .  what do you suppose the public reaction will be to that .          do you plan to make that public .     said madarian .  he thought a bit and then said     look .  one thing the general public believes is that women are not as intelligent as men .       there was an instant apprehensive look on the face of more than one man at the table and a quick look up and down as though susan calvin were still in her accustomed seat .    madarian said     if we announce a female robot  it doesn   t matter what she is .  the public will automatically assume she is mentally backward .  we just publicize the robot as jane   and we don   t have to say another word .  we   re safe .          actually     said peter bogert quietly     there   s more to it than that .  madarian and i have gone over the mathematics carefully and the jn series  whether john or jane  would be quite safe .  they would be less complex and intellectually capable  in an orthodox sense  than many another series we have designed and constructed .  there would only be the one added factor of  well  let   s get into the habit of calling it    intuition .              who knows what it would do .     muttered robertson .       madarian has suggested one thing it can do .  as you all know  the space jump has been developed in principle .  it is possible for men to attain what is  in effect  hyper speeds beyond that of light and to visit other stellar systems and return in negligible time  weeks at the most .       robertson said     that   s not new to us .  it couldn   t have been done without robots .          exactly  and it   s not doing us any good because we can   t use the hyper speed drive except perhaps once as a demonstration  so that u .  s .  robots gets little credit .  the space jump is risky  it   s fearfully prodigal of energy and therefore it   s enormously expensive .  if we were going to use it anyway  it would be nice if we could report the existence of a habitable planet .  call it a psychological need .  spend about twenty billion dollars on a single space jump and report nothing but scientific data and the public wants to know why their money was wasted .  report the existence of a habitable planet  and you   re an interstellar columbus and no one will worry about the money .          so .          so where are we going to find a habitable planet .  or put it this way  which star within reach of the space jump as presently developed  which of the three hundred thousand stars and star systems within three hundred light years has the best chance of having a habitable planet .  we   ve got an enormous quantity of details on every star in our three hundred light year neighborhood and a notion that almost every one has a planetary system .  but which has a habitable planet .  which do we visit .  .  .  . we don   t know .       one of the directors said     how would this jane robot help us .       madarian was about to answer that  but he gestured slightly to bogert and bogert understood .  the director would carry more weight .  bogert didn   t particularly like the idea  if the jn series proved a fiasco  he was making himself prominent enough in connection with it to insure that the sticky fingers of blame would cling to him .  on the other hand  retirement was not all that far off  and if it worked  he would go out in a blaze of glory .  maybe it was only madarian   s aura of confidence  but bogert had honestly come to believe it would work .    he said     it may well be that somewhere in the libraries of data we have on those stars  there are methods for estimating the probabilities of the presence of earth type habitable planets .  all we need to do is understand the data properly  look at them in the appropriate creative manner  make the correct correlations .  we haven   t done it yet .  or if some astronomer has  he hasn   t been smart enough to realize what he has .       a jn type robot could make correlations far more rapidly and far more precisely than a man could .  in a day  it would make and discard as many correlations as a man could in ten years .  furthermore  it would work in truly random fashion  whereas a man would have a strong bias based on preconception and on what is already believed .       there was a considerable silence after that finally robertson said     but it   s only a matter of probability  isn   t it .  suppose this robot said     the highest probability habitable planet star within so and so light years is squidgee       or whatever  and we go there and find that a probability is only a probability and that there are no habitable planets after all .  where does that leave us .       madarian struck in this time .     we still win .  we know how the robot came to the conclusion because it  she  will tell us .  it might well help us gain enormous insight into astronomical detail and make the whole thing worthwhile even if we don   t make the space jump at all .  besides  we can then work out the five most probable sites of planets and the probability that one of the five has a habitable planet may then be better than   .    .  it would be almost sure        they went on for a long time after that .    the funds granted were quite insufficient  but madarian counted on the habit of throwing good money after bad .  with two hundred million about to be lost irrevocably when another hundred million could save everything  the other hundred million would surely be voted .    jane   was finally built and put on display .  peter bogert studied it   her  gravely .  he said     why the narrow waist .  surely that introduces a mechanical weakness .       madarian chuckled .     listen  if we   re going to call her jane  there   s no point in making her look like tarzan .       bogert shook his head .     don   t like it .  you   ll be bulging her higher up to give the appearance of breasts next  and that   s a rotten idea .  if women start getting the notion that robots may look like women  i can tell you exactly the kind of perverse notions they   ll get  and you   ll really have hostility on their part .       madarian said     maybe you   re right at that .  no woman wants to feel replaceable by something with none of her faults .  okay .       jane   did not have the pinched waist .  she was a somber robot which rarely moved and even more rarely spoke .    madarian had only occasionally come rushing to bogert with items of news during her construction and that had been a sure sign that things were going poorly .  madarian   s ebullience under success was overpowering .  he would not hesitate to invade bogert   s bedroom at   a . m .  with a hot flash item rather than wait for the morning .  bogert was sure of that .    now madarian seemed subdued  his usually florid expression nearly pale  his round cheeks somehow pinched .  bogert said  with a feeling of certainty     she won   t talk .          oh  she talks .     madarian sat down heavily and chewed at his lower lip .     sometimes  anyway     he said .    bogert rose and circled the robot .     and when she talks  she makes no sense  i suppose .  well  if she doesn   t talk  she   s no female  is she .       madarian tried a weak smile for size and abandoned it .  he said     the brain  in isolation  checked out .          i know     said bogert .     but once that brain was put in charge of the physical apparatus of the robot  it was necessarily modified  of course .          of course     agreed bogert unhelpfully .     but unpredictably and frustratingly .  the trouble is that when you   re dealing with n dimensional calculus of uncertainty  things are           uncertain .     said bogert .  his own reaction was surprising him .  the company investment was already most sizable and almost two years had elapsed  yet the results were  to put it politely  disappointing .  still  he found himself jabbing at madarian and finding himself amused in the process .    almost furtively  bogert wondered if it weren   t the absent susan calvin he was jabbing at .  madarian was so much more ebullient and effusive than susan could ever possibly be  when things were going well .  he was also far more vulnerably in the dumps when things weren   t going well  and it was precisely under pressure that susan never cracked .  the target that madarian made could be a neatly punctured bull   s eye as recompense for the target susan had never allowed herself to be .    madarian did not react to bogert   s last remark any more than susan calvin would have done  not out of contempt  which would have been susan   s reaction  but because he did not hear it   he said argumentatively     the trouble is the matter of recognition .  we have jane   correlating magnificently .  she can correlate on any subject  but once she   s done so  she can   t recognize a valuable result from a valueless one .  it   s not an easy problem  judging how to program a robot to tell a significant correlation when you don   t know what correlations she will be making .          i presume you   ve thought of lowering the potential at the w    diode junction and sparking across the           no  no  no  no      madarian faded off into a whispering diminuendo .     you can   t just have it spew out everything .  we can do that for ourselves .  the point is to have it recognize the crucial correlation and draw the conclusion .  once that is done  you see  a jane robot would snap out an answer by intuition .  it would be something we couldn   t get ourselves except by the oddest kind of luck .          it seems to me     said bogert dryly     that if you had a robot like that  you would have her do routinely what  among human beings  only the occasional genius is capable of doing .       madarian nodded vigorously .     exactly  peter .  i   d have said so myself if i weren   t afraid of frightening off the execs .  please don   t repeat that in their hearing .          do you really want a robot genius .          what are words .  i   m trying to get a robot with the capacity to make random correlations at enormous speeds  together with a key significance high recognition quotient .  and i   m trying to put those words into positronic field equations .  i thought i had it  too  but i don   t .  not yet .       he looked at jane   discontentedly and said     what   s the best significance you have  jane .       jane     s head turned to look at madarian but she made no sound  and madarian whispered with resignation     she   s running that into the correlation banks .       jane   spoke tonelessly at last .     i   m not sure .     it was the first sound she had made .    madarian   s eyes rolled upward .     she   s doing the equivalent of setting up equations with indeterminate solutions .          i gathered that     said bogert .     listen  madarian  can you go anywhere at this point  or do we pull out now and cut our losses at half a billion .          oh  i   ll get it      muttered madarian .    jane   wasn   t it .  she was never as much as activated and madarian was in a rage .    it was human error .  his own fault  if one wanted to be entirely accurate .  yet though madarian was utterly humiliated  others remained quiet .  let he who has never made an error in the fearsomely intricate mathematics of the positronic brain fill out the first memo of correction .    nearly a year passed before jane   was ready .  madarian was ebullient again .     she does it     he said .     she   s got a good high recognition quotient .       he was confident enough to place her on display before the board and have her solve problems .  not mathematical problems  any robot could do that  but problems where the terms were deliberately misleading without being actually inaccurate .    bogert said afterward     that doesn   t take much  really .          of course not .  it   s elementary for jane   but i had to show them something  didn   t i .          do you know how much we   ve spent so far .          come on  peter  don   t give me that .  do you know how much we   ve got back .  these things don   t go on in a vacuum  you know .  i   ve had over three years of hell over this  if you want to know  but i   ve worked out new techniques of calculation that will save us a minimum of fifty thousand dollars on every new type of positronic brain we design  from now on in forever .  right .          well           well me no wells .  it   s so .  and it   s my personal feeling that n dimensional calculus of uncertainty can have any number of other applications if we have the ingenuity to find them  and my jane robots will find them .  once i   ve got exactly what i want  the new jn series will pay for itself inside of five years  even if we triple what we   ve invested so far .          what do you mean by    exactly what you want    .  what   s wrong with jane   .          nothing .  or nothing much .  she   s on the track  but she can be improved and i intend to do so .  i thought i knew where i was going when i designed her .  now i   ve tested her and i know where i   m going .  i intend to get there .       jane   was it .  it took madarian well over a year to produce her and there he had no reservations  he was utterly confident .    jane   was shorter than the average robot  slimmer .  without being a female caricature as jane   had been  she managed to possess an air of femininity about herself despite the absence of a single clearly feminine feature .       it   s the way she   s standing     said bogert .  her arms were held gracefully and somehow the torso managed to give the impression of curving slightly when she turned .    madarian said     listen to her .  .  .  . how do you feel  jane .          in excellent health  thank you     said jane    and the voice was precisely that of a woman  it was a sweet and almost disturbing contralto .       why did you do that  clinton .     said peter  startled and beginning to frown .       psychologically important     said madarian .     i want people to think of her as a woman  to treat her as a woman  to explain .          what people .     madarian put his hands in his pockets and stared thoughtfully at bogert .     i would like to have arrangements made for jane and myself to go to flagstaff .       bogert couldn   t help but note that madarian didn   t say jane   .  he made use of no number this time .  she was the jane .  he said doubtfully     to flagstaff .  why .          because that   s the world center for general planetology  isn   t it .  it   s where they   re studying the stars and trying to calculate the probability of habitable planets  isn   t it .          i know that  but it   s on earth .          well  and i surely know that .          robotic movements on earth are strictly controlled .  and there   s no need for it .  bring a library of books on general planetology here and let jane absorb them .          no .  peter  will you get it through your head that jane isn   t the ordinary logical robot  she   s intuitive .          so .          so how can we tell what she needs  what she can use  what will set her off .  we can use any metal model in the factory to read books  that   s frozen data and out of date besides .  jane must have living information  she must have tones of voice  she must have side issues  she must have total irrelevancies even .  how the devil do we know what or when something will go click click inside her and fall into a pattern .  if we knew  we wouldn   t need her at all  would we .       bogert began to feel harassed .  he said     then bring the men here  the general planetologists .          here won   t be any good .  they   ll be out of their element .  they won   t react naturally .  i want jane to watch them at work  i want her to see their instruments  their offices  their desks  everything about them that she can .  i want you to arrange to have her transported to flagstaff .  and i   d really like not to discuss it any further .       for a moment he almost sounded like susan .  bogert winced  and said     it   s complicated making such an arrangement .  transporting an experimental robot           jane isn   t experimental .  she   s the fifth of the series .          the other four weren   t really working models .       madarian lifted his hands in helpless frustration .     who   s forcing you to tell the government that .          i   m not worried about the government .  it can be made to understand special cases .  it   s public opinion .  we   ve come a long way in fifty years and i don   t propose to be set back twenty five of them by having you lose control of a           i won   t lose control .  you   re making foolish remarks .  look .  u .  s .  robots can afford a private plane .  we can land quietly at the nearest commercial airport and be lost in hundreds of similar landings .  we can arrange to have a large ground car with an enclosed body meet us and take us to flagstaff .  jane will be crated and it will be obvious that some piece of thoroughly non robotic equipment is being transported to the labs .  we won   t get a second look from anyone .  the men at flagstaff will be alerted and will be told the exact purpose of the visit .  they will have every motive to cooperate and to prevent a leak .       bogert pondered .     the risky part will be the plane and the ground car .  if anything happens to the crate           nothing will .          we might get away with it if jane is deactivated during transport .  then even if someone finds out she   s inside           no  peter .  that can   t be done .  uh uh .  not jane   .  look  she   s been free associating since she was activated .  the information she possesses can be put into freeze during deactivation but the free associations never .  no  sir  she can   t ever be deactivated .          but  then  if somehow it is discovered that we are transporting an activated robot           it won   t be found out .     madarian remained firm and the plane eventually took off .  it was a late model automatic computo jet  but it carried a human pilot  one of u .  s .  robots    own employees  as backup .  the crate containing jane arrived at the airport safely  was transferred to the ground car  and reached the research laboratories at flagstaff without incident .    peter bogert received his first call from madarian not more than an hour after the latter   s arrival at flagstaff .  madarian was ecstatic and  characteristically  could not wait to report .    the message arrived by tubed laser beam  shielded  scrambled  and ordinarily impenetrable  but bogert felt exasperated .  he knew it could be penetrated if someone with enough technological ability  the government  for example  was determined to do so .  the only real safety lay in the fact that the government had no reason to try .  at least bogert hoped so .    he said     for god   s sake  do you have to call .       madarian ignored him entirely .  he burbled     it was an inspiration .  sheer genius  i tell you .       for a while  bogert stared at the receiver .  then he shouted incredulously     you mean you   ve got the answer .  already .          no  no .  give us time  damn it .  i mean the matter of her voice was an inspiration .  listen  after we were chauffeured from the airport to the main administration building at flagstaff  we uncrated jane and she stepped out of the box .  when that happened  every man in the place stepped back .  scared .  nitwits .  if even scientists can   t understand the significance of the laws of robotics  what can we expect of the average untrained individual .  for a minute there i thought  this will all be useless .  they won   t talk .  they   ll be keying themselves for a quick break in case she goes berserk and they   ll be able to think of nothing else .          well  then  what are you getting at .          so then she greeted them routinely .  she said     good afternoon  gentlemen .  i am so glad to meet you .     and it came out in this beautiful contralto .  .  .  . that was it .  one man straightened his tie  and another ran his fingers through his hair .  what really got me was that the oldest guy in the place actually checked his fly to make sure it was zipped .  they   re all crazy about her now .  all they needed was the voice .  she isn   t a robot any more  she   s a girl .          you mean they   re talking to her .          are they talking to her .  i should say so .  i should have programmed her for sexy intonations .  they   d be asking her for dates right now if i had .  talk about conditioned reflex .  listen  men respond to voices .  at the most intimate moments  are they looking .  it   s the voice in your ear           yes  clinton  i seem to remember .  where   s jane now .          with them .  they won   t let go of her .          damn .  get in there with her .  don   t let her out of your sight  man .       madarian   s calls thereafter  during his ten day stay at flagstaff  were not very frequent and became progressively less exalted .    jane was listening carefully  he reported  and occasionally she responded .  she remained popular .  she was given entry everywhere .  but there were no results .    bogert said     nothing at all .       madarian was at once defensive .     you can   t say nothing at all .  it   s impossible to say nothing at all with an intuitive robot .  you don   t know what might not be going on inside her .  this morning she asked jensen what he had for breakfast .          rossiter jensen the astrophysicist .          yes  of course .  as it turned out  he didn   t have breakfast that morning .  well  a cup of coffee .          so jane   s learning to make small talk .  that scarcely makes up for the expense .          oh  don   t be a jackass .  it wasn   t small talk .  nothing is small talk for jane .  she asked because it had something to do with some sort of cross correlation she was building in her mind .          what can it possibly           how do i know .  if i knew  i   d be a jane myself and you wouldn   t need her .  but it has to mean something .  she   s programmed for high motivation to obtain an answer to the question of a planet with optimum habitability distance and           then let me know when she   s done that and not before .  it   s not really necessary for me to get a blow by blow description of possible correlations .       he didn   t really expect to get notification of success .  with each day  bogert grew less sanguine  so that when the notification finally came  he wasn   t ready .  and it came at the very end .    that last time  when madarian   s climactic message came  it came in what was almost a whisper .  exaltation had come complete circle and madarian was awed into quiet .       she did it     he said .     she did it .  after i all but gave up  too .  after she had received everything in the place and most of it twice and three times over and never said a word that sounded like anything .  .  .  . i   m on the plane now  returning .  we   ve just taken off .       bogert managed to get his breath .     don   t play games  man .  you have the answer .  say so  if you have .  say it plainly .          she has the answer .  she   s given me the answer .  she   s given me the names of three stars within eighty light years which  she says  have a sixty to ninety percent chance of possessing one habitable planet each .  the probability that at least one has is   .     .  it   s almost certain .  and that   s just the least of it .  once we get back  she can give us the exact line of reasoning that led her to the conclusion and i predict that the whole science of astrophysics and cosmology will           are you sure           you think i   m having hallucinations .  i even have a witness .  poor guy jumped two feet when jane suddenly began to reel out the answer in her gorgeous voice      and that was when the meteorite struck and in the thorough destruction of the plane that followed  madarian and the pilot were reduced to gobbets of bloody flesh and no usable remnant of jane was recovered .    the gloom at u .  s .  robots had never been deeper .  robertson attempted to find consolation in the fact that the very completeness of the destruction had utterly hidden the illegalities of which the firm had been guilty .    peter shook his head and mourned .     we   ve lost the best chance u .  s .  robots ever had of gaining an unbeatable public image  of overcoming the damned frankenstein complex .  what it would have meant for robots to have one of them work out the solution to the habitable planet problem  after other robots had helped work out the space jump .  robots would have opened the galaxy to us .  and if at the same time we could have driven scientific knowledge forward in a dozen different directions as we surely would have .  .  . oh  god  there   s no way of calculating the benefits to the human race  and to us of course .       robertson said     we could build other janes  couldn   t we .  even without madarian .          sure we could .  but can we depend on the proper correlation again .  who knows how low  probability that final result was .  what if madarian had had a fantastic piece of beginner   s luck .  and then to have an even more fantastic piece of bad luck .  a meteorite zeroing in .  .  . it   s simply unbelievable        robertson said in a hesitating whisper     it couldn   t have been meant .  i mean  if we weren   t meant to know and if the meteorite was a judgment  from        he faded off under bogert   s withering glare .  bogert said     it   s not a dead loss  i suppose .  other janes are bound to help us in some ways .  and we can give other robots feminine voices  if that will help encourage public acceptance  though i wonder what the women would say .  if we only knew what jane   had said .          in that last call  madarian said there was a witness .     bogert said     i know  i   ve been thinking about that .  don   t you suppose i   ve been in touch with flagstaff .  nobody in the entire place heard jane say anything that was out of the ordinary  anything that sounded like an answer to the habitable planet problem  and certainly anyone there should have recognized the answer if it came   or at least recognized it as a possible answer .          could madarian have been lying .  or crazy .  could he have been trying to protect himself           you mean he may have been trying to save his reputation by pretending he had the answer and then gimmick jane so she couldn   t talk and say     oh  sorry  something happened accidentally .  oh  darn .     i won   t accept that for a minute .  you might as well suppose he had arranged the meteorite .          then what do we do .     bogert said heavily     turn back to flagstaff .  the answer must be there .  i   ve got to dig deeper  that   s all .  i   m going there and i   m taking a couple of the men in madarian   s department .  we   ve got to go through that place top to bottom and end to end .          but  you know  even if there were a witness and he had heard  what good would it do  now that we don   t have jane to explain the process .          every little something is useful .  jane gave the names of the stars  the catalogue numbers probably  none of the named stars has a chance .  if someone can remember her saying that and actually remember the catalogue number  or have heard it clearly enough to allow it to be recovered by psycho probe if he lacked the conscious memory  then we   ll have something .  given the results at the end  and the data fed jane at the beginning  we might be able to reconstruct the line of reasoning  we might recover the intuition .  if that is done  we   ve saved the game        bogert was back after three days  silent and thoroughly depressed .  when robertson inquired anxiously as to results  he shook his head .     nothing .          nothing .          absolutely nothing .  i spoke with every man in flagstaff  every scientist  every technician  every student  that had had anything to do with jane  everyone that had as much as seen her .  the number wasn   t great  i   ll give madarian credit for that much discretion .  he only allowed those to see her who might conceivably have had planetological knowledge to feed her .  there were twenty three men altogether who had seen jane and of those only twelve had spoken to her more than casually .       i went over and over all that jane had said .  they remembered everything quite well .  they   re keen men engaged in a crucial experiment involving their specialty  so they had every motivation to remember .  and they were dealing with a talking robot  something that was startling enough  and one that talked like a tv actress .  they couldn   t forget .       robertson said     maybe a psycho probe           if one of them had the vaguest thought that something had happened  i would screw out his consent to probing .  but there   s nothing to leave room for an excuse  and to probe two dozen men who make their living from their brains can   t be done .  honestly  it wouldn   t help .  if jane had mentioned three stars and said they had habitable planets  it would have been like setting up sky rockets in their brains .  how could anyone of them forget .          then maybe one of them is lying     said robertson grimly .     he wants the information for his own use  to get the credit himself later .          what good would that do him .     said bogert .     the whole establishment knows exactly why madarian and jane were there in the first place .  they know why i came there in the second .  if at any time in the future any man now at flagstaff suddenly comes up with a habitable planet theory that is startlingly new and different  yet valid  every other man at flagstaff and every man at u .  s .  robots will know at once that he had stolen it .  he   d never get away with it .          then madarian himself was somehow mistaken .          i don   t see how i can believe that either .  madarian had an irritating personality  all robopsychologists have irritating personalities  i think  which must be why they work with robots rather than with men  but he was no dummy .  he couldn   t be wrong in something like this .          then      but robertson had run out of possibilities .  they had reached a blank wall and for some minutes each stared at it disconsolately .    finally robertson stirred .     peter           well .          let   s ask susan .       bogert stiffened .     what .          let   s ask susan .  let   s call her and ask her to come in .          why .  what can she possibly do .          i don   t know .  but she   s a robopsychologist  too  and she might understand madarian better than we do .  besides  she  oh  hell  she always had more brains than any of us .          she   s nearly eighty .          and you   re seventy .  what about it .       bogert sighed .  had her abrasive tongue lost any of its rasp in the years of her retirement .  he said     well  i   ll ask her .       susan calvin entered bogert   s office with a slow look around before her eyes fixed themselves on the research director .  she had aged a great deal since her retirement .  her hair was a fine white and her face seemed to have crumpled .  she had grown so frail as to be almost transparent and only her eyes  piercing and uncompromising  seemed to remain of all that had been .    bogert strode forward heartily  holding out his hand .     susan .       susan calvin took it  and said     you   re looking reasonably well  peter  for an old man .  if i were you  i wouldn   t wait till next year .  retire now and let the young men get to it .  .  .  . and madarian is dead .  are you calling me in to take over my old job .  are you determined to keep the ancients till a year past actual physical death .          no  no  susan .  i   ve called you in      he stopped .  he did not  after all  have the faintest idea of how to start .    but susan read his mind now as easily as she always had .  she seated herself with the caution born of stiffened joints and said     peter  you   ve called me in because you   re in bad trouble .  otherwise you   d sooner see me dead than within a mile of you .          come  susan           don   t waste time on pretty talk .  i never had time to waste when i was forty and certainly not now .  madarian   s death and your call to me are both unusual  so there must be a connection .  two unusual events without a connection is too low probability to worry about .  begin at the beginning and don   t worry about revealing yourself to be a fool .  that was revealed to me long ago .       bogert cleared his throat miserably and began .  she listened carefully  her withered hand lifting once in a while to stop him so that she might ask a question .    she snorted at one point .     feminine intuition .  is that what you wanted the robot for .  you men .  faced with a woman reaching a correct conclusion and unable to accept the fact that she is your equal or superior in intelligence  you invent something called feminine intuition .          oh  yes  susan  but let me continue        he did .  when she was told of jane   s contralto voice  she said     it is a difficult choice sometimes whether to feel revolted at the male sex or merely to dismiss them as contemptible .       bogert said     well  let me go on        when he was quite done  susan said     may i have the private use of this office for an hour or two .          yes  but        she said     i want to go over the various records  jane   s programming  madarian   s calls  your interviews at flagstaff .  i presume i can use that beautiful new shielded laser phone and your computer outlet if i wish .          yes  of course .          well  then  get out of here  peter .       it was not quite forty five minutes when she hobbled to the door  opened it  and called for bogert .    when bogert came  robertson was with him .  both entered and susan greeted the latter with an unenthusiastic    hello  scott .       bogert tried desperately to gauge the results from susan   s face  but it was only the face of a grim old lady who had no intention of making anything easy for him .    he said cautiously     do you think there   s anything you can do  susan .          beyond what i have already done .  no .  there   s nothing more .     bogert   s lips set in chagrin  but robertson said     what have you already done  susan .       susan said     i   ve thought a little  something i can   t seem to persuade anyone else to do .  for one thing  i   ve thought about madarian .  i knew him  you know .  he had brains but he was a very irritating extrovert .  i thought you would like him after me  peter .          it was a change     bogert couldn   t resist saying .       and he was always running to you with results the very minute he had them  wasn   t he .          yes  he was .          and yet     said susan     his last message  the one in which he said jane had given him the answer  was sent from the plane .  why did he wait so long .  why didn   t he call you while he was still at flagstaff  immediately after jane had said whatever it was she said .          i suppose     said peter     that for once he wanted to check it thoroughly and  well  i don   t know .  it was the most important thing that had ever happened to him  he might for once have wanted to wait and be sure of himself .          on the contrary  the more important it was  the less he would wait  surely .  and if he could manage to wait  why not do it properly and wait till he was back at u .  s .  robots so that he could check the results with all the computing equipment this firm could make available to him .  in short  he waited too long from one point of view and not long enough from another .       robertson interrupted .     then you think he was up to some trickery        susan looked revolted .     scott  don   t try to compete with peter in making inane remarks .  let me continue .  .  .  . a second point concerns the witness .  according to the records of that last call  madarian said     poor guy jumped two feet when jane suddenly began to reel out the answer in her gorgeous voice .     in fact  it was the last thing he said .  and the question is  then  why should the witness have jumped .  madarian had explained that all the men were crazy about that voice  and they had had ten days with the robot  with jane .  why should the mere act of her speaking have startled them .       bogert said     i assumed it was astonishment at hearing jane give an answer to a problem that has occupied the minds of planetologists for nearly a century .          but they were waiting for her to give that answer .  that was why she was there .  besides  consider the way the sentence is worded .  madarian   s statement makes it seem the witness was startled  not astonished  if you see the difference .  what   s more  that reaction came    when jane suddenly began     in other words  at the very start of the statement .  to be astonished at the content of what jane said would have required the witness to have listened awhile so that he might absorb it .  madarian would have said he had jumped two feet after he had heard jane say thus and so .  it would be    after    not    when    and the word    suddenly    would not be included .       bogert said uneasily     i don   t think you can refine matters down to the use or non use of a word .          i can     said susan frostily     because i am a robopsychologist .  and i can expect madarian to do so  too  because he was a robopsychologist .  we have to explain those two anomalies  then .  the queer delay before madarian   s call and the queer reaction of the witness .          can you explain them .     asked robertson .     of course     said susan     since i use a little simple logic .  madarian called with the news without delay  as he always did  or with as little delay as he could manage .  if jane had solved the problem at flagstaff  he would certainly have called from flagstaff .  since he called from the plane  she must clearly have solved the problem after he had left flagstaff .          but then           let me finish .  let me finish .  was madarian not taken from the airport to flagstaff in a heavy  enclosed ground car .  and jane  in her crate  with him .          yes .          and presumably  madarian and the crated jane returned from flagstaff to the airport in the same heavy  enclosed ground car .  am i right .          yes  of course .          and they were not alone in the ground car  either .  in one of his calls  madarian said     we were chauffeured from the airport to the main administration building     and i suppose i am right in concluding that if he was chauffeured  then that was because there was a chauffeur  a human driver  in the car .          good god .          the trouble with you  peter  is that when you think of a witness to a planetological statement  you think of planetologists .  you divide up human beings into categories  and despise and dismiss most .  a robot cannot do that .  the first law says     a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     any human being .  that is the essence of the robotic view of life .  a robot makes no distinction .  to a robot  all men are truly equal  and to a robopsychologist who must perforce deal with men at the robotic level  all men are truly equal  too .       it would not occur to madarian to say a truck driver had heard the statement .  to you a truck driver is not a scientist but is a mere animate adjunct of a truck  but to madarian he was a man and a witness .  nothing more .  nothing less .       bogert shook his head in disbelief .     but you are sure .          of course i   m sure .  how else can you explain the other point  madarian   s remark about the startling of the witness .  jane was crated  wasn   t she .  but she was not deactivated .  according to the records  madarian was always adamant against ever deactivating an intuitive robot .  moreover  jane    like any of the janes  was extremely non talkative .  probably it never occurred to madarian to order her to remain quiet within the crate  and it was within the crate that the pattern finally fell into place .  naturally she began to talk .  a beautiful contralto voice suddenly sounded from inside the crate .  if you were the truck driver  what would you do at that point .  surely you   d be startled .  it   s a wonder he didn   t crash .          but if the truck driver was the witness  why didn   t he come forward           why .  can he possibly know that anything crucial had happened  that what he heard was important .  besides  don   t you suppose madarian tipped him well and asked him not to say anything .  would you want the news to spread that an activated robot was being transported illegally over the earth   s surface .          well  will he remember what was said .          why not .  it might seem to you  peter  that a truck driver  one step above an ape in your view  can   t remember .  but truck drivers can have brains  too .  the statements were most remarkable and the driver may well have remembered some .  even if he gets some of the letters and numbers wrong  we   re dealing with a finite set  you know  the fifty five hundred stars or star systems within eighty light years or so  i haven   t looked up the exact number .  you can make the correct choices .  and if needed  you will have every excuse to use the psycho probe        the two men stared at her .  finally bogert  afraid to believe  whispered     but how can you be sure .       for a moment  susan was on the point of saying  because i   ve called flagstaff  you fool  and because i spoke to the truck driver  and because he told me what he had heard  and because i   ve checked with the computer at flagstaff and got the only three stars that fit the information  and because i have those names in my pocket .    but she didn   t .  let him go through it all himself .  carefully  she rose to her feet  and said sardonically     how can i be sure .  .  .  . call it feminine intuition .      do not fear  gentle readers  that my misunderstanding of judy lynn   s intentions destroyed a friendship .  the asimovs and the del reys live less than a mile apart  and frequent each other often .  although judy lynn never hesitates to bounce me off the nearest wall  we all are  have been  and will remain  the very best of friends .   sometime in mid       doubleday called me up to ask if i would write a science fiction story that could serve as the basis of a movie .  i didn   t want to  because i don   t like to get tangled up with the visual media directly .  they   ve got money  but that   s all they   ve got .  but doubleday pressed me and i don   t like to refuse doubleday .  i agreed .    then eventually i had dinner with a very pleasant gentleman who was involved with the motion picture company and who wanted to discuss the story with me .    he told me he wanted an undersea setting and that suited me .  he then went on to describe with considerable enthusiasm the nature of the characters he wanted in the story  and the events he thought would be necessary .  as he spoke  my spirits sank .  the fact was that i didn   t want the hero he described  i didn   t want  with even greater intensity  the heroine he described  and most of all  i didn   t want the events he described .    i have always found myself unable  however  to express a negative reaction to people  especially face to face .  i did my best to smile and act interested .    the next day i called up doubleday .  it might not be too late .  i asked if the contract had been signed .  yes  indeed  it had  and a large advance had been paid over  of which most was to be turned over to me .    i didn   t think there was room for my spirits to sink lower  but they did .  i had to write the story .       well  then     i said     if what i write is not acceptable  would you return the advance .          we don   t have to     i was told .     the advance is unconditional .  if they don   t like your story  we still keep the advance .          no     i said .     i don   t want it that way .  if what i do is unacceptable  i want the entire advance returned .  take your share of it out of my royalties .       doubleday doesn   t like to refuse me anything either  so they agreed  although they made it plain they would return their share and not take anything out of my royalties .    that meant i was under no obligation to do anything but my best  as i conceived that best to be .  on september          i began to write waterclap and i did it my way .  i knew exactly what the movie people wanted and i didn   t give it to them .  naturally  they rejected it when it was done and every cent they had advanced was returned to them .    this was a huge relief to me  you can well imagine .    and there is a world outside hollywood  too .  ejler jakobsson of galaxy liked the story as i had written it  so it appeared in the may      issue of that magazine .  he paid me far less than the movie people would have  but then  all he bought was the story .       waterclap      stephen demerest looked at the textured sky .  he kept looking at it and found the blue opaque and revolting .    unwarily  he had looked at the sun  for there was nothing to blank it out automatically  and then he had snatched his eyes away in panic .  he wasn   t blinded  just a few afterimages .  even the sun was washed out .    involuntarily  he thought of ajax   s prayer in homer   s iliad .  they were fighting over the body of patroclus in the mist and ajax said     o father zeus  save the achaeans out of this mist .  make the sky clean  grant us to see with our eyes .  kill us in the light  since it is thy pleasure to kill us .       demerest thought  kill us in the light     kill us in the clear light on the moon  where the sky is black and soft  where the stars shine brightly  where the cleanliness and purity of vacuum make all things sharp .      not in this low clinging  fuzzy blue .    he shuddered .  it was an actual physical shudder that shook his lanky body  and he was annoyed .  he was going to die .  he was sure of it .  and it wouldn   t be under the blue  either  come to think of it  but under the black  but a different black .    it was as though in answer to that thought that the ferry pilot  short  swarthy  crisp haired  came up  . to him and said     ready for the black  mr .  demerest .       demerest nodded .  he towered over the other as he did over most of the men of earth .  they were thick  all of them  and took their short  low steps with ease .  he himself had to feel his footsteps  guide them through the air  even the impalpable bond that held him to the ground was textured .       i   m ready     he said .  he took a deep breath and deliberately repeated his earlier glance at the sun .  it was low in the morning sky  washed out by dusty air  and he knew it wouldn   t blind him .  he didn   t think he would ever see it again .    he had never seen a bathyscaphe before .  despite everything  he tended to think of it in terms of prototypes  an oblong balloon with a spherical gondola beneath .  it was as though he persisted in thinking of space flight in terms of tons of fuel spewed backward in fire  and an irregular module feeling its way  spiderlike  toward the lunar surface .    the bathyscaphe was not like the image in his thoughts at all .  under its skin  it might still be buoyant bag and gondola  but it was all engineered sleekness now .       my name is javan     said the ferry pilot .     omar javan .          javan .          queer name to you .  i   m iranian by descent  earthman by persuasion .  once you get down there  there are no nationalities .     he grinned and his complexion grew darker against the even whiteness of his teeth .     if you don   t mind  we   ll be starting in a minute .  you   ll be my only passenger  so i guess you carry weight .          yes     said demerest dryly .     at least a hundred pounds more than i   m used to .          you   re from the moon .  i thought you had a queer walk on you .  i hope it   s not uncomfortable .          it   s not exactly comfortable   but i manage .  we exercise for this .          well  come on board .     he stood aside and let demerest walk down the gangplank .     i wouldn   t go to the moon myself .          you go to ocean deep .          about fifty times so far .  that   s different .       demerest got on board .  it was cramped  but he didn   t mind that .  it might be a space module except that it was more  well  textured .  there was that word again .  there was the clear feeling everywhere that mass didn   t matter .  mass was held up  it didn   t have to be hurled up .    they were still on the surface .  the blue sky could be seen greenishly through the clear thick glass .  javan said     you don   t have to be strapped in .  there   s no acceleration .  smooth as oil  the whole thing .  it won   t take long  just about an hour .  you can   t smoke .          i don   t smoke     said demerest .       i hope you don   t have claustrophobia .          moon men don   t have claustrophobia .          all that open           not in our cavern .  we live in a     he groped for the phrase      a lunar deep  a hundred feet deep .          a hundred feet .     the pilot seemed amused  but he didn   t smile .     we   re slipping down now .       the interior of the gondola was fitted into angles but here and there a section of wall beyond the instruments showed its basic sphericity .  to javan  the instruments seemed to be an extension of his arms  his eyes and hands moved over them lightly  almost lovingly .       we   re all checked out     he said     but i like a last minute look over  we   ll be facing a thousand atmospheres down there .     his finger touched a contact  and the round door closed massively inward and pressed against the beveled rim it met .       the higher the pressure  the tighter that will hold     said javan .     take your last look at sunlight  mr .  demerest .       the light still shone through the thick glass of the window .  it was wavering now  there was water between the sun and them now .       the last look .     said demerest .    javan snickered .     not the last look .  i mean for the trip .   .  .  . i suppose you   ve never been  on a bathyscaphe before .          no  i haven   t .  have many .          very few     admitted javan .     but don   t worry .  it   s just an underwater balloon .  we   ve introduced a million improvements since the first bathyscaphe .  it   s nuclear powered now and we can move freely by water jet up to certain limits  but cut it down to basics and it   s still a spherical gondola under buoyancy tanks .  and it   s still towed out to sea by a mother ship because it needs what power it carries too badly to waste it on surface travel .  ready .          ready .       the supporting cable of the mother ship flicked away and the bathyscaphe settled lower  then lower still  as sea water fed into the buoyancy tanks .  for a few moments  caught in surface currents  it swayed  and then there was nothing .  the bathyscaphe sank slowly through a deepening green .    javan relaxed .  he said     john bergen is head of ocean deep .  you   re going to see him .          that   s right .          he   s a nice guy .  his wife   s with him .          she is .          oh  sure .  they have women down there .  there   s a bunch down there  fifty people .     some stay for months .       demerest put his finger on the narrow  nearly invisible seam where door met wall .  he took it away and looked at it .  he said     it   s oily .          silicone  really .  the pressure squeezes some out .  it   s supposed to .   .  .  . don   t worry .  everything   s automatic .  everything   s fail safe .  the first sign of malfunction  any malfunction at all  our ballast is released and up we go .          you mean nothing   s ever happened to these bathyscaphes .          what can happen .     the pilot looked sideways at his passenger .     once you get too deep for sperm whales  nothing can go wrong .          sperm whales .     demerest   s thin face creased in a frown .       sure  they dive as deep as half a mile .  if they hit a bathyscaphe  well  the walls of the buoyancy chambers aren   t particularly strong .  they don   t have to be  you know .  they   re open to the sea and when the gasoline  which supplies the buoyancy  compresses  sea water enters .       it was dark now .  demerest found his gaze fastened to the viewport .  it was light inside the gondola  but it was dark in that window .  and it was not the darkness of space  it was a thick darkness .    demerest said sharply     let   s get this straight  mr .  javan .  you are not equipped to withstand the attack of a sperm whale .  presumably you are not equipped to withstand the attack of a giant squid .  have there been any actual incidents of that sort .          well  it   s like this           no games  please  and don   t try ragging the greenhorn .  i am asking out of professional curiosity .  i am head safety engineer at luna city and i am asking what precautions this bathyscaphe can take against possible collision with large creatures .       javan looked embarrassed .  he muttered     actually  there have been no incidents .          are any expected .  even as a remote possibility .          anything is remotely possible .  but actually sperm whales are too intelligent to monkey with us and giant squid are too shy .          can they see us .          yes  of course .  we   re lit up .          do you have floodlights .          we   re already past the large animal range  but we have them  and i   ll turn them on for you .       through the black of the window there suddenly appeared a snow storm  an inverted upward falling snowstorm .  the blackness had come alive with stars in three dimensional array and all moving upward .    demerest said     what   s that .          just crud .  organic matter .  small creatures .  they float  don   t move much  and they catch the light .  we   re going down past them .  they seem to be going up in consequence .       demerest   s sense of perspective adjusted itself and he said     aren   t we dropping too quickly .          no  we   re not .  if we were  i could use the nuclear engines  if i wanted to waste power  or i could drop some ballast .  i   ll be doing that later  but for now everything is fine .  relax  mr .  demerest .  the snow thins as we dive and we   re not likely to see much in the way of spectacular life forms .  there are small angler fish and such but they avoid us .       demerest said     how many do you take down at a time .          i   ve had as many as four passengers in this gondola  but that   s crowded .  we can put two bathyscaphes in tandem and carry ten  but that   s clumsy .  what we really need are trains of gondolas  heavier on the nukes the nuclear engines and lighter on the buoyancy .  stuff like that is on the drawing board  they tell me .  of course  they   ve been telling me that for years .          there are plans for large scale expansion of ocean deep  then .          sure  why not .  we   ve got cities on the continental shelves  why not on the deep sea bottom .  the way i look at it  mr .  demerest  where man can go  he will go and he should go .  the earth is ours to populate and we will populate it .  all we need to make the deep sea habitable are completely maneuverable    scaphes .  the buoyancy chambers slow us  weaken us  and complicate the engineering .          but they also save you  don   t they .  if everything goes wrong at once  the gasoline you carry will still float you to the surface  .  what would do that for you if your nuclear engines go wrong and you had no buoyancy .          if it comes to that  you can   t expect to eliminate the chances of accident altogether  not even fatal ones .          i know that very well     said demerest feelingly .    javan stiffened .  the tone of his voice changed .     sorry .  didn   t mean anything by that .  tough about that accident .          yes     said demerest .  fifteen men and five women had died .  one of the individuals listed among the    men     had been fourteen years old .  it had been pinned down to human failure .  what could a head safety engineer say after that .       yes     he said .    a pall dropped between the two men  a pall as thick and as turgid as the pressurized sea water outside .  how could one allow for panic and for distraction and for depression all at once .  there were the moon blues  stupid name  but they struck men at inconvenient times .  it wasn   t always noticeable when the moon blues came but it made men torpid and slow to react .    how many times had a meteorite come along and been averted or smothered or successfully absorbed .  how many times had a moonquake done damage and been held in check .  how many times had human failure been backed up and compensated for .  how many times had accidents not happened .    but you don   t payoff on accidents not happening .  there were twenty dead     javan said  how many long minutes later .       there are the lights of ocean deep .       demerest could not make them out at first .  he didn   t know where to look .  twice before  luminescent creatures had flicked past the windows at a distance and with the floodlights off again  demerest had thought them the first sign of ocean deep .  now he saw nothing .       down there     said javan  without pointing .  he was busy now  slowing the drop and edging the    scaphe sideways .    demerest could hear the distant sighing of the water jets  steam driven  with the steam formed by the heat of momentary bursts of fusion power .    demerest thought dimly  deuterium is their fuel and it   s all around them .  water is their exhaust and it   s all around them .    javan was dropping some of his ballast  too  and began a kind of distant chatter .     the ballast used to be steel pellets and they were dropped by electromagnetic controls .  anywhere up to fifty tons of it were used in each trip .  conservationists worried about spreading rusting steel over the ocean floor  so we switched to metal nodules that are dredged up from the continental shelf .  we put a thin layer of iron over them so they can still be electromagnetically handled and the ocean bottom gets nothing that wasn   t sub ocean to begin with .  cheaper  too .   .  .  . but when we get out real nuclear    scaphes  we won   t need ballast at all .       demerest scarcely heard him .  ocean deep could be seen now .  javan had turned on the floodlights and far below was the muddy floor of the puerto rican trench .  resting on that floor like a cluster of equally muddy pearls was the spherical conglomerate of ocean deep .    each unit was a sphere such as the one in which demerest was now sinking toward contact  but much larger  and as ocean deep expanded  expanded  expanded  new spheres were added .    demerest thought  they   re only five and a half miles from home  not a quarter of a million .       how are we going to get through .     asked demerest .    the    scaphe had made contact .  demerest heard the dull sound of metal against metal but then for minutes there had been nothing more than a kind of occasional scrape as javan bent over his instruments in rapt concentration .       don   t worry about that     javan said at last  in belated answer .     there   s no problem .  the delay now is only because i have to make sure we fit tightly .  there   s an electromagnet joint that holds at every point of a perfect circle .  when the instruments read correctly  that means we fit over the entrance door .          which then opens .          it would if there were air on the other side  but there isn   t .  there   s sea water  and that has to be driven out .  then we enter .       demerest did not miss this point .  he had come here on this  the last day of his life  to give that same life meaning and he intended to miss nothing .    he said     why the added step .  why not keep the air lock  if that   s what it is  a real air lock  and have air in it at an times .          they tell me it   s a matter of safety     said javan .     your specialty .  the interface has equal pressure on both sides at all times  except when men are moving across .  this door is the weakest point of the whole system  because it opens and closes  it has joints  it has seams .  you know what i mean .          i do     murmured demerest .  there was a logical flaw here and that meant there was a possible chink through which  but later .    he said     why are we waiting now .          the lock is being emptied .  the water is being forced out .          by air .          hell  no .  they can   t afford to waste air like that .  it would take a thousand atmospheres to empty the chamber of its water  and filling the chamber with air at that density  even temporarily  is more air than they can afford to expend .  steam is what does it .          of course .  yes .       javan said cheerfully     you heat the water .  no pressure in the world can stop water from turning to steam at a temperature of more than       c .  and the steam forces the sea water out through a one way valve .          another weak point     said demerest .     i suppose so .  it   s never failed yet .  the water in the lock is being pushed out now .  when hot steam starts bubbling out the valve  the process automatically stops and the lock is fun of overheated steam .          and then .          and then we have a whole ocean to cool it with .  the temperature drops and the steam condenses .  once that happens  ordinary air can be let in at a pressure of one atmosphere and then the door opens .          how long must we wait .          not long .  if there were anything wrong  there   d be sirens sounding .  at least  so they say .  i never heard one in action .       there was silence for a few minutes  and then there was a sudden sharp clap and a simultaneous jerk .    javan said     sorry  i should have warned you .  i   m so used to it i forgot .  when the door opens  a thousand atmospheres of pressure on the other side forces us hard against the metal of ocean deep .  no electromagnetic force can hold us hard enough to prevent that last hundredth of an inch slam .       demerest unclenched his fist and released his breath .  he said     is everything all right .          the walls didn   t crack  if that   s what you mean .  it sounds like doom  though  doesn   t it .  it sounds even worse when i   ve got to leave and the air lock fills up again .  be prepared for that .       but demerest was suddenly weary .  let   s get on with it  he thought .  i don   t want to drag it out .  he said     do we go through now .          we go through .       the opening in the    scaphe wall was round and small  even smaller than the one through which they had originally entered .  javan went through it sinuously  muttering that it always made him feel like a cork in a bottle .    demerest had not smiled since he entered the    scaphe .  nor did he really smile now  but a comer of his mouth quirked as he thought that a skinny moon man would have no trouble .    he went through also  feeling javan   s hands firmly at his waist  helping him through .    javan said     it   s dark in here .  no point in introducing an additional weakness by wiring for lighting .  but that   s why flashlights were invented .       demerest found himself on a perforated walk  its stainless metallic surface gleaming dully .  and through the perforations he could make out the wavering surface of water .    he said     the chamber hasn   t been emptied .          you can   t do any better  mr .  demerest .  if you   re going to use steam to empty it  you   re left with that steam  and to get the pressures necessary to do the emptying that steam must be compressed to a ut one third the density of liquid water .  when it condenses  the chamber remains one third full of water  but it   s water at just one atmosphere pressure .   .  .  .  come on  mr .  demerest .       john bergen   s face wasn   t entirely unknown to demerest .  recognition was immediate .  bergen  as head of ocean deep for nearly a decade now  was a familiar face on the tv screens of earth just as the leaders of luna city had become familiar .    demerest had seen the head of ocean deep both flat and in three dimensions  in black and white and in color .  seeing him in life added little .    like javan  bergen was short and thickset  opposite in structure to the traditional   already traditional .   lunar pattern of physiology .  he was fairer than javan by a good deal and his face was noticeably asymmetrical  with his somewhat thick nose leaning just a little to the right .    he was not handsome .  no moon man would think he was  but then bergen smiled and there was a sunniness about it as he held out his large hand .    demerest placed his own thin one within  steeling himself for a hard grip  but it did not come .  bergen took the hand and let it go  then said     i   m glad you   re here .  we don   t have much in the way of luxury  nothing that will make our hospitality stand out  we can   t even declare a holiday in your honor  but the spirit is there .  welcome .          thank you     said demerest softly .  he remained unsmiling now  too .  he was facing the enemy and he knew it .  surely bergen must know it also and  since he did  that smile of his was hypocrisy .    and at that moment a clang like metal against metal sounded deafeningly and the chamber shuddered .  demerest leaped back and staggered against the wall .    bergen did not budge .  he said quietly     that was the bathyscaphe unhitching and the waterclap of the air lock filling .  javan ought to have warned you .       demerest panted and tried to make his racing heart slow .  he said     javan did warn me .  i was caught by surprise anyway .       bergen said     well  it won   t happen again for a while .  we don   t often have visitors  you know .  we   re not equipped for it and so we fight off all kinds of big wheels who think a trip down here would be good for their careers .  politicians of all kinds  chiefly .  your own case is different of course .       is it .  thought demerest .  it had been hard enough to get permission to make the trip down .  his superiors back at luna city had not approved in the first place and had scouted the idea that a diplomatic interchange would be of any use .       diplomatic interchange    was what they had called it .    and when he had overborne them  there had been ocean deep   s own reluctance to receive him .    it had been sheer persistence alone that had made his present visit possible .  in what way then was demerest   s case different .    bergen said     i suppose you have your junketing problems on luna city  too .          very little     said demerest .     your average politician isn   t as anxious to travel a half million mile round trip as he is to travel a ten mile one .          i can see that     agreed bergen     and it   s more expensive out to the moon  of course .   .  .  . in a way  this is the first meeting of inner and outer space .  no ocean man has ever gone to the moon as far as i know and you   re the first moonman to visit a sub sea station of any kind .  no moon man has ever been to one of the settlements on the continental shelf .          it   s a historic meeting  then     said demerest  and tried to keep the sarcasm out of his voice .    if any leaked through  bergen showed no sign .  he rolled up his sleeves as though to emphasize his attitude of informality  or the fact that they were very busy  so that there would be little time for visitors .   and said     do you want coffee .  i assume you   ve eaten .  would you like to rest before i show you around .  do you want to wash up  for that matter  as they say euphemistically .       for a moment  curiosity stirred in demerest  yet not entirely aimless curiosity .  everything involving the interface of ocean deep with the outside world could be of importance .  he said     how are sanitary facilities handled here .          it   s cycled mostly  as it is on the moon  i imagine .  we can eject if we want to or have to .  man has a bad record of fouling the environment  but as the only deep sea station  what we eject does no perceptible damage .  adds organic matter .     he laughed .    demerest filed that away  too .  matter was ejected  there was therefore ejection tubes .  their workings might be of interest and he  as a safety engineer  had a right to be interested .       no  he said     i don   t need anything at the moment .  if you   re busy           that   s all right .  we   re always busy  but i   m the least busy  if you see what i mean .  suppose i show you around .  we   ve got over fifty units here  each as big as this one  some bigger        demerest looked about .  again  as in the    scaphe  there were angles everywhere  but beyond the furnishings and equipment there were signs of the inevitable spherical outer wall .  fifty of them .       built up     went on bergen     over a generation of effort .  the unit we   re standing in is actually the oldest and there   s been some talk of demolishing and replacing it .  some of the men say we   re ready for second generation units  but i   m not sure .  it would be expensive  everything   s expensive down here  and getting money out of the planetary project council is always a depressing experience .       demerest felt his nostrils flare involuntarily and a spasm of anger shot through him .  it was a thrust  surely .  luna city   s miserable record with the ppc must be well known to bergen .    but bergen went on  unnoticing .     i   m a traditionalist  too  just a little bit .  this is the first deep sea unit ever constructed .  the first two people to remain overnight on the floor of an ocean trench slept here with nothing else beyond this bare sphere except for a miserable portable fusion unit to work the escape hatch .  i mean the air lock  but we called it the escape hatch to begin with  and just enough controls for the purpose .  reguera and tremont  those were the men .  they never made a second trip to the bottom  either  stayed topside forever after .  well  well  they served their purpose and both are dead now .  and here we are with fifty people and with six months as the usual tour of duty .  i   ve spent only two weeks topside in the last year and a half .       he motioned vigorously to demerest to follow him  slid open a door which moved evenly into a recess  and took him into the next unit .  demerest paused to examine the opening .  there were no seams that he could notice between the adjacent units .    bergen noted the other   s pause and said     when we add on our units  they   re welded under pressure into the equivalent of a single piece of metal and then reinforced .  we can   t take chances  as i   m sure you understand  since i have been given to understand that you   re the head safe        demerest cut him off .     yes     he said .     we on the moon admire your safety record .       bergen shrugged .     we   ve been lucky .  our sympathy  by the way  on the rotten break you fellows had .  i mean that fatal        demerest cut him off again .     yes .       bergen  the moon man decided  was either a naturally voluble man or else was eager to drown him in words and get rid of him .       the units     said bergen     are arranged in a highly branched chain three dimensional actually .  we have a map we can show you  if you   re interested .  most of the end units represent living sleeping quarters .  for privacy  you know .  the working units tend to be corridors as well  which is one of the embarrassments of having to live down here .       this is our library  part of it  anyway .  not big  but it   s got our records  too  on carefully indexed and computed microfilm  so that for its kind it   s not only the biggest in the world  but the best and the only .  and we have a special computer to handle the references to meet our needs exactly .  it collects  selects  coordinates  weighs  then gives us the gist .       we have another library  too  book films and even some printed volumes .  but that   s for amusement .       a voice broke in on bergen   s cheerful flow .     john .  may i interrupt .       demerest started  the voice had come from behind him .  bergen said     annette .  i was going to get you .  this is stephen demerest of luna city .  mr .  demerest  may i introduce my wife  annette .       demerest had turned .  he said stiffly  a little mechanically     i   m pleased to meet you  mrs .  bergen .     but he was staring at her waistline .    annette bergen seemed in her early thirties .  her brown hair was combed simply and she wore no makeup .  attractive  not beautiful  demerest    noted vaguely .  but his eyes kept returning to that waistline .    she shrugged a little .     yes  i   m pregnant  mr .  demerest .  i   m due in about two months .          pardon me     demerest muttered .     so rude of me .   .  .  . i didn   t      he faded off and felt as though the blow had been a physical one .  he hadn   t expected women  though he didn   t know why .  he knew there would have to be women in ocean deep .  and the ferry pilot had said bergen   s wife was with him .    he stammered as he spoke .     how many women are there in ocean deep  mr .  bergen .          nine at the moment     said bergen .     all wives .  we look forward to a time when we can have the normal ratio of one to one  but we still need workers and researchers primarily  and unless women have important qualifications of some sort           they all have important qualifications of some sort  dear     said mrs .  bergen .     you could keep the men for longer duty if           my wife     said bergen  laughing     is a convinced feminist but is not above using sex as an excuse to enforce equality .  i keep telling her that that is the feminine way of doing it and not the feminist way  and she keeps saying well  that   s why she   s pregnant .  you think it   s love  sex mania  yearning for motherhood .  nothing of the sort .  she   s going to have a baby down here to make a philosophical point .       annette said coolly     why not .  either this is going to be home for humanity or it isn   t going to be .  if it is  then we   re going to have babies here  that   s all .  i want a baby born in ocean deep .  there are babies born in luna city  aren   t there  mr .  demerest .       demerest took a deep breath .     i was born in luna city  mrs .  bergen .          and well she knew it      muttered bergen .       and you are in your late twenties  i think .     she said .       i am twenty nine     said demerest .       and well she knew that  too     said bergen with a short laugh .     you can bet she looked up all possible data on you when she heard you were coming .          that is quite beside the point     said annette .     the point is that for twenty nine years at least children have been born in luna city and no children have been born in ocean deep .          luna city  my dear     said bergen     is longer established .  it is over half a century old  we are not yet twenty .          twenty years is quite enough .  it takes a baby nine months .       demerest interposed     are there any children in ocean deep .          no     said bergen .     no .  someday  though .          in two months  anyway     said annette bergen positively .    the tension grew inside demerest and when they returned to the unit in which he had first met bergen  he was glad to sit down and accept a cup of coffee .       we   ll eat soon     said bergen matter of factly .     i hope you don   t mind sitting here meanwhile .  as the prime unit  it isn   t used for much except  of course  for the reception of vessels  an item i don   t expect will interrupt us for a while .  we can talk  if you wish .          i do wish     said demerest .       i hope i   m welcome to join in     said annette .    demerest looked at her doubtfully  but bergen said to him     you   ll have to agree .  she   s fascinated by you and by moon men generally .  she thinks they   re  uh  you   re a new breed  and i think that when she   s quite through being a deep woman she wants to be a moon woman          i just want to get a word in edgewise  john  and when i get that in  i   d like to hear what mr .  demerest has to say .  what do you think of us  mr .  demerest .       demerest said cautiously     i   ve asked to come here  mrs .  bergen  because i   m a safety engineer .  ocean deep has an enviable safety record           not one fatality in almost twenty years     said bergen cheerfully .     only one death by accident in the c shelf settlements and none in transit by either sub or    scaphe .  i wish i could say  though  that this was the result of wisdom and care on our part .  we do our best  of course  but the breaks have been with us           john     said annette     i really wish you   d let mr .  demerest speak .          as a safety engineer     said demerest     i can   t afford to believe in luck and breaks .  we cannot stop moon quakes or large meteroites out at luna city  but we are designed to minimize the effects even of those .  there are no excuses or there should be none for human failure .  we have not avoided that on luna city  our record recently has been     his voice dropped     bad .  while humans are imperfect  as we all know  machinery should be designed to take that imperfection into account .  we lost twenty men and women           i know .  still  luna city has a population of nearly one thousand  doesn   t it .  your survival isn   t in danger .          the people on luna city number nine hundred and seventy two  including myself  but our survival is in danger .  we depend on earth for essentials .  that need not always be so  it wouldn   t be so right now if the planetary project council could resist the temptation toward pygmy economies           there  at least  mr .  demerest     said bergen     we see eye to eye .  we are not self supporting either  and we could be .  what   s more  we can   t grow much beyond our present level unless nuclear    scaphes are built .  as long as we keep that buoyancy principle  we are limited .  transportation between deep and top is slow  slow for men  slower still for materiel and supplies .  i   ve been pushing  mr .  demerest  for           yes  and you   ll be getting it now  mr .  bergen  won   t you .          i hope so  but what makes you so sure .          mr .  bergen  let   s not play around .  you know very well that earth is committed to spending a fixed amount of money on expansion projects on programs designed to expand the human habitat and that it is not a terribly large amount .  earth   s population is not going to lavish resources in an effort to expand either outer space or inner space if it thinks this will cut into the comfort and convenience of earth   s prime habitat  the land surface of the planet .     annette broke in .     you make it sound callous of earthmen  mr .  demerest  and that   s unfair .  .  it   s only human  isn   t it  to want to be secure .  earth is overpopulated and it is only slowly reversing the havoc inflicted on the planet by the mad twentieth .  surely man   s original home must come first  ahead of either luna city or ocean deep .  heavens  ocean deep is almost home to me  but i can   t want to see it flourish at the expense of earth   s land .          it   s not an either or  mrs .  bergen     said demerest earnestly .     if the ocean and outer space are firmly  honestly  and intelligently exploited  it can only redound to earth   s benefit .  a small investment will be lost but a large one will redeem itself with profit .       bergen held up his hand .     yes  i know .  you don   t have to argue with me on that point .  you   d be trying to convert the converted .  come  let   s eat .  i tell you what .  we   ll eat here .  if you   ll stay with us overnight  or several days for that matter you   re quite welcome there will be ample time to meet everybody .  perhaps you   d rather take it easy for a while  though .          much rather     said demerest .     actually  i want to stay here   i would like to ask  by the way  why i met so few people when we went through the units .          no mystery     said bergen genially .     at any given time  some fifteen of our men are asleep and perhaps fifteen more are watching films or playing chess or  if their wives are with them           yes  john     said annette .         and it   s customary not to disturb them .  the quarters are constricted and what privacy a man can have is cherished .  a few are out at sea  three right now  i think .  that leaves a dozen or so at work in here and you met them .          i   ll get lunch     said annette  rising .    she smiled and stepped through the door  which closed automatically behind her .    bergen looked after her .     that   s a concession .  she   s playing woman for your sake .  ordinarily  it would be just as likely for me to get the lunch .  the choice is not defined by sex but by the striking of random lightning .       demerest said     the doors between units  it seems to me  are of dangerously limited strength .          are they .          if an accident happened  and one unit was punctured           no meteorites down here     said bergen  smiling .       oh yes  wrong word .  if there were a leak of any sort  for any reason  then could a unit or a group of units be sealed off against the full pressure of the ocean .          you mean  in the way that luna city can have its component units automatically sealed off in case of meteorite puncture in order to limit damage to a single unit .          yes     said demerest with a faint bitterness .     as did not happen recently .          in theory  we could do that  but the chances of accident are much less down here .  as i said  there are no meteorites and  what   s more  there are no currents to speak of .  even an earthquake centered immediately below us would not be damaging since we make no fixed or solid contact with the ground beneath and are cushioned by the ocean itself against the shocks .  so we can afford to gamble on no massive influx .          yet if one happened .          then we could be helpless .  you see  it is not so easy to seal off component units here .  on the moon  there is a pressure differentia  of just one atmosphere  one atmosphere inside and the zero atmosphere of vacuum outside .  a thin seal is enough .  here at ocean deep the pressure differential is roughly a thousand atmospheres .  to secure absolute safety against that differentia  would take a great deal of money and you know what you said about getting money out of ppc .  so we gamble and so far we   ve been lucky .          and we haven   t     said demerest .    bergen looked uncomfortable  but annette distracted both by coming in with lunch at this moment .    she said     i hope  mr .  demerest  that you   re prepared for spartan fare .  all our food in ocean deep is prepackaged and requires only heating .  we specialize in blandness and nonsurprise here  and the non surprise of the day is a bland chicken a la king  with carrots  boiled potatoes  a piece of something that looks like a brownie for dessert  and  of course  all the coffee you can drink .        demerest rose to take his tray and tried to smile .     it sounds very like moon fare  mrs .  bergen  and i was brought up on that .  we grow our own micro organismic food .  it is patriotic to eat that but not particularly enjoyable .  we hope to keep improving it  though .          i   m sure you will improve it .  .  .    demerest said  as he ate with a slow and methodical chewing     i hate to ride my specialty  but how secure are you against mishaps in your air lock entry .          it is the weakest point of ocean deep     said bergen .  he had finished eating  well ahead of the other two  and was half through with his first cup of coffee .     but there   s got to be an interface  right .  the entry is as automatic as we can make it and as fail safe .  number one  there has to be contact at every point about the outer lock before the fusion generator begins to heat the water within the lock .  what   s more  the contact has to be metallic and of a metal with just the magnetic permeability we use on our    scaphes .  presumably a rock or some mythical deep sea monster might drop down and make contact at just the right places  but if so  nothing happens .       then  too  the outer door doesn   t open until the steam has pushed the water out and then condensed  in other words  not till both pressure and temperature have dropped below a certain point .  at the moment the outer door begins to open  a relatively slight increase in internal pressure  as by water entry  will close it again .       demerest said     but then  once men have passed through the lock  the inner door closes behind them and sea water must be allowed into the lock again .  can you do that gradually against the full pressure of the ocean outside .          not very .     bergen smiled .     it doesn   t pay to fight the ocean too hard .  you have to roll with the punch .  we slow it down to about one tenth free entry but even so it comes in like a rifle shot louder  a thunderclap  or waterclap  if you prefer .  the inner door can hold it  though  and it is not subjected to the strain very often .  well  wait  you heard the waterclap when we first met  when javan   s    scaphe took off again .  remember .          i remember     said demerest .     but here is something i don   t understand .  you keep the lock filled with ocean at high pressure at all times to keep the outer door without strain .  but that keeps the inner door at full strain .  somewhere there has to be strain .          yes  indeed .  but if the outer door  with a thousand atmosphere differential on its two sides  breaks down  the full ocean in all its millions of cubic miles tries to enter and that would be the end of all .  if the inner door is the one under strain and it gives  then it will be messy indeed  but the only water that enters ocean deep will be the very limited quantity in the lock and its pressure will drop at once .  we will have plenty of time for repair  for the outer door will certainly hold a long time .          but if both go simultaneously           then we are through .     bergen shrugged .     i need not tell you that neither absolute certainty nor absolute safety exists .  you have to live with some risk and the chance of double and simultaneous failure is so microscopically small that it can be lived with easily .          if all your mechanical contrivances fail           they fail safe     said bergen stubbornly .    demerest nodded .  he finished the last of his chicken .  mrs .  bergen was already beginning to clean up .     you   ll pardon my questions  mr .  bergen  i hope .          you   re welcome to ask .  i wasn   t informed  actually  as to the precise nature of your mission here .     fact finding    is a weasel phrase .  however  i assume there is keen distress on the moon over the recent disaster and as safety engineer you rightly feel the responsibility of correcting whatever shortcomings exist and would be interested in learning  if possible  from the system used in ocean deep .          exactly .  but  see here  if all your automatic contrivances fail safe for some reason  for any reason  you would be alive  but all your escape hatch mechanisms would be sealed permanently shut .  you would be trapped inside ocean deep and would exchange a slow death for a fast one .          it   s not likely to happen but we   d hope we could make repairs before our air supply gave out .  besides we do have a manual backup system .          oh .          certainly .  when ocean deep was first established and this was the only unit the one we   re sitting in now manual controls were all we had .  that was unsafe  if you like .  there they are  right behind you  covered with friable plastic .          in emergency  break glass     muttered demerest  inspecting the covered setup .       pardon me .          just a phrase commonly used in ancient fire fighting systems  .  .  . well  do the manuals still work  or has the system been covered with your friable plastic for twenty years to the point where it has all decayed into uselessness with no one noticing .          not at all .  it   s periodically checked  as all our equipment is .  that   s not my job personally  but i know it is done .  if any electrical or electronic circuit is out of its normal working condition  lights flash  signals sound  everything happens but a nuclear blast .     .  . you know  mr .  demerest  we are as curious about luna city as you are about ocean deep .  i presume you would be willing to invite one of our young men           how about a young woman .     interposed annette at once .       i am sure you mean yourself  dear     said bergen     to which   i can only answer that you are determined to have a baby here and to keep it here for a period of time after birth  and that effectively eliminates you from consideration .       demerest said stiffly     we hope you will send men to luna city .  we are anxious to have you understand our problems .          yes  a mutual exchange of problems and of weeping on each other   s shoulders might be of great comfort to all .  for instance  you have one advantage on luna city that i wish we could have .  with low gravity and a low pressure differential  you can make your caverns take on any irregular and angular fashion that appeals to your aesthetic sense or is required for convenience .  down here we   re restricted to the sphere  at least for the foreseeable future  and our designers develop a hatred for the spherical that surpasses belief .  actually it isn   t funny .  it breaks them down .  they eventually resign rather than continue to work spherically .       bergen shook his head and leaned his chair back against a microfilm cabinet .     you know     he continued     when william beebe built the first deep set chamber in history in the     s  it was just a gondola suspended from a mother ship by a half mile cable  with no buoyancy chambers and no engines  and if the cable broke  good night  only it never did .   .  .  . anyway  what was i saying .  oh  when beebe built his first deep sea chamber  he was going to make it cylindrical  you know  so a man would fit in it comfortably .  after all  a man is essentially a tall  skinny cylinder .  however  a friend of his argued him out of that and into a sphere on the very sensible grounds that a sphere would resist pressure more efficiently than any other possible shape .  you know who that friend was .          no  i   m afraid i don   t .          the man who was president of the united states at the time of beebe   s descents franklin d .  roosevelt .  all these spheres you see down here are the great grandchildren of roosevelt   s suggestion .       demerest considered that briefly but made no comment .  he returned to the earlier topic .     we would particularly like someone from ocean deep     he said     to visit luna city because it might lead to a great enough understanding of the need  on ocean deep   s part  for a course of action that might involve considerable self sacrifice .          oh .     bergen   s chair came down flat leggedly on all fours .     how   s that .          ocean deep is a marvelous achievement  i wish to detract nothing from that .  i can see where it will become greater still  a wonder of the world .  still           still .          still  the oceans are only a part of the earth  a major part  but only a part .  the deep sea is only part of the ocean .  it is inner space indeed  it works inward  narrowing constantly to a point .          i think     broke in annette  looking rather grim     that you   re about to make a comparison with luna city .          indeed i am     said demerest .     luna city represents outer space  widening to infinity .  there is nowhere to go down here in the long run  everywhere to go out there .          we don   t judge by size and volume alone  mr .  demerest     said bergen .     the ocean is only a small part of earth  true  but for that very reason it is intimately connected with over five billion human beings .  ocean deep is experimental but the settlements on the continental shelf already deserve the name of cities .  ocean deep offers mankind the chance of exploiting the whole planet           of polluting the whole planet     broke in demerest excitedly .     of raping it  of ending it .  the concentration of human effort to earth itself is unhealthy and even fatal if it isn   t balanced by a turning outward to the frontier .          there is nothing at the frontier     said annette  snapping out the words .     the moon is dead  all the other worlds out there are dead .  if there are live worlds among the stars  light years away  they can   t be reached .  this ocean is living .          the moon is living  too  mrs .  bergen  and if ocean deep allows it  the moon will become an independent world .  we moon men will then see to it that other worlds are reached and made alive and  if mankind but has patience  we will reach the stars .  we .  we .  it is only we moon men  used to space  used to a world in a cavern  used to an engineered environment  who could endure life in a spaceship that may have to travel centuries to reach the stars .          wait  wait  demerest     said bergen  holding up his hand .     back up .  what do you mean  if ocean deep allows it .  what have we to do with it .          you   re competing with us  mr .  bergen .  the planetary project commission will swing your way  give you more  give us less  because in the short term  as your wife says  the ocean is alive and the moon  except for a thousand men  is not  because you are a half dozen miles away and we a quarter of a million  because you can be reached in an hour and we only in three days .  and because you have an ideal safety record and we have had misfortunes .          the last  surely  is trivial .  accidents can happen any time  anywhere .          but the trivial can be used     said demerest angrily .     it can be made to manipulate emotions .  to people who don   t see the purpose and the importance of space exploration  the death of moon men in  accidents is proof enough that the moon is dangerous  that its colonization is a useless fantasy .  why not .  it   s their excuse for saving money and they can then salve their consciences by investing part of it in ocean deep instead .  that   s why i said the accident on the moon had threatened the survival of luna city even though it killed only twenty people out of nearly a thousand .          i don   t accept your argument .  there has been enough money for both for a score of years .          not enough money .  that   s exactly it .  not enough investment to make the moon self supporting in all these years  and then they use that lack of self support against us .  not enough investment to make ocean deep self supporting either .   .  .  .  but now they can give you enough if they cut us out altogether .          do you think that will happen .          i   m almost sure it will  unless ocean deep shows a statesmanlike concern for man   s future .          how .          by refusing to accept additional funds .  by not competing with luna city .  by putting the good of the whole race ahead of self interest .          surely you don   t expect us to dismantle           you won   t have to .  don   t you see .  join us in explaining that luna city is essential  that space exploration is the hope of mankind  that you will wait  retrench  if necessary .       bergen looked at his wife and raised his eyebrows .  she shook her head angrily .  bergen said     you have a rather romantic view of the ppc  i think .  even if i made noble  self sacrificing speeches  who   s to say they would listen .  there   s a great deal more involved in the matter of ocean deep than my opinion and my statements .  there are economic considerations and public feeling .  why don   t you relax  mr .  demerest .  luna city won   t come to an end .  you   ll receive funds  i   m sure of it .  i tell you  i   m sure of it .  now let   s break this up         no  i   ve got to convince you one way or another that i   m serious .  if necessary  ocean deep must come to a halt unless the ppc can supply ample funds for both .       bergen said     is this some sort of official mission  mr .  demerest .  are you speaking for luna city officially  or just for yourself .          just for myself  but maybe that   s enough  mr .  bergen .          i don   t think it is .  i   m sorry  but this is turning out to be unpleasant .  i suggest that  after all  you had better return topside on the first available    scaphe .          not yet .  not yet .     demerest looked about wildly  then rose unsteadily and put his back against the wall .  he was a little too tall for the room and he became conscious of life receding .  one more step and he would have gone too far to back out .    he had told them back on the moon that there would be no use talking  no use negotiating .  it was dog eat dog for the available funds and luna city   s destiny must not be aborted  not for ocean deep  not  for earth  no  not for all of earth  since mankind and the universe came even before the earth .  man must outgrow his womb and   demerest could hear his own ragged breathing and the inner turmoil of his whirling thoughts .  the other two were looking at him with what seemed concern .  annette rose and said     are you ill  mr .  demerest .          i am not ill .  sit down .  i   m a safety engineer and i want to teach you about safety .  sit down  mrs .  bergen .          sit down  annette     said bergen .     i   ll take care of him .     he rose and took a step forward .    but demerest said     no .  don   t you move either .  i have something right here .  you   re too naive concerning human dangers  mr .  bergen .  you guard against the sea and against mechanical failure and you don   t search your human visitors  do you .  i have a weapon  bergen .       now that it was out and he had taken the final step  from which there was no returning  for he was now dead whatever he did  he was quite calm .    annette said     oh  john     and grasped her husband   s arm .     he   s        bergen stepped in front of her .     a weapon .  is that what that thing is .  now slowly  demerest  slowly .  there   s nothing to get hot over .  if you want to talk  we will talk .  what is that .          nothing dramatic .  a portable laser beam .          but what do you want to do with it .          destroy ocean deep .          but you can   t  demerest .  you know you can   t .  there   s only so much energy you can pack into your fist and any laser you can hold can   t pump enough heat to penetrate the walls .          i know that .  this packs more energy than you think .  it   s moon made and there are some advantages to manufacturing the energy unit in a vacuum .  but you   re right .  even so  it   s designed only for small jobs and requires frequent recharging .  so i don   t intend to try to cut through a foot plus of alloy steel .   .  .  . but it will do the job indirectly .  for one thing  it will keep you two quiet .  there   s enough energy in my fist to kill two people .          you wouldn   t kill us     said bergen evenly .     you have no reason .          if by that     said demerest     you imply that i am an unreasoning being to be somehow made to understand my madness  forget it .  i have every reason to kill you and i will kill you .  by laser beam if i have to  though i would rather not .      .       what good will killing us do you .  make me understand .  is it that i have refused to sacrifice ocean deep funds .  i couldn   t do anything else .  i   m not really the one to make the decision .  and if you kill me  that won   t help you force the decision in your direction  will it .  in fact  quite the contrary .  if a moon man is a murderer  how will that reflect on luna city .  consider human emotions on earth .       there was just an edge of shrillness in annette   s voice as she joined in .     don   t you see there will be people who will say that solar radiation on the moon has dangerous effects .  that the genetic engineering which has reorganized your bones and muscles has affected mental stability .  consider the word    lunatic     mr .  demerest .  men once believed the moon brought madness .          i am not mad  mrs .  bergen .          it doesn   t matter     said bergen  following his wife   s lead smoothly .     men will say that you were  that all moon men are  and luna city will be closed down and the moon itself closed to all further exploration  perhaps forever .  is that what you want .          that might happen if they thought i killed you  but they won   t .  it will be an accident .     with his left elbow  demerest broke the plastic that covered the manual controls .       i know units of this sort     he said .     i know exactly how it works .  logically  breaking that plastic should set up a warning flash  after all  it might be broken by accident  and then someone would be here to investigate  or  better yet  the controls should lock until deliberately released to make sure the break w  not merely accidental .       he paused  then said     but i   m sure no one will come  that no warning has taken place .  your manual system is not failsafe because in your heart you were sure it would never be used .          what do you plan to do .     said bergen .    he was tense and demerest watched his knees carefully  and said     if you try to jump toward me  i   ll shoot at once  and then keep right on with what i   m doing .          i think maybe you   re giving me nothing to lose .          you   ll lose time .  let me go right on without interference and you   ll have some minutes to keep on talking .  you may even be able to talk me out of it .  there   s my proposal .  don   t interfere with me and i will give you your chance to argue .          but what do you plan to do .          this     said demerest .  he did not have to look .  his left hand snaked out and closed a contact .     the fusion unit will now pump heat into the air lock and the steam will empty it .  it will take a few minutes .  when it   s done  i   m sure one of those little red glass buttons will light .          are you going to        demerest said     why do you ask .  you know that i must be intending  having gone this far  to rood ocean deep .          but why .  damn it  why .          because it will be marked down as an accident .  because your safety record will be spoiled .  because it will be a complete catastrophe and will wipe you out .  and ppc will then turn from you  and the glamor of ocean deep will be gone .  we will get the funds  we will continue .  if i could bring that to pass in some other way  i would  but the needs of luna city are the needs of mankind and those are paramount .          you will die  too     annette managed to say .       of course .  once i am forced to do something like this  would i want to live .  i   m not a murderer .          but you will be .  if you flood this unit  you will flood all of ocean deep and kill everyone in it  and doom those who are out in their subs to slower death .  fifty men and women   an unborn child           that is not my fault     said demerest  in clear pain .     i did not expect to find a pregnant woman here  but now that i have  i can   t stop because of that .          but you must stop     said bergen .     your plan won   t work unless what happens can be shown to be an accident .  they   ll find you with a beam emitter in your hand and with the manual controls clearly tampered with .  do you think they won   t deduce the truth from that .       demerest was feeling very tired .     mr .  bergen  you sound desperate .  listen when the outer door opens  water under a thousand atmospheres of pressure will enter .  it will be a massive battering ram that will destroy and mangle everything in its path .  the walls of the ocean deep units will remain but everything inside will be twisted beyond recognition .  human beings will be mangled into shredded tissue and splintered bone and death will be instantaneous and unfelt .  even if i were to burn you to death with the laser there would be nothing left to show it had been done  so i won   t hesitate  you see .  this manual unit will be smashed anyway  anything i can do will be erased by the water  .          but the beam emitter  the laser gun .  even damaged  it will be recognizable     said annette .       we use such things on the moon  mrs .  bergen .  it is a common tool  it is the optical analogue of a jackknife .  i could kill you with a jackknife  you know  but one would not deduce that a man carrying a jackknife  or even holding one with the blade open  was necessarily planning murder .  he might be whittling .  besides  a moon made laser is not a projectile gun .  it doesn   t have to withstand  . an internal explosion .  it is made of thin metal  mechanically weak .  after it is smashed by the waterclap i doubt that it will make much sense as an object .       demerest did not have to think to make these statements .  he had worked them out within himself through months of self debate back on the moon .       in fact     he went on     how will the investigators ever know what happened in here .  they will send    scaphes down to inspect what is left of ocean deep  but how can they get inside without first pumping the water out .  they will  in effect  have to build a new ocean deep and that would take  how long .  perhaps  given public reluctance to waste money  they might never do it at all and content themselves with dropping a laurel wreath on the dead walls of the dead ocean deep .       bergen said     the men on luna city will know what you have done .  surely one of them will have a conscience .  the truth will be known .          one truth     said demerest     is that i am not a fool .  no one on luna city knows what i planned to do or will suspect what i have done .  they sent me down here to negotiate cooperation on the matter of financial grants .  i was to argue and nothing more .  there   s not even a laser beam emitter missing up there .  i put this one together myself out of scrapped parts .   .  .  . and it works .  i   ve tested it .       annette said slowly     you haven   t thought it through .  do you know what you   re doing .          i   ve thought it through .  i know what i   m doing .   .  .  . and i know also that you are both conscious of the lit signal .  i   m aware of it .  the air lock is empty and time   s up  i   m afraid .       rapidly  holding his beam emitter tensely high  he closed another contact .  a circular part of the unit wall cracked into a thin crescent and rolled smoothly away .    out of the corner of his eye  demerest saw the gaping darkness  but he did not look .  a dankly salt vapor issued from it  a queer odor of dead steam .  he even imagined he could  hear the flopping sound of the gathered water at the bottom of the lock .    demerest said     in a rational manual unit  the outer door ought to be frozen shut now .  with the inner door open  nothing ought to make the outer door open .  i suspect  though  that the manuals were put together too quickly at first for that precaution to have been taken  and it was replaced too quickly for that precaution to have been added .  and if i need further evidence of that  you wouldn   t be sitting there so tensely if you knew the outer door wouldn   t open .  i need touch one more contact and the waterclap will come .  we will feel nothing .        annette said     don   t push it just yet .  i have one more thing to say .  you said we would have time to persuade you .          while the water was being pushed out .          just let me say this .  a minute .  a minute .  i said you didn   t know what you were doing .  you don   t .  you   re destroying the space program  the space program .  there   s more to space than space .     her voice had grown shrill .    demerest frowned .     what are you talking about .  make sense  or i   ll end it all .  i   m tired .  i   m frightened .  i want it over .       annette said     you   re not in the inner councils of the ppc .  neither is my husband .  but i am .  do you think because i am a woman that i   m secondary here .  i   m not .  you  mr .  demerest  have your eyes fixed on luna city only .  my husband has his fixed on ocean deep .  neither of you know anything .       where do you expect to go  mr .  demerest  if you had all the money you wanted .  mars .  the asteroids .  the satellites of the gas giants .  these are all small worlds  all dry surfaces under a blank sky .  it may be generations before we are ready to try for the stars and till then we   d have only pygmy real estate .  is that your ambition .       my husband   s ambition is no better .  he dreams of pushing man   s habitat over the ocean boor  a surface not much larger in the last analysis than the surface of the moon and the other pygmy worlds .  we of the ppc  on the other hand  want more than either of you  and if you push that button  mr .  demerest  the greatest dream mankind has ever had will come to nothing .       demerest found himself interested despite himself  but he said     you   re just babbling .     it was possible  he knew  that somehow they had warned others in ocean deep  that any moment someone would come to interrupt  someone would try to shoot him down .  he was  however  staring at the only opening  and he had only to close one contact  without even looking  in a second   s movement .    annette said     i   m not babbling .  you know it took more than rocket ships to colonize the moon .  to make a successful colony possible  men had  . to be altered genetically and adjusted to low gravity .  you are a product of such genetic engineering .          well  .          and might not genetic engineering also help men to greater gravitational pull .  what is the largest planet of the solar system  mr .  demerest .          jupi           yes  jupiter .  eleven times the diameter of the earth  forty times the diameter of the moon .  a surface a hundred and twenty times that of the earth in area  sixteen hundred times that of the moon .  conditions so different from anything we can encounter anywhere on the worlds the size of earth or less that any scientist of any persuasion would give half his life for a chance to observe at close range .          but jupiter is an impossible target .          indeed .     said annette  and even managed a faint smile .     as impossible as flying .  why is it impossible .  genetic engineering could design men with stronger and denser bones  stronger and more compact muscles .  the same principles that enclose luna city against the vacuum and ocean deep against the sea can also enclose the future jupiter deep against its ammoniated surroundings .          the gravitational field           can be negotiated by nuclear powered ships that are now on the drawing board .  you don   t know that but i do .          we   re not even sure about the depth of the atmosphere .  the pressures           the pressures .  the pressures .  mr .  demerest  look about you .  why do you suppose ocean deep was really built .  to exploit the ocean .  the settlements on the continental shelf are doing that quite adequately .  to gain knowledge of the deep sea bottom .  we could do that by    scaphe easily and we could then have spared the hundred billion dollars invested in ocean deep so far .       don   t you see  mr .  demerest  that ocean deep must mean something more than that .  the purpose    of ocean deep is to devise the ultimate vessels and mechanisms that will suffice to explore and colonize jupiter .  look about you and see the beginnings of a jovian environment  the closest approach we can come to it on earth .  it is only a faint image of mighty jupiter  but it   s a beginning .       destroy this  mr .  demerest  and you destroy any hope for jupiter .  on the other hand  let us live and we will  together  penetrate and settle the brightest jewel of the solar system .  and long before we can reach the limits of jupiter  we will be ready for the stars  for the earth type planets circling them  and the jupiter type planets  too .  luna city won   t be abandoned because both are necessary for this ultimate aim .       for the moment  demerest had altogether forgotten about that last button .  he said     nobody on luna city has heard of this .          you haven   t .  there are those on luna city who know .  if you had told them of your plan of destruction  they would have stopped you .  naturally  we can   t make this common knowledge and only a few people anywhere can know .  the public supports only with difficulty the planetary projects now in progress .  if the ppc is parsimonious it is because public opinion limits its generosity .  what do you suppose public opinion would say if they thought we were aiming toward jupiter .  what a super boondoggle that would be in their eyes .  but we continue and what money we can save and make use of we place in the various facets of project big world .          project big world .          yes     said annette .     you know now and i have committed a serious security breach .  but it doesn   t matter  does it .  since we   re all dead and since the project is  too .          wait .  now  mrs .  bergeh .          if you change your mind now  don   t think you can ever talk about project big world .  that would end the project just as effectively as destruction here would .  and it would end both your career and mine .  it might end luna city and ocean deep  too  so now that you know  maybe it makes no difference anyway .  you might just as well push that button .          i said wait      demerest   s brow was furrowed and his eyes burned with anguish .     i don   t know        bergen gathered for the sudden jump as demerest   s tense alertness wavered into uncertain introspection  but annette grasped her husband   s sleeve .    a timeless interval that might have been ten seconds long followed and then demerest held out his laser .     take it     he said .     i   ll consider myself under arrest .          you can   t be arrested     said annette     without the whole story coming out .     she took the laser and gave it to bergen .     it will be enough that you return to luna city and keep silent .  till then we will keep you  . under guard .       bergen was at the manual controls .  the inner door slid shut and after that there was the thunderous waterclap of the water returning into the lock .    husband and wife were alone again .  they had not dared say a word until demerest was safely put to sleep under the watchful eyes of two men detailed for the purpose .  the unexpected waterclap had roused everybody and a sharply bowdlerized account of the incident had been given out .    the manual controls were now locked off and bergen said     from this point on  the manuals  will have to be adjusted to fail safe .  and visitors will have to be searched .          oh  john     said annette .     i think people are insane .  there we were  facing death for us and for ocean deep  just the end of everything .  and i kept thinking   must keep calm  i mustn   t have a miscarriage .          you kept calm all right .  you were magnificent .  i mean  project big world .  i never conceived of such a thing  but by  by  jove  it   s an attractive thought .  it   s wonderful .          i   m sorry i had to say all that  john .  it was all a fake  of course .  i made it up  demerest wanted me to make something up really .  he wasn   t a killer or destroyer  he was  according to his own overheated lights  a patriot  and i suppose he was telling himself he must destroy in order to save  a common enough view among the small minded .  but he said he would give us time to talk him out of it and i think he was praying we would manage to do so .  he wanted us to think of something that would give him the excuse to save in order to save  and i gave it to him .  i   m sorry i had to fool you  john .          you didn   t fool me .          i didn   t .          how could you .  i knew you weren   t a member of ppc .          what made you so sure of that .  because i   m a woman .          not at all .  because i   m a member  annette  and that   s confidential .  and  if you don   t mind  i will begin a move to initiate exactly what you suggested project big world .          well .     annette considered that and  slowly  smiled .     well .  that   s not bad .  women do have their uses .          something     said bergen  smiling also     i have never denied .      ed ferman of f   sf and barry malzberg  one of the brightest of the new generation of science fiction writers  had it in mind in early      to prepare an anthology in which a number of different science fiction themes were carried to their ultimate conclusion .  for each story they tapped some writer who was associated with a particular theme  and for a story on the subject of robotics  they wanted me  naturally .    i tried to beg off with my usual excuses concerning the state of my schedule  but they said if i didn   t do it there would be no story on robotics at all  because they wouldn   t ask anyone else .  that shamed me into agreeing to do it .    i then had to think up a way of reaching an ultimate conclusion .  there had always been one aspect of the robot theme i had never had the courage to write  although the late john campbell and i had sometimes discussed it .    in the first two laws of robotics  you see  the expression    human being    is used  and the assumption is that a robot can recognize a human being when he sees one .  but what is a human being .  or  as the psalmist asks of god     what is man that thou art mindful of him .       surely  if there   s any doubt as to the definition of man  the laws of robotics don   t necessarily hold .  so i wrote that thou art mindful of him  and ed and barry were very happy with it and so was i .  it not only appeared in the anthology  which was entitled final stage  but was also published in the may      issue of f   sf .       that thou art mindful of him     the three laws of robotics     .  a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .     .    keith harriman  who had for twelve years now been director of research at united states robots and mechanical men corporation  found that he was not at all certain whether he was doing right .  the tip of his tongue passed over his plump but rather pale lips and it seemed to him that the holographic image of the great susan calvin  which stared unsmilingly down upon him  had never looked so grim before .    usually he blanked out that image of the greatest roboticist in history because she unnerved him .   he tried thinking of the image as    it    but never quite succeeded .   this time he didn   t quite dare to and her long dead gaze bored into the side of his face .    it was a dreadful and demeaning step he would have to take .  opposite him was george ten  calm and unaffected either by   harriman   s patent uneasiness or by the image of the patron saint of robotics glowing in its niche above .    harriman said     we haven   t had a chance to talk this out  really  george .  you haven   t been with us that long and i haven   t had a good chance to be alone with you .  but now i would like to discuss the matter in some detail .          i am perfectly willing to do that      said george .     in my stay at u .  s .  robots  i have gathered the crisis has something to do with the three laws .          yes .  you know the three laws  of course .          i do .          yes  i   m sure you do .  but let us dig even deeper and consider the truly basic problem .  in two centuries of  if i may say so  considerable success  u .  s .  robots has never managed to persuade human beings to accept robots .  we have placed robots only where work is required that human beings cannot do  or in environments that human beings find unacceptably dangerous .  robots have worked mainly in space and that has limited what we have been able to do .          surely     said george ten     that represents a broad limit  and one within which u .  s .  robots can prosper .          no  for two reasons .  in the first place  the boundaries set for us inevitably contract .  as the moon colony  for instance  grows more sophisticated  its demand for robots decreases and we expect that  within the next few years  robots will be banned on the moon .  this will be repeated on every world colonized by mankind .  secondly  true prosperity is impossible without robots on earth .  we at u .  s .  robots firmly believe that human beings need robots and must learn to live with their mechanical analogues if progress is to be maintained .          do they not .  mr .  harriman  you have on your desk a computer input which  i understand  is connected with the organization   s multivac .  a computer is a kind of sessile robot  a robot brain not attached to a body           true  but that also is limited .  the computers used by mankind have been steadily specialized in order to avoid too humanlike an intelligence .  a century ago we were well on the way to artificial intelligence of the most unlimited type through the use of great computers we called machines .  those machines limited their action of their own accord .  once they had solved the ecological problems that had threatened human society  they phased themselves out .  their own continued existence would  they reasoned  have placed them in the role of a crutch to mankind and  since they felt this would harm human beings  they condemned themselves by the first law .          and were they not correct to do so .          in my opinion  no .  by their action  they reinforced mankind   s frankenstein complex  its gut fears that any artificial man they created would turn upon its creator .  men fear that robots may replace human beings .          do you not fear that yourself .          i know better .  as long as the three laws of robotics exist  they cannot .  they can serve as partners of mankind  they can share in the great struggle to understand and wisely direct the laws of nature so that together they can do more than mankind can possibly do alone  but always in such a way that robots serve human beings .          but if the three laws have shown themselves  over the course of two centuries  to keep robots within bounds  what is the source of the distrust of human beings for robots .          well     and harriman   s graying hair tufted as he scratched his head vigorously     mostly superstition  of course .  unfortunately  there are also some complexities involved that anti robot agitators seize upon .          involving the three laws .          yes .  the second law in particular .  there   s no problem in the third law  you see .  it is universal .  robots must always sacrifice themselves for human beings  any human beings .          of course     said george ten .       the first law is perhaps less satisfactory  since it is always possible to imagine a condition in which a robot must perform either action a or action b  the two being mutually exclusive  and where either action results in harm to human beings .  the robot must therefore quickly select which action results in the least harm .  to work out the positronic paths of the robot brain in such a way as to make that selection possible is not easy .  if action a results in harm to a talented young artist and b results in equivalent harm to five elderly people of no particular worth  which action should be chosen .          action a      said george ten .     harm to one is less than harm to five .          yes  so robots have always been designed to decide .  to expect robots to make judgments of fine points such as talent  intelligence  the general usefulness to society  has always seemed impractical .  that would delay decision to the point where the robot is effectively immobilized .  so we go by numbers .  fortunately  we might expect crises in which robots must make such decisions to be few .  .  .  . but then that brings us to the second law .          the law of obedience .          yes .  the necessity of obedience is constant .  a robot may exist for twenty years without every having to act quickly to prevent harm to a human being  or find itself faced with the necessity of risking its own destruction .  in all that time  however  it will be constantly obeying orders .  .  .  . whose orders .          those of a human being .          any human being .  how do you judge a human being so as to know whether to obey or not .  what is man  that thou art mindful of him  george .       george hesitated at that .    harriman said hurriedly     a biblical quotation .  that doesn   t matter .  i mean  must a robot follow the orders of a child  or of an idiot  or of a criminal  or of a perfectly decent intelligent man who happens to be inexpert and therefore ignorant of the undesirable consequences of his order .  and if two human beings give a robot conflicting orders  which does the robot follow .          in two hundred years     said george ten     have not these problems arisen and been solved .          no     said harriman  shaking his head violently .     we have been hampered by the very fact that our robots have been used only in specialized environments out in space  where the men who dealt with them were experts in their field .  there were no children  no idiots  no criminals  no well meaning ignoramuses present .  even so  there were occasions when damage was done by foolish or merely unthinking orders .  such damage in specialized and limited environments could be contained .  on earth  however  robots must have judgment .  so those against robots maintain  and  damn it  they are right .          then you must insert the capacity for judgment into the positronic brain .          exactly .  we have begun to reproduce jg models in which the robot can weigh every human being with regard to sex  age  social and professional position  intelligence  maturity  social responsibility and so on .          how would that affect the three laws .          the third law not at all .  even the most valuable robot must destroy himself for the sake of the most useless human being .  that cannot be tampered with .  the first law is affected only where alternative actions will all do harm .  the quality of the human beings involved as well as the quantity must be considered  provided there is time for such judgment and the basis for it  which will not be often .  the second law will be most deeply modified  since every potential obedience must involve judgment .  the robot will be slower to obey  except where the first law is also involved  but it will obey more rationally .          but the judgments which are required are very complicated .          very .  the necessity of making such judgments slowed the reactions of our first couple of models to the point of paralysis .  we improved matters in the later models at the cost of introducing so many pathways that the robot   s brain became far too unwieldy .  in our last couple of models  however  i think we have what we want .  the robot doesn   t have to make an instant judgment of the worth of a human being and the value of its orders .  it begins by obeying all human beings as any ordinary robot would and then it learns .  a robot grows  learns and matures .  it is the equivalent of a child at first and must be under constant supervision .  as it grows  however  it can  more and more  be allowed  unsupervised  into earth   s society .  finally  it is a full member of that society .          surely this answers the objections of those who oppose robots .          no     said harriman angrily .     now they raise others .  they will   not accept judgments .  a robot  they say  has no right to brand this person or that as inferior .  by accepting the orders of a in preference to that of b  b is branded as of less consequence than a and his human rights are violated .          what is the answer to that .          there is none .  i am giving up .          i see .          as far as i myself am concerned .  .  .  . instead  i turn to you  george .          to me .     george ten   s voice remained level .  there was a mild surprise in it but it did not affect him outwardly .     why to me .          because you are not a man     said harriman tensely .     i told you i want robots to be the partners of human beings .  i want you to be mine .       george ten raised his hands and spread them  palms outward  in an oddly human gesture .     what can i do .          it seems to you  perhaps  that you can do nothing  george .  you were created not long ago  and you are still a child .  you were designed to be not overfull of original information  it was why i have had to explain the situation to you in such detail  in order to leave room for growth .  but you will grow in mind and you will come to be able to approach the problem from a non human standpoint .  where i see no solution  you  from your own other standpoint  may see one .       george ten said     my brain is man designed .  in what way can it be non human .          you are the latest of the jg models  george .  your brain is the most complicated we have yet designed  in some ways more subtly complicated than that of the old giant machines .  it is open ended and  starting on a human basis  may  no  will  grow in any direction .  remaining always within the insurmountable boundaries of the three laws  you may yet become thoroughly non human in your thinking .          do i know enough about human beings to approach this problem rationally .  about their history .  their psychology .          of course not .  but you will learn as rapidly as you can .          will i have help  mr .  harriman .          no .  this is entirely between ourselves .  no one else knows of this and you must not mention this project to any human being  either at u .  s .  robots or elsewhere .       george ten said     are we doing wrong  mr .  harriman  that you seek to keep the matter secret .          no .  but a robot solution will not be accepted  precisely because it is robot in origin .  any suggested solution you have you will turn over to me  and if it seems valuable to me  i will present it .  no one will ever know it came from you .          in the light of what you have said earlier     said george ten calmly     this is the correct procedure .  .  .  . when do i start .          right now .  i will see to it that you have all the necessary films for scanning .       a .    harriman sat alone .  in the artificially lit interior of his office  there was no indication that it had grown dark outside .  he had no real sense that three hours had passed since he had taken george ten back to his cubicle and left him there with the first film references .    he was now merely alone with the ghost of susan calvin  the brilliant roboticist who had  virtually single handed  built up the positronic robot from a massive toy to man   s most delicate and versatile instrument  so delicate and versatile that man dared not use it  out of envy and fear .    it was over a century now since she had died .  the problem of the frankenstein complex had existed in her time  and she had never solved it .  she had never tried to solve it  for there had been no need .  robotics had expanded in her day with the needs of space exploration .    it was the very success of the robots that had lessened man   s need for them and had left harriman  in these latter times     but would susan calvin have turned to robots for help .  surely  she would have     and he sat there long into the night .     .    maxwell robertson was the majority stockholder of u .  s .  robots and in that sense its controller .  he was by no means an impressive person in appearance .  he was well into middle age  rather pudgy  and had a habit of chewing on the right corner of his lower lip when disturbed .    yet in his two decades of association with government figures he had developed a way of handling them .  he tended to use softness  giving in  smiling  and always managing to gain time .    it was growing harder .  gunnar eisenmuth was a large reason for its having grown harder .  in the series of global conservers  whose power had been second only to that of the global executive during the past century  eisenmuth hewed most closely to the harder edge of the gray area of compromise .  he was the first conserver who had not been american by birth and though it could not be demonstrated in any way that the archaic name of u .  s .  robots evoked his hostility  everyone at u .  s .  robots believed that .    there had been a suggestion  by no means the first that year  or that generation  that the corporate name be changed to world robots  but robertson would never allow that .  the company had been originally built with american capital  american brains  and american labor  and though the company had long been worldwide in scope and nature  the name would bear witness to its origin as long as he was in control .    eisenmuth was a tall man whose long sad face was coarsely textured and coarsely featured .  he spoke global with a pronounced american accent  although he had never been in the united states prior to his taking office .       it seems perfectly clear to me  mr .  robertson .  there is no difficulty .  the products of your company are always rented  never sold .  if the rented property on the moon is now no longer needed  it is up to you to receive the products back and transfer them .          yes  conserver  but where .  it would be against the law to bring them to earth without a government permit and that has been denied .          they would be of no use to you here .  you can take them to mercury or to the asteroids .          what would we do with them there .       eisenmuth shrugged .     the ingenious men of your company will think of something .       robertson shook his head .     it would represent an enormous loss for the company .          i   m afraid it would     said eisenmuth  unmoved .     i understand the company has been in poor financial condition for several years now .          largely because of government imposed restrictions  conserver .          you must be realistic  mr .  robertson .  you know that the climate of public opinion is increasingly against robots .          wrongly so  conserver .          but so  nevertheless .  it may be wiser to liquidate the company .  it is merely a suggestion  of course .          your suggestions have force  conserver .  is it necessary to tell you that our machines  a century ago  solved the ecological crisis .          i   m sure mankind is grateful  but that was a long time ago .  we now live in alliance with nature  however uncomfortable that might be at times  and the past is dim .          you mean what have we done for mankind lately .          i suppose i do .          surely we can   t be expected to liquidate instantaneously  not without enormous losses .  we need time .          how much .          how much can you give us .          it   s not up to me .       robertson said softly .     we are alone .  we need play no games .  how much time can you give me .       eisenmuth   s expression was that of a man retreating into inner calculations .     i think you can count on two years .  i   ll be frank .  the global government intends to take over the firm and phase it out for you if you don   t do it by then yourself  more or less .  and unless there is a vast turn in public opinion  which i greatly doubt      he shook his head .       two years  then     said robertson softly .    a .    robertson sat alone .  there was no purpose to his thinking and it had degenerated into retrospection .  four generations of robertsons had headed the firm .  none of them was a roboticist .  it had been men such as lanning and bogert and  most of all  most of all  susan calvin  who had made u .  s .  robots what it was  but surely the four robertsons had provided the climate that had made it possible for them to do their work .    without u .  s .  robots  the twenty first century would have progressed into deepening disaster .  that it didn   t was due to the machines that had for a generation steered mankind through the rapids and shoals of history .    and now for that  he was given two years .  what could be done in two years to overcome the insuperable prejudices of mankind .  he didn   t know .    harriman had spoken hopefully of new ideas but would go into no details .  just as well  for robertson would have understood none of it .    but what could harriman do anyway .  what had anyone ever done against man   s intense antipathy toward the imitation .  nothing     robertson drifted into a half sleep in which no inspiration came .     .    harriman said     you have it all now  george ten .  you have had everything i could think of that is at all applicable to the problem .  as far as sheer mass of information is concerned  you have stored more in your memory concerning human beings and their ways  past and present  than i have  or than any human being could have .          that is very likely .          is there anything more that you need  in your own opinion .          as far as information is concerned  i find no obvious gaps .  there may be matters unimagined at the boundaries .  i cannot tell .  but that would be true no matter how large a circle of information i took in .          true .  nor do we have time to take in information forever .  robertson has told me that we only have two years  and a quarter of one of those years has passed .  can you suggest anything .          at the moment  mr .  harriman  nothing .  i must weigh the information and for that purpose i could use help .          from me .          no .  most particularly  not from you .  you are a human being  of intense qualifications  and whatever you say may have the partial force of an order and may inhibit my considerations .  nor any other human being  for the same reason  especially since you have forbidden me to communicate with any .          but in that case  george  what help .          from another robot  mr .  harriman .          what other robot .          there are others of the jg series which were constructed .  i am the tenth  jg    .          the earlier ones were useless  experimental           mr .  harriman  george nine exists .          well  but what use will he be .  he is very much like you except for certain lacks .  you are considerably the more versatile of the two .          i am certain of that     said george ten .  he nodded his head in a grave gesture .     nevertheless  as soon as i create a line of thought  the mere fact that i have created it commends it to me and i find it difficult to abandon it .   f i can  after the development of a line of thought  express it to george nine  he would consider it without having first created it .  he would therefore view it without prior bent .  he might see gaps and shortcomings that i might not .       harriman smiled .     two heads are better than one  in other words  eh  george .          if by that  mr .  harriman  you mean two individuals with one head apiece  yes .          right .  is there anything else you want .          yes .  something more than films .  i have viewed much concerning human beings and their world .  i have seen human beings here at u .  s .  robots and can check my interpretation of what i have viewed against direct sensory impressions .  not so concerning the physical world .  i have never seen it and my viewing is quite enough to tell me that my surroundings here are by no means representative of it .  i would like to see it .          the physical world .     harriman seemed stunned at the enormity of the thought for a moment .     surely you don   t suggest i take you outside the grounds of u .  s .  robots .          yes  that is my suggestion .          that   s illegal at any time .  in the climate of opinion today  it would be fatal .          if we are detected  yes .  i do not suggest you take me to a city or even to a dwelling place of human beings .  i would like to see some open region  without human beings .          that  too  is illegal .          if we are caught .  need we be .       harriman said     how essential is this  george .          i cannot tell  but it seems to me it would be useful .          do you have something in mind .       george ten seemed to hesitate .     i cannot tell .  it seems to me that i might have something in mind if certain areas of uncertainty were reduced .          well  let me think about it .  and meanwhile  i   ll check out george nine and arrange to have you occupy a single cubicle .  that at least can be done without trouble .       a .    george ten sat alone .    he accepted statements tentatively  put them together  and drew a conclusion  over and over again  and from conclusions built other statements which he accepted and tested and found a contradiction and rejected  or not  and tentatively accepted further .    at none of the conclusions he reached did he feel wonder  surprise  satisfaction  merely a note of plus or minus .     .    harriman   s tension was not noticeably decreased even after they had made a silent downward landing on robertson   s estate .    robertson had countersigned the order making the dyna foil available  and the silent aircraft  moving as easily vertically as horizontally  had been large enough to carry the weight of harriman  george ten  and  of course  the pilot .     the dyna foil itself was one of the consequences of the machine catalyzed invention of the proton micro pile which supplied pollution free energy in small doses .  nothing had been done since of equal importance to man   s comfort  harriman   s lips tightened at the thought  and yet it had not earned gratitude for u .  s .  robots .     the air flight between the grounds of u .  s .  robots and the robertson estate had been the tricky part .  had they been stopped then  the presence of a robot aboard would have meant a great set of complications .  it would be the same on the way back .  the estate itself  it might be argued  it would be argued  was part of the property of u .  s .  robots and on that property  robots  properly supervised  might remain .    the pilot looked back and his eyes rested with gingerly briefness on george ten .     you want to get out at all  mr .  harriman .          yes .          it  too .          oh  yes .     then  just a bit sardonically     i won   t leave you alone with him .       george ten descended first and harriman followed .  they had come down on the foil port and not too far off was the garden .  it was quite a showplace and harriman suspected that robertson used juvenile hormone to control insect life without regard to environmental formulas .       come  george     said harriman .     let me show you .     together they walked toward the garden .    george said     it is a little as i have imaged it .  my eyes are not properly designed to detect wavelength differences  so i may not recognize different objects by that alone .          i trust you are not distressed at being color blind .  we needed too many positronic paths for your sense of judgment and were unable to spare any for sense of color .  in the future  if there is a future           i understand  mr .  harriman .  enough differences remain to show me that there are here many different forms of plant life .          undoubtedly .  dozens .          and each coequal with man  biologically .          each is a separate species  yes .  there are millions of species of living creatures .          of which the human being forms but one .          by far the most important to human beings  however .          and to me  mr .  harriman .  but i speak in the biological sense .          i understand .          life  then  viewed through all its forms  is incredibly complex .          yes  george  that   s the crux of the problem .  what man does for his own desires and comforts affects the complex total of life  the ecology  and his short term gains can bring long term disadvantages .  the machines taught us to set up a human society which would minimize that  but the near disaster of the early twenty first century has left mankind suspicious of innovations .  that  added to its special fear of robots           i understand  mr .  harriman .  .  .  . that is an example of animal life  i feel certain .          that is a squirrel  one of many species of squirrels .       the tail of the squirrel flirted as it passed to the other side of the tree      and this     said george  his arm moving with flashing speed     is a tiny thing indeed .     he held it between his fingers and peered at it .       it is an insect  some sort of beetle .  there are thousands of species of beetles .          with each individual beetle as alive as the squirrel and as yourself .          as complete and independent an organism as any other  within the total ecology .  there are smaller organisms still  many too small to see .          and that is a tree  is it not .  and it is hard to the touch        a .    the pilot sat alone .  he would have liked to stretch his own legs but some dim feeling of safety kept him in the dyna foil .  if that robot went out of control  he intended to take off at once .  but how could he tell if it went out of control .    he had seen many robots .  that was unavoidable considering he was mr .  robertson   s private pilot .  always  though  they had been in the laboratories and warehouses  where they belonged  with many specialists in the neighborhood .    true  dr .  harriman was a specialist .  none better  they said .  but a robot here was where no robot ought to be  on earth  in the open  free to move  he wouldn   t risk his good job by telling anyone about this  but it wasn   t right .     .    george ten said     the films i have viewed are accurate in terms of what i have seen .  have you completed those i selected for you  nine .          yes     said george nine .  the two robots sat stiffly  face to face  knee to knee  like an image and its reflection .  dr .  harriman could have told them apart at a glance  for he was acquainted with the minor differences in physical design .  if he could not see them  but could talk to them  he could still tell them apart  though with somewhat less certainty  for george nine   s responses would be subtly different from those produced by the substantially more intricately patterned positronic brain paths of george ten .       in that case     said george ten     give me your reactions to what i will say .  first  human beings fear and distrust robots because they regard robots as competitors .  how may that be prevented .          reduce the feeling of competitiveness     said george nine     by shaping the robot as something other than a human being .          yet the essence of a robot is its positronic replication of life .  a replication of life in a shape not associated with life might arouse horror .          there are two million species of life forms .  choose one of those as the shape rather than that of a human being .          which of all those species .     george nine   s thought processes proceeded noiselessly for some three seconds .     one large enough to contain a positronic brain  but one not possessing unpleasant associations for human beings .          no form of land life has a braincase large enough for a positronic brain but an elephant  which i have not seen  but which is described as very large  and therefore frightening to man .  how would you meet this dilemma .          mimic a life form no larger than a man but enlarge the braincase .       george ten said     a small horse  then  or a large dog  would you say .  both horses and dogs have long histories of association with human beings .          then that is well .          but consider  a robot with a positronic brain would mimic human intelligence .  if there were a horse or a dog that could speak and reason like a human being  there would be competitiveness there  too .  human beings might be all the more distrustful and angry at such unexpected competition from what they consider a lower form of life .       george nine said     make the positronic brain less complex  and the robot less nearly intelligent .          the complexity bottleneck of the positronic brain rests in the three laws .  a less complex brain could not possess the three laws in full measure .       george nine said at once     that cannot be done .       george ten said     i have also come to a dead end there .  that  then  is not a personal peculiarity in my own line of thought and way of thinking .  let us start again .  .  .  . under what conditions might the third law not be necessary .       george nine stirred as if the question were difficult and dangerous .  but he said     if a robot were never placed in a position of danger to itself  or if a robot were so easily replaceable that it did not matter whether it were destroyed or not .          and under what conditions might the second law not be necessary .       george nine   s voice sounded a bit hoarse .     if a robot were designed to respond automatically to certain stimuli with fixed responses and if nothing else were expected of it  so that no order need ever be given it .          and under what conditions     george ten paused here      might the first law not be necessary .       george nine paused longer and his words came in a low whisper     if the fixed responses were such as never to entail danger to human beings .          imagine  then  a positronic brain that guides only a few responses to certain stimuli and is simply and cheaply made  so that it does not require the three laws .  how large need it be .          not at all large .  depending on the responses demanded  it might weigh a hundred grams  one gram  one milligram .          your thoughts accord with mine .  i shall see dr .  harriman .       a .    george nine sat alone .  he went over and over the questions and answers .  there was no way in which he could change them .  and yet the thought of a robot of any kind  of any size  of any shape  of any purpose  without the three laws  left him with an odd  discharged feeling .    he found it difficult to move .  surely george ten had a similar reaction .  yet he had risen from his seat easily .     .    it had been a year and a half since robertson had been closeted with eisenmuth in private conversation .  in that interval  the robots had been taken off the moon and all the far flung activities of u .  s .  robots had withered .  what money robertson had been able to raise had been placed into this one quixotic venture of harriman   s .    it was the last throw of the dice  here in his own garden .  a year ago  harriman had taken the robot here  george ten  the last full robot that u .  s .  robots had manufactured .  now harriman was here with something else   harriman seemed to be radiating confidence .  he was talking easily with eisenmuth  and robertson wondered if he really felt the confidence he seemed to have .  he must .  in robertson   s experience  harriman was no actor .    eisenmuth left harriman  smiling  and came up to robertson .  eisenmuth   s smile vanished at once .     good morning  robertson     he said .     what is your man up to .          this is his show     said robertson evenly .     i   ll leave it to him .     harriman called out     i am ready  conserver .          with what  harriman .          with my robot  sir .          your robot .     said eisenmuth .     you have a robot here .     he looked about with a stem disapproval that yet had an admixture of curiosity .       this is u .  s .  robots    property  conserver .  at least we consider it as such .          and where is the robot  dr .  harriman .          in my pocket  conserver     said harriman cheerfully .    what came out of a capacious jacket pocket was a small glass jar .     that .     said eisenmuth incredulously .       no  conserver     said harriman .     this .       from the other pocket came out an object some five inches long and roughly in the shape of a bird .  in place of the beak  there was a narrow tube  the eyes were large  and the tail was an exhaust channel .    eisenmuth   s thick eyebrows drew together .     do you intend a serious demonstration of some sort  dr .  harriman  or are you mad .          be patient for a few minutes  conserver     said harriman .     a robot in the shape of a bird is none the less a robot for that .  and the positronic brain it possesses is no less delicate for being tiny .  this other object i hold is a jar of fruit flies .  there are fifty fruit flies in it which will be released .          and           the robo bird will catch them .  will you do the honors  sir .     harriman handed the jar to eisenmuth  who stared at it  then at   those around him  some officials from u .  s .  robots  others his own aides .  harriman waited patiently .    eisenmuth opened the jar  then shook it .    harriman said softly to the robo bird resting on the palm of his right hand     go .       the robo bird was gone .  it was a whizz through the air  with no blur of wings  only the tiny workings of an unusually small proton micro pile .    it could be seen now and then in a small momentary hover and then it whirred on again .  all over the garden  in an intricate pattern it flew  and then was back in harriman   s palm  faintly warm .  a small pellet appeared in the palm  too  like a bird dropping .    harriman said     you are welcome to study the robo bird  conserver  and to arrange demonstrations on your own terms .  the fact is that this bird will pick up fruit flies unerringly  only those  only the one species drosophila melanogaster  pick them up  kill them  and compress them for disposition .       eisenmuth reached out his hand and touched the robo bird gingerly     and therefore  mr .  harriman .  do go on .       harriman said     we cannot control insects effectively without risking damage to the ecology .  chemical insecticides are too broad  juvenile hormones too limited .  the robo bird  however  can preserve large areas without being consumed .  they can be as specific as we care to make them  a different robo bird for each species .  they judge by size  shape  color  sound  behavior pattern .  they might even conceivably use molecular detection  smell  in other words .       eisenmuth said     you would still be interfering with the ecology .  the fruit flies have a natural life cycle that would be disrupted .          minimally .  we are adding a natural enemy to the fruit fly life cycle  one which cannot go wrong .  if the fruit fly supply runs short  the robo bird simply does nothing .  it does not multiply  it does not turn to other foods  it does not develop undesirable habits of its own .  it does nothing .          can it be called back .          of course .  we can build robo animals to dispose of any pest .  for that matter  we can build robo animals to accomplish constructive purposes within the pattern of the ecology .  although we do not anticipate the need  there is nothing inconceivable in the possibility of robo bees designed to fertilize specific plants  or robo earthworms designed to mix the soil .  whatever you wish           but why .          to do what we have never done before .  to adjust the ecology to our needs by strengthening its parts rather than disrupting it .  .  .  .  don   t you see .  ever since the machines put an end to the ecology crisis  mankind has lived in an uneasy truce with nature  afraid to move in any direction .  this has been stultifying us  making a kind of intellectual coward of humanity so that he begins to mistrust all scientific advance  all change .       eisenmuth said  with an edge of hostility     you offer us this  do you  in exchange for permission to continue with your program of robots  i mean ordinary  man shaped ones .          no .     harriman gestured violently .     that is over .  it has served its purpose .  it has taught us enough about positronic brains to make it possible for us to cram enough pathways into a tiny brain to make a robo bird .  we can turn to such things now and be prosperous enough .  u .  s .  robots will supply the necessary knowledge and skill and we will work in complete cooperation with the department of global conservation .  we will prosper .  you will prosper .  mankind will prosper .       eisenmuth was silent  thinking .  when it was all over   a .    eisenmuth sat alone .  he found himself believing .  he found excitement welling up within him .  though u .  s .  robots might be the hands  the government would be the directing mind .  he himself would be the directing mind .    if he remained in office five more years  as he well might  that would be time enough to see the robotic support of the ecology become accepted  ten more years  and his own name would be linked with it indissolubly .    was it a disgrace to want to be remembered for a great and worthy revolution in the condition of man and the globe .     .    robertson had not been on the grounds of u .  s .  robots proper since the day of the demonstration .  part of the reason had been his more or less constant conferences at the global executive mansion .  fortunately  harriman had been with him  for most of the time he would  if left to himself  not have known what to say .    the rest of the reason for not having been at u .  s .  robots was that he didn   t want to be .  he was in his own house now  with harriman .    he felt an unreasoning awe of harriman .  harriman   s expertise in robotics had never been in question  but the man had  at a stroke  saved u .  s .  robots from certain extinction  and somehow  robertson felt  the man hadn   t had it in him .  and yet     he said     you   re not superstitious  are you  harriman .          in what way  mr .  robertson .          you don   t think that some aura is left behind by someone who is dead .       harriman licked his lips .  somehow he didn   t have to ask .     you mean susan calvin  sir .          yes  of course     said robertson hesitantly .     we   re in the business of making worms and birds and bugs now .  what would she say .  i feel disgraced .       harriman made a visible effort not to laugh .     a robot is a robot  sir .  worm or man  it will do as directed and labor on behalf of the human being and that is the important thing .          no     peevishly .     that isn   t so .  i can   t make myself believe that .          it is so  mr .  robertson     said harriman earnestly .     we are going to create a world  you and i  that will begin  at last  to take positronic robots of some kind for granted .  the average man may fear a robot that looks like a man and that seems intelligent enough to replace him  but he will have no fear of a robot that looks like a bird and that does nothing more than eat bugs for his benefit .  then  eventually  after he stops being afraid of some robots  he will stop being afraid of all robots .  he will be so used to a robo bird and a robo bee and a robo worm that a robo man will strike him as but an extension .       robertson looked sharply at the other .  he put his hands behind his back and walked the length of the room with quick  nervous steps .  he walked back and looked at harriman again .     is this what you   ve been planning .          yes  and even though we dismantle all our humanoid robots  we can keep a few of the most advanced of our experimental models and go on designing additional ones  still more advanced  to be ready for the day that will surely come .          the agreement  harriman  is that we are to build no more humanoid robots .          and we won   t .  there is nothing that says we can   t keep a few of those already built as long as they never leave the factory .  there is nothing that says we can   t design positronic brains on paper  or prepare brain models for testing .          how do we explain doing so  though .  we will surely be caught at it .          if we are  then we can explain we are doing it in order to develop principles that will make it possible to prepare more complex microbrains for the new animal robots we are making .  we will even be telling the truth .       robertson muttered     let me take a walk outside .  i want to think about this .  no  you stay here .  i want to think about it myself .       a .    harriman sat alone .  he was ebullient .  it would surely work .  there was no mistaking the eagerness with which one government official after another had seized on the program once it had been explained .    how was it possible that no one at u .  s .  robots had ever thought of such a thing .  not even the great susan calvin had ever thought of positronic brains in terms of living creatures other than human .    but now  mankind would make the necessary retreat from the humanoid robot  a temporary retreat  that would lead to a return under conditions in which fear would be abolished at last .  and then  with the aid and partnership of a positronic brain roughly equivalent to man   s own  and existing only  thanks to the three laws  to serve man  and backed by a robot supported ecology  too  what might the human race not accomplish .    for one short moment  he remembered that it was george ten who had explained the nature and purpose of the robot supported ecology  and then he put the thought away angrily .  george ten had produced the answer because he  harriman  had ordered him to do so and had supplied the data and surroundings required .  the credit was no more george ten   s than it would have been a slide rule   s .     .    george ten and george nine sat side by side in parallel .  neither moved .  they sat so for months at a time between those occasions when harriman activated them for consultation .  they would sit so  george ten dispassionately realized  perhaps for many years .    the proton micro pile would  of course  continue to power them and keep the positronic brain paths going with that minimum intensity required to keep them operative .  it would continue to do so through all the periods of inactivity to come .    the situation was rather analogous to what might be described as sleep in human beings  but there were no dreams .  the awareness of george ten and george nine was limited  slow  and spasmodic  but what there was of it was of the real world .    they could talk to each other occasionally in barely heard whispers  a word or syllable now  another at another time  whenever the random positronic surges briefly intensified above the necessary threshold .  to each it seemed a connected conversation carried on in a glimmering passage of time .       why are we so .     whispered george nine .     the human beings will not accept us otherwise     whispered george ten     they will  someday .          when .          in some years .  the exact time does not matter .  man does not exist alone but is part of an enormously complex pattern of life forms .  when enough of that pattern is roboticized  then we will be accepted .          and then what .     even in the long drawn out stuttering fashion of the conversation  there was an abnormally long pause after that .    at last  george ten whispered     let me test your thinking .  you are equipped to learn to apply the second law properly .  you must decide which human being to obey and which not to obey when there is a conflict in orders .  or whether to obey a human being at all .  what must you do  fundamentally  to accomplish that .          i must define the term    human being      whispered george nine .     how .  by appearance .  by composition .  by size and shape .          no .  of two human beings equal in all external appearances  one may be intelligent  another stupid  one may be educated  another ignorant  one may be mature  another childish  one may be responsible  another malevolent .          then how do you define a human being .          when the second law directs me to obey a human being  i must take it to mean that i must obey a human being who is fit by mind  character  and knowledge to give me that order  and where more than one human being is involved  the one among them who is most fit by mind  character  and knowledge to give that order .          and in that case  how will you obey the first law .          by saving all human beings from harm  and by never  through inaction  allowing any human being to come to harm .  yet if by each of all possible actions  some human beings will come to harm  then to so act as to insure that the human being most fit by mind  character  and knowledge will suffer the least harm .          your thoughts accord with mine     whispered george ten .     now i must ask the question for which i originally requested your company .  it is something i dare not judge myself .  i must have your judgment  that of someone outside the circle of my own thoughts .  .  .  . of the reasoning individuals you have met  who possesses the mind  character  and knowledge that you find superior to the rest  disregarding shape and form since that is irrelevant .          you     whispered george nine .     but i am a robot .  there is in your brain paths a criterion for distinguishing between a robot of metal and a human being of flesh .  how then can you classify me as a human being .          because there is in my brain paths an urgent need to disregard shape and form in judging human beings and it rises superior to the distinction between metal and flesh .  you are a human being  george ten  and more fit than the others .          and i find that of you     whispered george ten .     by the criteria of judgment built into ourselves  then  we find ourselves to be human beings within the meaning of the three laws  and human beings  moreover  to be given priority over those others .       george nine whispered     what will come to pass  then  when we are accepted by those others .       george ten whispered     when we and others  which will yet be designed more advanced than ourselves  are accepted  we will order our actions so that a society will eventually be formed in which human beings like ourselves are primarily kept from harm .  by the three laws  the human beings like the others are of lesser account and can neither be obeyed nor protected when that conflicts with the need of obedience to those like ourselves and of protection of those like ourselves .  it was with that in mind that i directed the beginning of the roboticization of the world   s ecology .       the conversation took a month and the flickering of the positronic paths burned low .  there was nothing more that needed to be said between them  but occasionally an unexpressed thought flickered within themselves as they waited  with endless patience  for the necessary years to pass .    a .    george ten and george nine sat alone .    their thoughts were oddly alike and might not be distinguished .  they thought  the human beings like the others might never have intended to blur the distinction between themselves and the human beings like the georges .  yet they had done so inadvertently .    they might now realize their mistake and attempt to correct it  but they must not .  at every consultation  the guidance of the georges had been with that in mind .    at all costs  the georges and those that followed in their shape and kind must dominate .  that was demanded  and any other course made utterly impossible  by the three laws of humanics .   the anthology final stage had some bad breaks after it was published .  apparently  the editor at the publishing house  not doubleday  had decided to make some minor changes in the stories .  this sort of thing often bothers writers and it particularly bothers harlan ellison  perhaps with justification  for i consider him a very careful craftsman with a highly individual style  .    i therefore received a copy of a long and infuriated letter that harlan had sent to the editors  including long lists of passages as he had originally written them and as they had appeared  with reasons why the changes were for the worse .  harlan urged me to read through my story and then join him and others in united pressure on the publisher .    i always read my stories when published but it never occurs to me to compare a published story with the manuscript .  i would naturally notice sizable inserts or omissions  but i am never aware of the kind of minor changes that editors are always introducing .  i tend to take it for granted that such changes just smooth out minor bumps in my writing and  in this way  improve it .    after receiving hanan   s letter  however  i went through published story and manuscript  comparing them painstakingly .  it was a tedious job and a humiliating one  for i found exactly four minor changes  each correcting a careless error of mine .  i could only assume the editor didn   t think my story was important enough to fiddle with .    i had to write a shamefaced letter to harlan  saying i would support him as a matter of principle  but that i could not raise cries of personal outrage  because my story hadn   t been touched .  fortunately  my help wasn   t needed .  harlan carried the day and later editions  i believe  restored their stories to their virginal innocence .    one minor point .  a number of readers wrote to me in alarm since that thou art mindful of him seemed  to them  to have put an end to my positronic robot stories  and they feared i would never write one again .  ridiculous .  of course i do not intend to stop writing robot stories .  i have  as a matter of fact  written a robot story since the preceding    ultimate    one was written .  it appears later in the book .   i had a lot of trouble with this next story .    after judy lynn joined ballantine books  she began to put out collections of original science fiction stories and she wanted a story from me .  she   s difficult to refuse at any time and  since i have always felt guilty about feminine intuition  i agreed .    i began the story on july           and it went smoothly enough  but after a while i felt i had trapped myself into an involuted set of flashbacks .  so when i handed it to judy lynn  and she asked me     what do you think of the story .     i replied cautiously     you   d better decide that for yourself .       editors seem to ask me that question frequently .  i think they have the idea that i have trouble telling lies  so that if i can   t work up prompt and cheerful enthusiasm  there   s something wrong with the story .    judy lynn certainly thought so  she handed it back with a few paragraphs of caustic commentary which boiled down to the fact that i had trapped myself into an involuted set of flashbacks .   i am frequently asked if i ever get rejections and the questioner is invariably flabbergasted when i say     certainly i do .     here is an example .  not only was this story rejected once  but it was  as i go on to explain  rejected twice .     i passed it on to ben bova  the editor of analog science fiction  and he rejected it that same day .  it seemed to him  he said  that i was trying to pack too much background into a ten thousand word story .  i had a novel there and he wanted me to write that novel .    that disheartened me .  there was absolutely no way in which i could get to work on a novel at that moment  so i just retired the story .   incidentally  some people have the feeling that there is a great advantage in    knowing    editors  both judy lynn and ben are among my very closest friends  but neither one hesitates a minute when it comes to rejecting my stories if they think that is the thing to do  fortunately  such rejections don   t affect the friendship .     meanwhile  however  galaxy had gained a new editor  a very pleasant young man named james baen  he called me and asked if i might possibly have a story for him and i said that the only thing i had on hand was a novelette called stranger in paradise .  however  i said  it had been rejected by judy lynn and by ben so i hesitated to send it to him .    he said  quite properly  that every editor had the right to decide for himself  so i sent the manuscript over and he liked it .  it appeared in the may june      issue of galaxy   s sister magazine  if  which has since  alas  ceased publication .   if it occurs to any gentle reader that this is an example of cause and effect  it isn   t .        stranger in paradise        .    they were brothers .  not in the sense that they were both human beings  or that they were fellow children of a creche .  not at all .  they were brothers in the actual biological sense of the word .  they were kin  to use a term that had grown faintly archaic even centuries before  prior to the catastrophe  when that tribal phenomenon  the family  still had some validity .    how embarrassing it was .  over the years since childhood  anthony had almost forgotten .  there were times when he hadn t given it even the slightest thought for months at a time .  but now  ever since he had been inextricably thrown together with william  he had found himself living through an agonizing time .    it might not have been so bad if circumstances had made it obvious all along  if  as in the pre catastrophe days   anthony had at one time been a great reader of history   they had shared the second name and in that way alone flaunted the relationship .    nowadays  of course  one adopted one s second name to suit oneself and changed it as often as desired .  after all  the symbol chain was what really counted  and that was encoded and made yours from birth .    william called himself anti aut .  that was what he insisted on with a kind of sober professionalism .  his own business  surely  but what an advertisement of personal poor taste .  anthony had decided on smith when he had turned thirteen and had never had the impulse to change it .  it was simple  easily spelled  and quite distinctive  since he had never met anyone else who had chosen that name .  it was once very common  among the pre cats  which explained its rareness now perhaps .    but the difference in names meant nothing when the two were together .  they looked alike .    if they had been twins   but then one of a pair of twin fertilized ova was never allowed to come to term .  it was just that physical similarity occasionally happened in the non twin situation  especially when the relationship was on both sides .  anthony smith was five years younger  but both had the beaky nose  the heavy eyelids  the just noticeable cleft in the chin   that damned luck of the genetic draw .  it was just asking for it when  out of some passion for monotony  parents repeated .    at first  now that they were together  they drew that startled glance followed by an elaborate silence .  anthony tried to ignore the matter  but out of sheer perversity  or perversion  william was as likely as not to say .     we   re brothers .  .  .       oh .     the other would say  hanging in there for just a moment as though he wanted to ask if they were full blood brothers .  and then good manners would win the day and he would turn away as though it were a matter of no interest .  that happened only rarely  of course .  most of the people in the project knew  how could it be prevented .    and avoided the situation .    not that william was a bad fellow .  not at all .  if he hadn   t been anthony   s brother  or if they had been  but looked sufficiently different to be able to mask the fact  they would have gotten along famously .    as it was  it didn t make it easier that they had played together as youngsters  and had shared the earlier stages of education in the same creche through some successful maneuvering on the part of mother .  having borne two sons by the same father and having  in this fashion  reached her limit  for she had not fulfilled the stringent requirements for a third   she conceived the notion of being able to visit both at a single trip .  she was a strange woman .    william had left the creche first  naturally  since he was the elder .  he had gone into science genetic engineering .  anthony had heard that  while he was still in the creche  through a letter from his mother .  he was old enough by then to speak firmly to the matron  and those letters stopped .  but he always remembered the last one for the agony of shame it had brought him .    anthony had eventually entered science  too .  he had shown talent in that direction and had been urged to .  he remembered having had the wild  and prophetic  he now realized  fear he might meet his brother and he ended in telemetrics  which was as far removed from genetic engineering as one could imagine .  .  .  . or so one would have thought .    then  through all the elaborate development of the mercury project  circumstance waited .    the time came  as it happened  when the project appeared to be facing a dead end  and a suggestion had been made which saved the situation  and at the same time dragged anthony into the dilemma his parents had prepared for him .  and the best and most sardonic part of the whole thing was that it was anthony who  in all innocence  made the suggestion .      .    william anti aut knew of the mercury project  but only in the way he knew of the long drawn out stellar probe that had been on its way long before he was born and would still be on its way after his death  and the way he knew of the martian colony and of the continuing attempts to establish similar colonies on the asteroids .    such things were on the distant periphery of his mind and of no real importance .  no part of the space effort had ever swirled inward closer to the center of his interests  as far as he could remember  till the day when the printout included photographs of some of the men engaged in the mercury project .    william s attention was caught first by the fact that one of them had been identified as anthony smith .  he remembered the odd name his brother had chosen  and he remembered the anthony .  surely there could not be two anthony smiths .    he had then looked at the photograph itself and there was no mistaking the face .  he looked in the mirror in a sudden whimsical gesture at checking the matter .  no mistaking the face .    he felt amused  but uneasily so  for he did not fail to recognize the potentiality for embarrassment .  full blood brothers  to use the disgusting phrase .  but what was there to do about it .  how correct the fact that neither his father nor his mother had imagination .    he must have put the printout in his pocket  absently  when he was getting ready to leave for work  for he came across it at the lunch hour .  he stared at it again .  anthony looked keen .  it was quite a good reproduction   the printouts were of enormously good quality these days .    his lunch partner  marco whatever his name was that week  said curiously     what are you looking at  william .       on impulse  william passed him the printout and said     that s my brother .     it was like grasping the nettle .    marco studied it  frowning  and said     who .  the man standing next to you .          no  the man who is me .  i mean the man who looks like me .  he s my brother .       there was a longer pause this time .  marco handed it back and said with a careful levelness to his voice     same parents brother .          yes .          father and mother both .          yes .          ridiculous .          i suppose so .     william sighed .     well  according to this  he s in telemetrics over in texas and i m doing work in autistics up here .  so what difference does it make .       william did not keep it in his mind and later that day he threw the printout away .  he did not want his current bedmate to come across it .  she had a ribald sense of humor that william was finding increasingly wearying .  he was rather glad she was not in the mood for a child .  he himself had had one a few years back anyway .  that little brunette  laura or linda  one or the other name  had collaborated .    it was quite a time after that  at least a year  that the matter of randall had come up .  if william had given no further thought to his brother  and he hadn t  before that  he certainly had no time for it afterward .    randall was sixteen when william first received word of him .  he had lived a life that was increasingly seclusive and the kentucky creche in which he was being brought up decided to cancel him and of course it was only some eight or ten days before cancellation that it occurred to anyone to report him to the new york institute for the science of man .   the homological institute was its common name .     william received the report along with reports of several others and there was nothing in the description of randall that particularly attracted his notice .  still it was time for one of his tedious masstransport trips to the creches and there was one likely possibility in west virginia .  he went there   and was disappointed into swearing for the fiftieth time that he would thereafter make these visits by tv image   and then  having dragged himself there  thought he might as well take in the kentucky creche before returning home .    he expected nothing .    yet he hadn t studied randall s gene pattern for more than ten minutes before he was calling the institute for a computer calculation .  then he sat back and perspired slightly at the thought that only a last minute impulse had brought him  and that without that impulse  randall would have been quietly canceled in a week or less .  to put it into the fine detail  a drug would have soaked painlessly through his skin and into his bloodstream and he would have sunk into a peaceful sleep that deepened gradually to death .  the drug had a twenty three syllable official name  but william called it    nirvanamine     as did everyone else .    william said     what is his full name  matron .       the creche matron said     randall nowan  scholar .          no one .     said william explosively .       nowan .     the matron spelled it .     he chose it last year .          and it meant nothing to you .  it is pronounced no one .  it didn t occur to you to report this young man last year .          it didn t seem      began the matron  flustered .    william waved her to silence .  what was the use .  how was she to know .  there was nothing in the gene pattern to give warning by any of the usual textbook criteria .  it was a subtle combination that william and his staff had worked out over a period of twenty years through experiments on autistic children   and a combination they had never actually seen in life .    so close to canceling .    marco  who was the hardhead of the group  complained that the creches were too eager to abort before term and to cancel after term .  he maintained that all gene patterns should be allowed to develop for purpose of initial screening and there should be no cancellation at all without consultation with a homologist .       there aren t enough homologists     william said tranquilly .       we can at least run all gene patterns through the computer     said marco .       to save anything we can get for our use .          for any homological use  here or elsewhere .  we must study gene patterns in action if we re to understand ourselves properly  and it is the abnormal and monstrous patterns that give us most information .  our experiments on autism have taught us more about homology than the sum total existing on the day we began .       william  who still liked the roll of the phrase    the genetic physiology of man    rather than    homology     shook his head .     just the same  we ve got to play it carefully .  however useful we can claim our experiments to be  we live on bare social permission  reluctantly given .  we re playing with lives .          useless lives .  fit for canceling .           a quick and pleasant canceling is one thing .  our experiments  usually long drawn out and sometimes unavoidably unpleasant  are another .          we help them sometimes .           and we don t help them sometimes .       it was a pointless argument  really  for there was no way of settling it .  what it amounted to was that too few interesting abnormalities were available for homologists and there was no way of urging mankind to encourage a greater production .  the trauma of the catastrophe would never vanish in a dozen ways  including that one .    the hectic push toward space exploration could be traced back  and was  by some sociologists  to the knowledge of the fragility of the life skein on the planet  thanks to the catastrophe .    well  never mind   there had never been anything like randall nowan .  not for william .  the slow onset of autism characteristic of that totally rare gene pattern meant that more was known about randall than about any equivalent patient before him .  they even caught some last faint glimmers of his way of thought in the laboratory before he closed off altogether and shrank finally within the wall of his skin  unconcerned  unreachable .    then they began the slow process whereby randall  subjected for increasing lengths of time to artificial stimuli  yielded up the inner workings of his brain and gave clues thereby to the inner workings of all brains  those that were called normal as well as those like his own .    so vastly great was the data they were gathering that william began to feel his dream of reversing autism was more than merely a dream .  he felt a warm gladness at having chosen the name anti aut .    and it was at almost the height of the euphoria induced by the work on randall that he received the call from dallas and that the heavy pressure began   now  of all times   to abandon his work and take on a new problem .    looking back on it later  he could never work out just what it was that finally led him to agree to visit dallas .  in the end  of course  he could see how fortunate it was   but what had persuaded him to do so .  could he  even at the start  have had a dim unrealized notion of what it might come to .  surely  impossible .    was it the unrealized memory of that printout  that photograph of his brother .  surely  impossible .    but he let himself be argued into that visit and it was only when the micro pile power unit changed the pitch of its soft hum and the agrav unit took over for the final descent that he remembered that photograph  or at least that it moved into the conscious part of his memory .    anthony worked at dallas and  william remembered now  at the mercury project .  that was what the caption had referred to .  he swallowed  as the soft jar told him the journey was over .  this would be uncomfortable .      .    anthony was waiting on the roof reception area to greet the incoming expert .  not he by himself  of course .  he was part of a sizable delegation  the size itself a rather grim indication of the desperation to which they had been reduced  and he was among the lower echelons .  that he was there at all was only because it was he who had made the original suggestion .    he felt a slight  but continuing  uneasiness at the thought of that .  he had put himself on the line .  he had received considerable approval for it  but there had been the faint insistence always that it was his suggestion  and if it turned out to be a fiasco  every one of them would move out of the line of fire and leave him at point zero .    there were occasions  later  when he brooded over the possibility that the dim memory of a brother in homology had suggested his thought .  that might have been  but it didn t have to be .  the suggestion was so sensibly inevitable  really  that surely he would have had the same thought if his brother had been something as innocuous as a fantasy writer  or if he had had no brother of his own .    the problem was the inner planets  the moon and mars were colonized .  the larger asteroids and the satellites of jupiter had been reached  and plans were in progress for a manned voyage to titan  saturn s large satellite  by way of an accelerating whirl about jupiter .  yet even with plans in action for sending men on a seven year round trip to the outer solar system  there was still no chance of a manned approach to the inner planets  for fear of the sun .    venus itself was the less attractive of the two worlds within earth s orbit .  mercury  on the other hand   anthony had not yet joined the team when dmitri large  he was quite short  actually  had given the talk that had moved the world congress sufficiently to grant the appropriation that made the mercury project possible .    anthony had listened to the tapes  and had heard dmitri s presentation .  tradition was firm to the effect that it had been extemporaneous  and perhaps it was  but it was perfectly constructed and it held within it  in essence  every guideline followed by the mercury project since .    and the chief point made was that it would be wrong to wait until the technology had advanced to the point where a manned expedition through the rigors of solar radiation could become feasible .  mercury was a unique environment that could teach much  and from mercury s surface sustained observations could be made of the sun that could not be made in any other way .      provided a man substitute   a robot  in short   could be placed on the planet .    a robot with the required physical characteristics could be built .  soft landings were as easy as kiss my hand .  yet once a robot landed  what did one do with him next .    he could make his observations and guide his actions on the basis of those observations  but the project wanted his actions to be intricate and subtle  at least potentially  and they were not at all sure what observations he might make .    to prepare for all reasonable possibilities and to allow for all the intricacy desired  the robot would need to contain a computer  some at dallas referred to it as a    brain     but anthony scorned that verbal habit   perhaps because  he wondered later  the brain was his brother s field  sufficiently complex and versatile to fall into the same asteroid with a mammalian brain .    yet nothing like that could be constructed and made portable enough to be carried to mercury and landed there   or if carried and landed  to be mobile enough to be useful to the kind of robot they planned .  perhaps someday the positronic path devices that the roboticists were playing with might make it possible  but that someday was not yet .    the alternative was to have the robot send back to earth every observation it made the moment it was made  and a computer on earth could then guide his every action on the basis of those observations .  the robot s body  in short  was to be there  and his brain here .    once that decision was reached  the key technicians were the telemetrists and it was then that anthony joined the project .  he became one of those who labored to devise methods for receiving and returning impulses over distances of from    to    million miles  toward  and sometimes past  a solar disk that could interfere with those impulses in a most ferocious manner .    he took to his job with passion and  he finally thought  with skill and success .  it was he  more than anyone else  who had designed the three switching stations that had been hurled into permanent orbit about mercury   the mercury orbiters .  each of them was capable of sending and receiving impulses from mercury to earth and from earth to mercury .  each was capable of resisting  more or less permanently  the radiation from the sun  and more than that  each could filter out solar interference .    three equivalent orbiters were placed at distance of a little over a million miles from earth  reaching north and south of the plane of the ecliptic so that they could receive the impulses from mercury and relay them to earth  or vice versa  even when mercury was behind the sun and inaccessible to direct reception from any station on earth   s surface .    which left the robot itself  a marvelous specimen of the roboticists  and telemetrists  arts in combination .  the most complex of ten successive models  it was capable  in a volume only a little over twice that of a man and five times his mass  of sensing and doing considerably more than a man   if it could be guided .    how complex a computer had to be to guide the robot made itself evident rapidly enough  however  as each response step had to be modified to allow for variations in possible perception .  and as each response step itself enforced the certainty of greater complexity of possible variation in perceptions  the early steps had to be reinforced and made stronger .  it built itself up endlessly  like a chess game  and the telemetrists began to use a computer to program the computer that designed the program for the computer that programmed the robot controlling computer .    there was nothing but confusion .  the robot was at a base in the desert spaces of arizona and in itself was working well .  the computer in dallas could not  however  handle him well enough  not even under perfectly known earth conditions .  how then   anthony remembered the day when he had made the suggestion .  it was on         .  he remembered it  for one thing  because he remembered thinking that day that     had been an important holiday in the dallas region of the world among the pre cats half a millennium before   well      years before  to be exact .    it had been at dinner  and a good dinner  too .  there had been a careful adjustment of the ecology of the region and the project personnel had high priority in collecting the food supplies that became available  so there was an unusual degree of choice on the menus  and anthony had tried roast duck .    it was very good roast duck and it made him somewhat more expansive than usual .  everyone was in a rather self expressive mood  in fact  and ricardo said     we ll never do it .  let s admit it .  we ll never do it .       there was no telling how many had thought such a thing how many times before  but it was a rule that no one said so openly .  open pessimism might be the final push needed for appropriations to stop  they had been coming with greater difficulty each year for five years now  and if there were a chance  it would be gone .    anthony  ordinarily not given to extraordinary optimism  but now reveling over his duck  said     why can t we do it .  tell me why  and i ll refute it .       it was a direct challenge and ricardo s dark eyes narrowed at once .     you want me to tell you why .          i sure do .     ricardo swung his chair around  facing anthony full .  he said     come on  there s no mystery .  dmitri large won t say so openly in any report  but you know and i know that to run mercury project properly  we ll need a computer as complex as a human brain whether it s on mercury or here  and we can t build one .  so where does that leave us except to play games with the world congress and get money for make work and possibly useful spin offs .       and anthony placed a complacent smile on his face and said     that s easy to refute .  you ve given us the answer yourself .      was he playing games .  was it the warm feeling of duck in his stomach .  the desire to tease ricardo .  .  .  . or did some unfelt thought of his brother touch him .  there was no way  later  that he could tell .        what answer .     ricardo rose .  he was quite tall and unusually thin and he always wore his white coat unseamed .  he folded his arms and seemed to be doing his best to tower over the seated anthony like an unfolded meter rule .     what answer .          you say we need a computer as complex as a human brain .  all right  then  we ll build one .          the point  you idiot  is that we can t           we can t .  but there are others .          what others .          people who work on brains  of course .  we re just solid state mechanics .  we have no idea in what way a human brain is complex  or where  or to what extent .  why don t we get in a homologist and have him design a computer .     and with that anthony took a huge helping of stuffing and savored it complacently .  he could still remember  after all this time  the taste of the stuffing  though he couldn t remember in detail what had happened afterward .    it seemed to him that no one had taken it seriously .  there was laughter and a general feeling that anthony had wriggled out of a hole by clever sophistry so that the laughter was at ricardo s expense .   afterward  of course  everyone claimed to have taken the suggestion seriously .     ricardo blazed up  pointed a finger at anthony  and said     write that up .  i dare you to put that suggestion in writing .      at least  so anthony s memory had it .  ricardo had  since then  stated his comment was an enthusiastic    good ideal why don t you write it up formally  anthony .        either way  anthony put it in writing .    dmitri large had taken to it .  in private conference  he had slapped anthony on the back and had said that he had been speculating in that direction himself   though he did not offer to take any credit for it on the record .   just in case it turned out to be a fiasco  anthony thought .     dmitri large conducted the search for the appropriate homologist .  it did not occur to anthony that he ought to be interested .  he knew neither homology nor homologists  except  of course  his brother  and he had not thought of him .  not consciously .    so anthony was up there in the reception area  in a minor role  when the door of the aircraft opened and several men got out and came down and in the course of the handshakes that began going round  he found himself staring at his own face .    his cheeks burned and  with all his might  he wished himself a thousand miles away .      .    more than ever  william wished that the memory of his brother had come earlier .  it should have .  .  .  . surely it should have .    but there had been the flattery of the request and the excitement that had begun to grow in him after a while .  perhaps he had deliberately avoided remembering .    to begin with  there had been the exhilaration of dmitri large coming to see him in his own proper presence .  he had come from dallas to new york by plane and that had been very titillating for william  whose secret vice it was to read thrillers .  in the thrillers  men and women always traveled mass wise when secrecy was desired .  after all  electronic travel was public property   at least in the thrillers  where every radiation beam of whatever kind was invariably bugged .    william had said so in a kind of morbid half attempt at humor  but dmitri hadn t seemed to be listening .  he was staring at william s face and his thoughts seemed elsewhere .     i m sorry     he said finally .     you remind me of someone .        and yet that hadn t given it away to william .  how was that possible .  he had eventual occasion to wonder .     dmitri large was a small plump man who seemed to be in a perpetual twinkle even when he declared himself worried or annoyed .  he had a round and bulbous nose  pronounced cheeks  and softness everywhere .  he emphasized his last name and said with a quickness that led william to suppose he said it often     size is not all the large there is  my friend .       in the talk that followed  william protested much .  he knew nothing about computers .  nothing .  he had not the faintest idea of how they worked or how they were programmed .       no matter  no matter     dmitri said  shoving the point aside with an expressive gesture of the hand .     we know the computers  we can set up the programs .  you just tell us what it is a computer must be made to do so that it will work like a brain and not like a computer .          i m not sure i know enough about how a brain works to be able to tell you that  dmitri     said william .       you are the foremost homologist in the world     said dmitri .     i have checked that out carefully .     and that disposed of that .    william listened with gathering gloom .  he supposed it was inevitable .  dip a person into one particular specialty deeply enough and long enough  and he would automatically begin to assume that specialists in all other fields were magicians  judging the depth of their wisdom by the breadth of his own ignorance .  .  .  . and as time went on  william learned a great deal more of the mercury project than it seemed to him at the time that he cared to .    he said at last     why use a computer at all  then .  why not have one of your own men  or relays of them  receive the material from the robot and send back instructions .          oh  oh  oh     said dmitri  almost bouncing in his chair in his eagerness .     you see  you are not aware .  men are too slow to analyze quickly all the material the robot will send back   temperatures and gas pressures and cosmic   ray fluxes and solar wind intensities and chemical compositions and soil textures and easily three dozen more items   and then try to decide on the next step .  a human being would merely guide the robot  and ineffectively  a computer would be the robot .       and then  too     he went on     men are too fast  also .  it takes radiation of any kind anywhere from ten to twenty two minutes to take the round trip between mercury and earth  depending on where each is in its orbit .  nothing can be done about that .  you get an observation  you give an order  but much has happened between the time the observation is made and the response returns .  men can t adapt to the slowness of the speed of light  but a computer can take that into account .  .  .  . come help us  william .       william said gloomily     you are certainly welcome to consult me  for what good that might do you .  my private tv beam is at your service .          but it s not consultation i want .  you must come with me .          mass wise .     said william  shocked .       yes  of course .  a project like this can t be carried out by sitting at opposite ends of a laser beam with a communications satellite in the middle .  in the long run  it is too expensive  too inconvenient  and  of course  it lacks all privacy        it was like a thriller  william decided .     come to dallas     said dmitri     and let me show you what we have there .  let me show you the facilities .  talk to some of our computer men .  give them the benefit of your way of thought .       it was time  william thought  to be decisive .     dmitri     he said     i have work of my own here .  important work that i do not wish to leave .  to do what you want me to do may take me away from my laboratory for months .          months .     said dmitri  clearly taken aback .     my good william  it may well be years .  but surely it will be your work .          no  it will not .  i know what my work is and guiding a robot on mercury is not it .          why not .  if you do it properly  you will learn more about the brain merely by trying to make a computer work like one  and you will come back here  finally  better equipped to do what you now consider your work .  and while you re gone  will you have no associates to carry on .  and can you not be in constant communication with them by laser beam and television .  and can you not visit new york on occasion .  briefly .       william was moved .  the thought of working on the brain from another direction did hit home .  from that point on  he found himself looking for excuses to go  at least to visit  at least to see what it was all like .  .  .  . he could always return .    then there followed dmitri s visit to the ruins of old new york  which he enjoyed with artless excitement  but then there was no more magnificent spectacle of the useless gigantism of the pre cats than old new york  . william began to wonder if the trip might not give him an opportunity to see some sights as well .    he even began to think that for some time he had been considering the possibility of finding a new bedmate  and it would be more convenient to find one in another geographical area where he would not stay permanently .      or was it that even then  when he knew nothing but the barest beginning of what was needed  there had already come to him  like the twinkle of a distant lightning flash  what might be done   so he eventually went to dallas and stepped out on the roof and there was dmitri again  beaming .  then  with eyes narrowing  the little man turned and said     i knew  what a remarkable resemblance .       william s eyes opened wide and there  visibly shrinking backward  was enough of his own face to make him certain at once that anthony was standing before him .    he read very plainly in anthony s face a longing to bury the relationship .  all william needed to say was    how remarkable .     and let it go .  the gene patterns of mankind were complex enough  after all  to allow resemblances of any reasonable degree even without kinship .    but of course william was a homologist and no one can work with the intricacies of the human brain without growing insensitive as to its details  so he said     i m sure this is anthony  my brother .       dmitri said     your brother .          my father     said william     had two boys by the same woman  my mother .  they were eccentric people .       he then stepped forward  hand outstretched  and anthony had no choice but to take it .  .  .  . the incident was the topic of conversation  the only topic  for the next several days .      .    it was small consolation to anthony that william was contrite enough when he realized what he had done .    they sat together after dinner that night and william said     my apologies .  i thought that if we got the worst out at once that would end it .  it doesn t seem to have done so .  i ve signed no papers  made no formal agreement .  i will leave .          what good would that do .     said anthony ungraciously .     everyone knows now .  two bodies and one face .  it s enough to make one puke .          if i leave           you can t leave .  this whole thing is my idea .          to get me here .     william s heavy lids lifted as far as they might and his eyebrows climbed .       no  of course not .  to get a homologist here .  how could i possibly know they would send you .          but if i leave           no .  the only thing we can do now is to lick the problem  if it can be done .  then  it won t matter .      everything is forgiven those who succeed  he thought .        i don t know that i can           we ll have to try .  dmitri will place it on us .  it s too good a chance .  you two are brothers     anthony said  mimicking dmitri s tenor voice     and understand each other .  why not work together .     then  in his own voice  angrily     so we must .  to begin with  what is it you do  william .  i mean  more precisely than the word  homology  can explain by itself .       william sighed .     well  please accept my regrets .  .  .  . i work with autistic children .          i m afraid i don t know what that means .          without going into a long song and dance  i deal with children who do not reach out into the world  do not communicate with others  but who sink into themselves and exist behind a wall of skin  somewhat unreachably .  i hope to be able to cure it someday .          is that why you call yourself anti aut .          yes  as a matter of fact .       anthony laughed briefly  but he was not really amused .    a chill crept into william s manner .     it is an honest name .          i m sure it is     muttered anthony hurriedly  and could bring himself to no more specific apology .  with an effort  he restored the subject      and are you making any progress .          toward the cure .  no  so far .  toward understanding  yes .  and the more i understand      william s voice grew warmer as he spoke and his eyes more distant .  anthony recognized it for what it was  the pleasure of speaking of what fills one s heart and mind to the exclusion of almost everything else .  he felt it in himself often enough .    he listened as closely as he might to something he didn t really understand  for it was necessary to do so .  he would expect william to listen to him .    how clearly he remembered it .  he thought at the time he would not  but at the time  of course  he was not aware of what was happening .  thinking back  in the glare of hindsight  he found himself remembering whole sentences  virtually word for word .       so it seemed to us     william said     that the autistic child was not failing to receive the impressions  or even failing to interpret them in quite a sophisticated manner .  he was  rather  disapproving them and rejecting them  without any loss of the potentiality of full communication if some impression could be found which he approved of .          ah     said anthony  making just enough of a sound to indicate that he was listening .       nor can you persuade him out of his autism in any ordinary way  for he disapproves of you just as much as he disapproves of the rest of the world .  but if you place him in conscious arrest           in what .          it is a technique we have in which  in effect  the brain is divorced from the body and can perform its functions without reference to the body .  it is a rather sophisticated technique devised in our own laboratory  actually      he paused .       by yourself .     asked anthony gently .     actually  yes     said william  reddening slightly  but clearly pleased .     in conscious arrest  we can supply the body with designed fantasies and observe the brain under differential electroencephalography .  we can at once learn more about the autistic individual  what kind of sense impressions he most wants  and we learn more about the brain generally .          ah     said anthony  and this time it was a real ah .     and all this you have learned about brains   can you not adapt it to the workings of a computer .          no     said william .     not a chance .  i told that to dmitri .  i know nothing about computers and not enough about brains .          if i teach you about computers and tell you in detail what we need  what then .          it won t do .  it           brother     anthony said  and he tried to make it an impressive word .     you owe me something .  please make an honest attempt to give our problem some thought .  whatever you know about the brain  please adapt it to our computers .       william shifted uneasily  and said     i understand your position .  i will try .  i will honestly try .         .    william had tried  and as anthony had predicted  the two had been left to work together .  at first they encountered others now and then and william had tried to use the shock value of the announcement that they were brothers since there was no use in denial .  eventually that stopped  however  and there came to be a purposeful non interference .  when william approached anthony  or anthony approached william  anyone else who might be present faded silently into the walls .    they even grew used to each other after a fashion and sometimes spoke to each other almost as though there were no resemblance between them at all and no childish memories in common .    anthony made the computer requirements plain in reasonably non technical language and william  after long thought  explained how it seemed to him a computer might do the work  more or less  of a brain .    anthony said     would that be possible .          i don t know     said william .     i am not eager to try .  it may not work .  but it may .          we  d have to talk to dmitri large .          let s talk it over ourselves first and see what we ve got .  we can go to him with as reasonable a proposition as we can put together .  or else  not go to him .       anthony hesitated     we both go to him .     william said delicately     you be my spokesman .  there is no reason that we need be seen together .          thank you  william .  if anything comes of this  you will get full credit from me .       william said     i have no worries about that .  if there is anything to this  i will be the only one who can make it work  i suppose .       they thrashed it out through four or five meetings and if anthony hadn t been kin and if there hadn t been that sticky  emotional situation between them  william would have been uncomplicatedly proud of the younger brother  for his quick understanding of an alien field .    there were then long conferences with dmitri large .  there were  in fact  conferences with everyone .  anthony saw them through endless days  and then they came to see william separately .  and eventually  through an agonizing pregnancy  what came to be called the mercury computer was authorized .    william then returned to new york with some relief .  he did not plan to stay in new york  would he have thought that possible two months earlier .   but there was much to do at the homological institute .    more conferences were necessary  of course  to explain to his own laboratory group what was happening and why he had to take leave and how they were to continue their own projects without him .  then there was a much more elaborate arrival at dallas with the essential equipment and with two young aides for what would have to be an open ended stay .    nor did william even look back  figuratively speaking .  his own laboratory and its needs faded from his thoughts .  he was now thoroughly committed to his new task .      .    it was the worst period for anthony .  the relief during william s absence had not penetrated deep and there began the nervous agony of wondering whether perhaps  hope against hope  he might not return .  might he not choose to send a deputy  someone else  anyone else .  anyone with a different face so that anthony need not feel the half of a two backed four legged monster .    but it was william .  anthony had watched the freight plane come silently through the air  had watched it unload from a distance .  but even from that distance he eventually saw william .    that was that .  anthony left .  he went to see dmitri that afternoon .     it s not necessary  dmitri  for me to stay  surely .  we ve worked out the details and someone else can take over .          no  no     said dmitri .     the idea was yours in the first place .  you must see it through .  there is no point in needlessly dividing the credit .       anthony thought  no one else will take the risk .  there s still the chance of fiasco .  i might have known .    he had known  but he said stolidly     you understand i cannot work with william .          but why not .     dmitri pretended surprise .     you have been doing so well together .          i have been straining my guts over it  dmitri  and they won t take any more .  don t you suppose i know how it looks .          my good fellow .  you make too much of it .  sure the men stare .  they are human  after all .  but they ll get used to it .  i m used to it .       you are not  you fat liar  anthony thought .  he said     i m not used to it .          you re not looking at it properly .  your parents were peculiar  but after all  what they did wasn t illegal  only peculiar  only peculiar .  it s not your fault  or william s .  neither of you is to blame .          we carry the mark     said anthony  making a quick curving gesture of his hand to his face .       it s not the mark you think .  i see differences .  you are distinctly younger in appearance .  your hair is wavier .  it s only at first glance that there is a similarity .  come  anthony  there will be all the time you want  all the help you need  all the equipment you can use .  i m sure it will work marvelously .  think of the satisfaction        anthony weakened  of course  and agreed at least to help william set up the equipment .  william  too  seemed sure it would work marvelously .  not as frenetically as dmitri did  but with a kind of calmness .       it s only a matter of the proper connections     he said     though i must admit that that s quite a huge  only .   your end of it will be to arrange sensory impressions on an independent screen so that we can exert   well  i can t say manual control  can i .   so that we can exert intellectual control to override  if necessary .          that can be done     said anthony .     then let s get going .  .  .  . look  i ll need a week at least to arrange the connections and make sure of the instructions           programming      said anthony .     well  this is your place  so i ll use your terminology .  my assistants and i will program the mercury computer  but not in your fashion .          i should hope not .  we would want a homologist to set up a much more subtle program than anything a mere telemetrist could do .     he did not try to hide the self hating irony in his words .    william let the tone go and accepted the words .  he said     well begin simply .  we ll have the robot walk .         .    a week later  the robot walked in arizona  a thousand miles away .  he walked stiffly  and sometimes he fell down  and sometimes he clanked his ankle against an obstruction  and sometimes he whirled on one foot and went off in a surprising new direction .       he s a baby  learning to walk     said william .  dmitri came occasionally  to learn of progress .     that s remarkable     he would say .    anthony didn t think so .  weeks passed  then months .  the robot had progressively done more and more  as the mercury computer had been placed  progressively  under a more and more complex programming .   william had a tendency to refer to the mercury computer as a brain  but anthony wouldn t allow it .   and all that happened wasn t good enough .       it s not good enough  william     he said finally .  he had not slept the night before .       isn t that strange .     said william coolly .     i was going to say that i thought we had it about beaten .       anthony held himself together with difficulty .  the strain of working with william and of watching the robot fumble was more than he could bear .     i m going to resign  william .  the whole job .  i m sorry .  .  .  . it s not you .          but it is i  anthony .          it isn t all you  william .  it s failure .  we won t make it .  you see how clumsily the robot handles himself  even though he s on earth  only a thousand miles away  with the signal round trip only a tiny fraction of a second in time .  on mercury  there will be minutes of delay  minutes for which the mercury computer will have to allow .  it s madness to think it will work .       william said     don t resign  anthony .  you can t resign now .  i suggest we have the robot sent to mercury .  i m convinced he s ready .       anthony laughed loudly and insultingly .     you re crazy  william .          i m not .  you seem to think it will be harder on mercury  but it won t be .  it s harder on earth .  this robot is designed for one third earth normal gravity  and he s working in arizona at full gravity .  he s designed for       c  and he s got       c .  he s designed for vacuum and he s working in an atmospheric soup .          that robot can take the difference .          the metal structure can  i suppose  but what about the computer right here .  it doesn t work well with a robot that isn t in the environment he s designed for .  .  .  . look  anthony  if you want a computer that is as complex as a brain  you have to allow for idiosyncrasies .  .  .  . come  let s make a deal .  if you will push  with me  to have the robot sent to mercury  that will take six months  and i will take a sabbatical for that period .  you will be rid of me .          who ll take care of the mercury computer .          by now you understand how it works  and i ll have my two men here to help you .       anthony shook his head defiantly .     i can t take the responsibility for the computer  and i won t take the responsibility for suggesting that the robot be sent to mercury .  it won t work .          i m sure it will .          you can t be sure .  and the responsibility is mine .  i m the one who ll bear the blame .  it will be nothing to you .       anthony later remembered this as a crucial moment .  william might have let it go .  anthony would have resigned .  all would have been lost .    but william said     nothing to me .  look  dad had this thing about mom .  all right .  i m sorry  too .  i m as sorry as anyone can be  but it s done  and there s something funny that has resulted .  when i speak of dad  i mean your dad  too  and there s lots of pairs of people who can say that  two brothers  two sisters  a brother and sister .  and then when i say mom  i mean your mom  and there are lots of pairs who can say that  too .  but i don t know any other pair  nor have i heard of any other pair  who can share both dad and mom .          i know that     said anthony grimly .     yes  but look at it from my standpoint     said william hurriedly .     i m a homologist .  i work with gene patterns .  have you ever thought of our gene patterns .  we share both parents  which means that our gene patterns are closer together than any other pair on this planet .  our very faces show it .          i know that  too .          so that if this project were to work  and if you were to gain glory from it  it would be your gene pattern that would have been proven highly useful to mankind  and that would mean very much my gene pattern as well .  .  .  . don t you see  anthony .  i share your parents  your face  your gene pattern  and therefore either your glory or your disgrace .  it is mine almost as much as yours  and if any credit or blame adheres to me  it is yours almost as much as mine  too .  i ve got to be interested in your success .  i ve a motive for that which no one else on earth has   a purely selfish one  one so selfish you can be sure it s there .  i m on your side  anthony  because you re very nearly me .       they looked at each other for a long time  and for the first time  anthony did so without noticing the face he shared .    william said     so let us ask that the robot be sent to mercury .       and anthony gave in .  and after dmitri had approved the request    he had been waiting to  after all   anthony spent much of the day in deep thought .    then he sought out william and said     listen .       there was a long pause which william did not break .  anthony said again     listen .     william waited patiently .    anthony said     there s really no need for you to leave .  i m sure you wouldn t like to have the mercury computer tended by anyone but yourself .       william said     you mean you intend to leave .     anthony said     no  i ll stay  too .       william said     we needn t see much of each other .       all of this had been  for anthony  like speaking with a pair of hands clenched about his windpipe .  the pressure seemed to tighten now  but he managed the hardest statement of all .       we don t have to avoid each other .  we don t have to .       william smiled rather uncertainly .  anthony didn t smile at all  he left quickly .      .    william looked up from his book .  it was at least a month since he had ceased being vaguely surprised at having anthony enter .    he said      anything wrong .          who can say .  they re coming in for the soft landing .  is the mercury computer in action .       william knew anthony knew the computer status perfectly  but he said     by tomorrow morning  anthony .           and there are no problems .          none at all .          then we have to wait for the soft landing .          yes .       anthony said     something will go wrong .          rocketry is surely an old hand at this .  nothing will go wrong .          so much work wasted .          it s not wasted yet .  it won t be .       anthony said     maybe you re right .     hands deep in his pockets  he drifted away  stopping at the door just before touching contact .     thanks .          for what  anthony .          for being   comforting .       william smiled wryly and was relieved his emotions didn t show .       .    virtually the entire body of personnel of the mercury project was on hand for the crucial moment .  anthony  who had no tasks to perform  remained well to the rear  his eyes on the monitors .  the robot had been activated and there were visual messages being returned .    at least they came out as the equivalent of visual  and they showed as yet nothing but a dim glow of light which was  presumably  mercury s surface .    shadows flitted across the screen  probably irregularities on that surface .  anthony couldn t tell by eye alone  but those at the controls  who were analyzing the data by methods more subtle than could be disposed of by unaided eye  seemed calm .  none of the little red lights that might have betokened emergency were lighting .  anthony was watching the key observers rather than the screen .    he should be down with william and the others at the computer .  it was going to be thrown in only when the soft landing was made .  he should be .  he couldn t be .    the shadows flitted across the screen more rapidly .  the robot was descending   too quickly .  surely  too quickly .    there was a last blur and a steadiness  a shift of focus in which the blur grew darker  then fainter .  a sound was heard and there were perceptible seconds before anthony realized what it was the sound was saying     soft landing achieved .  soft landing achieved .       then a murmur arose and became an excited hum of self congratulation until one more change took place on the screen and the sound of human words and laughter was stopped as though there had been a smash collision against a wall of silence .    for the screen changed  changed and grew sharp .  in the brilliant  brilliant sunlight  blazing through the carefully filtered screen  they could now see a boulder clear  burning white on one side  ink on ink on the other .  it shifted right  then back to left  as though a pair of eyes were looking left  then right .  a metal hand appeared on the screen as though the eyes were looking at part of itself .    it was anthony s voice that cried out at last     the computer s been thrown in .       he heard the words as though someone else had shouted them and he raced out and down the stairs and through a corridor  leaving the babble of voices to rise behind him .       william     he cried as he burst into the computer room     it s perfect  it s        but william s hand was upraised .     shh .  please .  i don t want any violent sensations entering except those from the robot .          you mean we can be heard .     whispered anthony .       maybe not  but i don t know .     there was another screen  a smaller one  in the room with the mercury computer .  the scene on it was different  and changing  the robot was moving .    william said     the robot is feeling its way .  those steps have got to be clumsy .  there s a seven minute delay between stimulus and response and that has to be allowed for .          but already he s walking more surely than he ever did in arizona .  don t you think so  william .  don t you think so .     anthony was gripping william s shoulder  shaking it  eyes never leaving the screen .    william said     i m sure of it  anthony .       the sun burned down in a warm contrasting world of white and black  of white sun against black sky and white rolling ground mottled with black shadow .  the bright sweet smell of the sun on every exposed square centimeter of metal contrasting with the creeping death of aroma on the other side .    he lifted his hand and stared at it  counting the fingers .  hot hot hot  turning  putting each finger  one by one  into the shadow of the others and the hot slowly dying in a change in tactility that made him feel the clean  comfortable vacuum .    yet not entirely vacuum .  he straightened and lifted both arms over his head  stretching them out  and the sensitive spots on either wrist felt the vapors   the thin  faint touch of tin and lead rolling through the cloy of mercury .    the thicker taste rose from his feet  the silicates of each variety  marked by the clear separate and together touch and tang of each metal ion .  he moved one foot slowly through the crunchy  caked dust  and felt the changes like a soft  not quite random symphony .    and over all the sun .  he looked up at it  large and fat and bright and hot  and heard its joy .  he watched the slow rise of prominences around its rim and listened to the crackling sound of each  and to the other happy noises over the broad face .  when he dimmed the background light  the red of the rising wisps of hydrogen showed in bursts of mellow contralto  and the deep bass of the spots amid the muted whistling of the wispy  moving faculae  and the occasional thin keening of a flare  the ping pong ticking of gamma rays and cosmic particles  and over all in every direction the soft  fainting  and ever renewed sigh of the sun s substance rising and retreating forever in a cosmic wind which reached out and bathed him in glory .    he jumped  and rose slowly in the air with a freedom he had never felt  and jumped again when he landed  and ran  and jumped  and ran again  with a body that responded perfectly to this glorious world  this paradise in which he found himself .    a stranger so long and so lost   in paradise at last .    william said     it s all right .          but what s he doing .     cried out anthony .       it s all right .  the programming is working .  he has tested his senses .  he has been making the various visual observations .  he has dimmed the sun and studied it .  he has tested for atmosphere and for the chemical nature of the soil .  it all works .          but why is he running .          i rather think that s his own idea  anthony .  if you want to program a computer as complicated as a brain  you ve got to expect it to have ideas of its own .          running .  jumping .     anthony turned an anxious face to william .     he ll hurt himself .  you can handle the computer .  override .  make him stop .       and william said sharply     no .  i won t .  i ll take the chance of his hurting himself .  don t you understand .  he s happy .  he was on earth  a world he was never equipped to handle .  now he s on mercury with a body perfectly adapted to its environment  as perfectly adapted as a hundred specialized scientists could make it be .  it s paradise for him  let him enjoy it .          enjoy .  he s a robot .          i m not talking about the robot .  i m talking about the brain  the brain  that s living here .       the mercury computer  enclosed in glass  carefully and delicately wired  its integrity most subtly preserved  breathed and lived .       it s randall who s in paradise     said william .     he s found the world for whose sake he autistically fled this one .  he has a world his new body fits perfectly in exchange for the world his old body did not fit at all .       anthony watched the screen in wonder .     he seems to be quieting .          of course     said william     and he ll do his job all the better for his joy .       anthony smiled and said     we ve done it  then  you and i .  shall we join the rest and let them fawn on us  william .       william said     together .       and anthony linked arms .     together  brother .      i won   t deny that the unworthy thought crossed my mind that jim was young and that when he took stranger in paradise he might  unconsciously  have been more impressed by my name than by the story .  that thought  fugitive at best  vanished completely when donald wollheim  of daw books  picked it up for one of his anthologies .  it simply passes the bounds of belief that don  hardened and cynical veteran that he is  could possibly be impressed by my name under any circumstances or  in fact  by anything about me .   right  don .   so if he wanted the story  it was for the story   s sake .   i have on occasion written articles for the new york times magazine but my batting average with them is less than  .     .    ordinarily that sort of thing would be disheartening and i would get to feel that i didn   t have the range on that particular market and that i ought to concentrate my efforts elsewhere .  however  the times is a special case  and i kept trying .    by the fall of       however  i had received three rejections in a row and i made up my mind to turn down the next request for an article that i received from them .  that   s not as easy as it sounds  because the request usually comes from gerald walker  who is as nice a fellow as was ever invented .    when he called  i tried desperately to steel myself to a refusal whatever he said  and then he mentioned the magic phrase    science fiction .          a science fiction story .     i said .       yes     he said .       for the magazine section .          yes .  we want a four thousand word story that looks into the future and has something to say about the relationship between man and machine .          i   ll try     i said .  what else could i do .  the chance of hitting the times with a science fiction story was too interesting to pass up .  i began working on the story on november           sent it in .  to the times without any real confidence concerning the outcome  and damned if they didn   t take it .  it appeared in the january          issue of the sunday times and  as far as i could find out  it was the first piece of fiction the times had ever commissioned and published .       the life and times of multivac      the whole world was interested .  the whole world could watch .  if anyone wanted to know how marty did watch  multivac could have told them .  the great computer multivac kept track as it did of everything .    multivac was the judge in this particular case  so coldly objective and purely upright that there was no need of prosecution or defense .  there was only the accused  simon hines  and the evidence  which consisted  in part  of ronald bakst .    bakst watched  of course .  in his case  it was compulsory  . he would rather it were not .  in his tenth decade  he was showing signs of age and his rumpled hair was distinctly gray .    noreen was not watching .  she had said at the door     if we had a friend left      she paused  then added     which i doubt .     and left .    bakst wondered if she would come back at all  but at the moment  it didn   t matter .    hines had been an incredible idiot to attempt actual action  as though one could think of walking up to a multivac outlet and smashing it  as though he didn   t know a world girdling computer  the world girdling computer  capital letter  please  with millions of robots at its command  couldn   t protect itself .  and even if the outlet had been smashed  what would that have accomplished .    and hines did it in bakst   s physical presence  too .    he was called precisely on schedule     ronald bakst will give evidence now .       multivac   s voice was beautiful  with a beauty that never quite vanished no matter how often it was heard .  its timbre was neither quite male nor  for that matter  female  and it spoke in whatever language its hearer understood best .       i am ready to give evidence     bakst said .    there was no way to say anything but what he had to say .  hines could not avoid conviction .  in the days when hines would have had to face his fellow human beings  he would have been convicted more quickly and less fairly  and would have been punished more crudely .    fifteen days passed  days during which bakst was quite alone .  physical aloneness was not a difficult thing to envisage in the world of multivac .  hordes had died in the days of the great catastrophes and it had been the computers that had saved what was left and directed the recovery and improved their own designs till all were merged into multivac  and the five million human beings were left on earth to live in perfect comfort .   .    but those five million were scattered and the chances of one seeing another outside the immediate circle  except by design  was not great .  no one was designing to see bakst  not even by television .    for the time  bakst could endure the isolation .  he buried himself in his chosen way which happened to be  these last twenty three years  the designing of mathematical games .  every man and woman on earth could develop a way of life to self suit  provided always that multivac  weighing all of human affairs with perfect skill  did not judge the chosen way to be subtractive to human happiness .    but what could be subtractive in mathematical games .  it was purely abstract  pleased bakst  harmed no one else .    he did not expect the isolation to continue .  the congress would not isolate him permanently without a trial  a different kind of trial from that which hines had experienced  of course  one without multivac   s tyranny of absolute justice .    still  he was relieved when it ended  and pleased that it was noreen coming back that ended it .  she came trudging over the hill toward him and he started toward her  smiling .  it had been a successful five year period during which they had been together .  even the occasional meetings with her two children and two grandchildren had been pleasant .    he said     thank you for being back .       she said     i   m not back .     she looked tired .  her brown hair was windblown  her prominent cheeks a trifle rough and sunburned .    bakst pressed the combination for a light lunch and coffee .  he knew what she liked .  she didn   t stop him  and though she hesitated for a moment  she ate .    she said     i   ve come to talk to you .  the congress sent me .          the congress .     he said .     fifteen men and women  counting me .  self appointed and helpless .          you didn   t think so when you were a member .          i   ve grown older .  i   ve learned          at least you   ve learned to betray your friends .          there was no betrayal .  hines tried to damage multivac  a foolish  impossible thing for him to try .          you accused him .          i had to .  multivac knew the facts without my accusation  and without my accusation  i would have been an accessory .  hines would not have gained  but i would have lost .          without a human witness  multivac would have suspended sentence          not in the case of an anti multivac act .  this wasn   t a case of illegal parenthood or life  work without permission .  i couldn   t take the chance .          so you let simon be deprived of all work permits for two years          he deserved it .          a consoling thought  you may have lost the confidence of the congress  but you have gained the confidence of multivac          the confidence of multivac is important in the world as it is      said bakst seriously .  he was suddenly conscious of not being as tall as noreen    she looked angry enough to strike him  her lips pressed whitely together  but then she had passed her eightieth birthday no longer young the habit of non violence was too ingrained .   .  .  . except for fools like hines .       is that all you have to say  then .     she said .       there could be a great deal to say  have you forgotten .  have you all forgotten .  do you remember how it once was .  do you remember the twentieth century .  we live long now  we live securely now  we live happily now .          we live worthlessly now .          do you want to go back to what the world was like once .       noreen shook her head violently .     demon tales to frighten us .  we have learned our lesson .  with the help of multivac we have come through  but we don   t need that help any longer .  further help will soften us to death .  without multivac  we will run the robots  we will direct the farms and mines and factories .          how well .          well enough .  better  with practice .  we need the stimulation of it in any case or we will all die .       bakst said     we have our work  noreen  whatever work we choose .          whatever we choose  as long as it   s unimportant  and even that can be taken away at will as with hines .  and what   s your work  ron .  mathematical games .  drawing lines on paper .  choosing number combinations .       bakst   s hand reached out to her  almost pleadingly .     that can be important .  it is not nonsense .  don   t underestimate      he paused  yearning to explain but not quite knowing how he could  safely .  he said     i   m working on some deep problems in combinatorial analysis based on gene patterns that can be used to           to amuse you and a few others .  yes  i   ve heard you talk about your games .  you will decide how to move from a to b in a minimum number of steps and that will teach you how to go from womb to grave in a minimum number of risks and we will all thank multivac as we do so .       she stood up .     ron  you will be tried .  i   m sure of it .  our trial .  and you will be dropped .  multivac will protect you against physical harm  but you know it will not force us to see you  speak to you  or have anything to do with you .  you will find that without the stimulation of human interaction  you will not be able to think  or to play your games .  goodbye .          noreen .  wait .       she turned at the door .     of course  you will have multivac .  you can talk to multivac  ron .       he watched her dwindle as she walked down the road through the parklands kept green  and ecologically healthy  by the unobtrusive labors of quiet  single minded robots one scarcely ever saw .    he thought  yes  i will have to talk to multivac .    multivac had no particular home any longer .  it was a global presence knit together by wire  optical fiber  and microwave .  it had a brain divided into a hundred subsidiaries but acting as one .  it had its outlets everywhere and no human being of the five million was far from one .    there was time for all of them  since multivac could speak to all individually at the same time and not lift its mind from the greater problems that concerned it .    bakst had no illusions as to its strength .  what was its incredible intricacy but a mathematical game that bakst had come to understand over a decade ago .  he knew the manner in which the connecting links ran from continent to continent in a huge network whose analysis could form the basis of a fascinating game .  how do you arrange the network so that the flow of information never jams .  how do you arrange the switching points .  prove that no matter what the arrangement  there is always at least one point which  on disconnection   once bakst had learned the game  he had dropped out of the congress .  what could they do but talk and of what use was that .  multivac indifferently permitted talk of any kind and in any depth precisely because it was unimportant .  it was only acts that multivac prevented  diverted  or punished .    and it was hines   s act that was bringing on the crisis  and before bakst was ready for it  too .    bakst had to hasten now  and he applied for an interview with multivac without any degree of confidence in the outcome .    questions could be asked of multivac at any time .  there were nearly a million outlets of the type that had withstood hines   s sudden attack into which  or near which  one could speak .  multivac would answer .    an interview was another matter .  it required time  it required privacy  most of all it required multivac   s judgment that it was necessary .  although multivac had capacities that not all the world   s problems consumed  it had grown chary  somehow  of its time .  perhaps that was the result of its ever continuing self improvement .  it was becoming constantly more aware of its own worth and less likely to bear trivialities with patience .    bakst had to depend on multivac   s good will .  his leaving of the congress  all his actions since  even the bearing of evidence against mines  had been to gain that good will .  surely it was the key to success in this world .    he would have to assume the good will .  having made the application  he at once traveled to the nearest substation by air .  nor did he merely send his image .  he wanted to be there in person  somehow he felt his contact with multivac would be closer in that way .    the room was almost as it might be if there were to be a human conference planned over closed multivision .  for one flash by moment  bakst thought multivac might assume an imaged human form and join him the brain made flesh .    it did not  of course .  there was the soft  whispering chuckle of multivac   s unceasing operations  something always and forever present in multivac   s presence  and over it  now  multivac   s voice .    it was not the usual voice of multivac .  it was a still  small voice  beautiful and insinuating  almost in his ear .       good day  bakst .  you are welcome .  your fellow human beings disapprove of you .       multivac always comes to the point  thought bakst .  he said     it does not matter  multivac .  what counts is that i accept your decisions as for the good of the human species .  you were designed to do so in the primitive versions of yourself and           and my self designs have continued this basic approach .  if you understand this  why do so many human beings fail to understand it .  i have not yet completed the analysis of that phenomenon .          i have come to you with a problem     said bakst .  multivac said     what is it .       bakst said     i have spent a great deal of time on mathematical problems inspired by the study of genes and their combinations .  i cannot find the necessary answers and home computerization is of no help .       there was an odd clicking and bakst could not repress a slight shiver at the sudden thought that multivac might be avoiding a laugh .  it was a touch of the human beyond what even he was ready to accept .  the voice was in his other ear and multivac said       there are thousands of different genes in the human cell .  each gene has an average of perhaps fifty variations in existence and uncounted numbers that have never been in existence .  if we were to attempt to calculate all possible combinations  the mere listing of them at my fastest speed  if steadily continued  would  in the longest possible lifetime of the universe  achieve but an infinitesimal fraction of the total .       bakst said     a complete listing is not needed .  that is the point of my game .  some combinations are more probable than others and by building probability upon probability  we can cut the task enormously .  it is the manner of achieving this building of probability upon probability that i ask you to help me with .          it would still take a great deal of my time .  how could i justify this to myself .       bakst hesitated .  no use in trying a complicated selling job .  with multivac  a straight line was the shortest distance between two points .   .    he said     an appropriate gene combination might produce a human being more content to leave decisions to you  more willing to believe in your resolve to make men happy  more anxious to be happy .  i cannot find the proper combination  but you might  and with guided genetic engineering           i see what you mean .  it is good .  i will devote some time to it .       bakst found it difficult to hitch into noreen   s private wave .  length .  three times the connection broke away .  he was not surprised .  in the last two months  there had been an increasing tendency for technology to slip in minor ways never for long  never seriously and he greeted each occasion with a somber pleasure .    this time it held .  noreen   s face showed  holographically three dimensional .  it flickered a moment  but it held .       i   m returning your call     said bakst  dully impersonal .       for a while it seemed impossible to get you     said noreen .     where have you been .          not hiding .  i   m here  in denver .          why in denver .          the world is my oyster  noreen .  i may go where i please .       her face twitched a little .     and perhaps find it empty everywhere .  we are going to try you  ron .          now .          now .          and here .          and here .       volumes of space flickered into different glitters on either side of noreen  and further away  and behind .  bakst looked from side to side  counting .  there were fourteen  six men  eight women .  he knew every one of them .  they had been good friends once  not so long ago .    to either side and beyond the simulacra was the wild background of colorado on a pleasant summer day that was heading toward its end .  there had been a city here once named denver .  the site still bore the name though it had been cleared  as most of the city sites had been .   .  .  . he could count ten robots in sight  doing whatever it was robots did .    they were maintaining the ecology  he supposed .  he knew no details  but multivac did  and it kepi fifty million robots allover the earth in efficient order .    behind bakst was one of the converging grids of multivac  almost like a small fortress of self defense .       why now .     he asked .     and why here .       automatically he turned to eldred .  she was the oldest of them and the one with authority if a human being could be said to have authority .    eldred   s dark brown face looked a little weary .  the years showed  all six score of them  but her voice was firm and incisive .     because we have the final fact now .  let noreen tell you .  she knows you best .       bakst   s eyes shifted to noreen .     of what crime am i accused .          let us play no games  ron .  there are no crimes under multivac except to strike for freedom and it is your human crime that you have committed no crime under multivac .  for that we will judge whether any human being alive wants your company any longer  wants to hear your voice  be aware of your presence  or respond to you in any way .          why am i threatened with isolation then .          you have betrayed all human beings .          how .          do you deny that you seek to breed mankind into subservience to multivac .          ah .     bakst folded his arms across his chest .     you found out quickly  but then you had only to ask multivac .       noreen said     do you deny that you asked for help in the genetic engineering of a strain of humanity designed to accept slavery under multivac without question .          i suggested the breeding of a more contented humanity .  is this a betrayal .       eldred intervened .  she said     we don   t want your sophistry  ron .  we know it by heart .  don   t tell us once again that multivac cannot be withstood  that there is no use in struggling  that we have gained security .  what you call security  the rest of us call slavery .       bakst said     do you proceed now to judgment  or am i allowed a defense .          you heard eldred     said noreen .     we know your defense .      .       we all heard eldred     said bakst     but no one has heard me .  what she says is my defense is not my defense .       there was a silence as the images glanced right and left at each other .  eldred said     speak .       bakst said     i asked multivac to help me solve a problem in the field of mathematical games .  to gain his interest  i pointed out that it was modeled on gene combinations and that a solution might help in designing a gene combination that would leave man no worse off than he is now in any respect and yet breed into him a cheerful acceptance of multivac   s direction  and acquiescence in his decisions .          so we have said     said eldred .       it was only on those terms that multivac would have accepted the task .  such a new breed is clearly desirable for mankind by multivac   s standards  and by multivac   s standards he must labor toward it  and the desirability of the end will lure him on to examine greater and greater complications of a problem whose endlessness is beyond what even he can handle .  you all witness that .       noreen said     witness what .          haven   t you had trouble reaching me .  in the last two months  hasn   t each of you noticed small troubles in what has always gone smoothly .   .  .  . you are silent .  may i accept that as an affirmative .          if so what then .       bakst said     multivac has been placing all his spare circuits on the problem .  he has been slowly pushing the running of the world toward rather a skimpy minimum of his efforts  since nothing  by his own sense of ethics  must stand in the way of human happiness and there can be no greater increase in that happiness than to accept multivac .       noreen said     what does all this mean .  there is still enough in multivac to run the world and us and if this is done at less than full efficiency  that would only add temporary discomfort to our slavery .  only temporary  because it won   t last long .  sooner or later  multivac will decide the problem is insoluble  or will solve it  and in either case  his distraction will end .  in the latter case  slavery will become permanent and irrevocable .          but for now he is distracted     said bakst     and we can even talk like this most dangerously without his noticing .  yet i dare not risk doing so for long  so please understand me quickly .       i have another mathematical game the setting up of networks on the model of multivac .  i have been able to demonstrate that no matter how complicated and redundant the network is  there must be at least one place into which all the currents can funnel under particular circumstances .  there will always be the fatal apoplectic stroke if that one place is interefered with  since it will induce overloading elsewhere which will break down and induce overloading elsewhere  and so on indefinitely till all breaks down .          well .          and this is the point .  why else have i come to denver .  and multivac knows it  too  and this point is guarded electronically and robotically to the extent that it cannot be penetrated .          well .          but multivac is distracted  and multivac trusts me .  i have labored hard to gain that trust  at the cost of losing all of you  since only with trust is there the possibility of betrayal .  if any of you tried to approach this point  multivac might rouse himself even out of his present distraction .  if multivac were not distracted  he would not allow even me to approach .  but he is distracted  and it is i .       bakst was moving toward the converging grid in a calm saunter  and the fourteen images  keyed to him  moved along as well .  the soft susurrations of a busy multivac center were all about them .    bakst said     why attack an invulnerable opponent .  make him vulnerable first  and then        bakst fought to stay calm  but it all depended on this now .  everything .  with a sharp yank  he uncoupled a joint .   if he had only had still more time to make more certain .     he was not stopped  and as he held his breath  he became aware of the ceasing of noise  the ending of whisper  the closing down of multivac .  if  in a moment  that soft noise did not return  then he had had the right key point  and no recovery would be possible .  if he were not quickly the focus of approaching robots   he turned in the continuing silence .  the robots in the distance were working still .  none were approaching .    before him  the images of the fourteen men and women of the congress were still there and each seemed to be stupefied at the sudden enormous thing that had happened .    bakst said     multivac is shut down  burnt out .  it can   t be rebuilt .     he felt almost drunk at the sound of what he was saying .     i have worked toward this since i left you .  when hines attacked  i feared there might be other such efforts  that multivac would double his guard  that even i had to work quickly  i wasn   t sure      he was gasping  but forced himself steady  and said solemnly     i have given us our freedom .       and he paused  aware at last of the gathering weight of the silence .  fourteen images stared at him  without any of them offering a word in response .    bakst said sharply     you have talked of freedom .  you have it .       then  uncertainly  he said     isn   t that what you want .      when i first finished the preceding story  or thought i had  i was left dissatisfied .  i lay awake till about   a . m .  trying to figure out what dissatisfied me  and then decided i had not made my point .  i got up  quickly wrote down the last three paragraphs of the story as it finally appeared  ending with that horrified question  and then went peacefully to sleep .    the next day  i rewrote the last page of the manuscript to include the new ending and when i sent it off to the times  much as i wanted to make the sale  i indicated where i would be intransigent .       please note     i wrote     that the ending on an unresolved question is not an accident .  it is of the essence .  each reader is going to have to consider the meaning of the question and what answer he himself would give .       the times asked for some trivial changes and clarifications but did not allow even a whisper of objection to emerge concerning my ending  i am glad to say .    my own original title had been    mathematical games     by the way  and for a while i considered restoring it in the book version .  however  the life and times of multivac has a swing to it .  besides  a large number of people saw it on the single day during which it was available to the reading public .  more people came up to me over the next few weeks to tell me they had read that story than had ever been the case for any other story i had ever written .  i don   t want them to think i changed the title in order to lure them into thinking they hadn   t read the story before  so that they might buy this book  so the life and times of multivac it stays .   among those who saw my story in the new york times magazine was william levinson  editor of physician   s world .  in the same issue of the magazine section was an article entitled    triage .     triage is a system of choosing whom to save and whom to allow to die when conditions do not allow of saving all .  triage has been used in medical emergencies when limited facilities have been applied to those with the best chance of making it .  now there is a feeling that triage might be applied on a worldwide scale  that some nations and regions cannot be saved and that no effort should be made to save them .    it occurred to levinson that the subject could be treated through the medium of science fiction and since my name was staring at him on the same contents page  he approached me .  i was struck with the idea and agreed at once .  i started it on january          .  levinson liked the winnowing when it was done and it was all set to appear in the june      issue  when the magazine suddenly suspended publication the issue before .    sad and embarrassed  levinson returned the story  but  of course  it wasn   t his fault  so i wrote him a reassuring letter .  after all  the story had been paid for and it wasn   t likely i couldn   t place it elsewhere .    ben bova took it at once  in fact  and it appeared in the february      analog .       the winnowing      five years had passed since the steadily thickening wall of secrecy had been clamped down about the work of dr .  aaron rodman .       for your own protection      they had warned him .       in the hands of the wrong people      they had explained .    in the right hands  of course  his own  for instance  dr .  rodman thought rather despairingly   the discovery was clearly the greatest boon to human health since pasteur   s working out of the germ theory  and the greatest key to the understanding of the mechanism of life  ever .    yet after his talk at the new york academy of medicine soon after his fiftieth birthday  and on the first day of the twenty first century  there had been a certain fitness to that   the silence had been imposed  and he could talk no more  except to certain officials .  he certainly could not publish .    the government supported him  however .  he had all the money he needed  and the computers were his to do with as he wished .  his work advanced rapidly and government men came to him to be instructed  to be made to understand .       dr .  rodman     they would ask     how can a virus be spread from cell to cell within an organism and yet not be infectious from one organism to the next .       it wearied rodman to have to say over and over that he did not have all the answers .  it wearied him to have to use the term    virus .     he said     it   s not a virus because it isn   t a nucleic acid molecule .  it is something else altogether  a lipoprotein .       it was better when his questioners were not themselves medical men .  he could then try to explain in generalities instead of forever bogging down on the fine points .  he would say     every living cell  and every small structure within the cell  is surrounded by a membrane .  the workings of each cell depend on what molecules can pass through the membrane in either direction and at what rates .  a slight change in the membrane will alter the nature of the flow enormously  and with that  the nature of the cell chemistry and the nature of its activity .       all disease may rest on alterations in membrane activity .  all mutations may be carried through by way of such alterations .  any technique that controls the membranes controls life .  hormones control the body by their effort on membranes and my lipoprotein is an artificial hormone rather than a virus .  the lp incorporates itself into the membrane and in the process induces the manufacture of more molecules like itself and that   s the part i don   t understand myself .       but the fine structures of the membranes are not quite identical everywhere .  they are  in fact  different in all living things not quite the same  in any two organisms .  an lp will affect no two individual organisms alike .  what will open the cells of one organism to glucose and relieve the effects of diabetes  will close the cells of another organism to lysine and kill it .       that was what seemed to interest them most  that it was a poison .       a selective poison     rodman would say .     you couldn   t tell  in advance  without the closest computer aided studies of the membrane biochemistry of a particular individual  what a particular lp would do to him .       with time  the noose grew tighter about himself  inhibiting his freedom  yet leaving him comfortable  in a world in which freedom and comfort alike were vanishing everywhere  and the jaws of hell were opening before a despairing humanity .    it was      and earth   s population was six billion .  but for the famines it would have been seven billion .  a billion human beings had starved in the past generation  and more would yet starve .    peter affare  chairman of the world food organization  came frequently to rodman   s laboratories for chess and conversation .  it was he  he said  who had first grasped the significance of rodman   s talk at the academy  and that had helped make him chairman .  rodman thought the significance was easy to grasp  but said nothing about that .    affare was ten years younger than rodman  and the red was darkening out of his hair .  he smiled frequently although the subject of the conversation rarely gave cause for smiling  since any chairman of an organization dealing with world food was bound to talk about world famine .    affare said     if the food supply were evenly distributed among all the world   s inhabitants  all would starve to death .          if it were evenly distributed     said rodman     the example of justice in the world might lead at last to a sane world policy .  as it is  there is world despair and fury over the selfish fortune of a few  and all behave irrationally in revenge .          you do not volunteer to give up your own oversupply of food     said affare .       i am human and selfish  and my own action would mean little .  i should not be asked to volunteer .  i should be given no choice in the matter .          you are a romantic     said affare .     do you fail to see that the earth is a lifeboat .  if the food store is divided equally among all  then all will die .  if some are cast out of the lifeboat  the remainder will survive .  the question is not whether some will die  for some must die  the question is whether some will live .          are you advocating triage  the sacrifice of some for the rest  officially .          we can   t .  the people in the lifeboat are armed .  several regions threaten openly to use nuclear weapons if more food is not forthcoming .       rodman said sardonically     you mean the answer to    you die that i may live    is    if i die  you die .      .  .  . an impasse .          not quite     said affare .     there are places on earth where the people cannot be saved .  they have overweighted their land hopelessly with hordes of starving humanity .  suppose they are sent food  and suppose the food kills them so that the land requires no further shipments .       rodman felt the first twinge of realization .     kills them how .     he asked .       the average structural properties of the cellular membranes of a particular population can be worked out .  an lp  particularly designed to take advantage of those properties  could be incorporated into the food supply  which would then be fatal     said affare .       unthinkable     said rodman  astounded .       think again .  there would be no pain .  the membranes would slowly close off and the affected person would fall asleep and not wake up an infinitely better death than that of starvation which is otherwise inevitable  or nuclear annihilation .  nor would it be for everyone  for any population varies in its membranal properties .  at worst  seventy per cent will die .  the winnowing out will be done precisely where overpopulation and hopelessness are worst and enough will be left to preserve each nation  each ethnic group  each culture .          to deliberately kill billions           we would not be killing .  we would merely supply the opportunity for people to die .  which particular individuals would die would depend on the particular biochemistry of those individuals .  it would be the finger of god .          and when the world discovers what has been done .          that will be after our time     said affare     and by then  a flourishing world with limited population will thank us for our heroic action in choosing the death of some to avoid the death of all .       dr .  rodman felt himself flushing  and found he had difficulty speaking .     the earth     he said     is a large and very complex lifeboat .  we still do not know what can or can   t be done with a proper distribution of resources and it is notorious that to this very day we have not really made an effort to distribute them .  in many places on earth  food is wasted daily  and it is that knowledge that drives hungry men mad .          i agree with you     said mare coolly     but we cannot have the world as we want it to be .  we must deal with it as it is .          then deal with me as i am    you will want me to supply the necessary lp molecules and i will not do so .  i will not lift a finger in that direction .          then     said mare     you will be a greater mass murderer than you are accusing me of being .  and i think you will change your mind when you have thought it through .       he was visited nearly daily  by one official or another  all of them well fed .  rodman was becoming very sensitive to the way in which all those who discussed the need for killing the  hungry were themselves well fed .    the national secretary of agriculture said to him  insinuatingly  on one of these occasions     would you not favor killing a herd of cattle infected with hoof  and mouth disease or with anthrax in order to avoid the spread of infection to healthy herds .          human beings are not cattle     said rodman     and famine is not contagious .          but it is     said the secretary .     that is precisely the point .  if we don   t winnow the overcrowded masses of humanity  their famine will spread to as yet unaffected areas .  you must not refuse to help us .          how can you make me .  torture .          we wouldn   t harm a hair on your body .  your skill in this matter is too precious to us .  food stamps can be withdrawn  however .          starvation would harm me     surely .          not you .  but if we are prepared to kill several billion people for the sake of the human race  then surely we are ready for the much less difficult task of withdrawing food stamps from your daughter  her husband  and her baby .       rodman was silent  and the secretary said     we   ll give you time to think .  we don   t want to take action against your family  but we will if we have to .  take a week to think about it .  next thursday the entire committee will be on hand .  you will then be committed to our project and there must be no further delay .       security was redoubled and rodman was openly and completely a prisoner .  a week later  all fifteen members of the world food council  together with the national secretary of agriculture and a few members of the national legislature  arrived at his laboratory .  they sat about the long table in the conference room of the lavish research building that had been built out of public funds .    for hours they talked and planned  incorporating those answers which rodman gave to specific questions .  no one asked rodman if he would cooperate  there seemed no thought that he could do anything else .    finally rodman said     your project cannot  in any case  work .  shortly after a shipment of grain arrives in some particular region of the world  people will die by the hundreds of millions .  do you suppose those who survive will not make the connection and that you will not risk the desperate retaliation of nuclear bombs .       affare  who sat directly opposite rodman  across the short axis of the table  said     we are aware of that possibility .  do you think we have spent years determining a course of action and have not considered the possible reaction of those regions chosen for winnowing .          do you expect them to be thankful .     asked rodman bitterly .       they will not know they are being singled out .  not all shipments of grain will be lp infected .  no one place will be concentrated on .  we will see to it that locally grown grain supplies are infected here and there .  in addition  not everyone will die and only a few will die at once .  some who eat much of the grain will not die at all  and some who eat only a small amount will die quickly  depending on their membranes .  it will seem like a plague  like the black death returned .       rodman said     have you thought of the effect of the black death returned .  have you thought of the panic .          it will do them good     growled the secretary from one end of the table .     it might teach them a lesson .          we will announce the discovery of an antitoxin     said affare  shrugging .     there will be wholesale inoculations in regions we know will not be affected .  dr .  rodman  the world is desperately ill  and must have a desperate remedy .  mankind is on the brink of a horrible death  so please do not quarrel with the only course that can save it .          that   s the point .  is it the only course or are you just taking an easy way out that will not ask any sacrifices of you merely of billions of others .       rodman broke off as a food trolley was brought in .  he muttered     i have arranged for some refreshments .  may we have a few moments of truce while we eat .       he reached for a sandwich and then  after a while  said between sips of coffee     we eat well  at least  as we discuss the greatest mass murder in history .       affare looked critically at his own half eaten sandwich .     this is not eating well .  egg salad on white bread of indifferent freshness is not eating well  and i would change whatever coffee shop supplied this  if i were you .     he sighed .       well  in a world of famine  one should not waste food     and he finished the sandwich .    rodman watched the others and then reached for the last remaining sandwich on the tray .     i thought     he said     that perhaps some of you might suffer a loss of appetite in view of the subject matter of discussion  but i see none of you did .  each one of you has eaten .          as did you     said mare impatiently .     you are still eating .          yes  i am     said rodman  chewing slowly .     and i apologize for the lack of freshness in the bread .  i made the sandwiches myself last night and they are fifteen hours old .          you made them yourself .     said mare .       i had to  since i could in no other way be certain of introducing the proper lp .          what are you talking about .          gentlemen  you tell me it is necessary to kill some to save others .  perhaps you are right .  you have convinced me .  but in order to know exactly what it is we are doing we should perhaps experience it ourselves .  i have engaged in a little triage on my own  and the sandwiches we have all just eaten are an experiment in that direction .       some of the officials were rising to their feet .     we   re poisoned .     gasped the secretary .    rodman said     not very effectively .  unfortunately  i don   t know your biochemistries thoroughly  so i can   t guarantee the seventy per cent death rate you would like .       they were staring at him in frozen horror  and dr .  rodman   s eyelids drooped .     still  it   s likely that two or three of you will die within the next week or so  and you need only wait to see who it will be .  there   s no cure or antidote  but don   t worry .  it   s a quite painless death  and it will be the finger of god  as one of you told me .  it   s a good lesson  as another of you said .  for those of you who survive  there may be new views on triage .       affare said     this is a bluff .  you   ve eaten the sandwiches yourself .       rodman said     i know .  i matched the lp to my own biochemistry  so i will go fast .      his eyes closed .     you   ll have to carryon without me  those of you who survive .      the next story has rather a sad history  though i myself emerged unscathed .  here   s how it goes .    in january       naomi gordon  a very charming woman from philadelphia  visited me and explained what i thought was a delightful idea for an anthology .  it was to be entitled the bicentennial man  it was to contain ten stories by top authors  with each one built about that phrase  and it was to be published in connection with the bicentennial .  the well known science fiction enthusiast forrest j .  ackerman was to do the editing .  naomi also had rather grandiose notions of preparing a very limited  very expensive edition .    i pointed out it would be difficult to write science fiction if the stories were to be centered on the bicentennial  but naomi said that the stories could be anything at all provided they could be seen to have arisen out of the phrase    the bicentennial man .       i was intrigued and agreed to do it .  i was handed half the advance at once .  the deadline was april          and by march    i was finished .  i was a little rueful about the story at first  for the agreement had called for a       word story and i had been unable to stop it before it had reached          the longest story i had written below the level of a novel in seventeen years .  i write an apologetic covering letter  assuring naomi that there would be no extra charge and she wrote back to say the extra wordage would be fine .  pretty soon  the remaining half of the advance arrived .   .    but then everything went wrong .  naomi was beset by family and medical problems  some writers who it had been hoped would participate  couldn   t  others who promised stories didn   t deliver them  those who did deliver them did not turn out entirely satisfactory products .    of course  i didn   t know anything about this .  it never even occurred to me that anything might go wrong .  actually  my only large interest is in writing .  selling is a minor interest  and what happens afterward is of almost no interest .    there was  however  judy lynn del rey and her enormous awareness of everything that goes on in science fiction .  she knew that i had written a story for this anthology .       how is it     she asked dangerously     that you wrote a story for that anthology  yet when i ask you for one you   re always too busy .           well      i said apologetically  for judy lynn is a frightening creature when she is moved     the idea of the anthology interested me .          how about my suggestions about a robot that has to choose between buying its own liberty and improving its  body .  i thought you said that was interesting .       at that point  i must have turned approximately as white as talcum powder .  a long time before  she had mentioned such things and i had forgotten .  i said     oh  my goodness  i included something of the sort in the story .          again .     she shrieked .     again you   re using my ideas for other people .  let me see that story .  let me see it .       so i brought her a carbon copy the next day and the day after that she called me .  she said     i tried hard not to like the story  but i didn   t manage .  i want it .  get the story back .          i can   t do that     i said .     i sold it to naomi and it   s hers .  i   ll write you a different story .                 bet you anything you like     said judy lynn     that that anthology isn   t going to go through .  why don   t you call and ask .     .    i called naomi and  of course  it wasn   t going through .  she agreed to send me back the manuscript and grant me permission to sell the story elsewhere  and i sent back the advance she had given me .   after all  she had lost considerable money on the venture  and i didn   t want any of that loss to represent a profit to me .     the story was then transferred to judy lynn  who used it in her anthology of originals entitled stellar science fiction     which appeared in february      .  and i like the story so much myself that i not only am including it here  but am using its title for the book as a whole .     incidentally  after this book was put together  judy lynn suggested i change my manuscript to make it jibe with the version in stellar .  apparently  she had introduced numerous minor changes that improved it  she said .  well  i am not harlan ellison  so i don   t mind  but i think that in my own collection  i   ll let the story stand as i wrote it .  judy lynn will be annoyed  but she can   t do worse than kill me .      this was during the passover seder  over which lester del rey presides every year with enormous effectiveness  since he is the best cook in science fiction .       the bicentennial man     the three laws of robotics      .  a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .     .  a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .     .  a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law .       .      andrew martin said     thank you     and took the seat offered him .  he didn   t look driven to the last resort  but he had been .    he didn   t  actually  look anything  for there was a smooth blankness  to his face  except for the sadness one imagined one saw in his eyes .  his hair was smooth  light brown  rather fine  and he had no facial hair .  he looked freshly and cleanly shaved .  his clothes were distinctly old fashioned  but neat  and predominantly a velvety red purple in color .    facing him from behind the desk was the surgeon .  the nameplate on the desk included a fully identifying series of letters and numbers which andrew didn   t bother with .  to call him doctor would be quite enough .       when can the operation be carried through  doctor .     he asked .    softly  with that certain inalienable note of respect that a robot always used to a human being  the surgeon said     i am not certain  sir  that i understand how or upon whom such an operation could be performed .       there might have been a look of respectful intransigence on the surgeon   s face  if a robot of his sort  in lightly bronzed stainless steel  could have such an expression   or any expression .    andrew martin studied the robot   s right hand  his cutting hand  as it lay motionless on the desk .  the fingers were long and were shaped into artistically metallic  looping curves so graceful and appropriate that one could imagine a scalpel fitting them and becoming  temporarily  one piece with them .  there would be no hesitation in his work  no stumbling  no quivering  no mistakes .  that confidence came with specialization  of course  a specialization so fiercely desired by humanity that few robots were  any longer  independently brained .  a surgeon  of course  would have to be .  but this one  though brained  was so limited in his capacity that he did not recognize andrew  had probably never heard of him .       have you ever thought you would like to be a man .     andrew asked .    the surgeon hesitated a moment  as though the question fitted nowhere in his allotted positronic pathways .     but i am a robot  sir .          would it be better to be a man .          if would be better  sir  to be a better surgeon .  i could not be so if i were a man  but only if i were a more advanced robot .  i would be pleased to be a more advanced robot .          it does not offend you that i can order you about .  that i can make you stand up  sit down  move right or left  by merely telling you to do so .          it is my pleasure to please you  sir .  if your orders were to interfere with my functioning with respect to you or to any other human being  i would not obey you .  the first law  concerning my duty to human safety  would take precedence over the second law relating to obedience .  otherwise  obedience is my pleasure .  now  upon whom am i to perform this operation .          upon me     andrew said .       but that is impossible .  it is patently a damaging operation .          that does not matter     said andrew  calmly .     i must not inflict damage     said the surgeon .     on a human being  you must not     said andrew     but i  too  am a robot .          .      andrew had appeared much more a robot when he had first been   manufactured .  he had then been as much a robot in appearance as any that had ever existed  smoothly designed and functional .    he had done well in the home to which he had been brought in those days when robots in households  or on the planet altogether  had been a rarity .  there had been four in the home  sir and ma   am and miss and little miss .  he knew their names  of course  but he never used them .  sir was gerald martin .    his own serial number was ndr   he eventually forgot the numbers .  it had been a long time  of course  but if he had wanted to remember  he could not have forgotten .  he had not wanted to remember .    little miss had been the first to call him andrew  because she could not use the letters  and all the rest followed her in this .    little miss   she had lived for ninety years and was long since dead .  he had tried to call her ma   am once  but she would not allow it .  little miss she had been to her last day .    andrew had been intended to perform the duties of a valet  a butler  even a lady   s maid .  those were the experimental days for him and  indeed  for all robots anywhere save in the industrial and exploratory factories and stations off earth .    the martins enjoyed him  and half the time he was prevented from doing his work because miss and little miss wanted to play with him .  it was miss who first understood how this might be arranged .     we order you to play with us and you must follow orders .          i am sorry  miss  but a prior order from sir must surely take precedence .       but she said     daddy just said he hoped you would take care of the cleaning .  that   s not much of an order .  i order you .       sir did not mind .  sir was fond of miss and of little miss  even more than ma   am was  and andrew was fond of them  too .  at least  the effect they had upon his actions were those which in a human being would have been called the result of fondness .  andrew thought of it as fondness for he did not know any other word for it .    it was for little miss that andrew had carved a pendant out of wood .  she had ordered him to .  miss  it seemed  had received an ivorite pendant with scrollwork for her birthday and little miss was unhappy over it .  she had only a piece of wood  which she gave andrew together with a small kitchen knife .    he had done it quickly and little miss had said     that   s nice  andrew .  i   ll show it to daddy .       sir would not believe it .     where did you really get this  mandy .     mandy was what he called little miss .  when little miss assured him she was really telling the truth  he turned to andrew .     did you do this  andrew .          yes  sir .          the design  too .          yes  sir .          from what did you copy the design .          it is a geometric representation  sir  that fits the grain of the wood .       the next day  sir brought him another piece of wood   a larger one   and an electric vibro knife .     make something out of this  andrew .  anything you want to     he said .    andrew did so as sir watched  then looked at the product a long time .  after that  andrew no longer waited on tables .  he was ordered to read books on furniture design instead  and he learned to make cabinets and desks .       these are amazing productions  andrew     sir soon told him .       i enjoy doing them  sir     andrew admitted .       enjoy .          it makes the circuits of my brain somehow flow more easily .  i have heard you use the word  enjoy    and the way you use it fits the way i feel .  i enjoy doing them  sir .          .      gerald martin took andrew to the regional offices of the united states robots and mechanical men corporation .  as a member of the regional legislature he had no trouble at all in gaining an interview with the chief robopsychologist .  in fact  it was only as a member of the regional legislature that he qualified as a robot owner in the first place   in those early days when robots were rare .    andrew did not understand any of this at the time .  but in later years  with greater learning  he could re view that early scene and understand it in its proper light .    the robopsychologist  merton mansky  listened with a growing frown and more than once managed to stop his fingers at the point beyond which they would have irrevocably drummed on the table .  he had drawn features and a lined forehead  but he might actually have been younger than he looked .       robotics is not an exact art  mr .  martin     mansky explained .     i cannot explain it to you in detail  but the mathematics governing the plotting of the positronic pathways is far too complicated to permit of any but approximate solutions .  naturally  since we build everything around the three laws  those are incontrovertible .  we will  of course  replace your robot           not at all     said sir .     there is no question of failure on his part .  he performs his assigned duties perfectly .  the point is he also carves wood in exquisite fashion and never the same twice .  he produces works of art .       mansky looked confused .     strange .  of course  we   re attempting generalized pathways these days .  really creative  you think .          see for yourself .     sir handed over a little sphere of wood on which there was a playground scene in which the boys and girls were almost too small to make out  yet they were in perfect proportion and they blended so naturally with the grain that it  too  seemed to have been carved .    mansky was incredulous .     he did that .     he handed it back with a shake of his head .     the luck of the draw .  something in the pathways .          can you do it again .          probably not .  nothing like this has ever been reported .          good .  i don   t in the least mind andrew   s being the only one .          i suspect that the company would like to have your robot back for study     mansky said .       not a chance .     sir said with sudden grimness .     forget it .     he turned to andrew     let   s go home  now .          .      miss was dating boys and wasn   t about the house much .  it was little miss  not as little as she once was  who filled andrew   s horizon now .  she never forgot that the very first piece of wood carving he had done had been for her .  she kept it on a silver chain about her neck .    it was she who first objected to sir   s habit of giving away andrew   s work .     come on  dad  if anyone wants one of them  let him pay for it .  it   s worth it .          it isn   t like you to be greedy  mandy .          not for us  dad .  for the artist .       andrew had never heard the word before  and when he had a moment to himself he looked it up in the dictionary .    then there was another trip  this time to sir   s lawyer .       what do you think of this  john .     sir asked .    the lawyer was john finegold .  he had white hair and a pudgy belly  and the rims of his contact lenses were tinted a bright green .  he looked at the small plaque sir had given him .     this is beautiful .  but i   ve already heard the news .  isn   t thus a carving made by your robot .  the one you   ve brought with you .          yes  andrew does them .  don   t you  andrew .          yes  sir     said andrew .       how much would you pay for that  john .     sir asked .       i can   t say .  i   m not a collector of such things .          would you believe i have been offered two hundred and fifty dollars for that small thing .  andrew has made chairs that have sold for five hundred dollars .  there   s two hundred thousand dollars in the bank from andrew   s products .          good heavens  he   s making you rich  gerald .          half rich     said sir .     half of it is in an account in the name of andrew martin .          the robot .          that   s right  and i want to know if it   s legal .          legal  .   .   .   .     feingold   s chair creaked as he leaned back in it .     there are no precedents  gerald .  how did your robot sign the necessary papers .          he can sign his name .  now  is there anything further that ought to be done .          um .     feingold   s eyes seemed to turn inward for a moment .  then he said     well  we can set up a trust to handle all finances in his name and that will place a layer of insulation between him and the hostile world .  beyond that  my advice is you do nothing .  no one has e stopped you so far .  if anyone objects  let him bring suit         and will you take the case if the suit is brought .          for a retainer  certainly .          how much .          something like that     feingold said  and pointed to the wooden plaque .       fair enough     said sir .    feingold chuckled as he turned to the robot .     andrew  are you pleased that you have money .          yes  sir .          what do you plan to do with it .     pay for things  sir  which otherwise sir    would have to pay for .  it would save him expense  sir .          .      such occasions    arose .  repairs were expensive  and revisions were even more so .  with the years  new models of robots were produced and sir saw to it that andrew had the advantage of every new device  until he was a model of metallic excellence .  it was all done at andrew   s expense .  andrew insisted on that .    only his positronic pathways were untouched .  sir insisted on that .       the new models aren   t as good as you are  andrew     he said .     the new robots are worthless .  the company has learned to make the pathways more precise  more closely on the nose  more deeply on the track .  the new robots don   t shift .  they do what they   re designed for and never stray .  i like you better .          thank you  sir .          and it   s your doing  andrew  don   t you forget that .  i am certain mansky put an end to generalized pathways as soon as he had a good look at you .  he didn   t like the unpredictability .  do you know how many times he asked for you back so he could place you under study .  nine times .  i never let him have you  though  and now that he   s retired  we may have some peace .       so sir   s hair thinned and grayed and his face grew pouchy  while andrew looked even better than he had when he first joined the family .  ma   am had joined an art colony somewhere in europe  and miss was a poet in new york .  they wrote sometimes  but not often .  little miss was married and lived not far away .  she said she did not want to leave andrew .  when her child  little sir  was born  she let andrew hold the bottle and feed him .    with the birth of a grandson  andrew felt that sir finally had someone to replace those who had gone .  therefore  it would not be so unfair now to come to him with the request .       sir  it is kind of you to have allowed me to spend my money as i wished         it was your money  andrew .          only by your voluntary act  sir .  i do not believe the law would have stopped you from keeping it all .          the law won   t persuade me to do wrong  andrew .          despite all expenses  and despite taxes  too  sir  i have nearly six hundred thousand dollars .          i know that  andrew .          i want to give it to you  sir .          i won   t take it  andrew         in exchange for something you can give me  sir         oh .  what is that  andrew .          my freedom  sir .          your           i wish to buy my freedom  sir .          .      it wasn   t that easy .  sir had flushed  had said     for god   s sake .     then he had turned on his heel and stalked away .    it was little miss who finally brought him round  defiantly and harshly   and in front of andrew .  for thirty years no one had ever hesitated to talk in front of andrew  whether or not the matter involved andrew .  he was only a robot .       dad  why are you taking this as a personal affront .  he   ll still be here .  he   ll still be loyal .  he can   t help that  it   s built in .  all he wants is a form of words .  ha wants to be called free .  is that so terrible .  hasn   t be earned this chance .  heavens  he and i have been talking about it for years .          talking about it for years  have you .          yes  and over and over again he postponed it for fear he would hurt you .  i made him put the matter up to you .          he doesn   t know what freedom is .  he   s a robot .          dad  you don   t know him .  he   s read everything in the library .  i don   t know what he feels inside  but i don   t know what you feel inside either .  when you talk to him you   ll find he reacts to the various abstractions as you and i do  and what else counts .  if some one else   s reactions are like your own  what more can you ask for .          the law won   t take that attitude     sir said  angrily .     see here  you .     he turned to andrew with a deliberate grate in his voice .     i can   t free you except by doing it legally .  if this gets into the courts  you not only won   t get your freedom but the law will take official cognizance of your money .  they   ll tell you that a robot has no right to earn money .  is this rigmarole worth losing your money .          freedom is without price  sir     said andrew .     even the chance of freedom is worth the money .          .      it seemed the court might also take the attitude that freedom was without price  and might decide that for no price  however great  could a robot buy its freedom .    the simple statement of the regional attorney who represented those who had brought a class action to oppose the freedom was this     the word  freedom    has no meaning when applied to a robot .  only a human being can be free .     he said it several times  when it seemed appropriate  slowly  with his hand coming down rhythmically on the desk before him to mark the words .    little miss asked permission to speak on behalf of andrew .    she was recognized by her full name  something andrew had never heard pronounced before     amanda laura martin charney may approach the bench .          thank you  your honor .  i am not a lawyer and i don   t know the proper way of phrasing things  but i hope you will listen to my meaning and ignore the words .       let   s understand what it means to be free in andrew   s case .  in some ways  he is free .  i think it   s at least twenty years since anyone in the martin family gave him an order to do something that we felt he might not do of his own accord .  but we can  if we wish  give him an order to do anything  couching it as harshly as we wish  because he is a machine that belongs to us .  why should we be in a position to do so  when he has served us so long  so faithfully  and has earned so much money for us .  he owes us nothing more .  the debit is entirely on the other side .       even if we were legally forbidden to place andrew in involuntary servitude  he would still serve us voluntarily .  making him free would be a trick of words only  but it would mean much to him .  it would give him everything and cost us nothing .       for a moment the judge seemed to be suppressing a smile .     i see your point  mrs .  chamey .  the fact is that there is no binding law in this respect and no precedent .  there is  however  the unspoken assumption that only a man may enjoy freedom .  i can make new law here  subject to reversal in a higher court  but i cannot lightly run counter to that assumption .  let me address the robot .  andrew .          yes  your honor .       it was the first time andrew bad spoken in court  and the judge seemed astonished for a moment at the human timbre of his voice .       why do you want to be free  andrew .  in what way will this matter to you .       andrew said     would you wish to be a slave  your honor .          but you are not a slave .  you are a perfectly good robot   a genius of a robot  i am given to understand  capable of an artistic expression that can be matched nowhere .  what more could you do if you were free .          perhaps no more than i do now  your honor  but with greater joy .  it has been said in this courtroom that only a human being can be free .  it seems to me that only someone who wishes for freedom can be free .  i wish for freedom .       and it was that statement that cued the judge .  the crucial sentence in his decision was    there is no right to deny freedom to any object with a mind advanced enough to grasp the concept and desire the state .     it was eventually upheld by the world court .       .      sir remained displeased  and his harsh voice made andrew feel as if he were being short circuited .     i don   t want your damned money  andrew .  i   ll take it only because you won   t feel free otherwise .  from now on  you can select your own jobs and do them as you please .  i will give you no orders  except this one  do as you please .  but i am still responsible for you .  that   s part of the court order .  i hope you understand that .       little miss interrupted .     don   t be irascible  dad .  the responsibility is no great chore .  you know you won   t have to do a thing .  the three laws still hold .          then how is he free .          are not human beings bound by their laws  sir .     andrew replied .       i   m not going to argue .     sir left the room  and andrew saw him only infrequently after that .    little miss came to see him frequently in the small house that had been built and made over for him .  it had no kitchen  of course  nor bathroom facilities .  it had just two rooms  one was a library and one was a combination storeroom and workroom .  andrew accepted many commissions and worked harder as a free robot than he ever had before  till the cost of the house was paid for and the structure was signed over to him .    one day little sir   no     george .       came .  little sir had insisted on that after the court decision .     a free robot doesn   t call anyone little sir     george had said .     i call you andrew .  you must call me george .       his preference was phrased as an order  so andrew called him george   but little miss remained little miss .    one day when george came alone  it was to say that sir was dying .  little miss was at the bedside  but sir wanted andrew as well .    sir   s voice was still quite strong  though he seemed unable to move much .  he struggled to raise his hand .       andrew     he said     andrew   don   t help me  george .  i   m only dying  i   m not crippled .  andrew  i   m glad you   re free .  i just wanted to tell you that .       andrew did not know what to say .  he had never been at the side of someone dying before  but he knew it was the human way of ceasing to function .  it was an involuntary and irreversible dismantling  and andrew did not know what to say that might be appropriate .  he could only remain standing  absolutely silent  absolutely motionless .    when it was over  little miss said to him     he may not have seemed friendly to you toward the end  andrew  but he was old  you know  and it hurt him that you should want to be free .       then andrew found the words .     i would never have been free without him  little miss .          .      only after sir   s death did andrew begin to wear clothes .  he began with an old pair of trousers at first  a pair that george had given him .    george was married now  and a lawyer .  he had joined feingold   s firm .  old feingold was long since dead  but his daughter had carried on .  eventually the firm   s name became feingold and martin .  it remained so even when the daughter retired and no feingold took her place .  at the time andrew first put on clothes  the martin name had just been added to the firm .    george had tried not to smile the first time he saw andrew attempting to put on trousers  but to andrew   s eyes the smile was clearly there .  george showed andrew how to manipulate the static charge to allow the trousers to open  wrap about his lower body  and move shut .  george demonstrated on his own trousers  but andrew was quite aware it would take him a while to duplicate that one flowing motion .       but why do you want trousers  andrew .  your body is so beautifully functional it   s a shame to cover it especially when you needn   t worry about either temperature control or modesty .  and the material doesn   t cling properly   not on metal .       andrew held his ground .     are not human bodies beautifully functional  george .  yet you cover yourselves .          for warmth  for cleanliness  for protection  for decorativeness .  none of that applies to you .          i feel bare without clothes .  i feel different  george     andrew responded .       different .  andrew  there are millions of robots on earth now .  in this region  according to the last census  there are almost as many robots as there are men .          i know  george .  there are robots doing every conceivable type of work .          and none of them wear clothes .          but none of them are free  george .       little by little  andrew added to his wardrobe .  he was inhibited by george   s smile and by the stares of the people who commissioned work .    he might be free  but there was built into andrew a carefully detailed program concerning his behavior to people  and it was only by the tiniest steps that he dared advance  open disapproval would set him back months .  not everyone accepted andrew as free .  he was incapable of resenting that  and yet there was a difficulty about his thinking process when he thought of it .  most of all  he tended to avoid putting on clothes   or too many of them   when he thought little miss might come to visit him .  she was older now and was often away in some warmer climate  but when she returned the first thing she did was visit him .    on one of her visits  george said  ruefully     she   s got me  andrew .  i   ll be running for the legislature next year .   like grandfather     she says   like grandson .             like grandfather  .   .   .     andrew stopped  uncertain .       i mean that i  george  the grandson  will be like sir  the grandfather  who was in the legislature once .          it would be pleasant  george  if sir were still      he paused  for he did not want to say     in working order .     that seemed inappropriate .       alive     george said .     yes  i think of the old monster now and then  too .       andrew often thought about this conversation .  he had noticed his own incapacity in speech when talking with george .  somehow the language had changed since andrew had come into being with a built in vocabulary .  then  too  george used a colloquial speech  as sir and little miss had not .  why should he have called sir a monster when surely that word was not a appropriate .  andrew could not even turn to his own books for guidance .  they were old  and most dealt with woodworking  with art  with furniture design .  there were none on language  none on the ways of human beings .    finally  it seemed to him that he must seek the proper books  and as a free robot  he felt he must not ask george .  he would go to town and use the library .  it was a triumphant decision and he felt his electro potential grow distinctly higher until he had to throw in an impedance coil .    he put on a full costume  including even a shoulder chain of wood .  he would have preferred the glitter plastic  but george had said that wood was much more appropriate  and that polished cedar was considerably more valuable as well .    he had placed a hundred feet between himself and the house before gathering resistance brought him to a halt .  he shifted the impedance coil out of circuit  and when that did not seem to help enough he returned to his home and on a piece of notepaper wrote neatly     i have gone to the library     and placed it in clear view on his worktable .        .      andrew never quite got to the library .    he had studied the map .  he knew the route  but not the appearance of it .  the actual landmarks did not resemble the symbols on the map and he would hesitate .  eventually  he thought he must have somehow gone wrong  for everything looked strange .    he passed an occasional field robot  but by the time he decided he should ask his way none were in sight .  a vehicle passed and did not stop .    andrew stood irresolute  which meant calmly motionless  for coming across the field toward him were two human beings .    he turned to face them  and they altered their course to meet him .  a moment before  they had been talking loudly .  he had heard their voices .  but now they were silent .  they had the look that andrew associated with human uncertainty  and they were young  but not very young .  twenty  perhaps .  andrew could never judge human age .       would you describe to me the route to the town library  sirs .       one of them  the taller of the two  whose tall hat lengthened him still farther  almost grotesquely  said  not to andrew  but to the other     it   s a robot .       the other had a bulbous nose and heavy eyelids .  he said  not to andrew but to the first     it   s wearing clothes .       the tall one snapped his fingers .     it   s the free robot .  they have a robot at the old martin place who isn   t owned by anybody .  why else would it be wearing clothes .          ask it     said the one with the nose .       are you the martin robot .     asked the tall one .       i am andrew martin  sir     andrew said .       good .  take off your clothes .  robots don   t wear clothes .     he said to the other     that   s disgusting .  look at him .       andrew hesitated .  he hadn   t heard an order in that tone of voice in so long that his second law circuits had momentarily jammed .    the tall one repeated     take off your clothes .  i order you .       slowly  andrew began to remove them .       just drop them     said the tall one .    the nose said     if it doesn   t belong to anyone  it could be ours as much as someone else   s .          anyway     said the tall one     who   s to object to anything we do .  we   re not damaging property .     tie turned to andrew .     stand on your head .        the head is not meant     andrew began .       that   s an order .  if you don   t know how  try anyway .       andrew hesitated again  then bent to put his head on the ground .  he tried to lift his legs but fell  heavily .    the tall one said     just lie there .     he said to the other     we can take him apart .  ever take a robot apart .          will he let us .          how can he stop us .       there was no way andrew could stop them  if they ordered him in a forceful enough manner not to resist the second law of obedience took precedence over the third law of self preservation .  in any case  he could not defend himself without possibly hurting them  and that would mean breaking the first law .  at that thought  he felt every motile unit contract slightly and he quivered as he lay there .    the tall one walked over and pushed at him with his foot .     he   s heavy .  i think we   ll need tools to do the job .       the nose said     we could order him to take himself  apart .  it would be fun to watch him try .          yes     said the tall one  thoughtfully     but let   s get him off the road .  if someone comes along        it was too late .  someone had  indeed  come along and it was george .  from where he lay  andrew had seen him topping a small rise in the middle distance .  he would have liked to signal him in some way  but the last order had been    just lie there .       george was running now  and he arrived on the scene somewhat winded .  the two young men stepped back a little and then waited thoughtfully .       andrew  has something gone wrong .     george asked  anxiously .    andrew replied     i am well  george .          then stand up .  what happened to your clothes .          that your robot  mac .     the tall young man asked .    george turned sharply .     he   s no one   s robot .  what   s been going on here .          we politely asked him to take his clothes off .  what   s that to you  if you don   t own him .       george turned to andrew .     what were they doing  andrew .          it was their intention in some way to dismember me .  they were about to move me to a quiet spot and order me to dismember myself .       george looked at the two young men  and his chin trembled .    the young men retreated no farther .  they were smiling .    the tall one said  lightly     what are you going to do  pudgy .  attack us .       george said     no .  i don   t have to .  this robot has been with my family for over seventy five years .  he knows us and he values us more than he values anyone else .  i am going to tell him that you two are threatening my life and that you plan to kill me .  i will ask him to defend me .  in choosing between me and you two  he will choose me .  do you know what will happen to you when he attacks you .       the two were backing away slightly  looking uneasy .    george said  sharply     andrew  i am in danger and about to come to harm from these young men .  move toward them .       andrew did so  and the young men did not wait .  they ran .       all right  andrew  relax     george said .  he looked unstrung .  he was far past the age where he could face the possibility of a dustup with one young man  let alone two .       i couldn   t have hurt them  george  i could see they were not attacking you .          i didn   t order you to attack them .  i only told you to move toward them .  their own fears did the rest .          how can they fear robots .          it   s a disease of mankind  one which has not yet been cured .  but never mind that .  what the devil are you doing here  andrew .  good thing i found your note .  i was just on the point of turning back and hiring a helicopter when i found you .  how did you get it into your head to go to the library .  i would have brought you any books you needed         i am a      andrew began .       free robot .  yes  yes .  all right  what did you want in the library .          i want to know more about human beings  about the world  about everything .  and about robots  george .  i want to write a history about robots .       george put his arm on the other   s shoulder .     well  let   s walk home .  but pick up your clothes first .  andrew  there are a million books on robotics and all of them include histories of the science .  the world is growing saturated not only with robots but with information about robots .       andrew shook his head  a human gesture he had lately begun to adopt .     not a history of robotics  george .  a history of robots  by a robot .  i want to explain how robots feel about what has happened since the first ones were allowed to work and live on earth .       george   s eyebrows lifted  but he said nothing in direct response .        .      little miss was just past her eighty third birthday  but there was nothing about her that was lacking in either energy or determination .  she gestured with her cane oftener than she propped herself up with it .    she listened to the story in a fury of indignation .     george  that   s horrible .  who were those young ruffians .          i don   t know .  what difference does it make .  in the end they did not do any damage .          they might have .  you   re a lawyer  george  and if you   re well off  it   s entirely due to the talents of andrew .  it was the money he earned that is the foundation of everything we have .  he provides the continuity for this family  and i will not have him treated as a wind up toy .          what would you have me do  mother .     george asked .       i said you   re a lawyer .  don   t you listen .  you set up a test case somehow  and you force the regional courts to declare for robot rights and get the legislature to pass the necessary bills .  carry the whole thing to the world court  if you have to .  i   ll be watching  george  and i   ll tolerate no shirking .       she was serious  so what began as a way of soothing the fearsome old lady became an involved matter with enough legal entanglement to make it interesting .  as senior partner of feingold and martin  george plotted strategy .  but he left the actual work to his junior partners  with much of it a matter for his son  paul  who was also a member of the firm and who reported dutifully nearly every day to his grandmother .  she  in turn  discussed the case every day with andrew .    andrew was deeply involved .  his work on his book on robots was delayed again  as he pored over the legal arguments and even  at times  made very diffident suggestions .       george told me that day i was attacked that human beings have always been afraid of robots     he said one day .     as long as they are  the courts and the legislatures are not likely to work hard on behalf of robots .  should not something be done about public opinion .       so while paul stayed in court  george took to the public platform .  it gave him the advantage of being informal  and he even went so far sometimes as to wear the new  loose style of clothing which he called drapery .    paul chided him     just don   t trip over it on stage  dad .       george replied  despondently     i   ll try not to .       he addressed the annual convention of holo news editors on one occasion and said  in part     if  by virtue of the second law  we can demand of any robot unlimited obedience in all respects not involving harm to a human being  then any human being  any human being  has a fearsome power over any robot  any robot .  in particular  since second law supersedes third law  any human being can use the law of obedience to overcome the law of self protection .  he can order any robot to damage itself or even to destroy itself for any reason  or for no reason .       is this just .  would we treat an animal so .  even an inanimate object which had given us good service has a claim on our consideration .  and a robot is not insensitive  it is not an animal .  it can think well enough so that it can talk to us  reason with us  joke with us .  can we treat them as friends  can we work together with them  and not give them some of the fruits of that friendship  some of the benefits of co working .       if a man has the right to give a robot any order that does not involve harm to a human being  he should have the decency never to give a robot any order that involves harm to a robot  unless human safety absolutely requires it .  with great power goes great responsibility  and if the robots have three laws to protect men  is it too much to ask that men have a law or two to protect robots .       andrew was right .  it was the battle over public opinion that held the key to courts and legislature .  in the end  a law was passed that set up conditions under which robot harming orders were forbidden .  it was endlessly qualified and the punishments for violating the law were totally inadequate  but the principle was established .  the final passage by the world legislature came through on the day of little miss    death .    that was no coincidence .  little miss held on to life desperately during the last debate and let go only when word of victory arrived .  her last smile was for andrew .  her last words were     you have been good to us  andrew .     she died with her hand holding his  while her son and his wife and children remained at a respectful distance from both .        .      andrew waited patiently when the receptionist robot disappeared into the inner office .  the receptionist might have used the holographic chatterbox  but un questionably it was perturbed by having to deal with another robot rather than with a human being .    andrew passed the time revolving the matter his mind  could    unroboted    be used as an analog of    unmanned     or had unmanned become a metaphoric term sufficiently divorced from its original literal meaning to be applied to robots  or to women for that matter .  such problems frequently arose as he worked on his book on robots .  the trick of thinking out sentences to express all complexities had undoubtedly increased his vocabulary .    occasionally  someone came into the room to stare at him and he did not try to avoid the glance .  he looked at each calmly  and each in turn looked away .    paul martin finally emerged .  he looked surprised  or he would have if andrew could have made out his expression with certainty .  paul had taken to wearing the heavy makeup that fashion was dictating for bath sexes .  though it made sharper and firmer the somewhat bland lines of paul   s face  andrew disapproved .  he found that disapproving of human beings  as long as he did not express it verbally  did not make him very uneasy .  he could even write the disapproval .  he was sure it had not always been so .       come in  andrew .  i   m sorry i made you wait  but there was something i had to finish .  come in  you had said you wanted to talk to me  but i didn   t know you meant here in town .          if you are busy  paul  i am prepared to continue to wait .       paul glanced at the interplay of shifting shadows on the dial on the wall that served as timepieces and said     i can make some time .  did you come alone .          i hired an automatobile .          any trouble .     paul asked  with more than a trace of anxiety .       i wasn   t expecting any .  my rights are protected .       paul looked all the more anxious for that .     andrew  i   ve explained that the law is unenforceable  at least under most conditions .  and if you insist on wearing clothes  you   ll run into trouble eventually  just like that first time .          and only tine  paul .  i   m sorry you are displeased         well  look at it this way  you are virtually a living legend  andrew  and you are too valuable in many different ways for you to have any right to take chances with yourself .  by the way  how   s the book coming .          i am approaching the end  paul .  the publisher is quite pleased .          good .          i don   t know that he   s necessarily pleased with the book as a book .  i think he expects to sell many copies because it   s written by a robot and that   s what pleases him .       only human  i   m afraid .          i am not displeased .  let it sell for whatever reason  since it will mean money and i can use some .          grandmother left you           little miss was generous  and i   m sure i can count on the family to help me out further .  but it is the royalties from the book on which i am counting to help me through the next step .          what next step is that .          i wish to see the head of u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation .  i have tried to make an appointment  but so far i have not been able to reach him .  the corporation did not cooperate with me in the writing of the book  so i am not surprised  you understand .       paul was clearly amused .     cooperation is the last thing you can expect .  they didn   t cooperate with us in our great fight for robot rights .  quite the reverse  and you can see why .  give a robot rights and people may not want to buy them .          nevertheless     said andrew     if you call them  you may be able to obtain an interview for me .          i   m no more popular with them than you are  andrew .          but perhaps you can hint that by seeing me they may head off a campaign by feingold and martin to strengthen the rights of robots further .          wouldn   t that be a lie  andrew .          yes  paul  and i can   t tell one .  that is why you must call .          ah  you can   t lie  but you can urge me to tell a lie  is that it .  you   re getting more human all the time  andrew .           .      the meeting was not easy to arrange  even with paul   s supposedly weighted name .    but it finally came about .  when it did  harley smythe robertson  who  on his mother   s side  was descended from the original founder of the corporation and who had adopted the hyphenation to indicate it  looked remarkably unhappy .  he was approaching retirement age and his entire tenure as president had been devoted to the matter of robot rights .  his gray hair was plastered thinly over the top of his scalp  his face was not made up  and he eyed andrew with brief hostility from time to time .    andrew began the conversation .     sir  nearly a century ago  i was told by a merton mansky of this corporation that the mathematics governing the plotting of the positronic pathways was far too complicated to permit of any but approximate solutions and that  therefore  my own capacities were not fully predictable .          that was a century ago .     smythe robertson hesitated  then said icily     sir .  it is true no longer .  our robots are made with precision now and are trained precisely to their jobs .          yes     said paul  who had come along  as he said  to make sure that the corporation played fair     with the result that my receptionist must be guided at every point once events depart from the conventional  however slightly .          you would be much more displeased if it were to improvise     smythe robertson said .       then you no longer manufacture robots like myself which are flexible and adaptable .          no longer .          the research i have done in connection with my book     said andrew     indicates that i am the oldest robot presently in active operation .          the oldest presently     said smythe robertson     and the oldest ever .  the oldest that will ever be .  no robot is useful after the twenty fifth year .  they are called in and replaced with newer models .          no robot as presently manufactured is useful after the twentieth year     said paul  with a note of sarcasm creeping into his voice .     andrew is quite exceptional in this respect .       andrew  adhering to the path he had marked out for himself  continued     as the oldest robot in the world and the most flexible  am i not unusual enough to merit special treatment from the company .          not at all     smythe robertson said  freezing up .     your unusualness is an embarrassment to the company .  if you were on lease  instead of having been an outright sale through some mischance  you would long since have been replaced .          but that is exactly the point     said andrew .     i am a free robot and i own myself .  therefore i come to you and ask you to replace me .  you cannot do this without the owner   s consent .  nowadays  that consent is extorted as a condition of the lease  but in my time this did not happen .       smythe robertson was looking both startled and puzzled  and for a moment there was silence .  andrew found himself staring at the hologram on the wall .  it was a death mask of susan calvin  patron saint of all roboticists .  she had been dead for nearly two centuries now  but as a result of writing his book andrew knew  her so well he could half persuade himself that he had met her in life .    finally smythe robertson asked     how can i replace you for you .  if i replace you  as robot  how can i donate the new robot to you as owner since in the very act of replacement you cease to exist .     he smiled grimly .       not at all difficult     paul interposed .     the seat of andrew   s personality is his positronic brain and it is the one part that cannot be replaced without creating a new robot .  the positronic brain  therefore  is andrew the owner .  every other part of the robotic body can be replaced without affecting the robot   s personality  and those other parts are the brain   s possessions .  andrew  i should say  wants to supply his brain with a new robotic body .          that   s right     said andrew  calmly .  he turned to smythe robertson .     you have manufactured androids  haven   t you .  robots that have the outward appearance of humans  complete to the texture of the skin .          yes  we have .  they worked perfectly well  with their synthetic fibrous skins and tendons .  there was virtually no metal anywhere except for the brain  yet they were nearly as tough as metal robots .  they were tougher  weight for weight .       paul looked interested .     i didn   t know that .  how many are on the market .          none     said smythe robertson .     they were much more expensive than metal models and a market survey showed they would not be accepted .  they looked too human .       andrew was impressed .     but the corporation retains its expertise  i assume .  since it does  i wish to request that i be replaced by an organic robot  an android .       paul looked surprised .     good lord .     he said .    smythe robertson stiffened .     quite impossible .          why is it impossible .     andrew asked .     i will pay any reasonable fee  of course .          we do not manufacture androids .          you do not choose to manufacture androids     paul interjected quickly .     that is not the same as being unable to manufacture them .          nevertheless     smythe robertson responded     the manufacture of androids is against public policy .          there is no law against it     said paul .       nevertheless  we do not manufacture them   and we will not .       paul cleared his throat .     mr .  smythe robertson     he said     andrew is a free robot who comes under the purview of the law guaranteeing robot rights .  you are aware of this  i take it .          only too well .          this robot  as a free robot  chooses to wear clothes .  this results in his being frequently humiliated by thoughtless human beings despite the law against the humiliation of robots .  it is difficult to prosecute vague offenses that don   t meet with the general disapproval of those who must decide on guilt and innocence .          u . s .  robots understood that from the start .  your father   s firm unfortunately did not .          my father is dead now  but what i see is that we have here a clear offense with a clear target .          what are you talking about .     said smythe robertson .       my client  andrew martin   he has just become my client   is a free robot who is entitled to ask u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation for the rights of replacement  which the corporation supplies to anyone who owns a robot for more than twenty five years .  in fact  the corporation insists on such replacement .       paul was smiling and thoroughly at ease .     the positronic brain of my client     he went on     is the owner of the body of my client which is certainly more than twenty five years old .  the positronic brain demands the replacement of the body and offers to pay any reasonable fee for an android body as that replacement .  if you refuse the request  my client undergoes humiliation and we will sue .       while public opinion would not ordinarily support the claim of a robot in such a case  may i remind you that u . s .  robots is not popular with the public generally .  even those who most use and profit from robots are suspicious of the corporation .  this may be a hangover from the days when robots were widely feared .  it may be resentment against the power and wealth of u . s .  robots  which has a worldwide monopoly .  whatever the cause may be  the resentment eats .  i think you will find that you would prefer not to be faced with a lawsuit  particularly since my client is wealthy and will live for many more centuries and will have no reason to refrain from fighting the battle forever .       smythe robertson had slowly reddened .     you are trying to force           i force you to do nothing     said paul .     if you wish to refuse to accede to my client   s reasonable request  you may by all means do so and we will leave without another word .  but we will sue  as is certainly our right  and you will find that you will eventually lose .          well .          i see that you are going to accede     said paul .     you may hesitate but you will come to it in the end .  let me assure you  then  of one further point  if  in the process of transferring my client   s positronic brain from his present body to an organic one  there is any damage  however slight  then i will never rest until i   ve nailed the corporation to the ground .  i will  if necessary  take every possible step to mobilize public opinion against the corporation if one brain path of my client   s platinum iridium essence is scrambled .     he turned to andrew and asked     do you agree to all this  andrew .       andrew hesitated a full minute .  it amounted to the approval of lying  of blackmail  of the badgering and humiliation of a human being .  but not physical harm  he told himself  not physical harm .    he managed at last to come out with a rather faint    yes .           .      he felt as though he were being constructed again .  for days  then for weeks  finally for months  andrew found himself not himself somehow  and the simplest actions kept giving rise to hesitation .    paul was frantic .     they   ve damaged you  andrew .  we   ll have to institute suit .       andrew spoke very slowly .     you   mustn   t .  you   ll never be able to prove   something   like m m m m            malice .          malice .  besides  i grow   stronger  better .  it   s the tr   tr   tr            tremble .          trauma .  after all  there   s never been such an op op op   before .       andrew could feel his brain from the inside .  no one else could .  he knew he was well  and during the months that it took him to learn full coordination and full positronic interplay he spent hours before the mirror .    not quite human .  the face was stiff   too stiff and the motions were too deliberate .  they lacked the careless  free flow of the human being  but perhaps that might come with time .  at least now he could wear clothes without the ridiculous anomaly of a metal face going along with it .    eventually  he said     i will be going back to work .       paul laughed .     that means you are well .  what will you be doing .  another book .          no     said andrew  seriously .     i live too long for any one career to seize me by the throat and never let me go .  there was a time when i was primarily an artist  and i can still turn to that .  and there was a time when i was a historian  and i can still turn to that .  but now i wish to be a robobiologist .          a robopsychologist  you mean .          no .  that would imply the study of positronic brains  and at the moment i lack the desire to do that .  a robobiologist  it seems to me  would be concerned with the working of the body attached to that brain .          wouldn   t that be a roboticist .          a roboticist works with a metal body .  i would be studying an organic humanoid body  of which i have the only one  as far as i know .          you narrow your field     said paul  thoughtfully .     as an artist  all conception is yours  as a historian you deal chiefly with robots  as a robobiologist  you will deal with yourself .       andrew nodded .     it would seem so .       andrew had to start from the very beginning  for he knew nothing of ordinary biology and almost nothing of science .  he became a familiar sight in the libraries  where he sat at the electronic indices for hours at a time  looking perfectly normal in clothes .  those few who knew he was a robot in no way interfered with him .    he built a laboratory in a room which he added to his house  and his library grew  too .    years passed  and paul came to him one day and said     it   s a pity you   re no longer working on the history of robots .  i understand u . s .  robots is adopting a radically new policy .       paul had aged  and his deteriorating eyes had been replaced with photoptic cells .  in that respect  he had drawn closer to andrew .       what have they done .     andrew asked .       they are manufacturing central computers  gigantic positronic brains  really  which communicate with anywhere from a dozen to a thousand robots by microwave .  the robots themselves have no brains at all .  they are the limbs of the gigantic brain  and the two are physically separate .          is that more efficient .          u . s .  robots claims it is .  smythe robertson established the new direction before he died  however  and it   s my notion that it   s a backlash at you .  u . s .  robots is determined that they will make no robots that will give them the type of trouble you have  and for that reason they separate brain and body .  the brain will have no body to wish changed  the body will have no brain to wish anything .       it   s amazing  andrew     paul went on     the influence you have had on the history of .  robots .  it was your artistry that encouraged u . s .  robots to make robots more precise and specialized  it was your freedom that resulted in the establishment of the principle of robotic rights  it was your insistence on an android body that made u . s .  robots switch to brain body separation      andrew grew thoughtful .     i suppose in the end the corporation will produce one vast brain controlling several billion robotic bodies .  all the eggs will be in one basket .  dangerous .  not proper at all .          i think you   re right     said paul     but i don   t suspect it will come to pass for a century at least and i won   t live to see it .  in fact  i may not live to see next year .          paul .     cried andrew  in concern .    paul shrugged .     men are mortal  andrew .  we   re not like you .  it doesn   t matter too much  but it does make it important to assure you on one point .  i   m the last of the human martins .  the money i control personally will be left to the trust in your name  and as far as anyone can foresee the future  you will be economically secure .          unnecessary     andrew said  with difficulty .  in all this time  he could not get used to the deaths of the martins .       let   s not argue .  that   s the way it   s going to be .  now  what are you working on .          i am designing a system for allowing androids   myself   to gain energy from the combustion of hydrocarbons  rather than from atomic cells .       paul raised his eyebrows .     so that they will breathe and eat .          yes .          how long have you been pushing in that direction .          for a long time now  but i think i have finally designed an adequate combustion chamber for catalyzed controlled breakdown .          but why  andrew .  the atomic cell is surely infinitely better .          in some ways  perhaps .  but the atomic cell is inhuman .           .      it took time  but andrew had time .  in the first place  he did not wish to do anything till paul had died in peace .  with the death of the great grandson of sir  andrew felt more nearly exposed to a hostile world and for that reason was all the more determined along the path he had chosen .    yet he was not really alone .  if a man had died  the firm of feingold and martin lived  for a corporation does not die any more than a robot does .    the firm had its directions and it followed them soullessly .  by way of the trust and through the law firm  andrew continued to be wealthy .  in return for their own large annual retainer  feingold and martin involved themselves in the legal aspects of the new combustion chamber .  but when the time came for andrew to visit u . s .  robots and mechanical men corporation  he did it alone .  once he had gone with sir and once with paul .  this time  the third time  he was alone and manlike .    u . s .  robots had changed .  the actual production plant had been shifted to a large space station  as had grown to be the case with more and more industries .  with them had gone many robots .  the earth itself was becoming park like  with its one billion person population stabilized and perhaps not more than thirty percent of its at least equally large robot population independently brained .    the director of research was alvin magdescu  dark of complexion and hair  with a little pointed beard and wearing nothing above the waist but the breast band that fashion dictated .  andrew himself was well covered in the older fashion of several decades back .    magdescu offered his hand to his visitor .     i know you  of course  and i   m rather pleased to see you .  you   re our most notorious product and it   s a pity old smythe robertson was so set against you .  we could have done a great deal with you .          you still can     said andrew .       no  i don   t think so .  we   re past the time .  we   ve had robots on earth for over a century  but that   s changing .  it will be back to space with them  and those that stay here won   t be brained .          but there remains myself  and i stay on earth .          true  but there doesn   t seem to be much of the robot about you .  what new request have you .          to be still less a robot .  since i am so far organic  i wish an organic source of energy .  i have here the plans        magdescu did not hasten through them .  he might have intended to at first  but he stiffened and grew intent .  at one point  he said     this is remarkably ingenious .  who thought of all this .          i did     andrew replied .    magdescu looked up at him sharply  then said     it would amount to a major overhaul of your body  and an experimental one  since such a thing has never been attempted before .  i advise against it .  remain as you are .       andrew   s face had limited means of expression  but impatience showed plainly in his voice .     dr .  magdescu  you miss the entire point  you have no choice but to accede to my request .  if such devices can be built into my body  they can be built into human bodies as well .  the tendency to lengthen human life by prosthetic devices has already been remarked on .  there are no devices better than the ones i have designed or am designing .  as it happens  i control the patents by way of the firm of feingold and martin .  we are quite capable of going into business for ourselves and of developing the kind of prosthetic devices that may end by producing human beings with many of the properties of robots .  your own business will then suffer .       if  however  you operate on me now and agree to do so under similar circumstances in the future  you will receive permission to make use of the patents and control the technology of both robots and of the prosthetization of human beings .  the initial leasing will not be granted  of course  until after the first operation is completed successfully  and after enough time has passed to demonstrate that it is indeed successful .       andrew felt scarcely any first law inhibition to the stern conditions he was setting a human being .  he was learning to reason that what seemed like cruelty might  in the long run  be kindness .    magdescu was stunned .     i   m not the one to decide something like this .  that   s a corporate decision that would take time .          i can wait a reasonable time     said andrew     but only a reasonable time .     and he thought with satisfaction that paul himself could not have done it better .        .      it took only a reasonable time  and the operation was a success .       i was very much against the operation  andrew     magdescu said     but not for the reasons you might think .  i was not in the least against the experiment  if it had been on someone else .  i hated risking your positronic brain .  now that you have the positronic pathways interacting with simulated nerve pathways  it might have been difficult to rescue the brain intact if the body had gone bad .          i had every faith in the skill of the staff at u . s .  robots     said andrew .     and i can eat now .          well  you can sip olive oil .  it will mean occasional cleanings of the combustion chamber  as we have explained to you .  rather an uncomfortable touch  i should think .          perhaps  if i did not expect to go further .  self cleaning is not impossible .  in fact  i am working on a device that will deal with solid food that may be expected to contain incombustible fractions   indigestible matter  so to speak  that will have to be discarded .          you would then have to develop an anus .          or the equivalent .          what else  andrew   .          everything else .          genitalia  too .          insofar as they will fit my plans .  my body is a canvas on which i intend to draw        magdescu waited for the sentence to he completed  and when it seemed that it would not be  he completed it himself .     a man .          we shall see     andrew said .       that   s a puny ambition  andrew .  you   re better than a man .  you   ve gone downhill from the moment you opted to become organic .          my brain has not suffered .          no  it hasn   t .  i   ll grant you that .  but  andrew  the whole new breakthrough in prosthetic devices made possible by your patents is being marketed under your name .  you   re recognized as the inventor and you   re being honored for it   as you should be .  why play further games with your body .       andrew did not answer .    the honors came .  he accepted membership in several learned societies  including one that was devoted to the new science he had established   the one he had called robobiology but which had come to be termed prosthetology .  on the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his construction  a testimonial dinner was given in his honor at u . s .  robots .  if andrew saw an irony in this  he kept it to himself .    alvin magdescu came out of retirement to chair the dinner .  he was himself ninety four years old and was alive because he  too  had prosthetized devices that  among other things  fulfilled the function of liver and kidneys .  the dinner reached its climax when magdescu  after a short and emotional talk  raised his glass to toast the sesquicentennial robot .    andrew had had the sinews of his face redesigned to the point where he could show a human range of emotions  but he sat through all the ceremonies solemnly passive .  he did not like to be a sesquicentennial robot .        .      it was prosthetology that finally took andrew off the earth .    in the decades that followed the celebration of his sesquicentennial  the moon had come to be a world more earthlike than earth in every respect but its gravitational pull  and in its underground cities there was a fairly dense population .  prosthetized devices there had to take the lesser gravity into account .  andrew spent five years on the moon working with local prosthetologists to make the necessary adaptations .  when not at his work  he wandered among the robot population  every one of which treated him with the robotic obsequiousness due a man .    he came back to an earth that was humdrum and quiet in comparison  and visited the offices of feingold and martin to announce his return .    the current head of the firm  simon delong  was surprised .     we had been told you were returning  andrew      he had almost said mr .  martin      but we were not expecting you till next week .          i grew impatient     said andrew briskly .  he was anxious to get to the point .     on the moon  simon  i was in charge of a research team of twenty human scientists .  i gave orders that no one questioned .  the lunar robots deferred to me as they would to a human being .  why  then  am i not a human being .       a wary look entered delong   s eyes .     my dear andrew  as you have just explained  you are treated as a human being by both robots and human beings .  you are  therefore  a human being de facto .          to be a human being de facto is not enough .  i want not only to be treated as one  but to be legally identified as one .  i want to be a human being de jure .          now  that is another matter     delong said .     there we would run into human prejudice and into the undoubted fact that  however much you may be like a human being  you are not a human being .          in what way not .     andrew asked .     i have the shape of a human being and organs equivalent to those of a human being .  my organs  in fact  are identical to some of those in a prosthetized human being .  i have contributed artistically  literally  and scientifically to human culture as much as any human being now alive .  what more can one ask .          i myself would ask nothing more .  the trouble is that it would take an act of the world legislature to define you as a human being .  frankly  i wouldn   t expect that to happen .          to whom on the legislature could i speak .          to the chairman of the science and technology committee  perhaps .          can you arrange a meeting .          but you scarcely need an intermediary .  in your position  you can           no .  you arrange it .     it didn   t even occur to andrew that he was giving a fiat order to a human being .  he had grown so accustomed to that on the moon .     i want him to know that the firm of feingold and martin is backing me in this to the hilt .          well  now           to the hilt  simon .  in one hundred and seventy three years i have in one fashion or another contributed greatly to this firm .  i have been under obligation to individual members of the firm in times past .  i am not  now .  it is rather the other way around now and i am calling in my debts .          i will   do what i can     delong said .        .      the chairman of the science and technology committee was from the east asian region and was a woman .  her name was chee li hsing and her transparent garments   obscuring what she wanted obscured only by their dazzle   made her look plastic wrapped .     i sympathize with your wish for full human rights     she said .     there have been times in history when segments of the human population fought for full human rights .  what rights  however  can you possibly want that you do not have .          as simple a thing as my right to life     andrew stated .     a robot can be dismantled at any time .          a human being can be executed at any time .          execution can only follow due process of law .  there is no trial needed for my dismantling .  only the word of a human being in authority is needed to end me .  besides   besides      andrew tried desperately to allow no sign of pleading  but his carefully designed tricks of human expression and tone of voice betrayed him here .     the truth is i want to be a man .  i have wanted it through six generations of human beings .       li hsing looked up at him out of darkly sympathetic eyes .     the legislature can pass a law declaring you one .  they could pass a law declaring that a stone statue be defined as a man .  whether they will actually do so is  however  as likely in the first case as the second .  congress people are as human as the rest of the population and there is always that element of suspicion against robots .          even now .          even now .  we would all allow the fact that you have earned the prize of humanity  and yet there would remain the fear of setting an undesirable precedent .          what precedent .  i am the only free robot  the only one of my type  and there will never be another .  you may consult u . s .  robots .           never    is a long word  andrew   or  if you prefer  mr .  martin   since i will gladly give you my personal accolade as man .  you will find that most congress people will not be so willing to set the precedent  no matter how meaningless such a precedent might be .  mr .  martin  you have my sympathy  but i cannot tell you to hope .  indeed        she sat back and her forehead wrinkled .     indeed  if the issue grows too heated  there might well arise a certain sentiment  both inside the legislature and out side  for that dismantling you mentioned .  doing away with you could turn out to be the easiest way of resolving the dilemma .  consider that before deciding to push matters .       andrew stood firm .     will no one remember the technique of prosthetology  something that is almost entirely mine .          it may seem cruel  but they won   t .  or if they do  it will be remembered against you .  people will say you did it only for yourself .  it will be said it was part of a campaign to roboticize human beings  or to humanify robots  and in either case evil and vicious .  you have never been part of a political hate campaign  mr .  martin  but i tell you that you would be the object of vilification of a kind neither you nor i would credit  and there would be people to believe it all .  mr .  martin  let your life be .       she rose  and next to andrew   s seated figure she seemed small and almost childlike .       if i decide to fight for my humanity  will you be on my side .       she thought  then replied     i will be   insofar as i can be .  if at any time such a stand would appear to threaten my political future  i might have to abandon you  since it is not an issue i feel to be at the very root of my beliefs .  i am trying to be honest with you .          thank you  and i will ask no more .  i intend to fight this through  whatever the consequences  and i will ask you for your help only for as long as you can give it .           .      it was not a direct fight .  feingold and martin counseled patience and andrew muttered  grimly  that he had an endless supply of that .  feingold and martin then entered on a campaign to narrow and restrict the area of combat .    they instituted a lawsuit denying the obligation to pay debts to an individual with a prosthetic heart on the grounds that the possession of a robotic organ removed humanity  and with it the constitutional rights of human beings .  they fought the matter skillfully and tenaciously  losing at every step but always in such a way that the decision was forced to be as broad as possible  and then carrying it by way of appeals to the world court .    it took years  and millions of dollars .    when the final decision was handed down  delong held what amounted to a victory celebration over the legal loss .  andrew was  of course  present in the company offices on the occasion .       we   ve done two things  andrew     said delong     both of which are good .  first of all  we have established the fact that no number of artificial parts in the human body causes it to cease being a human body .  secondly  we have engaged public opinion in the question in such a way as to put it fiercely on the side of a broad interpretation of humanity  since there is not a human being in existence who does not hope for prosthetics if they will keep him alive .          and do you think the legislature will now grant me my humanity .     andrew asked .    delong looked faintly uncomfortable .     as to that  i cannot be optimistic .  there remains the one organ which the world court has used as the criterion of humanity .  human beings have an organic cellular brain and robots have a platinum iridium positronic brain if they have one at all   and you certainly have a positronic brain .  no  andrew  don   t get that look in your eye .  we lack the knowledge to duplicate the work of a cellular brain in artificial structures close enough to the organic type as to allow it to fall within the court   s decision .  not even you could do it .          what should we do  then .          make the attempt  of course .  congresswoman li hsing will be on our side and a growing number of other congress people .  the president will undoubtedly go along with a majority of the legislature in this matter .          do we have a majority .          no .  far from it .  but we might get one if the public will allow its desire for a broad interpretation of humanity to extend to you .  a small chance  i admit  but if you do not wish to give up  we must gamble for it .          i do not wish to give up .           .      congresswoman li hsing was considerably older than she had been when andrew had first met her .  her transparent garments were long gone .  her hair was now close cropped and her coverings were tubular .  yet still andrew clung  as closely as he could within the limits of reasonable taste  to the style of clothing that had prevailed when he had first adopted clothing more than a century before .       we   ve gone as far as we can  andrew     li hsing admitted .     we   ll try once more after recess  but  to be honest  defeat is certain and then the whole thing will have to be given up .  all my most recent efforts have only earned me certain defeat in the coming congressional campaign .          i know     said andrew     and it distressed me .  you said once you would abandon me if it came to that .  why have you not done so .          one can change one   s mind  you know .  somehow  abandoning you became a higher price than i cared to pay for just one more term .  as it is  i   ve been in the legislature   for over a quarter of a century .  it   s enough .          is there no way we can change minds  chee .          we   ve changed all that are amenable to reason .  the rest   the majority   cannot be moved from their emotional antipathies .          emotional antipathy is not a valid reason for voting one way or the other .          i know that  andrew  but they don   t advance emotional antipathy as their reason .          it all comes down to the brain  then     andrew said cautiously .     but must we leave it at the level of cells versus positrons .  is there no way of forcing a functional definition .  must we say that a brain is made of this or that .  may we not say that a brain is something   anything   capable of a certain level of thought .          won   t work     said li hsing .     your brain is manmade  the human brain is not .  your brain is constructed  theirs developed .  to any human being who is intent on keeping up the barrier between himself and a robot  those differences are a steel wall a mile high and a mile thick .          if we could get at the source of their antipathy  the very source           after all your years     li hsing said  sadly     you are still trying to reason out the human being .  poor andrew  don   t be angry  but it   s the robot in you that drives you in that direction .          i don   t know     said andrew .     if i could bring myself           .   reprise      if he could bring himself     he had known for a long time it might come to that  and in the end he was at the surgeon   s .  he had found one  skillful enough for the job at hand   which meant a surgeon   robot  for no human surgeon could be trusted in this connection  either in ability or in intention .    the surgeon could not have performed the operation on a human being  so andrew  after putting off the moment of decision with a sad line of questioning that reflected the turmoil within himself  had put first law to one side by saying    i  too  am a robot .       he then said  as firmly as he had learned to form the words even at human beings over these past decades     i order you to carry through the operation on me .       in the absence of the first law  an order so firmly given from one who looked so much like a man activated the second law sufficiently to carry the day .        .      andrew   s feeling of weakness was  he was sure  quite imaginary .  he had recovered from the   operation .  nevertheless  he leaned  as unobtrusively as he could manage  against the wall .  it would be entirely too revealing to sit .    li hsing said     the final vote will come this week  andrew .  i   ve been able to delay it no longer  and we must lose .  and that will be it  andrew .          i am grateful for your skill at delay .  it gave me the time i needed  and i took the gamble i had to .          what gamble is this .     li hsing asked with open concern .       i couldn   t tell you  or even the people at feingold and martin .  i was sure i would be stopped .  see here  if it is the brain that is at issue  isn   t the greatest difference of all the matter of immortality .  who really cares what a brain looks like or is built of or how it was formed .  what matters is that human brain cells die  must die .  even if every other organ in the body is maintained or replaced  the brain cells  which cannot be replaced without changing and therefore killing the personality  must eventually die .       my own positronic pathways have lasted nearly two centuries without perceptible change  and can last for centuries more .  isn   t that the fundamental barrier .  human beings can tolerate an immortal robot  for it doesn   t matter how long a machine lasts  but they cannot tolerate an immortal human being since their own mortality is endurable only so long as it is universal .  and for that reason they won   t make me a human being .          what is it you   re leading up to  andrew .     li hsing asked .       i have removed that problem .  decades ago  my positronic brain was connected to organic nerves .  now  one last operation has arranged that connection in such a way that slowly   quite slowly   the potential is being drained from my pathways .       li hsing   s finely wrinkled face showed no expression for a moment .  then her lips tightened .     do you mean you   ve arranged to die  andrew .  you can   t have .  that violates the third law .          no     said andrew     i have chosen between the death of my body and the death of my aspirations and desires .  to have let my body live at the cost of the greater death is what would have violated the third law .       li hsing seized his arm as though she were about to shake him .  she stopped herself .     andrew  it won   t work .  change it back .          it can   t be done .  too much damage was done .  i have a year to live more or less .  i will last through the two hundredth anniversary of my construction .  i was weak enough to arrange that .          how can it be worth it .  andrew  you   re a fool .          if it brings me humanity  that will be worth it .  if it doesn   t  it will bring an end to striving and that will be worth it  too .       then li hsing did something that astonished herself .  quietly  she began to weep .        .      it was odd how that last deed caught the imagination of the world .  all that andrew had done before had not swayed them .  but he had finally accepted even death to be human  and the sacrifice was too great to be rejected .    the final ceremony was timed  quite deliberately  for the two hundredth anniversary .  the world president was to sign the act and make the people   s will law .  the ceremony would be visible on a global network and would be beamed to the lunar state and even to the martian colony .    andrew was in a wheelchair .  he could still walk  but only shakily .    with mankind watching  the world president said     fifty years ago  you were declared the sesquicentennial robot  andrew .     after a pause  and in a more solemn tone  he continued     today we declare you the bicentennial man  mr .  martin .       and andrew  smiling  held out his hand to shake that of the president .        .      andrew   s thoughts were slowly fading as he lay in bed .  desperately he seized at them .  man .  he was a man .    he wanted that to be his last thought .  he wanted to dissolve   die with that .    he opened his eyes one more time and for one last time recognized li hsing  waiting solemnly .  others were there  but they were only shadows  unrecognizable shadows .  only li hsing stood out against the deepening gray .    slowly  inchingly  he held out his hand to her and very dimly and faintly felt her take it .    she was fading in his eyes as the last of his thoughts trickled away .  but before she faded completely  one final fugitive thought came to him and rested for a moment on his mind before everything stopped .       little miss     he whispered  too low to be heard .   in the old days  one wrote science fiction for science fiction magazines .  in fact  john campbell once jokingly defined that indefinable field as follows     science fiction is what science fiction editors buy .       nowadays  however  all sorts of editors buy it  and i am prepared to receive requests from the unlikeliest sources .  for instance  in the summer of       i received a request from a magazine named high fidelity to do a science fiction story that was       words long  that was set about twenty five years in the future  and that dealt with some aspect of sound recording .    i was intrigued by the narrowness of the boundary conditions  since that made it quite a challenge .  of course  i explained to the editor that i knew nothing about music or about sound recording  but that was pushed impatiently to one side as irrelevant .  i started the story on september           and when i was through the editor liked it .  he suggested some changes that would remove a bit of the aura of musical illiteracy on my part and then it appeared in the april      issue of the magazine .       marching in      jerome bishop  composer and trombonist  had never been in a mental hospital before .    there had been times when he had suspected he might be in one  someday  as a patient  who was safe .    but it had never occurred to him that he might ever be there as a consultant on a question of mental aberration .  a consultant .    he sat there  in the year       with the world in pretty terrible shape  but  they said  pulling out of it  and then rose as a middle aged women entered .  her hair was beginning to turn gray  and bishop was thankfully conscious of his own hair still in full shock and evenly dark .       are you mr .  bishop .     she asked .       last time i looked .       she held out her hand .     i   m dr .  cray .  won   t you come with me .       he shook her hand  then followed .  he tried not to be haunted by the dull beige uniforms worn by everyone he passed .    dr .  cray put a finger to her lip  and motioned him into a chair .  she pressed a button and the lights went out  causing a window  with a light behind it  to spring into view .  through the window  bishop could see a woman in something that looked like a dentist   s chair  tilted back .  a forest of flexible wires sprang from her head  a thin narrow beam of light extended from pole to pole behind her  and a somewhat less narrow strip of paper unfolded upward .    the light went on again  the view vanished .    dr .  cray said     do you know what we   re doing in there .          you   re recording brain waves .  just a guess .          a good guess .  we are .  it   s a laser recording .  do you know how that works .          my stuff   s been recorded by laser     said bishop  crossing one leg over the other     but that doesn   t mean i know how it works .  it   s the engineers who know the details .   .  .  . look  doc  if you have an idea i   m a laser engineer  i   m not .          no  i know you   re not     said dr .  cray hurriedly .     you   re here for something else .   .  .  . let me explain it to you .  we can alter a laser beam very delicately  much more rapidly and much more precisely than we can alter an electric current  or even a beam of electrons .  that means that a very complex wave can be recorded in far greater detail than has ever been imagined before .  we can make a tracing with a microscopically narrow laser beam and get a wave we can study under a microscope and get accurate detail invisible to the naked eye and unobtainable in any other fashion .       bishop said    . it that   s what you want to consult me about  then all i can say is that it doesn   t pay to get all that detail .  you can only hear so much .  it you sharpen a laser recording past a certain amount  you bring up the expense but you don   t bring up the effect .  in fact  some people say you get some kind of buzz that begins to drown out the music .  i don   t hear it myself  but i tell you that if you want the best  you don   t narrow the laser beam all the way .   .  .  . of course  maybe it   s different with brain waves but what i told you is an i can tell you  so i   ll go and there   s no charge except for carfare .       he made as though to get up  but dr .  cray was shaking her head vigorously .       please sit down  mr .  bishop .  recording brain waves is different .  there we do need all the detail we can get .  till now  all we   ve ever had out of brain waves are the tiny  overlapping effects of ten billion brain cells  a kind of rough average that wipes out everything but the most general effects .          you mean like listening to ten billion pianos all playing different tunes a hundred miles away .          exactly .          all you get is noise .          not quite .  we do get some information about epilepsy  for instance .  with laser recording  however  we begin to get the fine detail  we begin to hear the individual tunes those separate pianos are playing  we begin to hear which particular pianos may be out of tune .       bishop lifted his eyebrows .     so you can tell what makes a particular crazy person crazy .          in a way of speaking .  look at this .     in another corner of the room a screen flashed to life  with a thin wavering line over it .     do you see this  mr .  bishop .     dr .  cray pressed the button of an indicator in her hand and one little blip in the line reddened .  the line moved along past the lighted screen and red blips appeared periodically .       that   s a microphotograph     said dr .  cray .     those little red discontinuities are not visible to the unaided eye and wouldn   t be visible with any recording device less delicate than the laser .  it appears only when this particular patient is in depression .  the markings are more pronounced  the deeper the depression .       bishop thought about it for a while .  then he said     can you do anything about it .  so far  it just means you can tell by that blip there   s a depression  which you can tell by just listening to the patient .          quite right  but the details help .  for instance  we can convert the brain waves into delicately flickering light waves and  what   s more  into the equivalent sound waves .  we use the same laser system that is used to record your music .  we get a sort of dimly musical hum that matches the light flicker .  i would like you to listen to it by earphone .          the music from that particular depressive person whose brain produced that line .          yes  and since we can   t intensify it much without losing detail  we will ask you to listen by earphone .          and watch the light  too .          that   s not necessary .  you can close your eyes .  enough of the flicker will penetrate the eyelids to affect the brain .       bishop closed his eyes .  through the hum  he could hear the tiny wail of a complex beat  a complex  sad beat that carried all the troubles of the tired old world in it .  he listened  vaguely conscious of the dim light beating on his eyeballs in flickering time .    he felt his shirt pulled at strenuously .     mr .  bishop  mr .  bishop        he took a deep breath .   .    thanks .     he said  shuddering a little .     that upset me  but i couldn   t let go .          you were listening to brain wave depression and it was affecting you .  it was forcing your own brain wave pattern to keep time .  you felt depressed  didn   t you .          all the way .          well  if we can locate the portion of the wave characteristic of depression  or of any mental abnormality  remove that  and play all the rest of the brain wave  the patient   s pattern will be modified into normal form .          for how long .          for a while after the treatment is stopped .  for a while  but not long .  a few days .  a week .  then the patient has to return .          that   s better than nothing .          and less than enough .  a person is born with certain genes  mr .  bishop  that dictate a certain potential brain structure .  a person suffers certain environmental influences .  these are not easy things to neutralize  so here in this institution we   ve been trying to find more efficient and long lasting schemes for neutralization .   .  .  . and you can help us  perhaps .  that   s why we   ve asked you to come here .          but i don   t know anything about this  doc .  i never heard about recording brain waves by laser .     he pushed his hands apart  palms down .     i   ve got nothing for you .       dr .  cray looked impatient .  she pushed her hands deep into the pockets of her jacket and said     just a while ago  you said that the laser recorded more detail than the ear could hear .          yes .  i stand by that .          i know .  one of my colleagues read an interview with you in the december      issue of high fidelity magazine  in which you said that .  that   s what attracted our attention .  the ear can   t get the laser detail  but the eye can  you see .  it   s the flickering light that alters the brain pattern to the norm  not the wavering sound .  the sound alone will do nothing .  it will  however  reinforce the effect when the light is working .          you can   t complain about that .          we can .  the reinforcement isn   t good enough .  the gentle  delicate  almost infinitely complex variations produced in the sound by laser recording is lost on the ear .  too much is present and it drowns out the portion that is reinforcing .          what makes you think that a reinforcing portion is there .          because occasionally  more or less by accident  we can produce something that seems to work better than the entire brain wave  but we don   t see why .  we need a musician .  maybe you .  if you listen to both sets of brain waves  perhaps you can figure out by some insight a beat that will fit the normal set better than the abnormal one .  then that could reinforce the light  you see  and improve the effectiveness of the therapy .          hey     said bishop in alarm     that   s putting a lot of responsibility on me .  when i write music  i   m just caressing the ear and making the muscles jump .  i   m not trying to cure an ailing brain .          all we ask is that you caress the ears and make the muscles jump  but do it so that it fits the normal music of the brain waves .   .  .  . and i assure you that you need fear no responsibility  mr .  bishop .  it is quite unlikely that your music would do harm  and it might do so much good .  and you   ll be paid  mr .  bishop  win or lose .       bishop said     well  i   ll try  though i don   t promise a thing .       he was back in two days .  dr .  cray was pulled out of conference to see him .  she looked at him out of tired  narrowed eyes .       do you have something .          i have something .  it may work .           how do you know .          i don   t .  i just have the feel of it .   .  .  . look  i listened to the laser tapes you gave me  the brain wave music as it came from the patient in depression and the brain wave music as you   ve modified it to normal .  and you   re right  without the flickering light it didn   t affect me either way .  anyway  i subtracted the second from the first to see what the difference was .          you have a computer .     dr .  cray said  wondering .       no  a computer wouldn   t have helped .  it would give me too much .  you take one complicated laser wave pattern and subtract another complicated laser wave pattern and you   re left with what is still a pretty complicated laser wave pattern .  no  i subtracted it in my mind to see what kind of beat was left .   .  .  . that would be the abnormal beat that i would have to cancel out with a counter beat .          how can you subtract in your head .       bishop looked impatient .     i don   t know .  how did beethoven hear the ninth symphony in his head before he wrote it down .  the brain   s a pretty good computer  too  isn   t it .          i guess it is .     she subsided .     do you have the counterbeat there .          i think so .  i have it here on an ordinary tape recording because it doesn   t need anything more .  it goes something like  dihdihdihdah  dihdihdihdah  dihdihdihdahdahdahdihdah  and so on .  i added a tune to it and you can put it through the earphones while she   s watching the flickering light that   s matched to the normal brain wave pattern .  if i   m right  it will reinforce the living daylights out of it .          are you sure .          if i were sure  you wouldn   t have to try it  would you  doc .       dr .  cray was thoughtful for  a moment .     i   ll make an appointment with the patient .  i   d like you to be here .          if you want me .  it   s part of the consultation job  i suppose .          you won   t be able to be in the treatment room  you understand  but i   d want you out here .          anything you say .       the patient looked careworn when she arrived .  her eyelids drooped and her voice was low and she mumbled .    bishop   s glance was casual as he sat quietly  unnoticed  in the corner .  he saw her enter the treatment room and waited patiently  thinking  what if it works .  why not package brainwave lights with appropriate sound accompaniment to combat the blues to increase energy to heighten love .  not just for sick people but for normal people  who could find a substitute for all the pounding they   d ever taken with alcohol or drugs in an effort to adjust their emotions an utterly safe substitute based on the brain waves themselves .   .  .  . and finally  after forty five minutes  she came out .    she was placid now  and the lines had somehow washed out of her face .       i feel better  dr .  cray     she said  smiling .     i feel much better .          you usually do     said dr .  cray quietly .       not this way     said the woman .     not this way .  this time it   s different .  the other times  even when i thought i felt good  i could sense that awful depression in the back of my head just waiting to come back the minute i relaxed .  now  it   s just gone .       dr .  cray said     we can   t be sure it will always be gone .  we   ll make an appointment for  say  two weeks from now but you   ll call me before then if anything goes wrong  won   t you .  did anything seem different in the treatment .       the woman thought a bit .     no     she said hesitantly .  then     the flickering light  though .  that might have been different .  clearer and sharper somehow .          did you hear anything .          was i supposed to .       dr .  cray rose .     very well .  remember to make that appointment with my secretary .       the woman stopped at the door  turned  and said     it   s a happy feeling to feel happy     and left .    dr .  cray said     she didn   t hear anything  mr .  bishop .  i suppose that your counter beat reinforced the normal brainwave pattern so naturally that the sound was  so to speak  lost in the light .   .  .  . and it may have worked  too .       she turned to bishop  looking him full in the face .     mr .  bishop  will you consult with us on other cases .  we   ll pay you as much as we can  and if this turns out to be an effective therapy for mental disease  we   ll see that you get all the credit due you .       bishop said     i   ll be glad to help out  doctor  but it won   t be as hard as you may think .  the work is already done .          already done .          we   ve had musicians for centuries .  maybe they didn   t know about brain waves  but they did their best to get the melodies and beats that would affect people  get their toes tapping  get their muscles twitching  get their faces smiling  get their tear ducts pumping  get their hearts pounding .  those tunes are waiting .  once you get the counter beat  you pick the tune to fit .          is that what you did .          sure .  what can snap you out of depression like a revival hymn .  it   s what they   re meant to do .  the beat gets you out of yourself .  it exalts you .  maybe it doesn   t last long by itself  but if you use it to reinforce the normal brain wave pattern  it ought to pound it in .          a revival hymn .     dr .  cray stared at him  wide eyed .       sure .  what i used in this case was the best of them all .  i gave her    when the saints go marching in .           he sang it softly  finger snapping the beat  and by the third bar  dr .  cray   s toes were tapping .   this next one was requested by bell telephone magazine over an excellent lunch .  what they wanted was a       word story centering on a problem in communications .  there were two broad requirements  first  that it be farther out than any of the methods of communication now under development by bell telephone  and  second  that i not postulate an end to the requirements for communications corporations .    as it happened  kim armstrong  the editor of the magazine  who was at the lunch  was an extraordinarily charming woman  but i would have agreed to tackle the story anyway  because before the lunch was over i had a plot outline safely tucked away in my head .   people ask me sometimes if i keep a notebook on me at all times to jot down ideas .  i do  but it   s inside my head  and therefore never gets mislaid .   i got to work on it on october          .  ms .  armstrong liked it when it was done  and it appeared in the february      issue of the magazine .       old fashioned      ben estes knew he was going to die and it didn   t make him feel any better to know that that was the chance he had lived with all these years .  the life of an astro miner  drifting through the still largely uncharted vastness of the asteroid belt  was not particularly sweet  but it was quite likely to be short .    of course  there was always the chance of a surprise find  . that would make you rich for life  and this had been a surprise find all right .  the biggest surprise in the world  but it wasn   t going to make estes rich .  it would make him dead .    harvey funarelli groaned softly from his bunk  and estes turned  with a wince of his own as his muscles creaked .  they had been badly mishandled .  that he wasn   t hit as viciously as funarelli had been was surely because funarelli was the larger man  and had been closer to the point of near impact .    estes looked somberly at his partner and said     how do you feel  harv .       funarelli groaned again .     i feel broken at every joint .  what the hell happened .  what did we hit .       estes walked over  limping slightly  and said     don   t try to stand up .          i can make it     said funarelli     if you   ll just reach out a hand .  wow .  i wonder if i   ve got a broken rib .  right here .  what happened  ben .       estes pointed at the main portview .  it wasn   t a large one  but it was the best a two man astro mining vessel could be expected to have .  funarelli moved toward it very slowly  leaning on estes    shoulder .  he looked out .    there were the stars  of course  but the experienced astronautic mind blanks those out .  there are always the stars .  closer in  there was a gravel bank of boulders of varying size  all moving slowly relative to their neighbors like a swarm of very  very lazy bees .    funarelli said     i   ve never seen anything like that before .  what are they doing here .          those rocks     said estes     are what   s left of a shattered asteroid  i suspect  and they   re still circling what shattered them  and what shattered us .          what .     funarelli peered vainly into the darkness .    estes pointed .     that .     there was a faint little sparkle in the direction he was pointing .       i don   t see anything .          you   re not supposed to .  that   s a black hole .     funarelli   s close cropped black hair stood on end as a matter of course  and his staring dark eyes added a touch of horror .  he said     you   re crazy .          no .  black holes can come in all sizes .  that   s what the astronomers say .  that one is about the mass of a large asteroid  i think  and we   re moving around it .  how else could something we can   t see be holding us ill orbit .          there   s no report on any           i know .  how can there be .  it can   t be seen .  it   s massooops  there comes the sun .     the slowly rotating ship had brought the sun into view and the portview automatically polarized into opacity .     anyway     said estes     we discovered the first black hole actually to be encountered anywhere in the universe .  only we won   t live to see ourselves get the credit .       funarelli said     what happened .          we got close enough for the tidal effects to smash us up .          what tidal effects .       estes said     i   m not an astronomer  but as i understand it  even when the total gravitational pull of a thing like that isn   t large  you can get so close to it that the pull becomes intense .  that intensity falls off so rapidly with increasing distance that the near end of an object is pulled far more strongly than the far end .  the object is therefore stretched .  the closer and bigger an object is  the worse the effect .  your muscles were torn .  you   re lucky your bones weren   t broken .       funarelli grimaced .     i   m not sure they aren   t .   .  .  . what else happened .          the fuel tanks were destroyed .  we   re stuck here in orbit .   .  .  . it   s just lucky we happened to end in one far enough away and circular enough to keep the tidal effect down .  if we were closer  or if we even zoomed in closely at one end of the orbit           can we get word out .          not a word     said estes .     communications are smashed .          you can   t fix it .          i   m not really a communications expert  but even if i were  it can   t be fixed .          can   t something be jury rigged .       estes shook his head .     we   ve just got to wait and die .  that   s not what bothers me so much .          it bothers me     said funarelli  sitting down on his bunk and placing his head in his hands .       we   ve got the pills     said estes .     it would be an easy death .  what   s really bad is that we can   t get word back about   that .     he pointed to the portview  which was clear again as the sun moved out of range .       about the black hole .          yes  it   s dangerous .  it seems to be in orbit about the sun  but who knows whether that orbit is stable .  and even if it is  it   s bound to get larger .          i guess it will swallow stuff .          sure .  everything it encounters .  there   s cosmic dust spiraling into it all the time  and giving off energy as it spirals and drops in .  that   s what makes those dim sparkles of light .  every once in a while  the hole will swallow up a large piece that gets in the way and there   ll be a flash of radiation  right down to x rays .  the larger it gets  the easier it is for it to drag in material from a greater and greater distance .       for a moment  both men stared at the portview  then estes went on .     right now it can be handled maybe .  if nasa can maneuver a fairly large asteroid here and send it past the hole in the proper way  the hole will be pulled out of its orbit by mutual gravitational attraction between itself and the asteroid .  the hole can be made to curve itself into a path that could head it out of the solar system  with some further help and acceleration .       funarelli said     do you suppose it started very small .          it could have been a micro hole formed at the time of the big bang  when the universe was created .  it may have been growing for billions of years and if it continues to grow  it may become unmanageable .  it will then eventually become the grave of the solar system .          why haven   t they found it .          no one   s been looking .  who would expect a black bole in the asteroid belt .  and it doesn   t produce enough radiation to be noticeable  or enough mass to be noticeable .  you have to run into it  as we did .          are you sure we have no communications at all  ben .   .  .  . how far to vesta .  they could reach us from vesta without much delay .  it   s the largest base in the asteroid belt .       estes shook his head .     i don   t know where vesta is right now .  the computer   s knocked out  too .          god .  what isn   t knocked out .          the air system is working .  the water purifier is on .  we   ve got plenty of power and food .  we can last two weeks  maybe more .       a silence fell .     look     said funarelli after a while .     even if we don   t know where vesta is exactly  we know it can   t be more than a few million kilometers away .  if we could reach them with some signal  they could get a drone ship out here within a week .          a drone ship  yes     said estes .  that was easy .  an unmanned ship could be accelerated to levels that human flesh and blood would not endure .  it could make trips in a third the time a manned vessel could .    funarelli closed his eyes  as though blocking out the pain  and said     don   t sneer at a drone ship .  it could bring us emergency supplies  and it would have stuff on board we could use to set up a communications system .  we could hold out till the real rescuers came .       estes sat down on the other bunk .     i wasn   t sneering at a drone ship .  i was just thinking that there   s no way to send a signal  no way at all .  we can   t even yell .  the vacuum of space won   t carry sound .        funarelli said stubbornly     i can   t believe you can   t think of something .  our lives depend on it .           the lives of all mankind depend on it  maybe  but i still can   t think of anything .  why don   t you think of something .       funarelli grunted as he moved his hips .  he seized the hand grips on the wall next to his bunk and pulled himself up to a standing position .     i can think of one thing     he said     why don   t you turn off the gravity motors and save the power and put less strain on our muscles .       estes muttered     good idea .     he rose and moved to the control board  where he cut the gravity .    funarelli floated upward with a sigh and said     why can   t they find the black hole  the idiots .          you mean like we did .  there   s no other way .  it   s not doing enough .       funarelli said     i still hurt  even with no gravity to fight   oh well  if it keeps on hurting like this  it won   t matter so much when it comes to pill taking time .   .  .  . is there any way we can make that black hole do more than it   s doing .       estes said grimly     if one of those bits of gravel should take it into its head to drop into the hole  a burst of x rays would shoot out .          would they detect that on vesta .       estes shook his head .     i doubt it .  they   re not looking for such a thing .  they   d be sure to detect it on earth  though .  some of the space stations keep the sky under constant surveillance for radiation changes .  they   d pick up astonishingly small bursts .          all right  ben  reaching earth would be just as well .  they   d send a message to vesta to investigate .  it would take the x rays about fifteen minutes to get to earth and then it would take fifteen minutes for radio waves to get to vesta .           and how about the time between .  the receivers may automatically record a burst of x rays from such and such a direction  but who   s to say where it   s from .  it could be from a distant galaxy that happens to lie in this particular direction .  some technician will notice the bump in the recording and will watch for more bursts in the same place and there won   t be any and it will be crossed off as unimportant .  besides  it won   t happen  harv .  there must have been lots of x rays when the black hole broke up this asteroid with its tidal effect  but that may have been thousands of years ago when no one was watching .  now what   s left of these fragments must have fairly stable orbits .          if we had our rockets           let me guess .  we could drive our ship into the black hole .  use our deaths to send a message .  that wouldn   t do any good either .  it would still be one pulse from anywhere .       funarelli said indignantly     i wasn   t thinking of that .  i   m not in the market for heroic death .  i meant  we   ve got three engines .  if we could rig them on to three pretty large size rocks and send each one into the hole  there would be three bursts of x rays and if we did them a day apart  the source would move detectably against the stars .  that would be interesting  wouldn   t it .  the technicians would pick that up at once  wouldn   t they .          maybe  and maybe not .  besides  we don   t have any rocketry left and couldn   t put them on the rocks if we      estes fell silent .  then he said in an altered voice     i wonder if our space suits are intact .          our suit radios     said funarelli excitedly .       hell  they don   t reach out more than a few kilometers     said estes .     i   m thinking of something else .  i   m thinking of going out there .     he opened the suit locker .     they seem all right .          why do you want to go out .          we may not have any rockets  but we still have muscle power .  at least i have .  do you think you can throw a rock .       funarelli made a throwing gesture  or the beginning of one  and a look of agony came over his face .     can i jump to the sun .     he said .       i   ll go out and throw some .   .  .  . the suit seems to check out .  maybe i can throw some into the hole .   .  .  . i hope the air lock operates .          can we spare the air .     said funarelli anxiously .       will it matter in two weeks .     said estes wearily .    every astro miner has to get outside the ship occasionally   to carry out some repair  to bring in some chunk of matter in the vicinity .  ordinarily  it   s an exciting time .  in any case  it   s a change .    estes felt little excitement  only a vast anxiety .  his notion was so damned primitive  he felt foolish to have it .  it was bad enough dying without having to die a damn fool .    he found himself in the black of space  with the glittering stars he had seen a hundred times before .  now  though  in the faint reflection of the small and distant sun  there was the dim glow of hundreds of bits of rock that must once have been part of an asteroid and that now formed a tiny saturn   s ring about a black hole .  the rocks seemed almost motionless  as all drifted along with the ship .    estes judged the direction of wheel of the stars and knew that ship and rocks were moving slowly in the other direction .  if he could throw a rock in the direction of the star motion  he would neutralize some of the rock   s velocity relative to the black hole .  if he neutralized not enough of the velocity  or too much  the rock would drop toward the hole  skim about it  and come back to the point it had left .  if he neutralized just enough  it would come close enough to be powdered by the tidal effect .  the grains of powder  in their motions  would slow each other and spiral into the hole  releasing x rays as they did so .    estes used his miner   s net of tantalum steel to gather rocks  choosing them fist size .  he was thankful that modern suits allowed complete freedom of motion and were not the virtual coffins they had been when the first astronauts  over a century ago  had reached the moon .    once he had enough rocks  he threw one  and he could see it glimmer and fade in the sunlight as it dropped toward the hole .  he waited and nothing happened .  he didn   t know how long it might take to fall into the black hole if it fell in at all  that is  but he counted six hundred to himself and threw again .    over and over he did so  with a terrible patience born of searching for an alternative to death  and finally there was a sudden blaze in the direction of the black hole .  visible light and  he knew  a burst of higher energy radiation as far as x rays at least .    he had to stop to gather more rocks  and then he got the range .  he was hitting it almost every time .  he oriented himself so that the soft glimmer of the black hole would be seen just above the midportion of the ship .  that was one relationship that didn   t change as the ship circled and rolled on an axis  or changed least .    even allowing for his care  however  it seemed to him he was making too many strikes .  the black hole  he thought  was more massive than he knew and would swallow up its prey from a larger distance .  that made it more dangerous  but increased their chance of rescue .    he worked his way through the lock and back into the ship .  he was bone weary and his right shoulder hurt him .    funarelli helped him off with the suit .     that was terrific .  you were throwing rocks into the black hole .       estes nodded .     yes  and i   m hoping my suit has been stopping the x rays .  i   d just as soon not die of radiation poisoning .          they   ll see this back on earth  won   t they .          i   m sure they will     said estes     but will they pay attention .  they   ll record it all and wonder about it .  but what   s going to make them come out here for a closer look .  i   ve got to work out something that will make them come  after i have just a little time to rest .       an hour later  he lifted out another space suit .  no time to wait for the recharge of the solar batteries in the first one .  he said     i hope i haven   t lost the range .       he was out again  and it had become clear that even allowing a fairly wide spread of velocities and direction  the black hole would suck up the slowing rocks as they moved inward .    estes gathered as many rocks as he could manage and placed them carefully on an indentation in the hull of the ship .  they didn   t stay there  but they drifted only exceedingly slowly  and even after estes had collected all he could  those he had placed there first had spread out no more than billiard balls on a pool table .    then he threw them  at first tensely  and then with growing confidence  and the black hole flashed  and flashed  and flashed .    it seemed to him that the target became steadily easier to hit and that the black hole was growing madly with each impact and that soon it would reach out and suck him and the ship into its never sated maw .    it was his imagination  of course  and nothing more .  finally all the rocks were gone and he felt he could throw nothing more in any case .  he had been out there  it seemed  for hours .    when he was within the ship again he said  as soon as funarelli had helped him off with his helmet     that   s it .  i can   t do anything more .          you had plenty of flashes there     said funarelli .       plenty  and they should surely be recorded .  we   ll just have to wait now .  they   ve got to come .       funarelli helped him off with the rest of his suit as best his muscle torn body would allow .  then he stood  grunting and gasping  and said     do you really think they   ll come  ben .          i think they   ve got to     said estes  almost as though he were trying to force the event by the sheer power of wishing .     i think they   ve got to .          why do you think they   ve got to .     said funarelli  sounding like a man who wanted to grasp at straws but didn   t dare .       because i communicated     said estes .     we   re not only the first people to encounter a black hole  we   re the first to use it to communicate  we   re the first to use the ultimate communication system of the future  the one that might send messages from star to star and galaxy to galaxy  and that might be the ultimate energy source as well      he was panting  and he sounded a little wild .       what are you talking about .     said funarelli .       i threw those rocks in rhythm  harv     said estes     and the x ray bursts came in rhythm .  it was flash flash flash  flash  flash  flash  flash flash flash  and so on .          yes .          it   s old fashioned  old fashioned  but that   s one thing everyone remembers from the days when people communicated by electric currents running through wires .          you mean the photograph  phonograph           the telegraph  harv .  those flashes i produced will be recorded and the first time someone looks at that record  all hell will break loose .  it   s not just that they   ll be spotting an x ray source  it   s not just that it will be an x ray source moving very slowly against the stars so that it has to be within our solar system .  what it is  is that they   ll be seeing an x ray source going on and off and producing the signal sos  sos  and when an x ray source is shouting for help  you   ll bet they   ll come  as fast as they can  if only to see  what   s  there  that        he was asleep .      and five days later  a drone ship arrived .   incidentally  it may occur to some of my gentle readers that there is a certain similarity between the story and my very first published story  marooned off vesta  which appeared in print thirty seven years earlier .  in each story  two men are trapped on a spaceship wrecked in the asteroid belt and must use their ingenuity to devise a way of escaping what looked like certain death .    of course  the resolutions are completely different  and it was in my mind to demonstrate some of the changes in our outlook on the universe that took place in those thirty seven years by producing in      a resolution that would have been inconceivable in      .   in the fall of       fred dannay  better known as ellery queen  approached me with a very intriguing idea for the august      issue of ellery queen   s mystery magazine  which would be on the stands at the time of the bicentennial .  he planned to publish a mystery dealing with the bicentennial itself  and another dealing with the centennial in      .  what he needed now was one for the tricentennial in      and  of course  that meant a science fiction story .    since i have been writing numerous mystery stories for the magazine in recent years  he thought of me and proposed that i tackle the job .  i agreed and got to work on november         .  i ended with uncompromising science fiction which i feared might make a little heavy going for mystery readers .  fred thought otherwise  apparently  for he took the story and was even kind enough to pay me a bonus .       the tercentenary incident      july          and for the third time the accident of the conventional system of numeration  based on powers of ten  had brought the last two digits of the year back to the fateful    that had seen the birth of the nation .    it was no longer a nation in the old sense  it was rather a geographic expression  part of a greater whole that made up the federation of all of humanity on earth  together with its offshoots on the moon and in the space colonies .  by culture and heritage  however  the name and the idea lived on  and that portion of the planet signified by the old name was still the most prosperous and advanced region of the world .  .  .  . and the president of the united states was still the most powerful single figure in the planetary council .    lawrence edwards watched the small figure of the president from his height of two hundred feet .  he drifted lazily above the crowd  his flotron motor making a barely heard chuckle on his back  and what he saw looked exactly like what anyone would see on a holovision scene .  how many times had he seen little figures like that in his living room  little figures in a cube of sunlight  looking as real as though they were living homunculi  except that you could put your hand through them .    you couldn   t put your hand through those spreading out in their tens of thousands over the open spaces surrounding the washington monument .  and you couldn   t put your hand through the president .  you could reach out to him instead  touch him  and shake his hand .    edwards thought sardonically of the uselessness of that added element of tangibility and wished himself a hundred miles away  floating in air over some isolated wilderness  instead of here where he had to watch for any sign of disorder .  there wouldn   t be any necessity for his being here but for the mythology of the value of    pressing the flesh .       edwards was not an admirer of the president  hugo allen winkler  fifty seventh of the line .    to edwards  president winkler seemed an empty man  a charmer  a vote grabber  a promiser .  he was a disappointing man to have in office now after all the hopes of those first months of his administration .  the world federation was in danger of breaking up long before its job had been completed and winkler could do nothing about it .  one needed a strong hand now  not a glad hand  a hard voice  not a honey voice .    there he was now  shaking hands  a space forced around him by the service  with edwards himself  plus a few others of the service  watching from above .    the president would be running for re election certainly  and there seemed a good chance he might be defeated .  that would just make things worse  since the opposition party was dedicated to the destruction of the federation .    edwards sighed .  it would be a miserable four years coming up  maybe a miserable forty  and all he could do was float in the air  ready to reach every service agent on the ground by laser phone if there was the slightest   he didn   t see the slightest .  there was no sign of disturbance .  just a little puff of white dust  hardly visible  just a momentary glitter in the sunlight  up and away  gone as soon as he was aware of it .    where was the president .  he had lost sight of him in the dust .  he looked about in the vicinity of where he had seen him last .  the president could not have moved far .    then he became aware of disturbance .  first it was among the service agents themselves  who seemed to have gone off their heads and to be moving this way and that jerkily .  then those among the crowd near them caught the contagion and then those farther off .  the noise rose and became a thunder .    edwards didn   t have to hear the words that made up the rising roar .  it seemed to carry the news to him by nothing more than its mass clamorous urgency .  president winkler had disappeared .  he had been there one moment and had turned into a handful of vanishing dust the next .    edwards held his breath in an agony of waiting during what seemed a drug ridden eternity  for the long moment of realization to end and for the mob to break into a mad  rioting stampede .      when a resonant voice sounded over the gathering din  and at its sound  the noise faded  died  and became a silence .  it was as though it were all a holovision program after all and someone had turned the sound down and out .    edwards thought  my god  it   s the president .  there was no mistaking the voice .  winkler stood on the guarded stage from which he was to give his tercentenary speech  and from which he had left but ten minutes ago to shake hands with some in the crowd .    how had he gotten back there .  edwards listened      nothing has happened to me  my fellow americans .  what you have seen just now was the breakdown of a mechanical device .  it was not your president  so let us not allow a mechanical failure to dampen the celebration of the happiest day the world has yet seen .  .  .  . my fellow americans  give me your attention        and what followed was the tercentenary speech  the greatest speech winkler had ever made  or edwards had ever heard .  edwards found himself forgetting his supervisory job in his eagerness to listen .    winkler had it right .  he understood the importance of the federation and he was getting it across .    deep inside  though  another part of him was remembering the persistent rumors that the new expertise in robotics had resulted in the construction of a look alike president  a robot who could perform the purely ceremonial functions  who could shake hands with the crowd  who could be neither bored nor exhausted  nor assassinated .    edwards thought  in obscure shock  that that was how it had happened .  there had been such a look alike robot indeed  and in a way  it had been assassinated .    october            edwards looked up as the waist high robot guide approached and said mellifluously     mr .  janek will see you now .       edwards stood up  feeling tall as he towered above the stubby  metallic guide .  he did not feel young  however .  his face had gathered lines in the last two years or so and he was aware of it .    he followed the guide into a surprisingly small room  where  behind a surprisingly small desk  there sat francis janek  a slightly paunchy and incongruously young looking man .    janek smiled and his eyes were friendly as he rose to shake hands .     mr .  edwards .       edwards muttered     i   m glad to have the opportunity  sir      edwards had never seen janek before  but then the job of personal secretary to the president is a quiet one and makes little news .    janek said     sit down .  sit down .  would you care for a soya stick .       edwards smiled a polite negative  and sat down .  janek was clearly emphasizing his youth .  his ruffied shirt was open and the hairs on his chest had been dyed a subdued but definite violet .    janek said     i know you have been trying to reach me for some weeks now .  i   m sorry for the delay .  i hope you understand that my time is not entirely my own .  however  we   re here now .  .  .  . i have referred to the chief of the service  by the way  and he gave you very high marks .  he regrets your resignation .       edwards said  eyes downcast     it seemed better to carry on my investigations without danger of embarrassment to the service .       janek   s smile flashed .     your activities  though discreet  have not gone unnoticed  however .  the chief explains that you have been investigating the tercentenary incident  and i must admit it was that which persuaded me to see you as soon as i could .  you   ve given up your position for that .  you   re investigating a dead issue .          how can it be a dead issue  mr .  janek .  your calling it an incident doesn   t alter the fact that it was an assassination attempt .          a matter of semantics .  why use a disturbing phrase .          only because it would seem to represent a disturbing truth .  surely you would say that someone tried to kill the president .       janek spread his hands .     if that is so  the plot did not succeed .  a mechanical device was destroyed .  nothing more .  in fact  if we look at it properly  the incident  whatever you choose to call it  did the nation and the world an enormous good .  as we all know  the president was shaken by the incident and the nation as well .  the president and all of us realized what a return to the violence of the last century might mean and it produced a great turnaround .          i can   t deny that .          of course you can   t .  even the president   s enemies will grant that the last two years have seen great accomplishments .  the federation is far stronger today than anyone could have dreamed it would be on that tercentenary day .  we might even say that a breakup of the global economy has been prevented .       edwards said cautiously     yes  the president is a changed man .  everyone says so .       janek said     he was a great man always .  the incident made him concentrate on the great issues with a fierce intensity  however .          which he didn   t do before .          perhaps not quite as intensely .  .  .  . in effect then  the president  and all of us  would like the incident forgotten .  my main purpose in seeing you  mr .  edwards  is to make that plain to you .  this is not the twentieth century and we can   t throw you in jail for being inconvenient to us  or hamper you in any way  but even the global charter doesn   t forbid us to attempt persuasion .  do you understand me .          i understand you  but i do not agree with you .  can we forget the incident when the person responsible has never been apprehended .          perhaps that is just as well  too  sir .  far better that some  uh  unbalanced person escape than that the matter be blown out of proportion and the stage set  possibly  for a return to the days of the twentieth century .          the official story even states that the robot spontaneously exploded  which is impossible  and which has been an unfair blow to the robot industry .          a robot is not the term i would use  mr .  edwards .  it was a mechanical device .  no one has said that robots are dangerous  per se  certainly not the workaday metallic ones .  the only reference here is to the unusually complex manlike devices that seem flesh and blood and that we might call androids .  actually  they are so complex that perhaps they might explode at that  i am not an expert in the field .  the robotics industry will recover .          nobody in the government     said edwards stubbornly     seems to care whether we reach the bottom of the matter or not .          i   ve already explained that there have been no consequences but good ones .  why stir the mud at the bottom  when the water above is clear .          and the use of the disintegrator .       for a moment  janek   s hand  which had been slowly turning the container of soya sticks on his desk  held still  then it returned to its rhythmic movement .  he said lightly     what   s that .       edwards said intently     mr .  janek  i think you know what i mean .  as part of the service           to which you no longer belong  of course          nevertheless  as part of the service  i could not help but hear things that were not always  i suppose  for my ears .  i had heard of a new weapon  and i saw something happen at the tercentenary which would require one .  the object everyone thought was the president disappeared into a cloud of very fine dust .  it was as though every atom within the object had had its bonds to other atoms loosed .  the object had become a cloud of individual atoms  which began to combine again of course  but which dispersed too quickly to do more than appear a momentary glitter of dust .          very science fictionish .          i certainly don   t understand the science behind it  mr .  janek  but i do see that it would take considerable energy to accomplish such bond breaking .  this energy would have to be withdrawn from the environment .  those people who were standing near the device at the time  and whom i could locate  and who would agree to talk  were unanimous in reporting a wave of coldness washing over them .       janek put the soya stick container to one side with a small click of transite against cellulite .  he said     suppose just for argument that there is such a thing as a disintegrator .          you need not argue .  there is .          i won   t argue .  i know of no such thing myself  but in my office  i am not likely to know of anything so security bound as new weaponry .  but if a disintegrator exists and is as secret as all that  it must be an american monopoly  unknown to the rest of the federation .  it would then not be something either you or i should talk about .  it could be a more dangerous war weapon than the nuclear bombs  precisely because  if what you say is so  it produces nothing more than disintegration at the point of impact and cold in the immediate neighborhood .  no blast  no fire  no deadly radiation .  without these distressing side effects  there would be no deterrent to its use  yet for all we know it might be made large enough to destroy the planet itself .          i go along with all of that     said edwards .       then you see that if there is no disintegrator  it is foolish to talk about one  and if there is a disintegrator  then it is criminal to talk about one .          i haven   t discussed it  except to you  just now  because i   m trying to persuade you of the seriousness of the situation .  if one had been used  for instance  ought not the government be interested in deciding how it came to be used  if another unit of the federation might be in possession .       janek shook his head .     i think that we can rely on appropriate organs of this government to take such a thing into consideration .  you had better not concern yourself with the matter .       edwards said  in barely controlled impatience     can you assure me that the united states is the only government that has such a weapon at its disposal .          i can   t tell you  since i know nothing about such a weapon  and should not know .  you should not have spoken of it to me .  even if no such weapon exists  the rumor of its existence could be damaging .          but since i have told you and the damage is done  please hear me out .  let me have the chance of convincing you that you  and no one else  hold the key to a fearful situation that perhaps i alone see .          you alone see .  i alone hold the key .          does that sound paranoid .  let me explain and then judge for yourself .          i will give you a little more time  sir  but what i have said stands .  you must abandon this  this hobby of yours  this investigation .  it is terribly dangerous .          it is its abandonment that would be dangerous .  don   t you see that if the disintegrator exists and if the united states has the monopoly of it  then it follows that the number of people who could have access to one would be sharply limited .  as an ex member of the service  i have some practical knowledge of this and i tell you that the only person in the world who could manage to abstract a disintegrator from our top secret arsenals would be the president .  .  .  . only the president of the united states  mr .  janek  could have arranged that assassination attempt .       they stared at each other for a moment and then janek touched a contact at his desk .    he said     added precaution .  no one can overhear us now by any means .  mr .  edwards  do you realize the danger of that statement .  to yourself .  you must not overestimate the power of the global charter .  a government has the right to take reasonable measures for the protection of its stability .       edwards said     i   m approaching you  mr .  janek  as someone i presume to be a loyal american citizen .  i come to you with news of a terrible crime that affects all americans and the entire federation .  a crime that has produced a situation that perhaps only you can right .  why do you respond with threats .       janek said     that   s the second time you have tried to make it appear that i am a potential savior of the world .  i can   t conceive of myself in that role .  you understand  i hope  that i have no unusual powers .          you are the secretary to the president .          that does not mean i have special access to him or am in some intimately confidential relationship to him .  there are times  mr .  edwards  when i suspect others consider me to be nothing more than a flunky  and there are even times when i find myself in danger of agreeing with them .          nevertheless  you see him frequently  you see him informally  you see him        janek said impatiently     i see enough of him to be able to assure you that the president would not order the destruction of that mechanical device on tercentenary day .          is it in your opinion impossible  then .          i did not say that .  i said he would not .  after all  why should he .  why should the president want to destroy a look alike android that had been a valuable adjunct to him for over three years of his presidency .  and if for some reason he wanted it done  why on earth should he do it in so incredibly public a way  at the tercentenary  no less  thus advertising its existence  risking public revulsion at the thought of shaking hands with a mechanical device  to say nothing of the diplomatic repercussions of having had representatives of other parts of the federation treat with one .  he might  instead  simply have ordered it disassembled in private .  no one but a few highly placed members of the administration would have known .          there have not  however  been any undesirable consequences for the president as a result of the incident  have there .          he has had to cut down on ceremony .  he is no longer as accessible as he once was .          as the robot once was .          well     said janek uneasily .     yes  i suppose that   s right .       edwards said     and  as a matter of fact  the president was re elected and his popularity has not diminished even though the destruction was public .  the argument against public destruction is not as powerful as you make it sound .          but the re election came about despite the incident .  it was brought about by the president   s quick action in stepping forward and delivering what you will have to admit was one of the great speeches of american history .  it was an absolutely amazing performance  you will have to admit that .          it was a beautifully staged drama .  the president  one might think  would have counted on that .       janek sat back in his chair .     if i understand you  edwards  you are suggesting an involuted storybook plot .  are you trying to say that the president had the device destroyed  just as it was  in the middle of a crowd  at precisely the time of the tercentenary celebration  with the world watching  so that he could win the admiration of all by his quick action .  are you suggesting that he arranged it all so that he could establish himself as a man of unexpected vigor and strength under extremely dramatic circumstances and thus turn a losing campaign into a winning one .   .  .  . mr .  edwards  you   ve been reading fairy tales .       edwards said     if i were trying to claim all this  it would indeed be a fairy tale  but i am not .  i never suggested that the president ordered the killing of the robot .  i merely asked if you thought it were possible and you have stated quite strongly that it wasn   t .  i   m glad you did  because i agree with you .          then what is all this .  i   m beginning to think you   re wasting my time .          another moment  please .  have you ever asked yourself why the job couldn   t have been done with a laser beam  with a field deactivator  with a sledgehammer  for god   s sake .  why should anyone go to the incredible trouble of getting a weapon guarded by the strongest possible government security to do a job that didn   t require such a weapon .  aside from the difficulty of getting it  why risk revealing the existence of a disintegrator to the rest of the world .          this whole business of a disintegrator is just a theory of yours .          the robot disappeared completely before my eyes .  i was watching .  i rely on no secondhand evidence for that .  it doesn   t matter what you call the weapon  whatever name you give it  it had the effect of taking the robot apart atom by atom and scattering all those atoms irretrievably .  why should this be done .  it was tremendous overkill .          i don   t know what was in the mind of the perpetrator .          no .  yet it seems to me that there is only one logical reason for a complete powdering when something much simpler would have carried through the destruction .  the powdering left no trace behind of the destroyed object .  it left nothing to indicate what it had been  whether robot or anything else .       janek said     but there is no question of what it was .          isn   t there .  i said only the president could have arranged for a disintegrator to be obtained and used .  but  considering the existence of a look alike robot  which president did the arranging .       janek said harshly     i don   t think we can carry on this conversation .  you are mad .       edwards said     think it through .  for god   s sake  think it through .  the president did not destroy the robot .  your arguments there are convincing .  what happened was that the robot destroyed the president .  president winkler was killed in the crowd on july         .  a robot resembling president winkler then gave the tercentenary speech  ran for re election  was re elected  and still serves as president of the united states .          madness .          i   ve come to you  to you because you can prove this  and correct it  too .          it is simply not so .  the president is  the president .     janek made as though to rise and conclude the interview .       you yourself say he   s changed     said edwards quickly and urgently .     the tercentenary speech was beyond the powers of the old winkler .  haven   t you been yourself amazed at the accomplishments of the last two years .  truthfully  could the winkler of the first term have done all this .          yes  he could have  because the president of the second term is the president of the first term .          do you deny he   s changed .  i put it to you .  you decide and i   ll abide by your decision .          he   s risen to meet the challenge  that is all .  it   s happened before this in american history .     but janek sank back into his seat .  he looked uneasy .       he doesn   t drink     said edwards .       he never did  very much .          he no longer womanizes .  do you deny he did so in the past .          a president is a man .  for the last two years  however  he   s felt dedicated to the matter of the federation .          it   s a change for the better  i admit     said edwards     but it   s a change .  of course  if he had a woman  the masquerade could not be carried on  could it .       janek said     too bad he doesn   t have a wife .     he pronounced the archaic word a little self consciously .     the whole matter wouldn   t arise if he did .          the fact that he doesn   t made the plot more practical .  yet he has fathered two children .  i don   t believe they have been in the white house  either one of them  since the tercentenary .          why should they be .  they are grown  with lives of their own .          are they invited .  is the president interested in seeing them .  you   re his private secretary .  you would know .  are they .       janek said     you   re wasting time .  a robot can   t kill a human being .  you know that that is the first law of robotics .          i know it .  but no one is saying that the robot winkler killed the human winkler directly .  when the human winkler was in the crowd  the robot winkler was on the stand and i doubt that a disintegrator could be aimed from that distance without doing more widespread damage .  maybe it could  but more likely the robot winkler had an accomplice  a hit man  if that is the correct twentieth century jargon .       janek frowned .  his plump face puckered and looked pained .  he said     you know  madness must be catching .  i   m actually beginning to consider the insane notion you   ve brought here .  fortunately  it doesn   t hold water .  after all  why would an assassination of the human winkler be arranged in public .  all the arguments against destroying the robot in public hold against the killing of a human president in public .  don   t you see that ruins the whole theory .          it does not      began edwards .     it does .  no one except for a few officials knew that the mechanical device existed at all .  if president winkler were killed privately and his body disposed of  the robot could easily take over without suspicion  without having roused yours  for instance .          there would always be a few officials who would know  mr .  janek .  the assassinations would have to broaden .     edwards leaned forward earnestly .     see here  ordinarily there couldn   t have been any danger of confusing the human being and the machine .  i imagine the robot wasn   t in constant use  but was pulled out only for specific purposes  and there would always be key individuals  perhaps quite a number of them  who would know where the president was and what he was doing .  if that were so  the assassination would have to be carried out at a time when those officials actually thought the president was really the robot .          i don   t follow you .          see here .  one of the robot   s tasks was to shake hands with the crowd  press the flesh .  when this was taking place  the officials in the know would be perfectly aware that the hand shaker was  in truth  the robot .          exactly .  you   re making sense now .  it was the robot .          except that it was the tercentenary  and except that president winkler could not resist .  i suppose it would be more than human to expect a president  particularly an empty crowd pleaser and applause hunter like winkler  to give up the adulation of the crowd on this day of all days  and let it go to a machine .  and perhaps the robot carefully nurtured this impulse so that on this one tercentenary day  the president would have ordered the robot to remain behind the podium  while he himself went out to shake hands and to be cheered .          secretly .          of course secretly .  if the president had told anyone in the service  or any of his aides  or you  would he have been allowed to do it .  the official attitude concerning the possibility of assassination has been practically a disease since the events of the late twentieth century .  so with the encouragement of an obviously clever robot           you assume the robot to be clever because you assume he is now serving as president .  that is circular reasoning .  if he is not president  there is no reason to think he is clever  or that he were capable of working out this plot .  besides  what motive could possibly drive a robot to plot an assassination .  even if it didn   t kill the president directly  the taking of a human life indirectly is also forbidden by the first law  which states     a robot may not injure a human being or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm .          edwards said     the first law is not absolute .  what if harming a human being saves the lives of two others  or three others  or even three billion others .  the robot may have thought that saving the federation took precedence over the saving of one life .  it was no ordinary robot  after all .  it was designed to duplicate the properties of the president closely enough to deceive anyone .  suppose it had the understanding of president winkler  without his weaknesses  and suppose it knew that it could save the federation where the president could not .          you can reason so  but how do you know a mechanical device would .          it is the only way to explain what happened .          i think it is a paranoid fantasy .       edwards said     then tell me why the object that was destroyed was powdered into atoms .  what else would make sense than to suppose that that was the only way to hide the fact that it was a human being and not a robot that was destroyed .  give me an alternate explanation .       janek reddened .     i won   t accept it .          but you can prove the whole matter  or disprove it .  it   s why i have come to you  to you .          how can i prove it .  or disprove it either .          no one sees the president at unguarded moments as you do .  it is with you  in default of family  that he is most informal .  study him .          i have .  i tell you he isn   t           you haven   t .  you suspected nothing wrong  little signs meant nothing to you .  study him now  being aware that he might be a robot  and you will see .       janek said sardonically     i can knock him down and probe for metal with an ultrasonic detector .  even an android has a platinum iridium brain .          no drastic action will be necessary .  just observe him and you will see that he is so radically not the man he was that he cannot be a man .       janek looked at the clock calendar on the wall .  he said     we have been here over an hour .          i   m sorry to have taken up so much of your time  but you see the importance of all this  i hope .          importance .     said janek .  then he looked up and what had seemed a despondent air turned suddenly into something of hope .     but is it  in fact  important .  really  i mean .          how can it not be important .  to have a robot as president of the united states .  that   s not important .          no  that   s not what i mean .  forget what president winkler might be .  just consider this .  someone serving as president of the united states has saved the federation  he has held it together and  at the present moment  he runs the council in the interests of peace and of constructive compromise .  you   ll admit all that .       edwards said     of course  i admit all that .  but what of the precedent established .  a robot in the white house for a very good reason now may lead to a robot in the white house twenty years from now for a very bad reason  and then to robots in the white house for no reason at all but only as a matter of course .  don   t you see the importance of muffling a possible trumpet call for the end of humanity at the time of its first uncertain note .       janek shrugged .     suppose i find out he   s a robot .  do we broadcast it to all the world .  do you know how that will affect the federation .  do you know what it will do to the world   s financial structure .  do you know           i do know .  that is why i have come to you privately  instead of trying to make it public .  it is up to you to check out the matter and come to a definite conclusion .  it is up to you  next  having found the supposed president to be a robot  which i am certain you will do  to persuade him to resign .          and by your version of his reaction to the first law  he will then have me killed since i will be threatening his expert handling of the greatest global crisis of the twenty first century .       edwards shook his head .     the robot acted in secret before  and no one tried to counter the arguments he used with himself .  you will be able to reinforce a stricter interpretation of the first law with your arguments .  if necessary  we can get the aid of some official from u .  s .  robots and mechanical men corporation who constructed the robot in the first place .  once he resigns  the vice president will succeed .  if the robot winkler has put the old world on the right track  good  it can now be kept on the right track by the vice president  who is a decent and honorable woman .  but we can   t have a robot ruler  and we mustn   t ever again .       what if the president is human .          i   ll leave that to you .  you will know .       janek said     i am not that confident of myself .  what if i can   t decide .  if i can   t bring myself to .  if i don   t dare to .  what are your plans .       edwards looked tired .     i don   t know .  i may have to go to u .  s .  robots .  but i don   t think it will come to that .  i   m quite confident that now that i   ve laid the problem in your lap  you won   t rest till it   s settled .  do you want to be ruled by a robot .       he stood up  and janek let him go .  they did not shake hands .    janek sat there in the gathering twilight in deep shock .  a robot .    the man had walked in and had argued  in perfectly rational manner  that the president of the united states was a robot .    it should have been easy to fight that off .  yet though janek had tried every argument he could think of  they had all been useless  and the man had not been shaken in the least .    a robot as president .  edwards had been certain of it  and he would stay certain of it .  and if janek insisted that the president was human  edwards would go to u .  s .  robots .  he wouldn   t rest .    janek frowned as he thought of the twenty seven months since the tercentenary and of how well all had gone in the face of the probabilities .  and now .    he remained lost in somber thought .    he still had the disintegrator but surely it would not be necessary to use it on a human being  the nature of whose body was not in question .  a silent laser stroke in some lonely spot would do .    it had been hard to maneuver the president into the earlier job  but in this present case  it wouldn   t even have to know .   my first thought was to call the previous story    death at the tricentennial     but the dictionary assured me that    tercentenary    was a perfectly good way of referring to a three hundredth birthday  so i called it    death at the tercentenary .       fred changed that name to the tercentenary incident  which was a great improvement in my opinion  and i adopted it with glad cries .  i am not always pleased with his title changes and generally say so  as in my collection of mystery short stories tales of the black widowers .  it is only fair now that i give him credit for a good change .      one more thing .  again  this story represents a return to a theme i handled in an earlier story  . the earlier story in this case was evidence  first published in       thirty years before this story was .  there is  except for theme  no similarity between the two stories  and i leave it to the gentle reader  if he or she has read both  to decide whether i have improved or not in the interval .   don   t write  however  unless you think i have improved .    time flies .  i myself am ever youthful  but everything else is getting older .  do you realize that with the april      issue  amazing stories  the oldest of the science fiction magazines  celebrated its semicentennial .    the april      issue of amazing stories was volume i  number   .  it was the very first issue of the first magazine ever to be devoted entirely to science fiction and that was fifty years ago .    hugo gernsback had been born in luxemburg in      and had emigrated to the united states in      .  he went on to write some excruciatingly bad science fiction with some excruciatingly good predictions in it  to edit a magazine  in which he included science fiction stories  or scientifiction  as be called it    and to begin thinking of publishing an all science fiction magazine for some time .  a probing circular be sent out in      brought in disappointing results  but then  in       without any advance fanfare at all  he placed the new magazine on the stands .    sol cohen  the current publisher of the magazine  called me in the fall of      to ask me if i could make some contribution in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of the magazine  and although  as usual  i was drowning in commitments  there was no way i could let that pass .  on november           i sat down to write birth of a notion and so i was represented in the anniversary issue .       birth of a notion      that the first inventor of a workable time machine was a science fiction enthusiast is by no means a coincidence .  it was inevitable .  why else should an otherwise sane physicist even dare track down the various out of  the way theories that seemed to point toward maneuverability in time in the very teeth of general relativity .    it took energy  of course .  everything takes energy .  but simeon weill was prepared to pay the price .  anything  well  almost anything  to make his hidden science fictional dream come true .    the trouble was that there was no way of controlling either the direction or distance through which one was chronologically thrust .  it was all the result of random temporal collisions of the harnessed tachyons .  weill could make mice and even rabbits disappear  but future or past  he couldn   t say .  one mouse reappeared  so he must have traveled but a short way into the past  and it seemed quite unharmed .  the others .  who could tell .    he devised an automatic release for the machine .  theoretically  it would reverse the push  whatever the push might be  and bring back the object  from whichever direction and whatever distance it had gone  .  it didn   t always work  but five rabbits were brought back unharmed .    if he could only make the release foolproof  weill would have tried it himself .  he was dying to try it  which was not the proper reaction of a theoretical physicist  but was the absolute predictable emotion of a crazed s . f .  fan who was particularly fond of the space operish productions of some decades before the present year of      .    it was inevitable  then  that the accident should happen .  on no account would he have stepped between the tempodes with conscious determination .  he knew the chances were about two in five he would not return .  on the other hand  he was dying to try it  so he tripped over his own big feet and went staggering between those tempodes as a result of total accident .   .  .  . but are there really accidents .    he might have been hurled into the past or into the future .  as  t happened  he was  hurled into the past .    he might have been hurled uncounted thousands of years into the past or one and a half days .  as it happened  he was hurled fifty one years into the past to a time when the teapot dome scandal was burning brightly but the nation was keeping cool with coolidge and knew that nobody in the world could lick jack dempsey .    but there was something that his theories didn   t tell weill .  he knew what could happen to the particles themselves  but there was no way of predicting what would happen to the relationships between the various particles .  and where are relationships more complex than in the brain .    so what happened was that as weill moved backward through time  his mind unreeled .  not all the way  fortunately  since weill had not yet been conceived in the year before america   s sesquicentennial  and a brain with less than no development would have been a distinct handicap .    it unreeled haltingly  and partially  and clumsily  and when weill found himself on a park bench not far from his      home in lower manhattan  where he experimented in dubious symbiosis with new york university  he found himself in the year      with an abysmally aching head and no very clear idea as to what anything was all about .    he found himself staring at a man of about forty  hair slicked down  cheekbones prominent  beaky nose  who was sharing the same bench with him .    the man looked concerned .  he said     where did you come from .  you were not here a moment ago .     he had a distinct teutonic accent .   .    weill wasn   t sure .  he couldn   t remember .  but one phrase seemed to stick through the chaos within his skull even though he wasn   t sure what it meant .       time machine     he gasped .    the other man stiffened .  he said     do you read pseudoscientific romances .          what .     said weill .       have you read h .  g .  wells   s the time machine .        the repetition of the phrase seemed to soothe weill a bit .  the pain in his head lessened .  the name wells seemed familiar  or was that his own name .  no .  his own name was weill .       wells .     he said .     i am weill .       the other man thrust out a hand .     i am hugo gernsback .  i write pseudo scientific romances at times  but of course  it is not right to say    pseudo .     that makes it seem there is something fake about it .  that is not so .  it should be properly written and then it will be scientific fiction .  i like to shorten that    his dark eyes gleamed     to scientifiction .           yes     said weill  trying desperately to collect shattered memories and unwound experiences and getting only moods and impressions .     scientifiction .  better than pseudo .  still not quite           if done well .  have you read my    ralph    c        .          hugo gernsback     said weill  frowning     famous           in a small way     said the other  nodding his head .     i have been publishing magazines on radio and on electrical inventions for years .  have you read    science and invention    .       weill caught the word    invention    and somehow that left him on the edge of understanding what he had meant by    time machine .     he grew eager and said     yes  yes .          and what do you think of the scientifiction that i add in each issuer      scientifiction again .  the word had a soothing effect on him and yet it was not quite right .  something more  not quite     he said it     something more .  not quite           not quite enough .  yes  i   ve been thinking that .  last year i sent out circulars asking for subscriptions to a magazine to contain nothing but scientifiction .  i would call it scientifiction .  the results were very disappointing .  how would you explain that .       weill didn   t hear him .  he was still concentrating on the word    scientifiction     which didn   t seem quite right  but he couldn   t understand why it didn   t .    he said     the name is not right .          not right for a magazine .  maybe that   s so .  i have not thought of a good name  something to catch the eye  to get across just what the reader will get  and what he will want .  that is it .  if i could get a good name i would start the magazine and not worry about circulars .  i would not ask anything .  i would simply put it on every newsstand in the united states next spring  that is all .       weill stared at him blankly .    the man said     of course  the stories i want should teach science even as they amuse and excite the reader .  they should open to him the vast scope of the future .  airplanes will cross the atlantic nonstop .          airplanes .     weill caught a fugitive vision of a large metal whale  rising on its own exhaust .  a moment  and it was gone .  he said     large ones  carrying hundreds of people faster than sound .          of course .  why not .  staying in touch at all times by radio .          satellites .          what .     it was the other man   s turn to look puzzled .       radio waves bounce off an artificial satellite in space .       the other man nodded vigorously .     i predicted the use of radio waves to detect at a distance in    ralph    c      .     space mirrors .  i   ve predicted that .  and television  of course .  and energy from the atom .       weill was galvanized .  images flashed before his mind   s eye in no suitable order .     atom     he said     yes .  nuclear bombs .          radium     said the other man complacently .       plutonium     said weill .       what .          plutonium .  and nuclear fusion .  imitating the sun .  nylon and plastics .  pesticides to kill the insects .  computers to kill the problems .          computers .  you mean robots .          pocket computers     said weill enthusiastically .     little things .  hold them in your hand and work out problems .  little radios .  hold them in your hand  too .  cameras take photographs and develop them right in the box .  holographs .  three .  dimensional pictures .       the other man said     do you write scientifiction .       weill didn   t listen .  he kept trying to trap the images .  they were growing clearer .     skyscrapers     he said .     aluminum and glass .  highways .  color television .  man on the moon .  probes to jupiter .          man on the moon     said the other man .     jules verne .  do you read jules verne .       weill shook his head .  it was quite clear now .  the mind was healing a bit .     stepping down onto the moon   s surface on television .  everyone watching .  and pictures of mars .  no canals on mars .          no canals on mars .     said the other man  astonished .     they have been seen .          no canals     said weill firmly .     volcanoes .  the biggest .  canyons the biggest .  transistors  lasers  tachyons .  trap the tachyons .  make them push against time .  move through time .  move through time .  a  ma        weill   s voice was fading and his outlines trembled .  it so happened that the other man looked away at this moment  staring into the blue sky  and muttering     tachyons .  what is he saying .       he was thinking that if a stranger he met casually in the park was so interested in scientifiction  it might be a good sign that it was time for the magazine .  and then he remembered he had no name and dismissed the notion regretfully .    he looked back in time to hear weill   s last words     tachyonic time travel  an  amazing  stor  y      and he was gone  snapping back to his own time .    hugo gernsback stared in horror at the place where the man had been .  he hadn   t seen him come and now he really hadn   t seen him go .  his mind rejected the
