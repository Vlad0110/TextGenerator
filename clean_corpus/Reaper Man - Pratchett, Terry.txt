reading     the morris dance is common to all inhabited worlds in the multiverse .   it is danced under blue skies to celebrate the quickening of the soil and under bare stars because it   s springtime and with any luck the carbon dioxide will unfreeze again .  the imperative is felt by deep sea beings who have never seen the sun and urban humans whose only connection with the cycles of nature is that their volvo once ran over a sheep .   it is danced innocently by raggedy bearded young mathematicians to an inexpert accordion rendering of    mrs .  widgery   s lodger    and ruthlessly by such as the ninja morris men of new ankh  who can do strange and terrible things with a simple handkerchief and a bell .   and it is never danced properly .   except on the discworld  which is flat and supported on the backs of four elephants which travel through space on the shell of great a   tuin  the world turtle .   and even there  only in one place have they got it right .  it   s a small village high in the ramtop mountains  where the big and simple secret is handed down across the generations .   there  the men dance on the first day of spring  backward and forward  bells tied under their knees  white shirts flapping .  people come and watch .  there   s an ox roast afterward  and it   s generally considered a nice day out for all the family .   but that isn   t the secret .   the secret is the other dance .   and that won   t happen for a while yet .      there is a ticking  such as might be made by a clock .  and  indeed  in the sky there is a clock  and the ticking of freshly minted seconds flows out from it .   at least  it looks like a clock .  but it is in fact exactly the opposite of a clock  and the biggest hand goes around just once .   there is a plain under a dim sky .  it is covered with gentle rolling curves that might remind you of something else if you saw it from a long way away  and if you did see it from a long way away you   d be very glad that you were  in fact  a long way away .   three gray figures floated just above it .  exactly what they were can   t be described in normal language .  some people might call them cherubs  although there was nothing rosy cheeked about them .  they might be numbered among those who see to it that gravity operates and that time stays separate from space .  call them auditors .  auditors of reality .   they were in conversation without speaking .  they didn   t need to speak .  they just changed reality so that they had spoken .   one said  it has never happened before .  can it be done .   one said  it will have to be done .  there is a personality .  personalities come to an end .  only forces endure .   it said this with a certain satisfaction .   one said  besides   there have been irregularities .  where you get personality  you get irregularities .  well known fact .   one said  he has worked inefficiently .   one said  no .  we can   t get him there .   one said  that is the point .  the word is him .  becoming a personality is inefficient .  we don   t want it to spread .  supposing gravity developed a personality .  supposing it decided to like people .   one said  got a crush on them  sort of thing .   one said  in a voice that would have been even chillier if it was not already at absolute zero  no .   one said  sorry .  just my little joke .   one said  besides  sometimes he wonders about his job .  such speculation is dangerous .   one said  no argument there .   one said  then we are agreed .   one  who seemed to have been thinking about something  said  just one moment .  did you not just use the singular pronoun     my .     not developing a personality  are you .   one said  guiltily  who .  us .   one said  where there is personality  there is discord .   one said  yes .  yes .  very true .   one said  all right .  but watch it in future .   one said  then we are agreed .   they looked up at the face of azrael  outlined against the sky .  in fact  it was the sky .   azrael nodded  slowly .   one said  very well .  where is this place .   one said  it is the discworld .  it rides through space on the back of a giant turtle .   one said  oh  one of that sort .  i hate them .   one said  you   re doing it again .  you said    i .      one said  no .  no .  i didn   t .  i never said    i    .    oh  bugger     it burst into flame and burned in the same way that a small cloud of vapor burns  quickly and with no residual mess .  almost immediately  another one appeared .  it was identical in appearance to its vanished sibling .   one said  let that be a lesson .  to become a personality is to end .  and now   let us go .   azrael watched them skim away .   it is hard to fathom the thoughts of a creature so big that  in real space  his length would be measured only in terms of the speed of light .  but he turned his enormous bulk and  with eyes that stars could be lost in  sought among the myriad worlds for a flat one .   on the back of a turtle .  the discworld   world and mirror of worlds .   it sounded interesting .  and  in his prison of a billion years  azrael was bored .      and this is the room where the future pours into the past via the pinch of the now .   timers line the walls .  not hour glasses  although they have the same shape .  not egg timers  such as you might buy as a souvenir attached to a small board with the name of the holiday resort of your choice jauntily inscribed on it by someone with the same sense of style as a jelly doughnut .   it   s not even sand in there .  it   s seconds  endlessly turning the maybe into the was .   and every lifetimer has a name on it .   and the room is full of the soft hissing of people living .   picture the scene     and now add the sharp clicking of bone on stone  getting closer .   a dark shape crosses the field of vision and moves up the endless shelves of sibilant glassware .  click  click .  here   s a glass with the top bulb nearly empty .  bone fingers rise and reach out .  select .  and another .  select .  and more .  many  many more .  select  select .   it   s all in a day   s work .  or it would be  if days existed here .   click  click  as the dark shape moves patiently along the rows .   and stops .   and hesitates .   because here   s a small gold timer  not much bigger than a watch .   it wasn   t there yesterday  or wouldn   t have been if yesterdays existed here .   bony fingers close around it and hold it up to the light .   it   s got a name on it  in small capital letters .   the name is death .   death put down the timer  and then picked it up again .  the sands of time were already pouring through .  he turned it over experimentally  just in case .  the sand went on pouring  only now it was going upward .  he hadn   t really expected anything else .   it meant that  even if tomorrows could exist here  there wasn   t going to be any .  not anymore .   there was a movement in the air behind him .   death turned slowly  and addressed the figure that wavered indistinctly in the gloom .   why .   it told him .   but that is   not right .   it told him that no  it was right .   not a muscle moved on death   s face  because he hadn   t got any .   i shall appeal .   it told him  he should know that there was no appeal .  never any appeal .  never any appeal .   death thought about this  and then he said   i have always done my duty as i saw fit .   the figure floated closer .  it looked vaguely like a gray robed and hooded monk .   it told him  we know .  that is why we   re letting you keep the horse .      the sun was near the horizon .  the shortest lived creatures on the disc were mayflies  which barely make it through twenty four hours .  two of the oldest zigzagged aimlessly over the waters of a trout stream  discussing history with some younger members of the evening hatching .      you don   t get the kind of sun now that you used to get     said one of them .      you   re right there .  we had proper sun in the good old hours .  it were all yellow .  none of this red stuff .         it were higher  too .         it was .  you   re right .         and nymphs and larvae showed you a bit of respect .         they did .  they did     said the other mayfly vehemently .      i reckon  if mayflies these hours behaved a bit better  we   d still be having proper sun .      the younger mayflies listened politely .      i remember     said one of the oldest mayflies     when all this was fields  as far as you could see .      the younger mayflies looked around .      it   s still fields     one of them ventured  after a polite interval .      i remember when it was better fields     said the old mayfly sharply .      yeah     said his colleague .     and there was a cow .         that   s right .  you   re right .  i remember that cow .  stood right over there for  oh  forty  fifty minutes .  it was brown  as i recall .         you don   t get cows like that these hours .         you don   t get cows at all .         what   s a cow .     said one of the hatchlings .      see .     said the oldest mayfly triumphantly .     that   s modern ephemeroptera for you .     it paused .     what were we doing before we were talking about the sun .         zigzagging aimlessly over the water     said one of the young flies .  this was a fair bet in any case .      no  before that .         er   you were telling us about the great trout .         ah  yes .  right .  the trout .  well  you see  if you   ve been a good mayfly  zigzagging up and down properly              taking heed of your elders and betters              yes  and taking heed of your elders and betters  then eventually the great trout        clop  clop     yes .     said one of the younger mayflies .   there was no reply .      the great trout what .     said another mayfly  nervously .   they looked down at a series of expanding concentric rings on the water .      the holy sign .     said a mayfly .     i remember being told about that .  a great circle in the water .  thus shall be the sign of the great trout .      the oldest of the young mayflies watched the water thoughtfully .  it was beginning to realize that  as the most senior fly present  it now had the privilege of hovering closest to the surface .      they say     said the mayfly at the top of the zigzagging crowd     that when the great trout comes for you  you go to a land flowing with   flowing with       mayflies don   t eat .  it was at a loss .     flowing with water     it finished lamely .      i wonder     said the oldest mayfly .      it must be really good there     said the youngest .      oh .  why .            cos no one ever wants to come back .         whereas the oldest things on the discworld were the famous counting pines  which grow right on the permanent snowline of the high ramtop mountains .   the counting pine is one of the few known examples of borrowed evolution .   most species do their own evolving  making it up as they go along  which is the way nature intended .  and this is all very natural and organic and in tune with mysterious cycles of the cosmos  which believes that there   s nothing like millions of years of really frustrating trial and error to give a species moral fiber and  in some cases  backbone .   this is probably fine from the species    point of view  but from the perspective of the actual individuals involved it can be a real pig  or at least a small pink root eating reptile that might one day evolve into a real pig .   so the counting pines avoided all this by letting other vegetables do their evolving for them .  a pine seed  coming to rest anywhere on the disc  immediately picks up the most effective local genetic code via morphic resonance and grows into whatever best suits the soil and climate  usually doing much better at it than the native trees themselves  which it usually usurps .   what makes the counting pines particularly noteworthy  however  is the way they count .   being dimly aware that human beings had learned to tell the age of a tree by counting the rings  the original counting pines decided that this was why humans cut trees down .   overnight every counting pine readjusted its genetic code to produce  at about eye level on its trunk  in pale letters  its precise age .  within a year they were felled almost into extinction by the ornamental house number plate industry  and only a very few survive in hard to reach areas .   the six counting pines in this clump were listening to the oldest  whose gnarled trunk declared it to be thirty one thousand  seven hundred and thirty four years old .  the conversation took seventeen years  but has been speeded up .      i remember when all this wasn   t fields .      the pines stared out over a thousand miles of landscape .  the sky flickered like a bad special effect from a time travel movie .  snow appeared  stayed for an instant  and melted .      what was it  then .     said the nearest pine .      ice .  if you can call it ice .  we had proper glaciers in those days .  not like the ice you get now  here one season and gone the next .  it hung around for ages .         what happened to it  then .         it went .         went where .         where things go .  everything   s always rushing off .         wow .  that was a sharp one .         what was .         that winter just then .         call that a winter .  when i was a sapling we had winters        then the tree vanished .   after a shocked pause for a couple of years  one of the clump said     he just went .  just like that .  one day he was here  next he was gone .      if the other trees had been humans  they would have shuffled their feet .      it happens  lad     said one of them  carefully .     he   s been taken to a better place   you can be sure of that .  he was a good tree .      the young tree  which was a mere five thousand  one hundred and eleven years old  said     what sort of better place .         we   re not sure     said one of the clump .  it trembled uneasily in a week long gale .     but we think it involves   sawdust .      since the trees were unable even to sense any event that took place in less than a day  they never heard the sound of axes .      windle poons  oldest wizard in the entire faculty of unseen university        home of magic  wizardry and big dinners        was also going to die .   he knew it  in a frail and shaky sort of way .   of course  he mused  as he wheeled his wheelchair over the flagstones toward his ground floor study  in a general sort of way everyone knew they were going to die  even the common people .  no one knew where you were before you were born  but when you were born  it wasn   t long before you found you   d arrived with your return ticket already punched .   but wizards really knew .  not if death involved violence or murder  of course  but if the cause of death was simply a case of running out of life then   well  you knew .  you generally got the premonition in time to return your library books and make sure your best suit was clean and borrow quite large sums of money from your friends .   he was one hundred and thirty .  it occurred to him that for most of his life he   d been an old man .  didn   t seem fair  really .   and no one had said anything .  he   d mentioned it in the uncommon room last week  and no one had taken the hint .  and at lunch today they   d hardly spoken to him .  even his old so called friends seemed to be avoiding him  and he wasn   t even trying to borrow money .   it was like not having your birthday remembered  only worse .   he was going to die all alone  and no one cared .   he bumped the door open with the wheel of the chair and fumbled on the table by the door for the tinder box .   that was another thing .  hardly anyone used tinder boxes these days .  they bought the big smelly yellow matches the alchemists made .  windle disapproved .  fire was important .  you shouldn   t be able to switch it on just like that  it didn   t show any respect .  that was people these days  always rushing around and   fires .  yes  it had been a lot warmer in the old days  too .  the kind of fires they had these days didn   t warm you up unless you were nearly on top of them .  it was something in the wood   it was the wrong sort of wood .  everything was wrong these days .  more thin .  more fuzzy .  no real life in anything .  and the days were shorter .  mmm .  something had gone wrong with the days .  they were shorter days .  mmm .  everyday took an age to go by  which was odd  because days plural went past like a stampede .  there weren   t many things people wanted a     year old wizard to do  and windle had got into the habit of arriving at the dining table up to two hours before each meal  simply to pass the time .   endless days  going by fast .  didn   t make sense .  mmm .  mind you  you didn   t get the sense now that you used to get in the old days .   and they let the university be run by mere boys now .  in the old days it had been run by proper wizards  great big men built like barges  the kinds of wizards you could look up to .  then suddenly they   d all gone off somewhere and windle was being patronized by these boys who still had some of their own teeth .  like that ridcully lad .  windle remembered him clearly .  thin lad  sticking out ears  never wiped his nose properly  cried for his mother in the dorm on the first night .  always up to mischief .  someone had tried to tell windle that ridcully was archchancellor now .  mmm .  they must think he was daft .   where was that damn tinder box .  fingers   you used to get proper fingers in the old days     someone pulled the covers off a lantern .  someone else pushed a drink into his groping hand .      surprise .         in the hall of the house of death is a clock with a pendulum like a blade but with no hands  because in the house of death there is no time but the present .   there was  of course  a present before the present now  but that was also the present .  it was just an older one .    the pendulum is a blade that would have made edgar allan poe give it all up and start again as a stand up comedian on the scampi in a casket circuit .  it swings with a faint whum whum noise  gently slicing thin rashers of interval from the bacon of eternity .   death stalked past the clock and into the somber gloom of his study .  albert  his servant  was waiting for him with the towel and dusters .      good morning  master .      death sat down silently in his big chair .  albert draped the towel over the angular shoulders .      another nice day     he said  conversationally .   death said nothing .   albert flapped the polishing cloth and pulled back death   s cowl .   albert .      sir .      death pulled out the tiny golden timer .   do you see this .      yes  sir .  very nice .  never seen one like that before .  whose is it .      mine .   albert   s eyes swiveled sideways .  on one corner of death   s desk was a large timer in a black frame .  it contained no sand .      i thought that one was yours  sir .     he said .   it was .  now this is .  a retirement present .  from azrael himself .   albert peered at the thing in death   s hand .      but   the sand  sir .  it   s pouring .      quite so .      but that means   i mean    .      it means that one day the sand will all be poured  albert .      i know that  sir  but   you   i thought time was something that happened to other people  sir .  doesn   t it .  not to you  sir .     by the end of the sentence albert   s voice was beseeching .   death pulled off the towel and stood up .   come with me .      but you   re death  master     said albert  running crab legged after the tall figure as it led the way out into the hall and down the passage to the stable .     this isn   t some sort of joke  is it .     he added hopefully .   i am not known for my sense of fun .      well  of course not  no offense meant .  but listen  you can   t die  because you   re death  you   d have to happen to yourself  it   d be like that snake that eats its own tail        nevertheless  i am going to die .  there is no appeal .      but what will happen to me .     albert said .  terror glittered on his words like flakes of metal on the edge of a knife .   there will be a new death .   albert drew himself up .      i really don   t think i could serve a new master     he said .   then go back into the world .  i will give you money .  you have been a good servant  albert .      but if i go back        yes  said death .  you will die .   in the warm  horsey gloom of the stable  death   s pale horse looked up from its oats and gave a little whinny of greeting .  the horse   s name was binky .  he was a real horse .  death had tried fiery steeds and skeletal horses in the past  and found them impractical  especially the fiery ones  which tended to set light to their own bedding and stand in the middle of it looking embarrassed .   death took the saddle down from its hook and glanced at albert  who was suffering a crisis of conscience .   thousands of years before  albert had opted to serve death rather than die .  he wasn   t exactly immortal .  real time was forbidden in death   s realm .  there was only the ever changing now  but it went on for a very long time .  he had less than two months of real time left  he hoarded his days like bars of gold .      i  er       he began .     that is        you fear to die .      it   s not that i don   t want   i mean  i   ve always   it   s just that life is a habit that   s hard to break        death watched him curiously  as one might watch a beetle that had landed on its back and couldn   t turn over .   finally albert lapsed into silence .   i understand  said death  unhooking binky   s bridle .      but you don   t seem worried .  you   re really going to die .      yes .  it will be a great adventure .      it will .  you   re not afraid .      i do not know how to be afraid .      i could show you  if you like     albert ventured .   no .  i should like to learn by myself .  i shall have experiences .  at last .      master   if you go  will there be    .      a new death will arise from the minds of the living  albert .      oh .     albert looked relieved .     you don   t happen to know what he   ll be like  do you .      no .      perhaps i   d better  you know  clean the place up a bit  get an inventory prepared  that sort of thing .      good idea  said death  as kindly as possible .  when i see the new death  i shall heartily recommend you .      oh .  you   ll see him  then .      oh  yes .  and i must leave now .      what  so soon .      certainly .  mustn   t waste time .  death adjusted the saddle  and then turned and held the tiny hourglass proudly in front of albert   s hooked nose .   see .  i have time .  at last  i have time .   albert backed away nervously .      and now that you have it  what are you going to do with it .     he said .   death mounted his horse .   i am going to spend it .      the party was in full swing .  the banner with the legend    goodebye windle     gloriouse years    was drooping a bit in the heat .  things were getting to the point where there was nothing to drink but the punch and nothing to eat but the strange yellow dip with highly suspicious tortillas and nobody minded .  the wizards chatted with the forced jolliness of people who see one another all day and are now seeing one another all evening .   in the middle of it all windle poons sat with a huge glass of rum and a funny hat on his head .  he was almost in tears .      a genuine going away party .     he kept muttering .     haven   t had one of them since old    scratcher    hocksole went away     the capital letters fell into place easily     back in  mm  the year of the intimidating  mm  porpoise .  thought everyone had forgotten about    em .         the librarian looked up the details for us     said the bursar  indicating a large orangutan who was trying to blow into a party squeaker .     he also made the banana dip .  i hope someone eats it soon .      he leaned down .      can i help you to some more potato salad .     he said  in the loud deliberate voice used for talking to imbeciles and old people .   windle cupped a trembling hand to his ear .      what .  what .         more .  salad .  windle .         no  thank you .         another sausage  then .         what .         sausage .         they give me terrible gas all night     said windle .  he considered this for a moment  and then took five .      er     shouted the bursar     do you happen to know what time    .         eh .         what .  time .         half past nine     said windle  promptly if indistinctly .      well  that   s nice     said the bursar .     it gives you the rest of the evening  er  free .      windle rummaged in the dreadful recesses of his wheelchair  a graveyard for old cushions  dog eared books and ancient  half sucked sweets .  he flourished a small green covered book and pushed it into the bursar   s hands .   the bursar turned it over .  scrawled on the cover were the words  windle poons hys dyary .  apiece of bacon rind marked today   s date .   under things to do  a crabbed hand had written  die .   the bursar couldn   t stop himself from turning the page .   yes .  under tomorrow   s date  things to do  get born .   his gaze slid sideways to a small table at the side of the room .  despite the fact that the room was quite crowded  there was an area of clear floor around the table  as if it had some kind of personal space that no one was about to invade .   there had been special instructions in the going away ceremony concerning the table .  it had to have a black cloth  with a few magic sigils embroidered on it .  it had a plate  containing a selection of the better canap  s .  it had a glass of wine .  after considerable discussion among the wizards  a funny paper hat had been added as well .   they all had an expectant look .   the bursar took out his watch and flicked open the lid .   it was one of the new fangled pocket watches  with hands .  they pointed to a quarter past nine .  he shook it .  a small hatch opened under the    and a very small demon poked its head out and said     knock it off  guv   nor  i   m pedalling as fast as i can .      he closed the watch again and looked around desperately .  no one else seemed anxious to come too near windle poons .  the bursar felt it was up to him to make polite conversation .  he surveyed possible topics .  they all presented problems .   windle poons helped him out .      i   m thinking of coming back as a woman     he said conversationally .   the bursar opened and shut his mouth a few times .      i   m looking forward to it     poons went on .     i think it might  mm  be jolly good fun .      the bursar riffled desperately through his limited repertoire of small talk relating to women .  he leaned down to windle   s gnarled ear .      isn   t there rather a lot of     he struck out aimlessly     washing things .  and making beds and cookery and all that sort of thing .         not in the kind of  mm  life i have in mind     said windle firmly .   the bursar shut his mouth .  the archchancellor banged on a table with a spoon .      brothers       he began  when there was something approaching silence .  this prompted a loud and ragged chorus of cheering .         as you all know we are here tonight to mark the  ah  retirement      nervous laughter      of our old friend and colleague windle poons .  you know  seeing old windle sitting here tonight puts me in mind  as luck would have it  of the story of the cow with three wooden legs .  it appears that there was this cow  and        the bursar let his mind wander .  he knew the story .  the archchancellor always mucked up the punch line  and in any case he had other things on his mind .   he kept looking back at the little table .   the bursar was a kindly if nervous soul  and quite enjoyed his job .  apart from anything else  no other wizard wanted it .  lots of wizards wanted to be archchancellor  for example  or the head of one of the eight orders of magic  but practically no wizards wanted to spend lots of time in an office shuffling bits of paper and doing sums .  all the paperwork of the university tended to accumulate in the bursar   s office  which meant that he went to bed tired at nights but at least slept soundly and didn   t have to check very hard for unexpected scorpions in his nightshirt .   killing off a wizard of a higher grade was a recognized way of getting advancement in the orders .  however  the only person likely to want to kill the bursar was someone else who derived a quiet pleasure from columns of numbers  all neatly arranged  and people like that don   t often go in for murder .    he recalled his childhood  long ago  in the ramtop mountains .  he and his sister used to leave a glass of wine and a cake out every hogswatch night for the hogfather .  things had been different  then .  he   d been a lot younger and hadn   t known much and had probably been a lot happier .   for example  he hadn   t known that he might one day be a wizard and join other wizards in leaving a glass of wine and a cake and a rather suspect chicken vol au vent and a paper party hat for        someone else .   there   d been hogswatch parties  too  when he was a little boy .  they   d always follow a certain pattern .  just when all the children were nearly sick with excitement  one of the grown ups would say  archly     i think we   re going to have a special visitor .     and  amazingly on cue  there   d be a suspicious ringing of hog bells outside the window and in would come        in would come     the bursar shook his head .  someone   s grandad in false whiskers  of course .  some jolly old boy with a sack of toys  stamping the snow off his boots .  someone who gave you something .   whereas tonight     of course  old windle probably felt different about it .  after one hundred and thirty years  death probably had a certain attraction .  you probably became quite interested in finding out what happened next .   the archchancellor   s convoluted anecdote wound jerkily to its close .  the assembled wizards laughed dutifully  and then tried to work out the joke .   the bursar looked surreptitiously at his watch .  it was now twenty minutes past nine .   windle poons made a speech .  it was long and rambling and disjointed and went on about the good old days and he seemed to think that most of the people around him were people who had been  in fact  dead for about fifty years  but that didn   t matter because you got into the habit of not listening to old windle .   the bursar couldn   t tear his eyes away from his watch .  from inside came the squeak of the treadle as the demon patiently pedalled his way toward infinity .   twenty five minutes past the hour .   the bursar wondered how it was supposed to happen .  did you hear   i think we   re going to have a very special visitor   hoofbeats outside .   did the door actually open or did he come through it .  silly question .  he was renowned for his ability to get into sealed places   especially into sealed places  if you thought about it logically .  seal yourself in anywhere and it was only a matter of time .   the bursar hoped he   d use the door properly .  his nerves were twanging as it was .   the conversational level was dropping .  quite a few other wizards  the bursar noticed  were glancing at the door .   windle was at the center of a very tactfully widening circle .  no one was actually avoiding him  it was just that an apparent random brownian motion was gently moving everyone away .   wizards can see death .  and when a wizard dies  death arrives in person to usher him into the beyond .  the bursar wondered why this was considered a plus        don   t know what you   re all looking at     said windle  cheerfully .   the bursar opened his watch .   the hatch under the    snapped up .      can you knock it off with all this shaking around .     squeaked the demon .     i keeps on losing count .         sorry     the bursar hissed .  it was nine twenty nine .   the archchancellor stepped forward .         bye  then  windle     he said  shaking the old man   s parchment like hand .     the old place won   t seem the same without you .         don   t know how we   ll manage     said the bursar  thankfully .      good luck in the next life     said the dean .     drop in if you   re ever passing and happen to  you know  remember who you   ve been .         don   t be a stranger  you hear .     said the archchancellor .   windle poons nodded amiably .  he hadn   t heard what they were saying .  he nodded on general principles .   the wizards  as one man  faced the door .   the hatch under the    snapped up again .      bing bing bong bing     said the demon .     bingely bingely bong bing bing .         what .     said the bursar  jolted .      half past nine     said the demon .   the wizards turned to windle poons .  they looked faintly accusing .      what   re you all looking at .     he said .   the seconds hand on the watch squeaked onward .      how are you feeling .     said the dean loudly .      never felt better     said windle .     is there anymore of that  mm  rum left .      the assembled wizards watched him pour a generous measure into his beaker .      you want to go easy on that stuff     said the dean nervously .      good health .     said windle poons .   the archchancellor drummed his fingers on the table .      mr .  poons     he said     are you quite sure .      windle had gone off at a tangent .     any more of these toturerillas .  not that i call it proper food     he said     dippin    bits of hard bikky in sludge  what   s so special about that .  what i could do with right now is one of mr .  dibbler   s famous meat pies        and then he died .   the archchancellor glanced at his fellow wizards  and then tiptoed across to the wheelchair and lifted a blue veined wrist to check the pulse .  he shook his head .      that   s the way i want to go     said the dean .      what  muttering about meat pies .     said the bursar .      no .  late .         hold on .  hold on     said the archchancellor .     this isn   t right  you know .  according to tradition  death himself turns up for the death of a wiz           perhaps he was busy     said the bursar hurriedly .      that   s right     said the dean .     bit of a serious flu epidemic over quirm way  i   m told .         quite a storm last night  too .  lots of shipwrecks  i daresay     said the lecturer in recent runes .      and of course it   s springtime  when you get a great many avalanches in the mountains .         and plagues .      the archchancellor stroked his beard thoughtfully .      hmmm     he said .      alone of all the creatures in the world  trolls believe that all living things go through time backward .  if the past is visible and the future is hidden  they say  then it means you must be facing the wrong way .  everything alive is going through life back to front .  and this is a very interesting idea  considering it was invented by a race who spend most of their time hitting one another on the head with rocks .   whichever way around it is  time is something that living creatures possess .   death galloped down through towering black clouds .   and now he had time  too .   the time of his life .      windle poons peered into the darkness .      hallo .     he said .     hallo .  anyone there .  what ho .      there was a distant  forlorn soughing  as of wind at the end of a tunnel .      come out  come out  wherever you are     said windle  his voice trembling with mad cheerfulness .     don   t worry .  i   m quite looking forward to it  to tell the truth .      he clapped his hands  spiritual hands  and rubbed them together with forced enthusiasm .      get a move on .  some of us have got new lives to go to     he said .   the darkness remained inert .  there was no shape  no sound .  it was void  without form .  the spirit of windle poons moved on the face of the darkness .   it shook its head .     blow this for a lark     it muttered .     this isn   t right at all .      it hung around for a while and then  because there didn   t seem anything else for it  headed for the only home it had ever known .   it was a home he   d occupied for one hundred and thirty years .  it wasn   t expecting him back and put up a lot of resistance .  you either had to be very determined or very powerful to overcome that sort of thing  but windle poons had been a wizard for more than a century .  besides  it was like breaking into your own house  the old familiar property that you   d lived in for years .  you knew where the metaphorical window was that didn   t shut properly .   in short  windle poons went back to windle poons .      wizards don   t believe in gods in the same way that most people don   t find it necessary to believe in  say  tables .  they know they   re there  they know they   re there for a purpose  they   d probably agree that they have a place in a well organized universe  but they wouldn   t see the point of believing  of going around saying     o great table  without whom we are as naught .     anyway  either the gods are there whether you believe or not  or exist only as a function of the belief  so either way you might as well ignore the whole business and  as it were  eat off your knees .   nevertheless  there is a small chapel off the university   s great hall  because while the wizards stand right behind the philosophy as outlined above  you don   t become a successful wizard by getting up gods    noses even if those noses only exist in an ethereal or metaphorical sense .  because while wizards don   t believe in gods they know for a fact that gods believe in gods .   and in this chapel lay the body of windle poons .  the university had instituted twenty four hours    lying in state ever since the embarrassing affair thirty years previously with the late prissal    merry prankster    teatar .   the body of windle poons opened its eyes .  two coins jingled onto the stone floor .   the hands  crossed over the chest  unclenched .   windle raised his head .  some idiot had stuck a lily on his stomach .   his eyes swiveled sideways .  there was a candle on either side of his head .   he raised his head some more .   there were two more candles down there  too .   thank goodness for old teatar  he thought .  otherwise i   d already be looking at the underside of a rather cheap pine lid .   funny thing  he thought .  i   m thinking .  clearly .   wow .   windle lay back  feeling his spirit refilling his body like gleaming molten metal running through a mold .  white hot thoughts seared across the darkness of his brain  fired sluggish neurones into action .   it was never like this when i was alive .   but i   m not dead .   not alive and not dead .   sort of non alive .   or un dead .   oh dear     he swung himself upright .  muscles that hadn   t worked properly for seventy or eighty years jerked into overdrive .  for the first time in his entire life  he corrected himself  better make that    period of existence     windle poons    body was entirely under windle poons    control .  and windle poons    spirit wasn   t about to take any lip from a bunch of muscles .   now the body stood up .  the knee joints resisted for a while  but they were no more able to withstand the onslaught of will power than a sick mosquito can withstand a blowtorch .   the door to the chapel was locked .  however  windle found that the merest pressure was enough to pull the lock out of the woodwork and leave fingerprints in the metal of the doorhandle .      oh  goodness     he said .   he piloted himself out into the corridor .  the distant clatter of cutlery and the buzz of voices suggested that one of the university   s four daily meals was in progress .   he wondered whether you were allowed to eat when you were dead .  probably not  he thought .   and could he eat  anyway .  it wasn   t that he wasn   t hungry .  it was just that   well  he knew how to think  and walking and moving were just a matter of twitching some fairly obvious nerves  but how exactly did your stomach work .   it began to dawn on windle that the human body is not run by the brain  despite the brain   s opinion on the matter .  in fact it   s run by dozens of complex automatic systems  all whirring and clicking away with the kind of precision that isn   t noticed until it breaks down .   he surveyed himself from the control room of his skull .  he looked at the silent chemical factory of his liver with the same sinking feeling as a canoe builder might survey the controls of a computerized supertanker .  the mysteries of his kidneys awaited windle   s mastery of renal control .  what  when you got right down to it  was a spleen .  and how did you make it go .   his heart sank .   or  rather  it didn   t .      oh  gods     muttered windle  and leaned against the wall .  how did it work  now .  he prodded a few likely looking nerves .  was it systolic   diastolic   systolic   diastolic    .  and then there were the lungs  too     like a conjuror keeping eighteen plates spinning at the same time   like a man trying to program a video recorder from an instruction manual translated from japanese into dutch by a korean rice husker   like  in fact  a man finding out what total self control really means  windle poons lurched onward .   the wizards of unseen university set great store by big  solid meals .  a man couldn   t be expected to get down to some serious wizarding  they held  without soup  fish  game  several huge plates of meat  a pie or two  something big and wobbly with cream on it  little savory things on toast  fruit  nuts and a brick thick mint with coffee .  it gave him a lining to his stomach .  it was also important that the meals were served at regular times .  it was what gave the day shape  they said .   except for the bursar  of course .  he didn   t eat much  but lived on his nerves .  he was certain he was anorectic  because every time he looked in a mirror he saw a fat man .  it was the archchancellor  standing behind him and shouting at him .   and it was the bursar   s unfortunate fate to be sitting opposite the doors when windle poons smashed them in because it was easier than fiddling with the handles .   he bit through his wooden spoon .   the wizards revolved on their benches to stare .   windle poons swayed for a moment  assembling control of vocal chords  lips and tongue  and then said     i think i may be able to metabolize alcohol .      the archchancellor was the first one to recover .      windle .     he said .     we thought you were dead .      he had to admit that it wasn   t a very good line .  you didn   t put people on a slab with candles and lilies all around them because you think they   ve got a bit of a headache and want a nice lie down for half an hour .   windle took a few steps forward .  the nearest wizards fell over themselves in an effort to get away .      i am dead  you bloody young fool     he muttered .     think i go around looking like this all the time .  good grief .     he glared at the assembled wizardry .     anyone here know what a spleen is supposed to do .      he reached the table  and managed to sit down .      probably something to do with the digestion     he said .     funny thing  you can go through your whole life with the bloody thing ticking away or whatever it does  gurgling or whatever  and you never know what the hell it   s actually for .  it   s like when you   re lying in bed of a night and you hear your stomach or something go pripple ipple goinnng .  it   s just a gurgle to you  but who knows what marvelously complex chemical exchange processes are really going           you   re an undead .     said the bursar  managing to get the words out at last .      i didn   t ask to be     said the late windle poons irritably  looking at the food and wondering how the blazes one went about turning it into windle poons .     i only came back because there was nowhere else to go .  think i want to be here .         but surely     said the archchancellor     didn   t   you know the fella  the one with the skull and the scythe           never saw him     said windle  shortly  inspecting the nearest dishes .     really takes it out of you  this un dyin    .      the wizards made frantic signals to one another over his head .  he looked up and glared at them .      and don   t think i can   t see all them frantic signals     he said .  and he was amazed to realize that this was true .  eyes that had viewed the past sixty years through a pale  fuzzy veil had been bullied into operating like the finest optical machinery .   in fact two main bodies of thought were occupying the minds of the wizards of unseen university .   what was being thought by most of the wizards was  this is terrible  is it really old windle in there  he was such a sweet old buffer  how can we get rid of it .  how can we get rid of it .   what was being thought by windle poons  in the humming  flashing cockpit of his brain  was  well  it   s true .  there is life after death .  and it   s the same one .  just my luck .      well     he said     what   re you going to do about it .         it was five minutes later .  half a dozen of the most senior wizards scurried along the drafty corridor in the wake of the archchancellor  whose robes billowed out behind him .   the conversation went like this      it   s got to be windle .  it even talks like him .         it   s not old windle .  old windle was a lot older .         older .  older than dead .         he   s said he wants his old bedroom back  and i don   t see why i should have to move out           did you see his eyes .  like gimlets .         eh .  what .  what d   you mean .  you mean like that dwarf who runs the delicatessen on cable street .         i mean like they bore into you .            it   s got a lovely view of the gardens and i   ve had all my stuff moved in and it   s not fair           has this ever happened before .         well  there was old teatar           yes  but he never actually died  he just used to put green paint on his face and push the lid off the coffin and shout     surprise  surprise              we   ve never had a zombie here .         he   s a zombie .         i think so           does that mean he   ll be playing kettle drums and doing that bimbo dancing all night  then .         is that what they do .         old windle .  doesn   t sound like his cup of tea .  he never liked dancing much when he was alive           anyway  you can   t trust those voodoo gods .  never trust a god who grins all the time and wears a top hat  that   s my motto .            i   m damned if i   m going to give up my bedroom to a zombie after waiting years for it           is it .  that   s a funny motto .         windle poons strolled around the inside of his own head again .   strange thing  this .  now he was dead  or not living anymore  or whatever he was  his mind felt clearer than it had ever done .   and control seemed to be getting easier  too .  he hardly had to bother about the whole respiratory thing  the spleen seemed to be working after a fashion  the senses were operating at full speed .  the digestive system was still a bit of a mystery  though .   he looked at himself in a silver plate .   he still looked dead .  pale face  red under the eyes .  a dead body .  operating but still  basically  dead .  was that fair .  was that justice .  was that a proper reward for being a firm believer in reincarnation for almost     years .  you come back as a corpse .   no wonder the undead were traditionally considered to be very angry .      something wonderful  if you took the long view  was about to happen .   if you took the short or medium view  something horrible was about to happen .   it   s like the difference between seeing a beautiful new star in the winter sky and actually being close to the supernova .  it   s the difference between the beauty of morning dew on a cobweb and actually being a fly .   it was something that wouldn   t normally have happened for thousands of years .   it was about to happen now .   it was about to happen at the back of a disused cupboard in a tumbledown cellar in the shades  the oldest and most disreputable part of ankh morpork .   plop .   it was a sound as soft as the first drop of rain on a century of dust .         maybe we could get a black cat to walk across his coffin .         he hasn   t got a coffin .     wailed the bursar  whose grip on sanity was always slightly tentative .      okay  so we buy him a nice new coffin and then we get a black cat to walk across it .         no  that   s stupid .  we   ve got to make him pass water .         what .         pass water .  undeads can   t do it .      the wizards  who had crowded into the archchancellor   s study  gave this statement their full  fascinated attention .      you sure .     said the dean .      well known fact     said the lecturer in recent runes flatly .      he used to pass water all the time when he was alive     said the dean doubtfully .      not when he   s dead  though .         yeah .  makes sense .         running water     said the lecturer in recent runes suddenly .     it   s running water .  sorry .  they can   t cross over it .         well  i can   t cross running water  either     said the dean .      undead .  undead .     the bursar was becoming a little unglued .      oh  stop teasing him     said the lecturer  patting the trembling man on the back .      well  i can   t     said the dean .     i sink .         undead can   t cross running water even on a bridge .         and is he the only one  eh .  are we going to have a plague of them  eh .     said the lecturer .   the archchancellor drummed his fingers on his desk .      dead people walking around is unhygienic     he said .   this silenced them .  no one had ever looked at it that way  but mustrum ridcully was just the sort of man who would .   mustrum ridcully was  depending on your point of view  either the worst or the best archchancellor that unseen university had had for a hundred years .   there was just too much of him  for one thing .  it wasn   t that he was particularly big  it was just that he had the kind of huge personality that fits any available space .  he   d get roaring drunk at supper and that was fine and acceptable wizardly behavior .  but then he   d go back to his room and play darts all night long and leave at five in the morning to go duck hunting .  he shouted at people .  he tried to jolly them along .  and he hardly ever wore proper robes .  he   d persuaded mrs .  whitlow  the university   s dreaded housekeeper  to make him a sort of baggy trouser suit in garish blue and red  twice a day the wizards stood in bemusement and watched him jog purposefully around the university buildings  his pointy wizarding hat tied firmly on his head with string .  he   d shout cheerfully up at them  because fundamental to the make up of people like mustrum ridcully is an iron belief that everyone else would like it  too  if only they tried it .      maybe he   ll die     they told one another hopefully  as they watched him try to break the crust on the river ankh for an early morning dip .     all this healthy exercise can   t be good for him .      stories trickled back into the university .  the archchancellor had gone two rounds bare fisted with detritus  the huge odd job troll at the mended drum .  the archancellor had arm wrestled with the librarian for a bet and  although of course he hadn   t won  still had his arm afterward .  the archchancellor wanted the university to form its own football team for the big city game on hogswatchday .   intellectually  ridcully maintained his position for two reasons .  one was that he never  ever  changed his mind about anything .  the other was that it took him several minutes to understand any new idea put to him  and this is a very valuable trait in a leader  because anything anyone is still trying to explain to you after two minutes is probably important and anything they give up after a mere minute or so is almost certainly something they shouldn   t have been bothering you with in the first place .   there seemed to be more mustrum ridcully than one body could reasonably contain .      plop .  plop  in the dark cupboard in the cellar  a whole shelf was already full .      there was exactly as much windle poons as one body could contain  and he steered it carefully along the corridors .   i never expected this  he thought .  i don   t deserve this .  there   s been a mistake somewhere .   he felt a cool breeze on his face and realized he   d tottered out into the open air .  ahead of him were the university   s gates  locked shut .   suddenly windle poons felt acutely claustrophobic .  he   d waited years to die  and now he had  and here he was stuck in this   this mausoleum with a lot of daft old men  where he   d have to spend the rest of his life being dead .  well  the first thing to do was to get out and make a proper end to himself           evening  mr .  poons .      he turned around very slowly and saw the small figure of modo  the university   s dwarf gardener  who was sitting in the twilight smoking his pipe .      oh .  hallo  modo .         i    eard you was took dead  mr .  poons .         er .  yes .  i was .         see you got over it  then .      poons nodded  and looked dismally around the walls .  the university gates were always locked at sunset every evening  obliging students and staff to climb over the walls .  he doubted very much that he   d be able to manage that .   he clenched and unclenched his hands .  oh  well        is there any other gateway around here  modo .     he said .      no  mr .  poons .         well  where shall we have one .         sorry  mr .  poons .      there was the sound of tortured masonry  followed by a vaguely poons shaped hole in the wall .  windle   s hand reached back in and picked up his hat .   modo relit his pipe .  you see a lot of interesting things in this job  he thought .      in an alley  temporarily out of sight of passers by  someone called reg shoe  who was dead  looked both ways  took a brush and a paint tin out of his pocket  and painted on the wall the words   dead yes .  gone no .      and ran away  or at least lurched off at high speed .      the archchancellor opened a window onto the night .      listen     he said .   the wizards listened .   a dog barked .  somewhere a thief whistled  and was answered from a neighboring rooftop .  in the distance a couple were having the kind of quarrel that causes most of the surrounding streets to open their windows and listen in and make notes .  but these were only major themes against the continuous hum and buzz of the city .  ankh morpork purred through the night  en route for the dawn  like a huge living creature although  of course  this was only a metaphor .      well .     said the senior wrangler .     i can   t hear anything special .         that   s what i mean .  dozens of people die in ankh morpork every day .  if they   d all started coming back like poor old windle  don   t you think we   d know about it .  the place   d be in uproar .  more uproar than usual  i mean .         there   s always a few undead around     said the dean  doubtfully .     vampires and zombies and banshees and so on .         yes  but they   re more naturally undead     said the archchancellor .     they know how to carry it off .  they   re born to it .         you can   t be born to the undead     the senior wrangler  pointed out .      i mean it   s traditional     the archchancellor snapped .     there were some very respectable vampires where i grew up .  they   d been in their family for centuries .         yes  but they drink blood     said the senior wrangler .     that doesn   t sound very respectable to me .         i read where they don   t actually need the actual blood     said the dean  anxious to assist .     they just need something that   s in blood .  hemogoblins  i think it   s called .      the other wizards looked at him .   the dean shrugged .     search me     he said .     hemogoblins .  that   s what it said .  it   s all to do with people having iron in their blood .         i   m damn sure i   ve got no iron goblins in my blood     said the senior wrangler .      at least they   re better than zombies     said the dean .     a much better class of people .  vampires don   t go shuffling around the whole time .         people can be turned into zombies  you know     said the lecturer of recent runes  in conversational tones .     you don   t even need magic .  just the liver of a certain rare fish and the extract of a particular kind of root .  one spoonful  and when you wake up  you   re a zombie .         what type of fish .     said the senior wrangler .      how should i know .         how should anyone know  then .     said the senior wrangler nastily .     did someone wake up one morning and say  hey  here   s an idea  i   ll just turn someone into a zombie  all i   ll need is some rare fish liver and a piece of root  it   s just a matter of finding the right one .  you can see the queue outside the hut  can   t you .  no .      red stripefish liver and maniac root   didn   t work .  no .     spikefish liver and dum dum root   didn   t work .  no .               what are you talking about .     the archchancellor demanded .      i was simply pointing out the intrinsic unlikelihood of           shut up     said the archchancellor  matter of factly .     seems to me   seems to me   look  death must be going on  right .  death has to happen .  that   s what bein    alive is all about .  you   re alive  and then you   re dead .  it can   t just stop happening .         but he didn   t turn up for windle     the dean pointed out .      it goes on all the time     said ridcully  ignoring him .     all sorts of things die all the time .  even vegetables .         but i don   t think death ever came for a potato     said the dean doubtfully .      death comes for everything     said the archchancellor  firmly .   the wizards nodded sagely .   after a while the senior wrangler said     do you know  i read the other day that every atom in your body is changed every seven years .  new ones keep getting attached and old ones keep on dropping off .  it goes on all the time .  marvellous  really .      the senior wrangler could do to a conversation what it takes quite thick treacle to do to the pedals of a precision watch .      yes .  what happens to the old ones .     said ridcully  interested despite himself .      dunno .  they just float around in the air  i suppose  until they get attached to someone else .      the archchancellor looked affronted .      what  even wizards .         oh  yes .  everyone .  it   s part of the miracle of existence .         is it .  sounds like bad hygiene to me     said the archchancellor .     i suppose there   s no way of stopping it .         i shouldn   t think so     said the senior wrangler  doubtfully .     i don   t think you   re supposed to stop miracles of existence .         but that means everythin    is made up of everythin    else     said ridcully .      yes .  isn   t it amazing .         it   s disgusting  is what it is     said ridcully  shortly .     anyway  the point i   m making   the point i   m making       he paused  trying to remember .     you can   t just abolish death  that   s the point .  death can   t die .  that   s like asking a scorpion to sting itself .         as a matter of fact     said the senior wrangler  always ready with a handy fact     you can get a scorpion to           shut up     said the archchancellor .      but we can   t have an undead wizard wandering around     said the dean .     there   s no telling what he might take it into his head to do .  we   ve got to   put a stop to him .  for his own good .         that   s right     said ridcully .     for his own good .  shouldn   t be too hard .  there must be dozens of ways to deal with an undead .         garlic     said the senior wrangler flatly .     undead don   t like garlic .         don   t blame them .  can   t stand the stuff     said the dean .      undead .  undead .     said the bursar  pointing an accusing finger .  they ignored him .      yes  and then there   s sacred items     said the senior wrangler .     your basic undead crumbles into dust as soon as look at    em .  and they don   t like daylight .  and if the worst comes to worst  you bury them at a crossroads .  that   s surefire  that is .  and you stick a stake in them to make sure they don   t get up again .         with garlic on it     said the bursar .      well  yes .  i suppose you could put garlic on it     the senior wrangler conceded  reluctantly .      i don   t think you should put garlic on a good steak     said the dean .     just a little oil and seasoning .         red pepper is nice     said the lecturer in recent runes  happily .      shut up     said the archchancellor .      plop .   the cupboard door   s hinges finally gave way  spilling its contents into the room .      sergeant colon of the ankh morpork city guard was on duty .  he was guarding the brass bridge  the main link between ankh and morpork .  from theft .   when it came to crime prevention  sergeant colon found it safest to think big .   there was a school of thought that believed the best way to get recognized as a keen guardian of the law in ankh morpork would be to patrol the streets and alleys  bribe informants  follow suspects and so on .   sergeant colon played truant from this particular school .  not  he would hasten to say  because trying to keep down crime in ankh morpork was like trying to keep down salt in the sea and the only recognition any keen guardian of the law was likely to get was the sort that goes     hey  that body in the gutter  isn   t that old sergeant colon .     but because the modern  go ahead  intelligent law officer ought to be always one jump ahead of the contemporary criminal .  one day someone was bound to try to steal the brass bridge  and then they   d find sergeant colon right there waiting for them .   in the meantime  it offered a quiet place out of the wind where he could have a relaxing smoke and probably not see anything that would upset him .   he leaned with his elbows on the parapet  wondering vaguely about life .   a figure stumbled out of the mist .  sergeant colon recognized the familiar pointy hat of a wizard .      good evening  officer     its wearer croaked .      morning  y   honor .         would you be kind enough to help me up onto the parapet  officer .      sergeant colon hesitated .  but the chap was a wizard .  a man could get into serious trouble not helping wizards .      trying out some new magic  y   honor .     he said  brightly  helping the skinny but surprisingly heavy body up onto the crumbling stonework .      no .      windle poons stepped off the bridge .  there was a squelch .    sergeant colon looked down as the waters of the ankh closed again  slowly .   those wizards .  always up to something .   he watched for a while .  after several minutes there was a disturbance in the scum and debris near the base of one of the pillars of the bridge  where a flight of greasy stairs led down to the water .   a pointy hat appeared .   sergeant colon heard the wizard slowly climb the stairs  swearing under his breath .   windle poons reached the top of the bridge again .  he was soaked .      you want to go and get changed     sergeant colon volunteered .     you could catch your death  standing around like that .         hah .         get your feet in front of a roaring fire  that   s what i   d do .         hah .      sergeant colon looked at windle poons in his own private puddle .      you been trying some special kind of underwater magic  y   honor .     he ventured .      not exactly  officer .         i   ve always wondered about what it   s like under water     said sergeant colon  encouragingly .     the myst   ries of the deep  strange and wonderful creatures   my mum told me a tale once  about this little boy what turned into a mermaid  well  not a mermaid  and he had all these adventures under the s        his voice drained away under windle poons    dreadful stare .      it   s boring     said windle .  he turned and started to lurch away into the mist .     very  very boring .  very boring indeed .      sergeant colon was left alone .  he lit a fresh cigarette with a trembling hand  and started to walk hurriedly toward the watch headquarters .      that face     he told himself .     and those eyes   just like whatsisname   who   s that bloody dwarf who runs the delicatessen on cable street           sergeant .      colon froze .  then he looked down .  a face was staring up at him from ground level .  when he   d got a grip on himself  he made out the sharp features of his old friend cut me own throat dibbler  the discworld   s walking  talking argument in favor of the theory that mankind had descended from a species of rodent .  c . m . o . t .  dibbler liked to describe him as a merchant adventurer  everyone else liked to describe him as an itinerant pedlar whose moneymaking schemes were always let down by some small but vital flaw  such as trying to sell things he didn   t own or which didn   t work or  sometimes  didn   t even exist .  fairy gold is well known to evaporate by morning  but it was a reinforced concrete slab by comparison to some of throat   s merchandise .   he was standing at the bottom of some steps that led down to one of ankh morpork   s countless cellars .      hallo  throat .         would you step down here a minute  fred .  i could use a bit of legal aid .         got a problem  throat .      dibbler scratched his nose .      well  fred   is it a crime to be given something .  i mean  without you knowing it .         someone been giving you things  throat .      throat nodded .     dunno .  you know i keep merchandise down here .     he said .      yeah .         you see  i just come down to do a bit of stocktaking  and       he waved a hand helplessly .     well   take a look        he opened the cellar door .   in the darkness something went plop .      windle poons lurched aimlessly along a dark alley in the shades  arms extended in front of him  hands hanging down at the wrists .  he didn   t know why .  it just seemed the right way to go about it .   jumping off a building .  no  that wouldn   t work  either .  it was hard enough to walk as it was  and two broken legs wouldn   t help .  poison .  he imagined it would be like having a very bad stomach ache .  noose .  hanging around would probably be more boring than sitting on the bottom of the river .   he reached a noisome courtyard where several alleys met .  rats scampered away from him .  a cat screeched and scurried off over the rooftops .   as he stood wondering where he was  why he was  and what ought to happen next  he felt the point of a knife against his backbone .      okay  grandad     said a voice behind him     it   s your money or your life .      in the darkness windle poons    mouth formed a horrible grin .      i   m not playing about  old man     said the voice .      are you thieves    guild .     said windle  without turning around .      no  we   re   freelances .  come on  let   s see the color of your money .         haven   t got any     said windle .  he turned around .  there were two more muggers behind him .      ye gods  look at his eyes     said one of them .   windle raised his arms above his head .      ooooooooh     he moaned .   the muggers backed away .  unfortunately  there was a wall behind them .  they flattened themselves against it .      oooooooooooobuggeroffooooooooo    said windle  who hadn   t realized that the only way of escape lay through him .  he rolled his eyes for better effect .   maddened by terror  the would be attackers dived under his arms  but not before one of them had sunk his knife up to the hilt in windle   s pigeon chest .   he looked down at it .      hey .  that was my best robe .     he said .     i wanted to be buried in   will you look at it .  you know how difficult it is to darn silk .  come back here this   look at it  right where it shows        he listened .  there was no sound but the distant and retreating scurry of footsteps .   windle poons removed the knife .      could have killed me     he muttered  tossing it away .      in the cellar  sergeant colon picked up one of the objects that lay in huge drifts on the floor .      there must be thousands of    em     said throat  behind him .     what i want to know is  who put them there .       sergeant colon turned the object around and around in his hands .      never seen one of these before     he said .  he gave it a shake .  his face lit up .     pretty  ain   t they .         the door was locked and everything     said throat .     and i   m paid up with the thieves    guild .      colon shook the thing again .      nice     he said .      fred .      colon  fascinated  watched the little snowflakes fall inside the tiny glass globe .     hmm .         what am i supposed to do .         dunno .  i suppose they   re yours  throat .  can   t imagine why anyone   d want to get rid of    em  though .      he turned toward the door .  throat stepped into his path .      then that   ll be twelve pence     he said smoothly .      what .         for the one you just put in your pocket  fred .      colon fished the globe out of his pocket .      come on .     he protested .     you just found them here .  they didn   t cost you a penny .         yes  but there   s storage   packing   handling           tuppence     said colon desperately .      tenpence .         threepence .         sevenpence   and that   s cutting my own throat  mark you .         done     said the sergeant  reluctantly .  he gave the globe another shake .      nice  ain   t they .     he said .      worth every penny     said dibbler .  he rubbed his hands together hopefully .     should sell like hot cakes     he said  picking up a handful and shoving them into a box .   he locked the door behind them when they left .   in the darkness something went plop .      ankh morpork has always had a fine tradition of welcoming people of all races  colors and shapes  if they have money to spend and a return ticket .   according to the guild of merchants    famous publication  wellcome to ankh morporke  citie of one thousand surprises     you the visitor will be assured of a warm wellcome in the countles ins and hostelries of this ancient citie  where many specialize in catoring for the taste of guest from distant part .  so if you a manne  trolle  dwarfe  goblin or gnomm  annk morporke will raise your glass convivial and say  cheer .  here looking  you kid .  up  you bottom .      windle poons didn   t know where undead went for a good time .  all he knew  and he knew it for a certainty  was that if they could have a good time anywhere then they could probably have it in ankh morpork .   his labored footsteps led him deeper into the shades .  only they weren   t so labored now .   for more than a century windle poons had lived inside the walls of unseen university .  in terms of accumulated years  he may have lived a long time .  in terms of experience  he was about thirteen .   he was seeing  hearing and smelling things he   d never seen  heard or smelled before .   the shades was the oldest part of the city .  if you could do a sort of relief map of sinfulness  wickedness and all around immorality  rather like those representations of the gravitational field around a black hole  then even in ankh morpork the shades would be represented by a shaft .  in fact the shades was remarkably like the aforesaid well known astronomical phenomenon  it had a certain strong attraction  no light escaped from it  and it could indeed become a gateway to another world .  the next one .   the shades was a city within a city .   the streets were thronged .  muffled figures slunk past on errands of their own .  strange music wound up from sunken stairwells .  so did sharp and exciting smells .   poons passed goblin delicatessens and dwarf bars  from which came the sounds of singing and fighting  which dwarfs traditionally did at the same time .  and there were trolls  moving through the crowds like   like big people moving among little people .  they weren   t shambling  either .   windle had hitherto seen trolls only in the more select parts of the city   where they moved with exaggerated caution in case they accidentally clubbed someone to death and ate them .  in the shades they strode  unafraid  heads held so high they very nearly rose above their shoulder blades .   windle poons wandered through the crowds like a random shot on a pinball table .  here a blast of smoky sound from a bar spun him back into the street  there a discreet doorway promising unusual and forbidden delights attracted him like a magnet .  windle poons    life hadn   t included even very many usual and approved delights .  he wasn   t even certain what they were .  some sketches outside one pink lit  inviting doorway left him even more mystified but incredibly anxious to learn .   he turned around and around in pleased astonishment .   this place .  only ten minutes    walk or fifteen minutes    lurch from the university .  and he   d never known it was there .  all these people .  all this noise .  all this life .   several people of various shapes and species jostled him .  one or two started to say something  shut their mouths quickly  and hurried off .   they were thinking   his eyes .  like gimlets .   and then a voice from the shadows said     hallo  big boy .  you want a nice time .         oh  yes .     said windle poons  lost in wonder .     oh  yes .  yes .      he turned around .      bloody hell .     there was the sound of someone hurrying away down an alley .   windle   s face fell .   life  obviously  was only for the living .  perhaps this back to your body business had been a mistake after all .  he   d been a fool to think otherwise .   he turned and  hardly bothering to keep his own heart beating  went back to the university .      windle trudged across the quad to the great hall .  the archchancellor would know what to do        there he is .         it   s him .         get him .      windle   s train of thought ran over a cliff .  he looked around at five red  worried  and above all familiar faces .      oh  hallo  dean     he said  unhappily .     and is that the senior wrangler .  oh  and the archchancellor  this is           grab his arm .         don   t look at his eyes .         grab his other arm .         this is for your own good  windle .         it   s not windle .  it   s a creature of the night .         i assure you           have you got his legs .         grab his leg .         grab his other leg .         have you grabbed everything .     roared the archchancellor .   the wizards nodded .   mustrum ridcully reached into the massive recesses of his robe .      right  fiend in human shape     he growled     what d   you think of this  then .  ah ha .      windle squinted at the small object that was thrust triumphantly under his nose .      well  er       he said diffidently     i   d say   yes   hmm   yes  the smell is very distinctive  isn   t it   yes  quite definitely .  allium sativum .  the common domestic garlic .  yes .      the wizards stared at him .  they stared at the little white clove .  they stared at windle again .      i am right  aren   t i .     he said  and made an attempt at a smile .      er     said the archchancellor .     yes .  yes  that   s right .     ridcully cast around for something to add .     well done     he said .      thank you for trying     said windle .     i really appreciate it .     he stepped forward .  the wizards might as well have tried to hold back a glacier .      and now i   m going to have a lie down     he said .     it   s been a long day .      he lurched into the building and creaked along the corridors until he reached his room .  someone else seemed to have moved some of their stuff into it  but windle dealt with that by simply picking it all up in one sweep of his arms and throwing it out into the corridor .   then he lay down on the bed .   sleep .  well  he was tired .  that was a start .  but sleeping meant letting go of control  and he wasn   t too certain that all the systems were fully functional yet .   anyway  when you got right down to it  did he have to sleep at all .  after all  he was dead .  that was supposed to be just like sleeping  only even more so .  they said that dying was just like going to sleep  although of course if you weren   t careful bits of you could rot and drop off .   what were you supposed to do when you slept  anyway .  dreaming   wasn   t that all to do with sorting out your memories  or something .  how did you go about it .   he stared at the ceiling .      i never thought being dead would be so much trouble     he said aloud .   after a while a faint but insistent squeaking noise made him turn his head .   over the fireplace was an ornamental candlestick  fixed to a bracket on the wall .  it was such a familiar piece of furniture that windle hadn   t really seen it for fifty years .   it was coming unscrewed .  it spun around slowly  squeaking once a turn .  after half a dozen turns it fell off and clattered to the floor .   inexplicable phenomena were not in themselves unusual on the discworld .   it was just that they normally had more point  or at least were a bit more interesting .   nothing else seemed to be about to move .  windle relaxed  and went back to organizing his memories .  there was stuff in there he   d completely forgotten about .   there was a brief whispering outside  and then the door burst open        get his legs .  get his legs .         hold his arms .      windle tried to sit up .     oh  hallo  everyone     he said .     what   s the matter .      the archchancellor  standing at the foot of the bed  fumbled in a sack and produced a large  heavy object .   he held it aloft .      ah ha .     he said .   windle peered at it .      yes .     he said  helpfully .      ah ha     said the archchancellor again  but with slightly less conviction .      it   s a symbolic double handled axe from the cult of blind io     said windle .   the archchancellor gave him a blank look .      er  yes     he said     that   s right .     he threw it over his shoulder  almost removing the dean   s left ear  and fished in the sack again .      ah ha .         that   s a rather fine example of the mystic tooth of offler the crocodile god     said windle .      ah ha .         and that   s a   let me see now   yes  that   s the matched set of sacred flying ducks of ordpor the tasteless .  i say  this is fun .         ah ha .         that   s   don   t tell me  don   t tell me   that   s the holy linglong of the notorious sootee cult  isn   t it .         ah ha .         i think that one   s the three headed fish of the howanda three headed fish religion     said windle .      this is ridiculous     said the archchancellor  dropping the fish .   the wizards sagged .  religious objects weren   t such a surefire undead cure after all .      i   m really sorry to be such a nuisance     said windle .   the dean suddenly brightened up .      daylight .     he said excitedly .     that   ll do the trick .         get the curtain .         get the other curtain .         one  two  three   now .      windle blinked in the invasive sunlight .   the wizards held their breath .      i   m sorry     he said .     it doesn   t seem to work .      they sagged again .      don   t you feel anything .     said ridcully .      no sensation of crumbling into dust and blowing away .     said the senior wrangler hopefully .      my nose tends to peel if i   m out in the sun too long     said windle .     i don   t know if that   s any help .     he tried to smile .   the wizards looked at one another and shrugged .      get out     said the archchancellor .  they trooped out .   ridcully followed them .  he paused at the door and waved a finger at windle .      this uncooperative attitude  windle  is not doing you any good     he said  and slammed the door behind him .   after a few seconds the four screws holding the door handle very slowly unscrewed themselves .  they rose up and orbited near the ceiling for a while  and then fell .   windle thought about this for a while .   memories .  he had lots of them .  one hundred and thirty years of memories .  when he was alive he hadn   t been able to remember one hundredth of the things he knew but now he was dead  his mind uncluttered with everything except the single silver thread of his thoughts  he could feel them all there .  everything he   d ever read  everything he   d ever seen  everything he   d ever heard .  all there  ranged in ranks .  nothing forgotten .  everything in its place .   three inexplicable phenomena in one day .  four  if you included the fact of his continued existence .  that was really inexplicable .   it needed explicating .   well  that was someone else   s problem .  everything was someone else   s problem now .      the wizards crouched outside the door of windle   s room .      got everything .     said ridcully .      why can   t we get some of the servants to do it .     muttered the senior wrangler .     it   s undignified .         because i want it done properly and with dignity     snapped the archchancellor .     if anyone   s going to bury a wizard at a crossroads with a stake hammered through him  then wizards ought to do it .  after all  we   re his friends .         what is this thing  anyway .     said the dean  inspecting the implement in his hands .      it   s called a shovel     said the senior wrangler .     i   ve seen the gardeners use them .  you stick the sharp end in the ground .  then it gets a bit technical .      ridcully squinted through the keyhole .      he   s lying down again    he said .  he got up  brushing the dust off his knees  and grasped the door handle .     right     he said .     take your time from me .  one   two        modo the gardener was trundling a barrow load of hedge trimmings to a bonfire behind the new high energy magic research building when about half a dozen wizards went past at  for wizards  high speed .  windle poons was being borne aloft between them .   modo heard him say     really  archchancellor  are you quite sure this one will work    .         we   ve got your best interests at heart     said ridcully .      i   m sure  but           we   ll soon have you feeling your old self again     said the bursar .      no  we won   t     hissed the dean .     that   s the whole point .         we   ll soon have you not feeling your old self again  that   s the whole point     stuttered the bursar  as they rounded the corner .   modo picked up the handles of the barrow again and pushed it thoughtfully toward the secluded area where he kept his bonfire  his compost heaps  his leaf mold pile  and the little shed he sat in when it rained .   he used to be assistant gardener at the palace  but this job was a lot more interesting .  you really got to see life .      ankh morpork society is street society .  there is always something interesting going on .  at the moment  the driver of a two horse fruit wagon was holding the dean six inches in the air by the scruff of the dean   s robe and was threatening to push the dean   s face through the back of the dean   s head .      it   s peaches  right .     he kept bellowing .     you know what happens to peaches what lies around too long .  they get bruised .  lots of things around here are going to get bruised .         i am a wizard  you know     said the dean  his pointy shoes dangling .     if it wasn   t for the fact that it would be against the rules for me to use magic in anything except a purely defensive manner  you would definitely be in a lot of trouble .         what you doing  anyway .     said the driver  lowering the dean so he could look suspiciously over his shoulder .      yeah     said a man trying to control the team pulling a lumber wagon     what   s going on .  there   s people here being paid by the hour  you know .         move along at the front there .      the lumber driver turned in his seat and addressed the queue of carts behind him .     i   m trying to     he said .     it   s not my fault  is it .  there   s a load of wizards digging up the godsdamn street .      the archchancellor   s muddy face peered over the edge of the hole .      oh  for heaven   s sake  dean     he said     i told you to sort things out .         yes  i was just asking this gentleman to back up and go another way     said the dean  who was afraid he was beginning to choke .   the fruiterer turned him around so that he could see along the crowded streets .     ever tried to back up sixty carts all at once .     he demanded .     it   s not easy .  especially when everyone can   t move because you guys have got it so   s the carts are backed up all around the block and no one can move because everyone   s in someone else   s way  right .      the dean tried to nod .  he had wondered himself about the wisdom of digging the hole at the junction of the street of small gods and broad way  two of the busiest streets in ankh morpork .  it had seemed logical at the time .  even the most persistent undead ought to stay decently buried under that amount of traffic .  the only problem was that no one had thought seriously about the difficulty of digging up a couple of main streets during the busy time of day .      all right  all right  what   s going on here .      the crowd of spectators opened to admit the bulky figure of sergeant colon of the watch .  he moved through the people unstoppably  his stomach leading the way .  when he saw the wizards  waist deep in a hole in the middle of the road  his huge red face brightened up .      what   s this  then .     he said .     a gang of international crossroads thieves .      he was overjoyed .  his long term policing strategy was paying off .   the archchancellor tipped a shovelful of ankh morpork loam over his boots .      don   t be stupid  man     he snapped .     this is vitally important .         oh  yes .  that   s what they all say     said sergeant colon  not a man to be easily steered from a particular course of thought once he   d got up to mental speed .     i bet there   s hundreds of villages in heathen places like klatch that   d pay good money for a nice prestigious crossroads like this  eh .      ridcully looked up at him with his mouth open .      what are you gabbling about  officer .     he said .  he pointed irritably to his pointy hat .     didn   t you hear me .  we   re wizards .  this is wizard business .  so if you could just sort of direct the traffic around us  there   s a good chap              these peaches bruise as soon as you even look at    em       said a voice behind sergeant colon .      the old idiots have been holding us up for half an hour     said a cattle drover who had long ago lost control of forty steers now wandering aimlessly around the nearby streets .     i wants    em arrested .      it dawned on the sergeant that he had inadvertently placed himself center stage in a drama involving hundreds of people  some of them wizards and all of them angry .      what are you doing  then .     he said weakly .      we   re burying our colleague .  what does it look like .     said ridcully .   colon   s eyes swiveled to an open coffin by the side of the road .  windle poons gave him a little wave .      but   he   s not dead   is he .     he said  his forehead wrinkling as he tried to get ahead of the situation .      appearances can be deceptive     said the archchancellor .      but he just waved to me     said the sergeant  desperately .     so .         well  it   s not normal for           it   s all right  sergeant     said windle .   sergeant colon sidled closer to the coffin .      didn   t i see you throw yourself into the river last night .     he said  out of the corner of his mouth .      yes .  you were very helpful     said windle .      and then you threw yourself sort of out again     said the sergeant .      i   m afraid so .         but you were down there for ages .         well  it was very dark  you see .  i couldn   t find the steps .      sergeant colon had to concede the logic of this .      well  i suppose you must be dead  then     he said .     no one could stay down there who wasn   t dead .         this is it     windle agreed .      only why are you waving and talking .     said colon .   the senior wrangler poked his head out of the hole .      it   s not unknown for a dead body to move and make noises after death  sergeant     he volunteered .     it   s all down to involuntary muscular spasms .         actually  senior wrangler is right     said windle poons .     i read that somewhere .         oh .     sergeant colon looked around .     right     he said  uncertainly .     well   fair enough  i suppose           okay  we   re done     said the archchancellor  scrambling out of the hole     it   s deep enough .  come on  windle  down you go .         i really am very touched  you know     said windle  lying back in the coffin .  it was quite a good one  from the mortuary in elm street .  the archchancellor had let him choose it himself .   ridcully picked up a mallet .   windle sat up again .      everyone   s going to so much trouble           yes  right     said ridcully  looking around .     now   who   s got the stake .      everyone looked at the bursar .   the bursar looked unhappy .   he fumbled in a bag .      i couldn   t get any     he said .   the archchancellor put his hand over his eyes .      all right     he said quietly .     you know  i   m not surprised .  not surprised at all .  what did you get .  lamb chops .  a nice piece of pork .         celery     said the bursar .      it   s his nerves     said the dean  quickly .      celery     said the archchancellor  his self control rigid enough to bend horsehoes around .     right .      the bursar handed him a soggy green bundle .  ridcully took it .      now  windle     he said     i   d like you to imagine that what i have in my hand           it   s quite all right     said windle .      i   m not actually sure i can hammer           i don   t mind  i assure you     said windle .      you don   t .         the principle is sound     said windle .     if you just hand me the celery but think hammering a stake  that   s probably sufficient .         that   s very decent of you     said ridcully .     that shows a very proper spirit .         esprit de corpse     said the senior wrangler .   ridcully glared at him  and thrust the celery dramatically toward windle .      take that .     he said .      thank you     said windle .      and now let   s put the lid on and go and have some lunch     said ridcully .     don   t worry  windle .  it   s bound to work .  today is the last day of the rest of your life .      windle lay in the darkness  listening to the hammering .  there was a thump and a muffled imprecation against the dean for not holding the end properly .  and then the patter of soil on the lid  getting fainter and more distant .   after a while a distant rumbling suggested that the commerce of the city was being resumed .  he could even hear muffled voices .   he banged on the coffin lid .      can you keep it down .     he demanded .     there   s people down here trying to be dead .      he heard the voices stop .  there was the sound of feet hurrying away .   windle lay there for some time .  he didn   t know how long .  he tried stopping all functions  but that just made things uncomfortable .  why was dying so difficult .  other people seemed to manage it  even without practice .   also  his leg itched .   he tried to reach down to scratch it  and his hand touched something small and irregularly shaped .  he managed to get his fingers around it .   it felt like a bundle of matches .   in a coffin .  did anyone think he   d smoke a quiet cigar to pass the time .   after a certain amount of effort he managed to push one boot off with the other boot and ease it up until he could just grasp it .  this gave him a rough surface to strike the match on     sulphurous light filled his tiny oblong world .   there was a tiny scrap of cardboard pinned to the inside of the lid .   he read it .   he read it again .   the match went out .   he lit another one  just to check that what he had read really did exist .   the message was still as strange  even third time around       dead .  depressed .   feel like starting it all again .   then why not come along to the  fresh start club  thursdays    pm      elm street  every body welcome    the second match went out  taking the last of the oxygen with it .   windle lay in the dark for a while  considering his next move and finishing off the celery .   who   d have thought it .   and it suddenly dawned on the late windle poons that there was no such thing as somebody else   s problem  and that just when you thought the world had pushed you aside it turned out to be full of strangeness .  he knew from experience that the living never found out half of what was really happening  because they were too busy being the living .  the onlooker sees most of the game  he told himself .   it was the living who ignored the strange and wonderful  because life was too full of the boring and mundane .  but it was strange .  it had things in it like screws that unscrewed themselves  and little written messages to the dead .   he resolved to find out what was going on .  and then   if death wasn   t going to come to him  he   d go to death .  he had his rights  after all .  yeah .  he   d lead the biggest missing person hunt of all time .   windle grinned in the darkness .   missing   believed death .   today was the first day of the rest of his life .   and ankh morpork lay at his feet .  well  metaphorically .  the only way was up .   he reached up  felt for the card in the dark  and pulled it free .  he stuck it between his teeth .   windle poons braced his feet against the end of the box  pushed his hands past his head  and heaved .   the soggy loam of ankh morpork moved slightly .   windle paused out of habit to take a breath  and realized that there was no point .  he pushed again .  the end of the coffin splintered .   windle pulled it toward him and tore the solid pine like paper .  he was left with a piece of plank which would have been a totally useless spade for anyone with un zombie like strength .   turning onto his stomach  tucking the earth around him with his impromptu spade and ramming it back with his feet  windle poons dug his way toward a fresh start .      picture a landscape  a plain with rolling curves .   it   s late summer in the octarine grass country below the towering peaks of the high ramtops  and the predominant colors are umber and gold .  heat sears the landscape .  grasshoppers sizzle  as in a frying pan .  even the air is too hot to move .  it   s the hottest summer in living memory and  in these parts  that   s a long  long time .   picture a figure on horseback  moving slowly along a road that   s an inch deep in dust between fields of corn that already promise an unusually rich harvest .   picture a fence of baked  dead wood .  there   s a notice pinned to it .  the sun has faded the letters  but they are still readable .   picture a shadow  falling across the notice .  you can almost hear it reading both the words .   there   s a track leading off the road  toward a small group of bleached buildings .   picture dragging footsteps .   picture a door  open .   picture a cool  dark room  glimpsed through the open doorway .  this isn   t a room that people live in a lot .  it   s a room for people who live out doors but have to come inside sometimes  when it gets dark .  it   s a room for harnesses and dogs  a room where oil skins are hung up to dry .  there   s a beer barrel by the door .  there are flagstones on the floor and  along the ceiling beams  hooks for bacon .  there   s a scrubbed table that thirty hungry men could sit down at .   there are no men .  there are no dogs .  there is no beer .  there is no bacon .      there was silence after the knocking  and then the flap flap of slippers on flagstones .  eventually a skinny old woman with a face the color and texture of a walnut peered around the door .      yes .     she said .   the notice said    man wanted .         did it .  did it .  that   s been up there since before last winter .      i am sorry .  you need no help .   the wrinkled face looked at him thoughtfully .      i can   t pay more   n sixpence a week  mind     it said .   the tall figure looming against the sunlight appeared to consider this .   yes  it said  eventually .      i wouldn   t even know where to start you workin     either .  we haven   t had any proper help here for three years .  i just hire the lazy good fornothin   s from the village when i want    em .   yes .      you don   t mind  then .      i have a horse .   the old woman peered around the stranger .  in the yard was the most impressive horse she   d ever seen .  her eyes narrowed .      and that   s your horse  is it .      yes .      with all that silver on the harness and everything .      yes .      and you want to work for sixpence a week .      yes .   the old woman pursed her lips .  she looked from the stranger to the horse to the dilapidation around the farm .  she appeared to reach a decision  possibly on the lines that someone who owned no horses probably didn   t have much to fear from a horse thief .      you   re to sleep in the barn  understand .     she said .   sleep .  yes .  of course .  yes  i will have to sleep .      couldn   t have you in the house anyway .  it wouldn   t be right .      the barn will be quite adequate  i assure you .      but you can come into the house for your meals .      thank you .      my name   s miss flitworth .      yes .   she waited .      i expect you have a name  too     she prompted .   yes .  that   s right .   she waited again .      well .      i   m sorry .      what is your name .      the stranger stared at her for a moment  and then looked around wildly .      come on     said miss flitworth .     i ain   t employing no one without no name .  mr    .      the figure stared upward .   mr .  sky .      no one   s called mr .  sky .      mr    .  door .   she nodded .      could be .  could be mr .  door .  there was a chap called doors i knew once .  yeah .  mr .  door .  and your first name .  don   t tell me you haven   t got one of those too .  you   ve got to be a bill or a tom or a bruce or one of those names .      yes .      what .      one of those .      which one .      er .  the first one .      you   re a bill .      yes .   miss flitworth rolled her eyes .      all right  bill sky       she said .   door .      yeah .  sorry .  all right  bill door        call me bill .      and you can call me miss flitworth .  i expect you want some dinner .      i would .  ah .  yes .  the meal of the evening .  yes .      you look half starved  to tell the truth .  more than half  really .     she squinted at the figure .  somehow it was very hard to be certain what bill door looked like  or even remember the exact sound of his voice .  clearly he was there  and clearly he had spoken   otherwise why did you remember anything at all .      there   s a lot of people in these parts as don   t use the name they were born with     she said .     i always say there   s nothing to be gained by going around asking pers   nal questions .  i suppose you can work  mr .  bill door .  i   m still getting the hay in off the high meadows and there   ll be a lot of work come harvest .  can you use a scythe .      bill door seemed to meditate on the question for some time .  then he said  i think the answer to that is a definite    yes     miss flitworth .       cut me own throat dibbler also never saw the sense in asking personal questions  at least insofar as they applied to him and were on the lines of    are these things yours to sell .     but no one appeared to be coming forward to berate him for selling off their property  and that was good enough for him .  he   d sold more than a thousand of the little globes this morning  and he   d had to employ a troll to keep up a flow from the mysterious source of supply in the cellar .   people loved them .   the principle of operation was laughably simple and easily graspable by the average ankh morpork citizen after a few false starts .   if you gave the globe a shake  a cloud of little white snowflakes swirled up in the liquid inside and settled  delicately  on a tiny model of a famous ankh morpork landmark .  in some globes it was the university  or the tower of art  or the brass bridge  or the patrician   s palace .  the detail was amazing .   and then there were no more left .  well  thought throat  that   s a shame .  since they hadn   t technically belonged to him   although morally  of course  morally they were his   he couldn   t actually complain .  well  he could complain  of course  but only under his breath and not to anybody specific .  maybe it was all for the best  come to think of it .  stack    em high  sell    em cheap .  get    em off your hands   it made it much easier to spread them in a gesture of injured innocence when you said    who  me .      they were really pretty  though .  except  strangely enough  for the writing .  it was on the bottom of each globe  in shaky  amateurish letters  as if done by someone who had never seen writing before and was trying to copy some down .  on the bottom of every globe  below the intricate little snowflake covered building  were the words       mustrum ridcully  archchancellor of unseen university  was a shameless autocondimentor .   he had his own special cruet put in front of him at every meal .  it consisted of salt  three types of pepper  four types of mustard  four types of vinegar  fifteen different kinds of chutney and his special favorite  wow wow sauce  a mixture of mature scumble  pickled cucumbers  capers  mustard  mangoes  figs  grated wahooni  anchovy essence  asafetida and  significantly  sulfur and saltpetre for added potency .  ridcully inherited the formula from his uncle who  after half a pint of sauce on a big meal one evening  had a charcoal biscuit to settle his stomach  lit his pipe and disappeared in mysterious circumstances  although his shoes were found on the roof the following summer .   there was cold mutton for lunch .  mutton went well with wow wow sauce  on the night of ridcully senior   s death  for example  it had gone at least three miles .   mustrum tied his napkin behind his neck  rubbed his hands together  and reached out .   the cruet moved .   he reached out again .  it slid away .   ridcully sighed .      all right  you fellows     he said .     no magic at table  you know the rules .  who   s playing silly buggers .      the other senior wizards stared at him .      i  i  i don   t think we can play it anymore     said the bursar  who at the moment was only occasionally bouncing off the sides of sanity     i  i  i think we lost some of the pieces        he looked around  giggled  and went back to trying to cut his mutton with a spoon .  the other wizards were keeping knives out of his way at present .   the entire cruet floated up into the air and started to spin slowly .  then it exploded .   the wizards  dripping vinegar and expensive spices  watched it owlishly .      it was probably the sauce     the dean ventured .     it was definitely going a bit critical last night .      something dropped on his head and landed in his lunch .  it was a black iron screw  several inches long .   another one mildly concussed the bursar .   after a second or two  a third landed point down on the table by the archchancellor   s hand and stuck there .   the wizards turned their eyes upward .   the great hall was lit in the evenings by one massive chandelier  although the word so often associated with glittering prismatic glassware seemed inappropriate for the huge  heavy  black  tallow encrusted thing that hung from the ceiling like a threatening overdraft .  it could hold a thousand candles .  it was directly over the senior wizards    table .   another screw tinkled onto the floor by the fireplace .   the archchancellor cleared his throat .      run .     he suggested .   the chandelier dropped .   bits of table and crockery smashed into the walls .  lumps of lethal tallow the size of a man   s head whirred through the windows .  a whole candle  propelled out of the wreckage at a freak velocity  was driven several inches into a door .   the archchancellor disentangled himself from the remains of his chair .      bursar .     he yelled .   the bursar was exhumed from the fireplace .      um  yes  archchancellor .     he quavered .      what was the meanin    of that .      ridcully   s hat rose from his head .   it was a basic floppy brimmed  pointy wizarding hat  but adapted to the archchancellor   s outgoing lifestyle .  fishing flies were stuck in it .  a very small pistol crossbow was shoved in the hatband in case he saw something to shoot while out jogging  and mustrum ridcully had found that the pointy bit was just the right size for a small bottle of bentinck   s very old peculiar brandy .  he was quite attached to his hat .   but it was no longer attached to him .   it drifted gently across the room .  there was a faint but distinct gurgling noise .   the archchancellor leapt to his feet .     bugger that     he roared .     that stuff   s nine dollars a fifth .     he made a leap for the hat  missed  and kept on going until he drifted to a halt several feet above the ground .   the bursar raised a hand  nervously .      possibly woodworm .     he said .      if there is any more of this     growled ridcully     any more at all  d   you hear  i shall get very angry .      he was dropped to the floor at the same time as the big doors opened .  one of the college porters bustled in  followed by a squad of the patrician   s palace guard .   the guard captain looked the archchancellor up and down with the expression of one to whom the word    civilian    is pronounced in the same general tones as    cockroach .         you the head chap .     he said .   the archchancellor smoothed his robe and tried to straighten his beard .      i am the archchancellor of this university  yes     he said .   the guard captain looked curiously around the hall .  the students were all cowering down the far end .  splashed food covered most of the walls to ceiling height .  bits of furniture lay around the wreckage of the chandelier like trees around ground zero of a meteor strike .   then he spoke with all the distaste of someone whose own further education had stopped at age nine  but who   d heard stories        indulging in a bit of youthful high spirits  were we .     he said .     throwin    a few bread rolls around that kind of thing .         may i ask the meaning of this intrusion .     said ridcully  coldly .   the guard captain leaned on his spear .      well     he said     it   s like this .  the patrician is barricaded in his bedroom on account of the furniture in the palace is zooming around the place like you wouldn   t believe  the cooks won   t even go back in the kitchen on account of what   s happening in there        the wizards tried not to look at the spear   s head .  it was starting to unscrew itself .      anyway     the captain went on  oblivious to the faint metallic noises     the patrician calls through the keyhole  see  and says to me     douglas  i wonder if you wouldn   t mind nipping down to the university and asking the head man if he would be so good as to step up here  if he   s not too busy .     but i can always go back and tell him you   re engagin    in a bit of student humor  if you like .      the spearhead was almost off the shaft .      you listening to me .     said the captain suspiciously .      hmm .  what .     said the archchancellor  tearing his eyes away from the spinning metal .     oh .  yes .  well  i can assure you  my man  that we are not the cause of           aargh .         pardon .         the spearhead fell on my foot .         did it .     said ridcully  innocently .   the guard captain hopped up and down .      listen  are you bloody hocus pocus merchants coming or not .     he said  between bounces .     the boss is not very happy .  not very happy at all .         a great formless cloud of life drifted across the discworld  like water building up behind a dam when the sluice gates are shut .  with no death to take the life force away when it was finished with  it had nowhere else to go .   here and there it earthed itself in random poltergeist activity  like flickers of summer lightning before a big storm .   everything that exists  yearns to live .  that   s what the cycle of life is all about .  that   s the engine that drives the great biological pumps of evolution .  everything tries to inch its way up the tree  clawing or tentacling or sliming its way up to the next niche until it gets to the very top   which  on the whole  never seems to have been worth all that effort .   everything that exists  yearns to live .  even things that are not alive .  things that have a kind of sub life  a metaphorical life  an almost life .  and now  in the same way that a sudden hot spell brings forth unnatural and exotic blooms     there was something about the little globes .  you had to pick them up and give them a shake  watch the pretty snowflakes swirl and glitter .  and then take them home and put them on the mantelpiece .   and then forget about them .      the relationship between the university and the patrician  absolute ruler and nearly benevolent dictator of ankh morpork  was a complex and subtle one .   the wizards held that  as servants of a higher truth  they were not subject to the mundane laws of the city .   the patrician said that  indeed  this was the case  but they would bloody well pay their taxes like everyone else .   the wizards said that  as followers of the light of wisdom  they owed allegiance to no mortal man .   the patrician said that this may well be true but they also owed a city tax of two hundred dollars per head per annum  payable quarterly .   the wizards said that the university stood on magical ground and was therefore exempt from taxation and anyway you couldn   t put a tax on knowledge .   the patrician said you could .  it was two hundred dollars per capita  if per capita was a problem  de capita could be arranged .   the wizards said that the university had never paid taxes to the civil authority .   the patrician said he was not proposing to remain civil for long .   the wizards said  what about easy terms .   the patrician said he was talking about easy terms .  they wouldn   t want to know about the hard terms .   the wizards said that there was a ruler back in  oh  it would be the century of the dragonfly  who had tried to tell the university what to do .  the patrician could come and have a look at him if he liked .   the patrician said that he would .  he truly would .   in the end it was agreed that while the wizards of course paid no taxes  they would nevertheless make an entirely voluntary donation of  oh  let   s say two hundred dollars per head  without prejudice  mutatis mutandis  no strings attached  to be used strictly for non militaristic and environmentally acceptable purposes .   it was this dynamic interplay of power blocs that made ankh morpork such an interesting  stimulating and above all bloody dangerous place in which to live .       senior wizards did not often get out and about on what wellcome to ankh morporke probably called the thronged highways and intimate byways of the city  but it was instantly obvious that something was wrong .  it wasn   t that cobblestones didn   t sometimes fly through the air  but usually someone had thrown them .  they didn   t normally float by themselves .   a door burst open and a suit of clothes came out  a pair of shoes dancing along behind it  a hat floating a few inches above the empty collar .  close behind them came a skinny man endeavoring to do with a hastily snatched flannel what normally it took a whole pair of trousers to achieve .      you come back here .     he screamed  as they rounded the corner .     i still owe seven dollars for you .      a second pair of trousers scurried out into the street and hurried after them .   the wizards clustered together like a frightened animal with five pointed heads and ten legs  wondering who was going to be the first to comment .      that   s bloody amazing .     said the archchancellor .      hmm .     said the dean  trying to imply that he saw more amazing things than that all the time  and that in drawing attention to mere clothing running around by itself the archchancellor was letting down the whole tone of wizardry .      oh  come on .  i don   t know many tailors around here who   d throw in a second pair of pants for a seven dollar suit     said ridcully .      oh     said the dean .      if it comes past again  try to trip it up so   s i can have a look at the label .      a bedsheet squeezed through an upper window and flapped away across the rooftops .      y   know     said the lecturer in recent runes  trying to keep his voice calm and relaxed     i don   t think this is magic .  it doesn   t feel like magic .      the senior wrangler fished in one of the deep pockets of his robe .  there was a muffled clanking and rustling and the occasional croak .  eventually he produced a dark blue glass cube .  it had a dial on the front .      you carry one of them around in your pocket .     said the dean .     a valuable instrument like that .         what the hell is it .     said ridcully .      amazingly sensitive magical measuring device     said the dean .     measures the density of a magical field .  a thaumometer .      the senior wrangler proudly held the cube aloft and pressed a button on the side .   a needle on the dial wobbled around a little bit and stopped .      see .     said the senior wrangler .     just natural background  representing no hazard to the public .         speak up     said the archchancellor .     i can   t hear you above the noise .      crashes and screams rose from the houses on either side of the street .      mrs .  evadne cake was a medium  verging on small .   it wasn   t a demanding job .  not many people who died in ankh morpork showed much inclination to chat to their surviving relatives .  put as many mystic dimensions between you and them as possible  that was their motto .  she filled in between engagements with dressmaking and church work   any church .  mrs .  cake was very keen on religion  at least on mrs .  cake   s terms .   evadne cake was not one of those bead curtain and incense mediums  partly because she didn   t hold with incense but mainly because she was actually very good at her profession .  a good conjuror can astound you with a simple box of matches and a perfectly ordinary deck of cards  if you would care to examine them  sir  you will see they are a perfectly ordinary deck of cards   he doesn   t need the finger nipping folding tables and complicated collapsible top hats of lesser prestidigitators .  and  in the same way  mrs .  cake didn   t need much in the way of props .  even the industrial grade crystal ball was only there as a sop to her customers .  mrs .  cake could actually read the future in a bowl of porridge .   she could have a revelation in a panful of frying bacon .  she had spent a lifetime dabbling in the spirit world  except that in evadne   s case dabbling wasn   t really apposite .  she wasn   t the dabbling kind .  it was more a case of stamping into the spirit world and demanding to see the manager .   and  while making her breakfast and cutting up dogfood for ludmilla  she started to hear voices .   they were very faint .  it wasn   t that they were on the verge of hearing  because they were the kind of voices that ordinary ears can   t hear .  they were inside her head .      watch what you   re doing   where am i   quit shoving  there     and then they faded again .   they were replaced by a squeaking noise from the next room .  she pushed aside her boiled egg and waddled through the bead curtain .   the sound was coming from under the severe  no nonsense hessian cover of her crystal ball .   evadne went back into the kitchen and selected a heavy frying pan .  she waved it through the air once or twice  getting the heft of it  and then crept toward the crystal under its hood .   raising the pan ready to swat anything unpleasant  she twitched aside the cover .   the ball was turning slowly around and around on its stand .   evadne watched it for a while .  then she drew the curtains  eased her weight down on the chair  took a deep breath and said     is there anybody there .      most of the ceiling fell in .   after several minutes and a certain amount of struggle mrs .  cake managed to get her head free .      ludmilla .      there were soft footsteps in the passageway and then something came in from the backyard .  it was clearly  even attractively female  in general shape  and wore a perfectly ordinary dress .  it was also apparently suffering from a case of superfluous hair that not all the delicate pink razors in the world could erase .  also  teeth and fingernails were being worn long this season .  you expected the whole thing to growl  but it spoke in a pleasant and definitely human voice .      mother .         oi   m under    ere .      the fearsome ludmilla lifted up a huge joist and tossed it lightly aside .     what happened .  didn   t you have your premonition switched on .         oi turned it off to speak to the baker .  cor  that gave me a turn .         i   ll make you a cup of tea  shall i .         now then  you know you always crushes teacups when it   s your time .         i   m getting better at it     said ludmilla .      there   s a good girl  but i   ll do it myself  thanks all the same .      mrs .  cake stood up  brushed the plaster dust off her apron  and said     they shouted .  they shouted .  all at once .         modo the university gardener was weeding a rose bed when the ancient  velvet lawn beside him heaved and sprouted a hardy perennial windle poons  who blinked in the light .      is that you  modo .         that   s right  mr .  poons     said the dwarf .     shall i give you a hand up .         i think i can manage  thank you .         i   ve got a shovel in the shed  if you like .         no  it   s perfectly all right .     windle pulled himself out of the grass and brushed the soil off the remains of his robe .     sorry about your lawn     he added  looking down at the hole .      don   t mention it  mr .  poons .         did it take long to get it looking like that .         about five hundred years  i think .         gosh  i am sorry .  i was aiming for the cellars  but i seem to have lost my bearings .         don   t you worry about that  mr .  poons     said the dwarf cheerfully .     everything   s growing like crazy anyway .  i   ll fill it in this afternoon and put some more seed down and five hundred years will just zoom past  you wait and see .         the way things are going  i probably will     said windle moodily .  he looked around .     is the archchancellor here .     he said .      i saw them all going up to the palace     said the gardener .      then i think i   ll just go and have a quick bath and a change of clothes .  i wouldn   t want to disturb anyone .         i heard you wasn   t just dead but buried too     said the gardener  as windle lurched off .      that   s right .         can   t keep a good man down  eh .      windle turned back .      by the way   where   s elm street .      modo scratched an ear .     isn   t it that one off treacle mine road .         oh  yes .  i remember .      modo went back to his weeding .   the circular nature of windle poons    death didn   t bother him much .  after all  trees looked dead in the winter  burst forth again every spring .  dried up old seeds went in the ground  fresh young plants sprang up .  practically nothing ever died for long .  take compost  for example .   modo believed in compost with the same passion that other people believed in gods .  his compost heaps heaved and fermented and glowed faintly in the dark  perhaps because of the mysterious and possibly illegal ingredients modo fed them  although nothing had ever been proved and  anyway  no one was about to dig into one to see what was in it .   all dead stuff  but somehow alive .  and it certainly grew roses .  the senior wrangler had explained to modo that his roses grew so big because it was a miracle of existence  but modo privately thought that they just wanted to get as far away from the compost as possible .   the heaps were in for a treat tonight .  the weeds were really doing well .  he   d never known plants to grow so fast and luxuriantly .  it must be all the compost  modo thought .      by the time the wizards reached the palace it was in uproar .  pieces of furniture were gliding across the ceiling .  a shoal of cutlery  like silvery minnows in mid air  flashed past the archchancellor and dived away down a corridor .  the place seemed to be in the grip of a selective and tidy minded hurricane .   other people had already arrived .  they included a group dressed very like the wizards in many ways  although there were important differences to the trained eye .      priests .     said the dean .     here .  before us .      the two groups began very surreptitiously to adopt positions that left their hands free .      what good are they .     said the senior wrangler .   there was a noticeable drop in metaphorical temperature .   a carpet undulated past .   the archchancellor met the gaze of the enormous chief priest of blind io who  as senior priest of the senior god in the discworld   s rambling pantheon  was the nearest thing ankh morpork had to a spokesman on religious affairs .      credulous fools     muttered the senior wrangler .      godless tinkerers     said a small acolyte  peering out from behind the chief priest   s bulk .      gullible idiots .         atheistic scum .         servile morons .         childish conjurors .         bloodthirsty priests .         interfering wizards .      ridcully raised an eyebrow .  the chief priest nodded very slightly .   they left the two groups hurling imprecations at each other from a safe distance and strolled nonchalantly toward a comparatively quiet part of the room where  beside a statue of one of the patrician   s predecessors  they turned and faced one another again .      so   how are things in the godbothering business .     said ridcully .      we do our humble best .  how is the dangerous meddling with things man was not meant to understand .         pretty fair .  pretty fair .     ridcully removed his hat and fished inside the pointy bit .     can i offer you a drop of something .         alcohol is a snare for the spirit .  would you care for a cigarette .  i believe you people indulge .         not me .  if i was to tell you what that stuff does to your lungs        ridcully unscrewed the very tip of his hat and poured a generous measure of brandy into it .      so     he said     what   s happening .         we had an altar float up into the air and drop on us .         a chandelier unscrewed itself .  everything   s unscrewing itself .  you know  i saw a suit of clothes run past on the way here .  two pairs of pants for seven dollars .         hmm .  did you see the label .         everything   s throbbing  too .  notice the way everything   s throbbing .         we thought it was you people .         it   s not magic .  i suppose the gods aren   t more than usually unhappy .         apparently not .      behind them  the priests and the wizards were screaming chin to chin .   the chief priest moved a little closer .      i think i could be strong enough to master and defeat just a little snare     he said .     i haven   t felt like this since mrs .  cake was one of my flock .         mrs .  cake .  what   s a mrs .  cake .         you have   ghastly things from the dungeon dimensions and things  yes .  terrible hazards of your ungodly profession .     said the chief priest .      yes .         we have someone called mrs .  cake .      ridcully gave him an enquiring look .      don   t ask     said the priest  shuddering .     just be grateful you   ll never have to find out .      ridcully silently passed him the brandy .      just between the two of us     said the priest     have you got any ideas about all this .  the guards are trying to dig his lordship out .  you know he   ll want answers .  i   m not even certain i know the questions .         not magic and not gods     said ridcully .     can i have the snare back .  thank you .  not magic and not gods .  that doesn   t leave us much  does it .         i suppose there   s not some kind of magic you don   t know about .         if there is  we don   t know about it .         fair enough     the priest conceded .      i suppose it   s not the gods up to a bit of ungodliness on the side .     said ridcully  clutching at one last straw .     a couple of    em had a bit of a tiff or something .  messing around with golden apples or something .         it   s very quiet on the god front right now     said the chief priest .  his eyes glazed as he spoke  apparently reading from a script inside his head .     hyperopia  goddess of shoes  thinks that sandelfon  god of corridors  is the long lost twin brother of grune  god of unseasonal fruit .  who put the goat in the bed of offler  the crocodile god .  is offler forging an alliance with seven handed sek .  meanwhile  hoki the jokester is up to his old tricks           yes  yes  all right     said ridcully .     i   ve never been able to get interested in all that stuff  myself .      behind them  the dean was trying to prevent the lecturer in recent runes from attempting to turn the priest of offler the crocodile god into a set of matching suitcases  and the bursar had a bad nose bleed from a lucky blow with a thurible .      what we   ve got to present here     said ridcully     is a united front .  right .         agreed     said the chief priest .      right .  for now .      a small rug sinewaved past at eye level .  the chief priest handed back the brandy bottle .      incidentally  mother says you haven   t written lately     he said .      yeah       the other wizards would have been surprised at their archchancellor   s look of contrite embarrassment .     i   ve been busy .  you know how it is .         she said to be sure to remind you she   s expecting both of us over for lunch on hogswatchday .         i haven   t forgotten     said ridcully  glumly .     i   m looking forward to it .     he turned to the m  l  e behind them .      cut it out  you fellows     he said .      brethren .  desist .     bellowed the chief priest .   the senior wrangler released his grip on the head of the high priest of the cult of hinki .  a couple of cu rates stopped kicking the bursar .  there was a general adjustment of clothing  a finding of hats and a bout of embarrassed coughing .      that   s better     said ridcully .     now then  his eminence the chief priest and myself have decided        the dean glowered at a very small bishop .      he kicked me .  you kicked me .         ooo .  i never did  my son .         you bloody well did     the dean hissed .     sideways  so they wouldn   t see .            have decided       repeated ridcully  glaring at the dean     to pursue a solution to the current disturbances in a spirit of brotherhood and goodwill and that includes you  senior wrangler .         i couldn   t help it .  he pushed me .         well .  may you be forgiven .     said the archdeacon of thrume  stoutly .   there was a crash from above .  a chaise longue cantered down the stairs and smashed through the hall door .      i think perhaps the guards are still trying to free the patrician     said the high priest .     apparently even his secret passages locked themselves .         all of them .  i thought the sly devil had    em everywhere     said ridcully .      all locked     said the high priest .     all of them .         almost all of them     said a voice behind him .   ridcully   s tones did not change as he turned around  except that a slight extra syrup was added .   a figure had apparently stepped out of the wall .  it was human  but only by default .  thin  pale  and clad all in dusty black  the patrician always put ridcully in mind of a predatory flamingo  if you could find a flamingo that was black and had the patience of a rock .      ah  lord vetinari     he said     i am so glad you are unhurt .         i will see you gentlemen in the oblong office     said the patrician .  behind him  a panel in the wall slid back noiselessly .      i  um  i believe there are a number of guards upstairs trying to free       the chief priest began .   the patrician waved a thin hand at him .     i wouldn   t dream of stopping them     he said .     it gives them something to do and makes them feel important .  otherwise they just have to stand around all day looking fierce and controlling their bladders .  come this way .         the leaders of the other ankh morpork guilds turned up in ones and twos  gradually filling the room .   the patrician sat gloomily staring at the paperwork on his desk as they argued .      well  it   s not us     said the head of the alchemists .      things are always flying through the air when you fellows are around     said ridcully .      yes  but that   s only because of unforeseen exothermic reactions     said the alchemist .      things keep blowing up     translated the deputy head alchemist  without looking up .      they may blow up  but they come down again .  they don   t flutter around and  e . g .   start unscrewing themselves     said his chief  giving him a warning frown .     anyway  why   d we do it to ourselves .  i tell you  it   s hell in my workshop .  there   s stuff whizzing everywhere .  just before i came out  a huge and very expensive piece of glassware broke into splinters .         marry     twas a sharp retort     said a wretched voice .   the press of bodies moved aside to reveal the general secretary and chief butt of the guild of fools and joculators .  he flinched under the attention  but he generally flinched all the time anyway .  he had the look of a man whose face has been ground zero for one custard pie too many  whose trousers have been too often awash with whitewash  whose nerves would disintegrate completely at the sound of just one more whoopee cushion .  the other guild leaders tried to be nice to him  in the same way that people try to be kind to other people who are standing on the ledges of very high buildings .      what do you mean  geoffrey .     said ridcully  as kindly as he could .   the fool gulped .     well  you see     he mumbled     we have sharp as in splinters  and retort as in large glass alchemical vessel  and thus we get a pun on    sharp retort    which also means  well  a scathing answer .  sharp retort .  you see .  it   s a play on words .  um .  it   s not very good  is it .      the archchancellor looked into eyes like two runny eggs .      oh  a pun     he said .     of course .  hohoho .     he waved a hand encouragingly at the others .      hohoho     said the chief priest .      hohoho     said the leader of the assassins    guild .      hohoho     said the head alchemist .     and  you know  what makes it even funnier is that it was actually an alembic .         so what you   re telling me     said the patrician  as considerate hands led the fool away     is that none of you are responsible for these events .      he gave ridcully a meaningful look as he spoke .   the archchancellor was about to answer when his eye was caught by a movement on the patrician   s desk .   there was a little model of the palace in a glass globe .  and next to it was a paper knife .   the paperknife was slowly bending .      well .     said the patrician .      not us     said ridcully  his voice hollow .  the patrician followed his gaze .   the knife was already curved like a bow .   the patrician scanned the sheepish crowd until he found captain doxie of the city guard day watch .      can   t you do something .     he said .      er .  like what  sir .  the knife .  er .  i suppose i could arrest it for being bent .      lord vetinari threw his hands up in the air .      so .  it   s not magic .  it   s not gods .  it   s not people .  what is it .  and who   s going to stop it .  who am i going to call .      half an hour later the little globe had vanished .  no one noticed .  they never do .   mrs .  cake knew who she was going to call .      you there  one man bucket .     she said .   then she ducked  just in case .   a reedy and petulant voice oozed out of the air .  where have you been .  can   t move in here .      mrs .  cake bit her lip .  such a direct reply meant her spirit guide was worried .  when he didn   t have anything on his mind he spent five minutes talking about buffaloes and great white spirits  although if one man bucket had ever been near white spirit he   d drunk it and it was anyone   s guess what he   d do to a buffalo .  and he kept putting    ums    and    hows    into the conversation .      what d   you mean .     there been a catastrophe or something .  some kind of ten second plague .      no .  don   t think so .     there   s real pressure here  you know .  what   s holding everything up .      what do you mean .      shutupshutupshutup i   m trying to talk to the lady .  you lot over there  keep the noise down .  oh yeah .  sez you     mrs .  cake was aware of other voices trying to drown him out .      one man bucket .      heathen savage  am i .  so you know what this heathen savage says to you .  yeah .  listen  i   ve been over here for a hundred years  me .  i don   t have to take talk like that from someone who   s still warm .  right   that does it  you     his voice faded .   mrs .  cake set her jaw .   his voice came back .      oh yeah .  oh yeah .  well  maybe you was big when you was alive  friend  but here and now you   re just a bedsheet with holes in it .  oh  so you don   t like that  eh        he   s going to start fighting again  mum     said ludmilla  who was curled up by the kitchen stove .     he always calls people    friend    just before he hits them .      mrs .  cake sighed .      and it sounds as if he   s going to fight a lot of people     said ludmilla .      oh  all right .  go and fetch me a vase .  a cheap one  mind .      it is widely suspected  but not generally known  that everything has an associated spirit form which  upon its demise  exists briefly in the drafty gap between the worlds of the living and the dead .  this is important .      no  not that one .  that belonged to your granny .      this ghostly survival does not last for long without a consciousness to hold it together  but depending on what you have in mind it can last for just long enough .      that one   ll do .  i never liked the pattern .      mrs .  cake took an orange vase with pink peonies on it from her daughter   s paws .      are you still there  one man bucket .     she said .      i   ll make you regret the day you ever died  you whining        catch .      she dropped the vase onto the stove .  it smashed .   a moment later  there was a sound from the other side .  if a discorporate spirit had hit another discorporate spirit with the ghost of a vase  it would have sounded just like that .   right  said the voice of one man bucket  and there   s more where that came from  okay .   the cakes  mother and hairy daughter  nodded at each other .   when one man bucket spoke again  his voice dripped with smug satisfaction .   just a bit of an altercation about seniority here  he said .  just sorting out a bit of personal space .  got a lot of problems here  mrs .  cake .  it   s like a waiting room     there was a shrill clamor of other disembodied voices .      could you get a message  please  to mr .         tell her there   s a bag of coins on the ledge up the chimney        agnes is not to have the silverware after what she said about our molly        i didn   t have time to feed the cat  could someone go     shutupshutup .  that was one man bucket again .  you   ve got no idea  have you .  this is ghost talk  is it .  feed the cat .  whatever happened to    i am very happy here  and waiting for you to join me    .      listen  if anyone else joins us  we   ll be standing on one another   s heads     that   s not the point .  that   s not the point  that   s all i   m saying .  when you   re a spirit  there   s things you gotta say .  mrs .  cake .      yes .     you got to tell someone about this .   mrs .  cake nodded .      now you all go away     she said .     i   m getting one of my headaches .      the crystal ball faded .      well .     said ludmilla .      i ain   t going to tell no priests     said mrs .  cake firmly .   it wasn   t that mrs .  cake wasn   t a religious woman .  she was  as has already been hinted  a very religious woman indeed .  there wasn   t a temple  church  mosque or small group of standing stones anywhere in the city that she hadn   t attended at one time or another  as a result of which she was more feared than an age of enlightenment  the mere sight of mrs .  cake   s small fat body on the threshold was enough to stop most priests dead in the middle of their invocation .   dead .  that was the point .  all the religions had very strong views about talking to the dead .  and so did mrs .  cake .  they held that it was sinful .  mrs .  cake held that it was only common courtesy .   this usually led to a fierce ecclesiastical debate which resulted in mrs .  cake giving the chief priest what she called    a piece of her mind .     there were so many pieces of mrs .  cake   s mind left around the city now that it was quite surprising that there was enough left to power mrs .  cake but  strangely enough  the more pieces of her mind she gave away the more there seemed to be left .   there was also the question of ludmilla .  ludmilla was a problem .  the late mr .  cake  gods resthissoul  had never so much as even whistled at the full moon his whole life  and mrs .  cake had dark suspicions that ludmilla was a throwback to the family   s distant past in the mountains  or maybe had contracted genetics as a child .  she was pretty certain her mother had once alluded circumspectly to the fact that great uncle erasmus sometimes had to eat his meals under the table .  either way  ludmilla was a decent upright young woman for three weeks in every four and a perfectly well behaved hairy wolf thing for the rest of the time .   priests often failed to see it that way .  since by the time mrs .  cake fell out with whatever priests  were currently moderating between her and the gods  she had usually already taken over the flower arrangements  altar dusting  temple cleaning  sacrificial stone scrubbing  honorary vestigial virgining  has sock repairing and every other vital religious support role by sheer force of personality  her departure resulted in total chaos .   mrs .  cake buttoned up her coat .      it won   t work     said ludmilla .      i   ll try the wizards .  they ought to be tole     said mrs .  cake .  she was quivering with self importance  like a small enraged football .      yes  but you said they never listen     said ludmilla .      got to try .  anyway  what are you doing out of your room .         oh  mother .  you know i hate that room .  there   s no need           you can   t be too careful .  supposin    you was to take it into your head to go and chase people   s chickens .  what would the neighbors say .         i   ve never felt the least urge to chase a chicken  mother     said ludmilla wearily .      or run after carts  barkin    .         that   s dogs  mother .         you just get back in your room and lock yourself in and get on with some sewing like a good girl .         you know i can   t hold the needles properly  mother .         try for your mother .         yes  mother     said ludmilla .      and don   t go near the window .  we don   t want people upset .         yes  mother .  and you make sure you put your premonition on  mum .  you know your eyesight isn   t what it was .      mrs .  cake watched her daughter go upstairs .  then she locked the front door behind her and strode toward unseen university where  she   d heard  there was too much nonsense of all sorts .   anyone watching mrs .  cake   s progress along the street would have noticed one or two odd details .  despite her erratic gait  no one bumped into her .  they weren   t avoiding her  she just wasn   t where they were .  at one point she hesitated  and stepped into an alleyway .  a moment later a barrel rolled off a cart that was unloading outside a tavern and smashed on the cobbles where she would have been .  she stepped out of the alley and over the wreckage  grumbling to herself .   mrs .  cake spent a lot of the time grumbling .  her mouth was constantly moving  as if she was trying to dislodge a troublesome pip from somewhere in the back of her teeth .   she reached the high black gates of the university and hesitated again  as if listening to some inner voice .   then she stepped aside and waited .      bill door lay in the darkness of the hayloft and waited .  below  he could hear the occasional horsey sounds of binky   a soft movement  the champ of a jaw .   bill door .  so now he had a name .  of course  he   d always had a name  but he   d been named for what he embodied  not for who he was .  bill door .  it had a good solid ring to it .  mr .  bill door .  william door  esq .  billy d   no .  not billy .   bill door cased himself further into the hay .  he reached into his robe and pulled out the golden timer .  there was  quite perceptibly  less sand in the top bulb .  he put it back .   and then there was this    sleep .     he knew what it was .  people did it for quite a lot of the time .  they lay down and sleep happened .  presumably it served some purpose .  he was watching out for it with interest .  he would have to subject it to analysis .      night drifted across the world  coolly pursued by a new day .   there was a stirring in the henhouse across the yard .      cock a doo   er .      bill door stared at the roof of the barn .      cock a doodle   er .      gray light was filtering in between the cracks .   yet only moments ago there had been the red light of sunset .   six hours had vanished .   bill hauled out the timer .  yes .  the level was definitely down .  while he had been waiting to experience sleep  something had stolen part of his   of his life .  he   d completely missed it  too        cock   cock a   er        he climbed down from the loft and stepped out into the thin mist of dawn .   the elderly chickens watched him cautiously as he peered into their house .  an ancient and rather embarrassed looking cockerel glared at him and shrugged .   there was a clanging noise from the direction of the house .  an old iron barrel hoop was hanging by the door  and miss flitworth was hitting it vigorously with a ladle .   he stalked over to investigate .   what for are you making the noise  miss flitworth .   she spun around  ladle half raised .      good grief  you must walk like a cat .     she said .   i must .      i meant i didn   t hear you .     she stood back and looked him up and down .      there   s still something about you i can   t put my finger on  bill door     she said .     wish i knew what it was .      the seven foot skeleton regarded her stoically .  he felt there was nothing he could say .      what do you want for breakfast .     said the old woman .     not that it   ll make any difference     cos it   s porridge .      later she thought  he must have eaten it  because the bowl is empty .  why can   t i remember .   and then there was the matter of the scythe .  he looked at it as if he   d never seen one before .  she pointed out the grass nail and the handles .  he looked at them politely .   how do you sharpen it  miss flitworth .      it   s sharp enough  for goodness sake .      how do you sharpen it more .      you can   t .  sharp   s sharp .  you can   t get sharper than that .      he   d swished it aimlessly  and made a disappointed hissing noise .   and there was the grass  too .   the hay meadow was high on the hill behind the farm  overlooking the cornfield .  she watched him for a while .   it was the most interesting technique she had ever witnessed .  she wouldn   t even have thought that it was technically possible .   eventually she said     it   s good .  you   ve got the swing and everything .      thank you  miss flitworth .      but why one blade of grass at a time .      bill door regarded the neat row of stalks for some while .   there is another way .      you can do lots in one go  you know .      no .  no .  one blade at a time .  one time  one blade .      you won   t cut many that way     said miss flitworth .   every last one  miss flitworth .      yes .      trust me on this .   miss flitworth left him to it and went back to the farmhouse .  she stood at the kitchen window and watched the distant dark figure for a while  as it moved over the hillside .   i wonder what he did .  she thought .  he   s got a past .  he   s one of them men of mystery  i expect .  perhaps he did a robbery and is lying low .   he   s cut a whole row already .  one at a time  but somehow faster than a man cutting swathe by swathe     miss flitworth   s only reading matter was the farmer   s almanac and seed catalogue  which could last a whole year in the privy if no one was ill .  in addition to sober information about phases of the moon and seed sowings it took a certain grisly relish in recounting the various mass murders  vicious robberies and natural disasters that befell mankind  on the lines of    june     year of the impromptu stoat  on this day     yrs .  since  a man killed by freak shower of goulash in quirm    or       die at hands of chume  the notorious herring thrower .      the important thing about all these was that they happened a long way away  possibly by some kind of divine intervention .  the only things that usually happened locally were the occasional theft of a chicken  and the occasional wandering troll .  of course  there were also robbers and bandits in the hills but they got on well with the actual residents and were essential to the local economy .  even so  she felt she   d certainly feel safer with someone else about the place .   the dark figure on the hillside was well into the second row .  behind it  the cut grass withered in the sun .      i have finished  miss flitworth .      go and feed the pig  then .  she   s called nancy .      nancy  said bill  turning the word around in his mouth as though he was trying to see it from all sides .      after my mother .      i will go and feed the pig nancy  miss flitworth .   it seemed to miss flitworth that mere seconds went by .   i have finished  miss flitworth .   she squinted at him .  then  slowly and deliberately  she wiped her hands on a cloth  stepped out into the yard and headed for the pigsty .   nancy was eyeball deep in the swill trough .   miss flitworth wondered exactly what comment she should make .  finally she said     very good .  very good .  you  you  you certainly work   fast .      miss flitworth  why does not the cockerel crow properly .      oh  that   s just cyril .  he hasn   t got a very good memory .  ridiculous  isn   t it .  i wish he   d get it right .         bill door found a piece of chalk in the farm   s old smithy  located a piece of board among the debris  and wrote very carefully for some time .  then he wedged the board in front of the henhouse and pointed cyril toward it .   this you will read  he said .   cyril peered myopically at the    cock a doodle doo    in heavy gothic script .  somewhere in his tiny mad chicken mind a very distinct and chilly understanding formed that he   d better learn to read very  very quickly .      bill door sat back among the hay and thought about the day .  it seemed to have been quite a full one .  he   d cut hay and fed animals and mended a window .  he   d found some old overalls hanging in the barn .  they seemed far more appropriate for a bill door than a robe woven of absolute darkness  so he   d put them on .  and miss flitworth had given him a broad brimmed straw hat .   and he   d ventured the half mile walk into the town .  it wasn   t even a one horse town .  if anyone had a horse  they   d have eaten it .  the residents appeared to make a living by stealing one another   s washing .   there was a town square  which was ridiculous .  it was really only an enlarged crossroads  with a clock tower .  and there was a tavern .  he   d gone inside .   after the initial pause while everyone   s mind had refocused to allow him room  they   d been cautiously hospitable  news travels even faster on a vine with few grapes .      you   d be the new man up at miss flitworth   s     said the barman .     a mr .  door  i did hear .      call me bill .      ah .  used to be a tidy old farm  once upon a time .  we never thought the old girl   d stay on .         ah     agreed a couple of old men by the fireplace .   ah .      new to these parts  then .     said the barman .   the sudden silence of the other men in the bar was like a black hole .   not precisely .      been here before  have you .      just passing through .      they say old miss flitworth   s a loony     said one of the figures on the benches around the smoke blackened walls .      but sharp as a knife  mind     said another hunched drinker .      oh  yes .  she   s sharp all right .  but still a loony .         and they say she   s got boxes full of treasure in that old parlor of hers .         she   m tight with money  i know that .         that proves it .  rich folk are always tight with money .         all right .  sharp and rich .  but still a loony .         you can   t be loony and rich .  you   ve got to be eccentric if you   re rich .      the silence returned and hovered .  bill door sought desperately for something to say .  he had never been very good at small talk .  he   d never had much occasion to use it .   what did people say at times like this .  ah .  yes .   i will buy everyone a drink  he announced .   later on they taught him a game that consisted of a table with holes and nets around the edge  and balls carved expertly out of wood  and apparently balls had to bounce off one another and into the holes .  it was called pond .  he played it well .  in fact  he played it perfectly .  at the start  he didn   t know how not to .  but after he heard them gasp a few times he corrected himself and started making mistakes with painstaking precision  by the time they taught him darts he was getting really good at them .  the more mistakes he made  the more people liked him .  so he propelled the little feathery darts with cold skill  never letting one drop within a foot of the targets they urged on him .  he even sent one ricocheting off a nail head and a lamp so that it landed in someone   s beer  which made one of the older men laugh so much he had to be taken outside into the fresh air .   they   d called him good old bill .   no one had ever called him that before .   what a strange evening .   there had been one bad moment  though .  he   d heard a small voice say     that man is a skelington     and had turned to see a small child in a nightdress watching him over the top of the bar  without terror but with a sort of fascinated horror .   the landlord  who by now bill door knew to be called lifton  had laughed nervously and apologized .      that   s just her fancy     he said .     the things children say  eh .  get on with you back to bed  sal .  and say you   re sorry to mr .  door .         he   s a skelington with clothes on     said the child .     why doesn   t all the drink fall through .      he   d almost panicked .  his intrinsic powers were fading  then .  people could not normally see him   he occupied a blind spot in their senses  which they filled in somewhere inside their heads with something they preferred to encounter .  but the adults    inability to see him clearly wasn   t proof against this sort of insistent declaration  and he could feel the puzzlement around him .  then  just in time  its mother had come in from the back room and had taken the child away .  there   d been muffled complaints on the lines of       a skelington  with all bones on       disappearing around the bend in the stairs .   and all the time the ancient clock over the fireplace had been ticking  ticking  chopping seconds off his life .  there   d seemed so many of them  not long ago     there was a faint knocking at the barn door  below the hayloft .  he heard it pushed open .      are you decent  bill door .     said miss flitworth   s voice in the darkness .   bill door analyzed the sentence for meaning within context .   yes .  he ventured .      i   ve brought you a hot milk drink .      yes .      come on  quick now .  otherwise it   ll go cold .      bill door cautiously climbed down the wooden ladder .  miss flitworth was holding a lantern  and had a shawl around her shoulders .      it   s got cinnamon on it .  my ralph always liked cinnamon .     she sighed .   bill door was aware of undertones and overtones in the same way that an astronaut is aware of weather patterns below him  they   re all visible  all there  all laid out for study and all totally divorced from actual experience .   thank you  he said .   miss flitworth looked around .      you   ve really made yourself at home here     she said brightly .   yes .   she pulled the shawl around her shoulders .      i   ll be getting back to the house  then     she said .     you can bring the mug back in the morning .      she sped away into the night .   bill door took the drink up to the loft .  he put it on a low beam and sat and watched it long after it grew cold and the candle had gone out .   after a while he was aware of an insistent hissing .  he took out the golden timer and put it right at the other end of the loft  under a pile of hay .   it made no difference at all .      windle poons peered at the house numbers   a hundred counting pines had died for this street alone   and then realized he didn   t have to .  he was being shortsighted out of habit .  he improved his eyesight .   number     took some while to find because it was in fact on the first floor above a tailor   s shop .  entrance was via an alleyway .  there was a wooden door at the end of the alley .  on its peeling paintwork someone had pinned a notice which read  in optimistic lettering .          come in .  come in .  .  the fresh start club .  being dead is only the beginning .  .  .        the door opened onto a flight of stairs that smelled of old paint and dead flies .  they creaked even more than windle   s knees .   someone had been drawing on the walls .  the phraseology was exotic but the general tone was familiar enough  spooks of the world arise  you have nothing to lose but your chains and the silent majority want dead rights and end vitalism now .  .  .   at the top was a landing  with one door opening off it .  once upon a time someone had hung on oil lamp from the ceiling  but it looked as though it had never been lit for thousands of years .  an ancient spider  possibly living on the remains of the oil  watched him warily from its eyrie .   windle looked at the card again  took a deep breath out of habit  and knocked .      the archchancellor strode back into college in a fury  with the others trailing desperately behind him .      who is he going to call .  we   re the wizards around here .         yes  but we don   t actually know what   s happening  do we .     said the dean .      so we   re going to find out .     ridcully growled .     i don   t know who he   s going to call  but i   m damn sure who i   m going to call .      he halted abruptly .  the rest of the wizards piled into him .      oh  no     said the senior wrangler .     please  not that .         nothing to it     said ridcully .     nothing to worry about .  read up on it last night     s   matterofact .  you can do it with three bits of wood and           four cc of mouse blood     said the senior wrangler mournfully .     you don   t even need that .  you can use two bits of wood and an egg .  it has to be a fresh egg  though .         why .         i suppose the mouse feels happier about it .         no  i mean the egg .         oh  who knows how an egg feels .         anyway     said the dean     it   s dangerous .  i   ve always felt that he only stays in the octogram for the look of the thing .  i hate it when he peers at you and seems to be counting .         yes     said the senior wrangler .     we don   t need to do that .  we get over most things .  dragons  monsters .  rats .  remember the rats last year .  seemed to be everywhere .  lord vetinari wouldn   t listen to us  oh no .  he paid that glib bugger in the red and yellow tights a thousand gold pieces to get rid of    em .         it worked  though     said the lecturer in recent runes .      of course it bloody worked     said the dean .     it worked in quirm and sto lat as well .  he   d have got away with it in pseudopolis as well if someone hadn   t recognized him .  mr .  so called amazing maurice and his educated rodents .         it   s no good trying to change the subject     said ridcully .     we   re going to do the rite of ashkente .  right .         and summon death     said the dean .     oh  dear .         nothing wrong with death     said ridcully .     professional fellow .  job to do .  fair and square .  play a straight bat  no problem .  he   ll know what   s happening .         oh  dear     said the dean again .   they reached the gateway .  mrs .  cake stepped forward  blocking the archchancellor   s path .   ridcully raised his eyebrows .   the archchancellor was not the kind of man who takes a special pleasure in being brusque and rude to women .  or  to put it another way  he was brusque and rude to absolutely everyone  regardless of sex  which was equality of a sort .  and if the following conversation had not been taking place between someone who listened to what people said several seconds before they said it  and someone who didn   t listen to what people said at all  everything might have been a lot different .  or perhaps it wouldn   t .   mrs .  cake led with an answer .      i   m not your good woman .     she snapped .      and who are you  my good woman .     said the archchancellor .      well  that   s no way to talk to a respectable person     said mrs .  cake .      there   s no need to be offended     said ridcully .      oh blow  is that what i   m doin    .     said mrs .  cake .      madam  why are you answering me before i   ve even said something .         what .         what d   you mean .         what do you mean .         what .      they stared at one another  fixed in an unbreakable conversational deadlock .  then mrs .  cake realized .      oi   m prematurely premoniting again     she said .  she stuck a finger in her ear and wiggled it around with a squelching noise .     it   s all orlright now .  now  the reason        but ridcully had had enough .      bursar     he said     give this woman a penny and send her about her business  will you .         what .     said mrs .  cake  suddenly enraged beyond belief .      there   s too much of this sort of thing these days     said ridcully to the dean  as they strolled away .      it   s the pressures and stresses of living in a big city     said the senior wrangler .     i read that somewhere .  it takes people in a funny way .      they stepped through the wicket gate in one of the big doors and the dean shut it in mrs .  cake   s face .      he might not come     said the senior wrangler  as they crossed the quadrangle .     he didn   t come for poor old windle   s farewell party .         he   ll come for the rite     said ridcully .     it doesn   t just send him an invitation  it puts a bloody rsvp on it .         oh  good .  i like sherry     said the bursar .      shut up  bursar .         there was an alley  somewhere in the shades  which was the most alley ridden part of an alley ridden city .   something small and shiny rolled into it  and vanished in the darkness .   after a while  there were faint metallic noises .      the atmosphere in the archchancellor   s study was very cold .   eventually the bursar quavered     maybe he   s busy .         shut up     said the wizards  in unison .   something was happening .  the floor inside the chalked magic octogram was going white with frost .      it   s never done that before     said the senior wrangler .      this is all wrong  you know     said the dean .     we should have some candles and some cauldrons and some stuff bubbling in crucibles and some glitter dust and some colored smoke           the rite doesn   t need any of that stuff     said ridcully sharply .      it might not need them  but i do     muttered the dean .     doing it without the right paraphernalia is like taking all your clothes off to have a bath .         that   s what i do     said ridcully .      humph .  well  each to his own  of course  but some of us like to think that we   re maintaining standards .         perhaps he   s on holiday .     said the bursar .      oh  yes     sneered the dean .     on a beach somewhere .  a few iced drinks and a kiss me quick hat .         hold on .  hold on .  someone   s coming     hissed the senior wrangler .   the faint outlines of a hooded figure appeared above the octogram .  it wavered constantly  as if it was being seen through superheated air .      that   s him     said the dean .      no it isn   t     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it   s just a gray ro   there   s nothing in        he stopped .   it turned  slowly .  it was filled out  suggesting a wearer  but at the same time had a feeling of hollowness  as if it was merely a shape for something with no shape of its own .  the hood was empty .   the emptiness watched the wizards for a few seconds and then focused on the archchancellor .   it said  who are you .   ridcully swallowed .     er .  mustrum ridcully .  archchancellor .      the hood nodded .  the dean stuck a finger in his ear and waggled it around .  the robe wasn   t talking .  nothing was being heard .  it was just that  afterward  you had a sudden memory of what had just failed to be said and no knowledge of how it had got there .   the hood said  you are a superior being on this world .   ridcully looked at the other wizards .  the dean glared .      well   you know   yes   first among equals and all that sort of thing   yes       ridcully managed .   he was told  we bring good news .      good news .  good news .     ridcully squirmed under the gazerless gaze .     oh  good .  that is good news .      he was told  death has retired .      pardon .      he was told  death has retired .      oh .  that is   news       said ridcully uncertainly .     uh .  how .  exactly   how .      he was told  we apologize for the recent lapse in standards .      lapse .     said the archchancellor  now totally mystified .     well  uh  i   m not sure there   s been a   i mean  of course the fella was always knockin    around  but most of the time we hardly        he was told  it has all been most irregular .      it has .  has it .  oh  well  can   t have irregularity     said the archchancellor .   he was told  it must have been terrible .      well  i   that is   i suppose we   i   m not sure   must it .      he was told  but now the burden is removed .  rejoice .  that is all .  there will be a short transitional period before a suitable candidate presents itself  and then normal service will be resumed .  in the meantime  we apologize for any unavoidable inconvenience caused by superfluous life effects .   the figure wavered and began to fade .   the archchancellor waved his hands desperately .      wait .     he said .     you can   t just go like that .  i command you to stay .  what service .  what does it all mean .  who are you .      the hood turned back toward him and said  we are nothing .      that   s no help .  what is your name .      we are oblivion .   the figure vanished .   the wizards fell silent .  the frost in the octogram began to sublime back into air .      oh oh     said the bursar .      short transitional period .  is that what this is .     said the dean .   the floor shook .      oh oh     said the bursar again .      that doesn   t explain why everything is living a life of its own     said the senior wrangler .      hold on   hold on     said ridcully     if people are coming to the end of their life and leaving their bodies and everything  but death isn   t taking them away           then that means they   re queueing up here     said the dean .      with nowhere to go .         not just people     said the senior wrangler .     it must be everything .  every thing that dies .         filling up the world with life force     said ridcully .  the wizards were speaking in a monotone  everyone   s mind running ahead of the conversation to the distant horror of the conclusion .      hanging around with nothing to do     said the lecturer in recent runes .      ghosts .         poltergeist activity .         good grief .               hang on  though     said the bursar  who had managed to catch up with events .     why should that worry us .  we don   t have anything to fear from the dead  do we .  after all  they   re just people who are dead .  they   re just ordinary people .  people like us .      the wizards thought about this .  they looked at one another .  they started to shout  all at once .   no one remembered the bit about suitable candidates .      belief is one of the most powerful organic forces in the multiverse .  it may not be able to move mountains  exactly .  but it can create someone who can .   people get exactly the wrong idea about belief .  they think it works back to front .  they think the sequence is  first object  then belief .  in fact  it works the other way .   belief sloshes around in the firmament like lumps of clay spiraling into a potter   s wheel .  that   s how gods get created  for example .  they clearly must be created by their own believers  because a brief r  sum   of the lives of most gods suggests that their origins certainly couldn   t be divine .  they tend to do exactly the things people would do if only they could  especially when it comes to nymphs  golden showers  and the smiting of your enemies .   belief creates other things .   it created death .  not death  which is merely a technical term for a state caused by prolonged absence of life  but death  the personality .  he evolved  as it were  along with life .  as soon as a living thing was even dimly aware of the concept of suddenly becoming a non living thing  there was death .  he was death long before humans ever considered him  they only added the shape and all the scythe and robe business to a personality that was already millions of years old .   and now he had gone .  but belief doesn   t stop .  belief goes right on believing .  and since the focal point of belief had been lost  new points sprang up .  small as yet  not very powerful .  the private deaths of every species  no longer united but specific .   in the stream  black scaled  swam the new death of mayflies .  in the forests  invisible  a creature of sound only  drifted the chop chop chop of the death of trees .   over the desert a dark and empty shell moved purposefully  half an inch above the ground   the death of tortoises .   the death of humanity hadn   t been finished yet .  humans can believe some very complex things .   it   s like the difference between off the peg and bespoke .      the metallic sounds stopped coming from the alley .   then there was a silence .  it was the particularly wary silence of something making no noise .   and  finally  there was a very faint jangling sound  disappearing into the distance .         don   t stand in the doorway  friend .  don   t block up the hall .  come on in .      windle poons blinked in the gloom .   when his eyes became accustomed to it  he realized that there was a semi circle of chairs in an otherwise rather bare and dusty room .  they were all occupied .   in the center   at the focus  as it were  of the half circle   was a small table at which someone had been seated .  they were now advancing toward him  with their hand out and a big smile on their face .      don   t tell me  let me guess     they said .     you   re a zombie  right .         er .     windle poons had never seen anyone with such a pallid skin  such as there was of it  before .  or wearing clothes that looked as if they   d been washed in razor blades and smelled as though someone had not only died in them but was still in them .  or sporting a glad to be gray badge .      i don   t know     he said .     i suppose so .  only they buried me  you see  and there was this card       he held it out  like a shield .         course there was .     course there was     said the figure .   he   s going to want me to shake hands  windle thought .  if i do  i just know i   m going to end up with more fingers than i started with .  oh  my goodness .  will i end up like that .      and i   m dead     he said  lamely .      and fed up with being pushed around  eh .     said the greenish skinned one .  windle shook his hand very carefully .      well  not exactly fed           shoe   s the name .  reg shoe .         poons .  windle poons     said windle .     er           yeah  it   s always the same     said reg shoe bitterly .     once you   re dead  people just don   t want to know  right .  they act as if you   ve got some horrible disease .  dying can happen to anyone  right .         everyone  i should have thought     said windle .     er  i           yeah  i know what it   s like .  tell someone you   re dead and they look at you as if they   ve seen a ghost     mr .  shoe went on .   windle realized that talking to mr .  shoe was very much like talking to the archchancellor .  it didn   t actually matter what you said  because he wasn   t listening .  only in mustrum ridcully   s case it was because he just wasn   t bothering  while reg shoe was in fact supplying your side of the conversation somewhere inside his own head .      yeah  right     said windle  giving in .      we were just finishing off  in fact     said mr .  shoe .     let me introduce you .  everyone  this is       he hesitated .      poons .  windle poons .         brother windle     said mr .  shoe .     give him a big fresh start welcome .      there was an embarrassed chorus of    hallos .     a large and rather hairy young man at the end of the row caught windle   s eye and rolled his own yellow eyes in a theatrical gesture of fellow feeling .      this is brother arthur winkings           count notfaroutoe     said a female voice sharply .      and sister doreen   i mean countess notfaroutoe  of course           charmed  i   m sure     said the female voice  as the small dumpy woman sitting next to the small dumpy shape of the count extended a be ringed hand .  the count himself gave windle a worried grin .  he seemed to be wearing opera dress designed for a man several sizes larger .      and brother schleppel        the chair was empty .  but a deep voice from the darkness underneath it said     evenin    .         and brother lupine .     the muscular  hairy young man with the long canines and pointy ears gave windle   s hand a hearty shake .      and sister drull .  and brother gorper .  and brother ixolite .      windle shook a number of variations on the theme of hand .   brother ixolite handed him a small piece of yellow paper .  on it was written one word  ooooeeeeooooeeeeooooeeeee .      i   m sorry there aren   t more here tonight     said mr .  shoe .     i do my best  but i   m afraid some people just don   t seem prepared to make the effort .         er   dead people .     said windle  still staring at the note .      apathy  i call it     said mr .  shoe  bitterly .     how can the movement make progress if people are just going to lie around the whole time .      lupine started making frantic    don   t get him started    signals behind mr .  shoe   s head  but windle wasn   t able to stop himself in time .      what movement .     he said .      dead rights     said mr .  shoe promptly .     i   ll give you one of my leaflets .         but  surely  er  dead people don   t have rights .     said windle .  in the corner of his vision he saw lupine put his hand over his eyes .      you   re dead right there     said lupine  his face absolutely straight .  mr .  shoe glared at him .      apathy     he repeated .     it   s always the same .  you do your best for people  and they just ignore you .  do you know people can say what they like about you and take away your property  just because you   re dead .  and they           i thought that most people  when they died  just   you know   died     said windle .      it   s just laziness     said mr .  shoe .     they just don   t want to make the effort .      windle had never seen anyone look so dejected .  reg shoe seemed to shrink several inches .      how long have you been undead  vindle .     said doreen  with brittle brightness .      hardly any time at all     said windle  relieved at the change of tone .     i must say it   s turning out to be different than i imagined .         you get used to it     said arthur winkings  alias count notfaroutoe  gloomily .     that   s the thing about being undead .  it   s as easy as falling off a cliff .  we   re all undead here .      lupine coughed .      except lupine     said arthur .      i   m more what you might call honorary undead     said lupine .      him being a werewolf     explained arthur .      i thought he was a werewolf as soon as i saw him     said windle  nodding .      every full moon     said lupine .     regular .         you start howling and growing hair     said windle .   they all shook their heads .      er  no     said lupine .     i more sort of stop howling and some of my hair temporarily falls out .  it   s bloody embarrassing .         but i thought at the full moon your basic werewolf always           lupine   s problem     said doreen     is that he approaches it from ze ozzer way  you see .         i   m technically a wolf     said lupine .     ridiculous  really .  every full moon i turn into a wolf man .  the rest of the time i   m just a   wolf .         good grief     said windle .     that must be a terrible problem .         the trousers are the worst part     said lupine .      er   they are .         oh  yeah .  see  it   s all right for human werewolves .  they just keep their own clothes on .  i mean  they might get a bit ripped  but at least they   ve got them handy on  right .  whereas if i see the full moon  next minute i   m walking and talking and i   m definitely in big trouble on account of being very deficient in the trousery vicinity .  so i have to keep a pair stashed somewhere .  mr .  shoe              call me reg              lets me keep a pair where he works .         i work at the mortuary on elm street     said mr .  shoe .     i   m not ashamed .  it   s worth it to save a brother or sister .         sorry .     said windle .     save .         it   s me that pins the card on the bottom of the lid     said mr .  shoe .     you never know .  it has to be worth a try .         does it often work .     said windle .  he looked around the room .  his tone must have suggested that it was a reasonably large room  and had only eight people in it  nine if you included the voice from under the chair  which presumably belonged to a person .   doreen and arthur exchanged glances .      it vorked for artore     said doreen .      excuse me     said windle     i couldn   t help wondering   are you two   er   vampires  by any chance .            s   right     said arthur .     more   s the pity .         hah .  you should not tvalk like zat     said doreen haughtily .     you should be prout of your noble lineage .         prout .     said arthur .      did you get bitten by a bat or something .     said windle quickly  anxious not to be the cause of any family friction .      no     said arthur     by a lawyer .  i got this letter  see .  with a posh blob of wax on it and everything .  blahblahblah   great great uncle   blahblahblah   only surviving relative   blahblahblah   may we be the first to offer our heartiest   blahblahblah .  one minute i   m arthur winkings  a coming man in the wholesale fruit and vegetable business  next minute i find i   m arthur  count notfaroutoe  owner of fifty acres of cliff face a goat   d fall off of and a castle that even the cockroaches have abandoned and an invitation from the burgomaster to drop in down at the village one day and discuss three hundred years of back taxes .         i hate lawyers     said the voice from under the chair .  it had a sad  hollow sound .  windle tried to move his legs a little closer to his own chair .      it voss quite a good castle     said doreen .      a bloody heap of moldering stone is what it was     said arthur .      it had nice views .         yeah  through every wall     said arthur  dropping a portcullis into that avenue of conversation .     i should have known even before we went to look at it .  so i turned the carriage around  right .  i thought  well  that   s four days wasted  right in the middle of our busy season .  i don   t think anymore about it .  next thing  i wake up in the dark  i   m in a box  i finally find these matches  i light one  there   s this card six inches from my nose .  it said              you don   t have to take this lying down        said mr .  shoe proudly .     that was one of my first ones .         it vasn   t my fault     said doreen  stiffly .     you had been lyink rigid for tree dace .         it gave the priest a shock  i can tell you     said arthur .      huh .  priests .     said mr .  shoe .     they   re all the same .  always telling you that you   re going to live again after you   re dead  but you just try it and see the look on their faces .         don   t like priests  either     said the voice from under the chair .  windle wondered if anyone else was hearing it .      i won   t forget the look on the reverend welegare   s face in a hurry     said arthur gloomily .     i   ve been going to that temple for thirty years .  i was respected in the community .  now if i even think of setting foot in a religious establishment i get a pain all down my leg .         yes  but there was no need for him to say what he said when you pushed the lid off     said doreen .     and him a priest  too .  they shouldn   t know those kind of words .         i enjoyed that temple     said arthur  wistfully .     it was something to do on a wednesday .      it dawned on windle poons that doreen had miraculously acquired the ability to use her double yous .      and you   re a vampire too  mrs .  win   i do beg your pardon   countess notfaroutoe .     he inquired politely .   the countess smiled .     my vord  yes     she said .      by marriage     said arthur .      can you do that .  i thought you had to be bitten     said windle .   the voice under the chair sniggered .      i don   t see why i should have to go around biting my wife after thirty years of marriage  and that   s flat     said the count .      every voman should share her husband   s hobbies     said doreen .     it iss vot keeps a marriage inter vesting .         who wants an interesting marriage .  i never said i wanted an interesting marriage .  that   s what   s wrong with people today  expecting things like marriage to be interesting .  and it   s not a hobby  anyway     moaned arthur .     this vampiring   s not all it   s cracked up to be  you know .  can   t go out in daylight  can   t eat garlic  can   t have a decent shave           why can   t you have a       windle began .      can   t use a mirror     said arthur .     i thought the turning into a bat bit would be interesting  but the owls around here are murder .  and as for the   you know   with the blood   well       his voice trailed off .      artore   s never been very good at meetink people     said doreen .      and the worst part is having to wear evening dress the whole time     said arthur .  he gave doreen a sideways glance .     i   m sure it   s not really compulsory .         it iss very important to maintain standerts     said doreen .  doreen  in addition to her here one minute and gone the next vampire accent  had decided to complement arthur   s evening dress with what she considered appropriate for a female vampire  figure hugging black dress  long dark hair cut into a widow   s peak  and very pallid makeup .  nature had designed her to be small and plump with frizzy hair and a hearty complexion .  there were definite signs of conflict .      i should have stayed in that coffin     said arthur .      oh  no     said mr .  shoe .     that   s taking the easy way out .  the movement needs people like you  arthur .  we had to set an example .  remember our motto .         which motto is that  reg .     said lupine wearily .     we have so many .         undead yes   unperson no .     reg said .      you see  he means well     said lupine  after the meeting had broken up .   he and windle were walking back through the gray dawn .  the notfaroutoes had left earlier to be back home before daylight heaped even more troubles on arthur  and mr .  shoe had gone off  he said  to address a meeting .      he goes down to the cemetery behind the temple of small gods and shouts     lupine explained .     he calls it consciousness raising but i don   t reckon he   s onto much of a certainty .         who was it under the chair .     said windle .      that was schleppel     said lupine .     we think he   s a bogeyman .         are bogeymen undead .         he won   t say .         you   ve never seen him .  i thought bogeymen hid under things and  er  behind things and sort of leapt out at people .         he   s all right on the hiding .  i don   t think he likes the leaping out     said lupine .   windle thought about this .  an agoraphobic bogeyman seemed to complete the full set .      fancy that     he said  vaguely .      we only go along to the club to keep reg happy     said lupine .     doreen said it   d break his heart if we stopped .  you know the worst bit .         go on     said windle .      sometimes he brings a guitar along and makes us sing songs like    the streets of ankh morpork    and    we shall overcome .      it   s terrible .         can   t sing  eh .     said windle .      sing .  never mind sing .  have you ever seen a zombie try to play a guitar .  it   s helping him find his fingers afterward that   s so embarrassing .     lupine sighed .     by the way  sister drull is a ghoul .  if she offers you any of her meat patties  don   t accept .      windle remembered a vague  shy old lady in a shapeless gray dress .      oh  dear     he said .     you mean she makes them out of human flesh .         what .  oh .  no .  she just can   t cook very well .         oh .         and brother ixolite is probably the only banshee in the world with a speech impediment  so instead of sitting on roofs and screaming when people are about to die he just writes them a note and slips it under the door        windle recalled a long  sad face .     he gave me one  too .         we try to encourage him     said lupine .     he   s very self conscious .      his arm shot out and flung windle against a wall .      quiet .         what .      lupine   s ears swiveled .  his nostrils flared .   motioning windle to remain where he was  the wereman slunk silently along the alley until he reached its junction with another  even smaller and nastier one .  he paused for a moment  and then thrust a hairy hand around the corner .   there was a yelp .  lupine   s hand came back holding a struggling man .  huge hairy muscles moved under lupine   s torn shirt as the man was hoisted up to fang level .      you were waiting to attack us  weren   t you     said lupine .      who  me    .         i could smell you     said lupine  evenly .      i never        lupine sighed .     wolves don   t do this sort of thing  you know     he said .   the man dangled .      hey  is that a fact     he said .      it   s all head on combat  fang against fang  claw against claw     said lupine .     you don   t find wolves lurking behind rocks ready to mug a passing badger .         get away .         would you like me to tear your throat out .      the man stared eye to yellow eye .  he estimated his chances against a seven foot man with teeth like that .      do i get a choice .     he said .      my friend here     said lupine  indicating windle     is a zombie           well  i don   t know about actual zombie  i think you have to eat some sort of fish and root to be a zom              and you know what zombies do to people  don   t you .      the man tried to nod  even though lupine   s fist was right under his neck .      yeggg     he managed .      now  he   s going to take a very good look at you  and if he ever sees you again           i say  hang on     murmured windle .         he   ll come after you .  won   t you  windle .         eh .  oh  yes .  that   s right .  like a shot     said windle  unhappily .     now run along  there   s a good chap .  okay .         oggay     said the prospective mugger .  he was thinking  ig eyes .  ike imlets .   lupine let go .  the man hit the cobbles  gave windle one last terrified glance  and ran for it .      er  what do zombies do to people .     said windle .     i suppose i   d better know .         they tear them apart like a sheet of dry paper     said lupine .      oh .  right     said windle .  they strolled on in silence .  windle was thinking  why me .  hundreds of people must die in this city every day .  i bet they don   t have this trouble .  they just shut their eyes and wake up being born as someone else  or in some sort of heaven or  i suppose  possibly some sort of hell .  or they go and feast with the gods in their hall  which has never seemed a particularly great idea   gods are all right in their way  but not the kind of people a decent man would want to have a meal with .  the yen buddhists think you just become very rich .  some of the klatchian religions say you go to a lovely garden full of young women  which doesn   t sound very religious to me     windle found himself wondering how you applied for klatchian nationality after death .   and at that moment the cobblestones came up to meet him .   this is usually a poetic way of saying that someone fell flat on their face .  in this case  the cobblestones really came up to meet him .  they fountained up  circled silently in the air above the alley for a moment  and then dropped like stones .   windle stared at them .  so did lupine .      that   s something you don   t often see     said the wereman  after a while .     i don   t think i   ve ever seen stones flying before .         or dropping like stones     said windle .  he nudged one with the toe of his boot .  it seemed perfectly happy with the role gravity had chosen for it .      you   re a wizard           were a wizard     said windle .      you were a wizard .  what caused all that .         i think it was probably an inexplicable phenomenon     said windle .     there   s a lot of them about  for some reason .  i wish i knew why .      he prodded a stone again .  it showed no inclination to move .      i   d better be getting along     said lupine .      what   s it like  being a wereman .     said windle .   lupine shrugged .     lonely     he said .      hmm .         you don   t fit in  you see .  when i   m a wolf i remember what it   s like to be a man  and vice versa .  like   i mean   sometimes   sometimes  right  when i   m wolf shaped  i run up into the hills   in the winter  you know  when there   s a crescent moon in the sky and a crust on the snow and the hills go on forever   and the other wolves  well  they feel what it   s like  of course  but they don   t know like i do .  to feel and know at the same time .  no one else knows what that   s like .  no one else in the whole world could know what that   s like .  that   s the bad part .  knowing there   s no one else        windle became aware of teetering on the edge of a pit of sorrows .  he never knew what to say in moments like this .   lupine brightened up .     come to that   what   s it like  being a zombie .         it   s okay .  it   s not too bad .      lupine nodded .      see you around     he said  and strode off .   the streets were beginning to fill up as the population of ankh morpork began its informal shift change between the night people and the day people .  all of them avoided windle .  people didn   t bump into a zombie if they could help it .   he reached the university gates  which were now open  and made his way to his bedroom .   he   d need money  if he was moving out .  he   d saved quite a lot over the years .  had he made a will .  he   d been fairly confused the past ten years or so .  he might have made one .  had he been confused enough to leave all his money to himself .  he hoped so .  there   d been practically no known cases of anyone successfully challenging their own will     he levered up the floorboard by the end of his bed  and lifted out a bag of coins .  he remembered he   d been saving up for his old age .   there was his diary .  it was a five year diary  he recalled  so in a technical sense windle had wasted about   he did a quick calculation   yes  about three fifths of his money .   or more  when you came to think about it .  after all  there wasn   t much on the pages .  windle hadn   t done anything worth writing down for years  or at least anything he   d been able to remember by the evening .  there were just phases of the moon  lists of religious festivals  and the occasional sweet stuck to a page .   there was something else down there under the floor  too .  he fumbled around in the dusty space and found a couple of smooth spheres .  he pulled them out and stared at them  mystified .  he shook them  and watched the tiny snowfalls .  he read the writing  noting how it wasn   t so much writing as a drawing of writing .  he reached down and picked up the third object  it was a little bent metal wheel .  just one little metal wheel .  and  beside it  a broken sphere .   windle stared at them .   of course  he had been a bit non compos mentis in his last thirty years or so  and maybe he   d worn his underwear outside his clothes and dribbled a bit  but   he   d collected souvenirs .  and little wheels .   there was a cough behind him .   windle dropped the mysterious objects back into the hole and looked around .  the room was empty  but there seemed to be a shadow behind the open door .      hallo .     he said .   a deep  rumbling  but very diffident voice said        s   only me  mr .  poons .      windle wrinkled his forehead with the effort of recollection .      schleppel .     he said .      that   s right .         the bogeyman .         that   s right .         behind my door .         that   s right .         why .         it   s a friendly door .      windle walked over to the door and gingerly shut it .  there was nothing behind it but old plaster  although he did fancy that he felt an air movement .      i   m under the bed now  mr .  poons     said schleppel   s voice from  yes  under the bed .     you don   t mind  do you .         well  no .  i suppose not .  but shouldn   t you be in a closet somewhere .  that   s where bogeymen used to hide when i was a lad .         a good closet is hard to find  mr .  poons .      windle sighed .     all right .  the underside of the bed   s yours .  make yourself at home  or whatever .         i   d prefer going back to lurking behind the door  mr .  poons  if it   s all the same to you .         oh  all right .         do you mind shutting your eyes a moment .      windle obediently shut his eyes .   there was another movement of air .      you can look now  mr .  poons .      windle opened his eyes .      gosh     said schleppel   s voice     you   ve even got a coat hook and everything behind here .      windle watched the brass knobs on the end of his bedstead unscrew themselves .   a tremor shook the floor .      what   s going on  schleppel .     he said .      build up of life force  mr .  poons .         you mean you know .         oh  yes .  hey  wow  there   s a lock and a handle and a brass finger plate and everything behind here           what do you mean  a build up of life force .            and the hinges  there   s a really good rising butts here  never had a door with           schleppel .         just life force  mr .  poons .  you know .  it   s a kind of force what you get in things that are alive .  i thought you wizards knew about this sort of thing .      windle poons opened his mouth to say something like    of course we do     before proceeding diplomatically to find out what the hell the bogeyman was talking about  and then remembered that he didn   t have to act like that now .  that   s what he would have done if he was alive  but despite what reg shoe proclaimed  it was quite hard to be proud when you were dead .  a bit stiff  perhaps  but not proud .      never heard of it     he said .     what   s it building up for .         don   t know .  very unseasonal .  it ought to be dying down around now     said schleppel .   the floor shook again .  then the loose floorboard that had concealed windle   s little fortune creaked  and started to put out shoots .      what do you mean  unseasonal .     he said .      you get a lot of it in the spring     said the voice from behind the door .     shoving the daffodils up out of the ground and that kind of stuff .         never heard of it     said windle  fascinated .      i thought you wizards knew everything about everything .      windle looked at his wizarding hat .  burial and tunnelling had not been kind to it  but after more than a century of wear it hadn   t been the height of haute couture to start with .      there   s always something new to learn     he said .      it was another dawn .  cyril the cockerel stirred on his perch .   the chalked words glowed in the half light .   he concentrated .   he took a deep breath .      dock a loodle fod .      now that the memory problem was solved  there was only the dyslexia to worry about .      up in the high fields the wind was strong and the sun was close and strong .  bill door strode back and forth through the stricken grass of the hillside like a shuttle across a green weave .   he wondered if he   d ever felt wind and sunlight before .  yes  he   d felt them  he must have done .  but he   d never experienced them like this  the way wind pushed at you  the way the sun made you hot .  the way you could feel time passing .   carrying you with it .      there was a timid knocking at the barn door .   yes .      come on down here  bill door .      he climbed down in the darkness and opened the door cautiously .   miss flitworth was shielding a candle with one hand .      um     she said .   i am sorry .      you can come into the house  if you like .  for the evening .  not for the night  of course  i mean  i don   t like to think of you all alone out here of an evening  when i   ve got a fire and everything .      bill door was no good at reading faces .  it was a skill he   d never needed .  he stared at miss flitworth   s frozen  worried  pleading smile like a baboon looking for meaning in the rosetta stone .   thank you  he said .   she scuttled off .   when he arrived at the house she wasn   t in the kitchen .  he followed a rustling  scraping noise out into a narrow hallway and through a low doorway .  miss flitworth was down on her hands and knees in the little room beyond  feverishly lighting the fire .   she looked up  flustered  when he rapped politely on the open door .      hardly worth putting a match to it for one     she mumbled  by way of embarrassed explanation .     sit down .  i   ll make us some tea .      bill door folded himself into one of the narrow chairs by the fire  and looked around the room .   it was an unusual room .  whatever its functions were  being lived in wasn   t apparently one of them .  whereas the kitchen was a sort of roofed over outside space and the hub of the farm   s activities  this room resembled nothing so much as a mausoleum .   contrary to general belief  bill door wasn   t very familiar with funereal decor .  deaths didn   t normally take place in tombs  except in rare and unfortunate cases .  the open air  the bottoms of rivers  halfway down sharks  any amount of bedrooms  yes   tombs  no .   his business was the separation of the wheat germ of the soul from the chaff of the mortal body  and that was usually concluded long before any of the rites associated with  when you got right down to it  a reverential form of garbage disposal .   but this room looked like the tombs of those kings who wanted to take it all with them .   bill door sat with his hands on his knees  looking around .   first  there were the ornaments .  more teapots than one might think possible .  china dogs with staring eyes .  strange cake stands .  miscellaneous statues and painted plates with cheery little messages on them  a present from quirm  long life and happiness .  they covered every flat surface in a state of total democracy  so that a rather valuable antique silver candlestick was next to a bright colored china dog with a bone in its mouth and an expression of culpable idiocy .   pictures hid the walls .  most of them were painted in shades of mud and showed depressed cattle standing on wet moorland in a fog .   in fact the ornaments almost concealed the furniture  but this was no loss .  apart from two chairs groaning under the weight of accumulated antimacassars  the rest of the furniture seemed to have no use whatsoever apart from supporting ornaments .  there were spindly tables everywhere .  the floor was layered in rag rugs .  someone had really liked making rag rugs .  and  above all  and around all  and permeating all  was the smell .   it smelled of long  dull afternoons .   on a cloth draped sideboard were two small wooden chests flanking a larger one .  they must be the famous boxes full of treasure  he thought .   he became aware of ticking .   there was a clock on the wall .  someone had once had what they must have thought was the jolly idea of making a clock like an owl .  when the pendulum swung  the owl   s eyes went backward and forward in what the seriously starved of entertainment probably imagined was a humorous way .  after a while  your own eyes started to oscillate in sympathy .   miss flitworth bustled in with a loaded tray .  there was a blur of activity as she performed the alchemical ceremony of making tea  buttering scones  arranging biscuits  hooking sugar tongs on the basin     she sat back .  then  as if she had been in a state of repose for twenty minutes  she trilled slightly breathlessly     well   isn   t this nice .      yes  miss flitworth .      don   t often have occasion to open up the parlor these days .      no .      not since i lost my dad .      for a moment bill door wondered if she   d lost the late mr .  flitworth in the parlor .  perhaps he   d taken a wrong turning among the ornaments .  then he recalled the funny little ways humans put things .   ah .      he used to sit in that very chair  reading the almanac .      bill door searched his memory .   a tall man  he ventured .  with a mustache .  missing the tip of the little finger on his left hand .   miss flitworth stared at him over the top of her cup .      you knew him .     she said .   i think i met him once .      he never mentioned you     said miss flitworth archly .     not by name .  not as bill door .      i don   t think he would have mentioned me  said bill door slowly .      it   s all right     said miss flitworth .     i know all about it .  dad used to do a bit of smuggling  too .  well  this isn   t a big farm .  it   s not what you   d call a living .  he always said a body has to do what it can .  i expect you were in his line of business .  i   ve been watching you .  that was your business  right enough .      bill door thought deeply .   general transportation  he said .      that sounds like it  yes .  have you got any family  bill .      a daughter .      that   s nice .      i   m afraid we   ve lost touch .      that   s a shame     said miss flitworth  and sounded as though she meant it .     we used to have some good times here in the old days .  that was when my young man was alive  of course .      you have a son .  said bill  who was losing track .   she gave him a sharp look .      i invite you to think hard about the word    miss        she said .     we takes things like that seriously in these parts .      my apologies .      no  rufus was his name .  he was a smuggler  like dad .  not as good  though .  i got to admit that .  he was more artistic .  he used to give me all sorts of things from foreign parts  you know .  bits of jewelry and suchlike .  and we used to go dancing .  he had very good calves  i remember .  i like to see good legs on a man .      she stared at the fire for a while .      see   he never come back one day .  just before we were going to be wed .  dad said he never should have tried to run the mountains that close to winter  but i know he wanted to do it so   s he could bring me a proper present .  and he wanted to make some money and impress dad  because dad was against        she picked up the poker and gave the fire a more ferocious jab than it deserved .      anyway  some folk said he ran away to farferee or ankh morpork or somewhere  but i know he wouldn   t have done something like that .      the penetrating look she gave bill door nailed him to the chair .      what do you think  bill door .     she said sharply .   he felt quite proud of himself for spotting the question within the question .   miss flitworth  the mountains can be very treacherous in the winter .   she looked relieved .     that   s what i   ve always said     she said .     and do you know what  bill door .  do you know what i thought .      no  miss flitworth .      it was the day before we were going to be wed  like i said .  and then one of his pack ponies came back by itself and then the men went and found the avalanche   and you know what i thought .  i thought  that   s ridiculous .  that   s stupid .  terrible  isn   t it .  oh  i thought other things afterward  naturally  but the first thing was that the world shouldn   t act as if it was some kind of book .  isn   t that a terrible thing to have thought .      i myself have never trusted drama  miss flitworth .   she wasn   t really listening .      and i thought  what life expects me to do now is moon around the place in the wedding dress for years and go completely doolally .  that   s what it wants me to do .  hah .  oh  yes .  so i put the dress in the ragbag and we still invited everyone to the wedding breakfast  because it   s a crime to let good food go to waste .      she attacked the fire again  and then gave him another megawatt stare .      i think it   s always very important to see what   s really real and what isn   t  don   t you .      miss flitworth .      yes .      do you mind if i stop the clock .   she glanced up at the boggle eyed owl .      what .  oh .  why .      i am afraid it gets on my nerves .      it   s not very loud  is it .      bill door wanted to say that every tick was like the hammering of iron clubs on bronze pillars .   it   s just rather annoying  miss flitworth .      well  stop it if you want to  i   m sure .  i only keep it wound up for the company .      bill door got up thankfully  stepped gingerly through the forest of ornaments  and grabbed the pine cone shaped pendulum .  the wooden owl glared at him and the ticking stopped  at least in the realm of common sound .  he was aware that  elsewhere  the pounding of time continued none the less .  how could people endure it .  they allowed time in their houses  as though it was a friend .   he sat down again .   miss flitworth had started to knit  ferociously .   the fire rustled in the grate .   bill door leaned back in the chair and stared at the ceiling .      your horse enjoying himself .      pardon .      your horse .  he seems to be enjoying himself in the meadow     prompted miss flitworth .   oh .  yes .      running around as if he   s never seen grass before .      he likes grass .      and you like animals .  i can tell .      bill door nodded .  his reserves of small talk  never very liquid  had dried up .   he sat silently for the next couple of hours  hands gripping the arms of the chair  until miss flitworth announced that she was going to bed .  then he went back to the barn  and slept .      bill door hadn   t been aware of it coming .  but there it was  a gray figure floating in the darkness of the barn .   somehow it had got hold of the golden timer .   it told him  bill door  there had been a mistake .   the glass shattered .  fine golden seconds glittered in the air  for a moment  and then settled .   it told him  return .  you have work to do .  there has been a mistake .   the figure faded .   bill door nodded .  of course there had been a mistake .  anyone could see there had been a mistake .  he   d known all along it had been a mistake .   he tossed the overalls in a corner and took up the robe of absolute blackness .   well  it had been an experience .  and  he had to admit  one that he didn   t want to relive .  he felt as though a huge weight had been removed .   was that what it was really like to be alive .  the feeling of darkness dragging you forward .   how could they live with it .  and yet they did  and even seemed to find enjoyment in it  when surely the only sensible course would be to despair .  amazing .  to feel you were a tiny living thing  sandwiched between two cliffs of darkness .  how could they stand to be alive .   obviously it was something you had to be born to .   death saddled his horse and rode out and up over the fields .  the corn rippled far below  like the sea .  miss flitworth would have to find someone else to help her gather in the harvest .   that was odd .  there was a feeling there .  regret .  was that it .  but it was bill door   s feeling  and bill door was   dead .  had never lived .  he was his old self again  safe where there were no feelings and no regrets .   never any regrets .   and now he was in his study  and that was odd  because he couldn   t quite remember how he   d got there .  one minute on horseback  the next in the study  with its ledgers and timers and instruments .   and it was bigger than he remembered .  the walls lurked on the edge of sight .   that was bill door   s doing .  of course it would seem big to bill door  and there was probably just a bit of him still hanging on .  the thing to do was keep busy .  throw himself into his work .   there were already some lifetimers on his desk .  he didn   t remember putting them there  but that didn   t matter  the important thing was to get on with the job     he picked up the nearest one  and read the name .         lod a foodle wok .      miss flitworth sat up in bed .  on the edge of dreams she   d heard another noise  which must have woken the cockerel .   she fiddled with a match until she got a candle alight  and then felt under the bed and her fingers found the hilt of a cutlass that had been much employed by the late mr .  flitworth during his business trips across the mountains .   she hurried down the creaking stairs and out into the chill of the dawn .   she hesitated at the barn door  and then pulled it open just enough to slip inside .      mr .  door .      there was a rustle in the hay  and then an alert silence .   miss flitworth .      did you call out .  i   m sure i heard someone shout my name .      there was another rustle  and bill door   s head appeared over the edge of the loft .   miss flitworth .      yes .  who did you expect .  are you all right .      er .  yes .  yes  i believe so .      you sure you   re all right .  you woke up cyril .      yes .  yes .  it was just a   i thought that   yes .   she blew out the candle .  there was already enough pre dawn light to see by .      well  if you   re sure   now i   m up i may as well put the porridge on .      bill door lay back on the hay until he felt he could trust his legs to carry him  and then climbed down and tottered across the yard to the farmhouse .   he said nothing while she ladled porridge into a bowl in front of him  and drowned it with cream .  finally  he couldn   t contain himself any longer .  he didn   t know how to ask the questions  but he really needed the answers .   miss flitworth .      yes .      what is it   in the night   when you see things  but they are not the real things .   she stood  porridge pot in one hand and ladle in the other .      you mean dreaming .     she said .   is that what dreaming is .      don   t you dream .  i thought everyone dreamed .      about things that are going to happen .      that   s premonitions  that is .  i   ve never believed in    em myself .  you   re not telling me you don   t know what dreams are .      no .  no .  of course not .      what   s worrying you  bill .      i suddenly know that we are going to die .   she watched him thoughtfully .      well  so does everyone     she said .     and that   s what you   ve been dreaming about  is it .  everyone feels like this sometimes .  i wouldn   t worry about it  if i was you .  the best thing to do is keep busy and act cheerful  i always say .      but we will come to an end .      oh  i don   t know about that     said miss flitworth .     it all depends on what kind of life you   ve led  i suppose .      i   m sorry .      are you a religious man .      you mean that what happens to you when you die is what you believe will happen .     it would be nice if that was the case  wouldn   t it .     she said brightly .   but  you see  i know what i believe .  i believe   nothing .      we are gloomy this morning  aren   t we .     said miss flitworth .     best thing you could do right now is finish off that porridge .  it   s good for you .  they say it builds healthy bones .      bill door looked down at the bowl .   can i have some more .      bill door spent the morning chopping wood .  it was pleasantly monotonous .   get tired .  that was important .  he must have slept before last night  but he must have been so tired that he didn   t dream .  and he was determined not to dream again .  the axe rose and fell on the logs like clockwork .   no .  not like clockwork .   miss flitworth had several pots on the stove when he came in .   it smells good  bill volunteered .  he reached for a wobbling pot lid .  miss flitworth spun around .      don   t touch it .  you don   t want that stuff .  it   s for the rats .      do rats not feed themselves .      you bet they do .  that   s why we   re going to give them a little extra something before the harvest .  a few dollops of this around the holes and   no more rats .      it took a little while for bill door to put two and two together  but when this took place it was like megaliths mating .   this is poison .      essence of spikkle  mixed with oatmeal .  never fails .      and they die .      instantly .  straight over and legs in the air .  we   re having bread and cheese     she added .     i ain   t doing big cooking twice in one day  and we   re having chicken tonight .  talking of chicken  in fact   come on        she took a cleaver off the rack and went out into the yard .  cyril the cockerel eyed her suspiciously from the top of the midden .  his harem of fat and rather elderly hens  who had been scratching up the dust  bounded unsteadily toward miss flitworth in the broken knicker elastic runs of hens everywhere .  she reached down quickly and picked one up .   it regarded bill door with bright  stupid eyes .      do you know how to pluck a chicken .     said miss flitworth .   bill looked from her to the hen .   but we feed them  he said helplessly .      that   s right .  and then they feed us .  this one   s been off lay for months .  that   s how it goes in the chicken world .  mr .  flitworth used to wring their necks but i never got the knack of that  the cleaver   s messy and they run around a bit afterward  but they   re dead all right  and they know it .      bill door considered his options .  the chicken had focused one beady eye on him .  chickens are a lot more stupid than humans  and don   t have the sophisticated mental filters that prevent them seeing what is truly there .  it knew where it was and who was looking at it .   he looked into its small and simple life and saw the last few seconds pouring away .   he   d never killed .  he   d taken life  but only when it was finished with .  there was a difference between theft and stealing by finding .   not the cleaver  he said wearily .  give me the chicken .   he turned his back for a moment  then handed the limp body to miss flitworth .      well done     she said  and went back to the kitchen .   bill door felt cyril   s accusing gaze on him .   he opened his hand .  a tiny spot of light hovered over his palm .   he blew on it  gently  and it faded away .   after lunch they put down the rat poison .  he felt like a murderer .      a lot of rats died .   down in the runs under the barn   in the deepest one  one tunneled long ago by long forgotten ancestral rodents   something appeared in the darkness .   it seemed to have difficulty deciding what shape it was going to be .   it began as a lump of highly suspicious cheese .  this didn   t seem to work .   then it tried something that looked very much like a small  hungry terrier .  this was also rejected .   for a moment it was steel jawed trap .  this was clearly unsuitable .   it cast around for fresh ideas and much to its surprise one arrived smoothly  as if traveling from no distance at all .  not so much a shape as a memory of a shape .   it tried it and found that  while totally wrong for the job  in some deeply satisfying way it was the only shape it could possibly be .   it went to work .      that evening the men were practicing archery on the green .  bill door had carefully ensured a local reputation as the worst bowman in the entire history of toxophily  it had never occurred to anyone that putting arrows through the hats of bystanders behind him must logically take a lot more skill than merely sending them through a quite large target a mere fifty yards away .   it was amazing how many friends you could make by being bad at things  provided you were bad enough to be funny .   so he was allowed to sit on a bench outside the inn  with the old men .   next door  sparks poured from the chimney of the village smithy and spiraled up into the dusk .  there was a ferocious hammering from behind its closed doors .  bill door wondered why the smithy was always shut .  most smiths worked with their doors open  so that their forge became an unofficial village meeting room .  this one was keen on his work        hallo  skelington .      he swiveled around .   the small child of the house was watching him with the most penetrating gaze he had ever seen .      you are a skelington  aren   t you     she said .     i can tell  because of the bones .      you are mistaken  small child .      you are .  people turn into skelingtons when they   re dead .  they   re not supposed to walk around afterward .      ha .  ha .  ha .  will you hark at the child .      why are you walking around  then .      bill door looked at the old men .  they appeared engrossed in the sport .   i   ll tell you what  he said desperately  if you will go away  i will give you a half penny .      i   ve got a skelington mask for when we go trickle treating on soul cake night     she said .     it   s made of paper .  you get given sweets .      bill door made the mistake millions of people had tried before with small children in slightly similar circumstances .  he resorted to reason .   look  he said  if i was really a skeleton  little girl  i   m sure these old gentlemen here would have something to say about it .   she regarded the old men at the other end of the bench .      they   re nearly skelingtons anyway     she said .     i shouldn   t think they   d want to see another one .      he gave in .   i have to admit that you are right on that point .      why don   t you fall to bits .      i don   t know .  i never have .      i   ve seen skelingtons of birds and things and they all fall to bits .      perhaps it is because they are what something was  whereas this is what i am .      the apothecary who does medicine over in chambly   s got a skelington on a hook with all wire to hold the bones together     said the child  with the air of one imparting information gained after diligent research .   i don   t have wires .      there   s a difference between alive skelingtons and dead ones .      yes .      it   s a dead skelington he   s got then  is it .      yes .      what was inside someone .      yes .      ur .  yuk .      the child stared distantly at the landscape for a while and then said     i   ve got new socks .      yes .      you can look  if you like .      a grubby foot was extended for inspection .   well  well .  fancy that .  new socks .      my mum knitted them out of sheep .      my word .   the horizon was given another inspection .      d   you know     she said     d   you know   it   s friday .      yes .      i found a spoon .      bill door found he was waiting expectantly .  he was not familiar with people who had an attention span of less than three seconds .      you work along of miss flitworth   s .      yes .      my dad says you   ve got your feet properly under the table there .      bill door couldn   t think of an answer to this because he didn   t know what it meant .  it was one of those many flat statements humans made that were really just a disguise for something more subtle  which was often conveyed merely by the tone of voice or a look in the eyes  neither of which was being done by the child .      my dad says she said she   s got boxes of treasure .      has she .      i   ve got tuppence .      my goodness .      sal .      they both looked up as mrs .  lifton appeared on the doorstep .      bedtime for you .  stop worrying mr .  door .      oh  i assure you she is not        say goodnight  now .         how do skelingtons go to sleep .  they can   t close their eyes because        he heard their voices  muffled  inside the inn .      you mustn   t call mr .  door that just because   he   s   very   he   s very thin           it   s all right .  he   s not the dead sort .      mrs .  lifton   s voice had the familiar worried tones of someone who can   t bring themselves to believe the evidence of their own eyes .     perhaps he   s just been very ill .         i should think he   s just about been as ill as he can be ever .      bill door walked back home thoughtfully .   there was a light on in the farmhouse kitchen  but he went straight to the barn  climbed the ladder to the hayloft  and lay down .   he could put off dreaming  but he couldn   t escape remembering .   he stared at the darkness .   after a while he was aware of the pattering of feet .  he turned .   a stream of pale rat shaped ghosts skipped along the roof beam above his head  fading as they ran so that soon there was nothing but the sound of the scampering .   they were followed by a   shape .   it was about six inches high .  it wore a black robe .  it held a small scythe in one skeletal paw .  a bone white nose with brittle gray whiskers protruded from the shadowy hood .   bill door reached out and picked it up .  it didn   t resist  but stood on the palm of his hand and eyed him as one professional to another .   bill door said  and you are    .   the death of rats nodded .   squeak .   i remember  said bill door  when you were a part of me .   the death of rats squeaked again .   bill door fumbled in the pockets of his overall .  he   d put some of his lunch in there .  ah  yes .   i expect  he said  that you could murder a piece of cheese .   the death of rats took it graciously .   bill door remembered visiting an old man once   only once   who had spent almost his entire life locked in a cell in a tower for some alleged crime or other  and had tamed little birds for company during his life sentence .  they crapped on his bedding and ate his food  but he tolerated them and smiled at their flight in and out of the high barred windows .  death had wondered  at the time  why anyone would do something like that .   i won   t delay you  he said .  i expect you   ve got things to do  rats to see .  i know how it is .   and now he understood .   he put the figure back on the beam  and lay down in the hay .   drop in any time you   re passing .   bill door stared at the darkness again .   sleep .  he could feel her prowling around .  sleep  with a pocketful of dreams .   he lay in the darkness and fought back .      miss flitworth   s shouting jolted him upright and  to his momentary relief  still went on .   the barn door slammed open .      bill .  come down quick .      he swung his legs onto the ladder .   what is happening  miss flitworth .      something   s on fire .      they ran across the yard and out onto the road .  the sky over the village was red .      come on .      but it is not our fire .      it   s going to be everyone   s .  it spreads like crazy on thatch .      they reached the apology for a town square .  the inn was already well alight  the thatch roaring star ward in a million twisting sparks .      look at everyone standing around     snarled miss flitworth .     there   s the pump  buckets are everywhere  why don   t people think .      there was a scuffle a little way as a couple of his customers tried to stop lifton from running into the building .  he was screaming at them .      the girl   s still in there     said miss flitworth .     is that what he said .      yes .   flames curtained every upper window .      there   s got to be some way     said miss flitworth .     maybe we could find a ladder        we should not .      what .  we   ve got to try .  we can   t leave people in there .      you don   t understand  said bill door .  to tinker with the fate of one individual could destroy the whole world .   miss flitworth looked at him as if he had gone mad .      what kind of garbage is that .      i mean that there is a time for everyone to die .   she stared .  then she drew her hand back  and gave him a ringing slap across the face .   he was harder than she   d expected .  she yelped and sucked at her knuckles .      you leave my farm tonight  mr .  bill door     she growled .     understand .     then she turned on her heel and ran toward the pump .   some of the men had brought long hooks to drag the burning thatch off the roof .  miss flitworth organized a team to get a ladder up to one of the bedroom windows but  by the time a man was persuaded to climb it behind the steaming protection of a damp blanket  the top of the ladder was already smouldering .   bill door watched the flames .   he reached into his pocket and pulled out the golden timer .  the firelight glowed redly on the glass .  he put it away again .   part of the roof fell in .   squeak .   bill door looked down .  a small robed figure marched between his legs and strutted into the flaming doorway .   someone was yelling something about barrels of brandy .   bill door reached back into his pocket and took out the timer again .  its hissing drowned out the roar of the flames .  the future flowed into the past  and there was a lot more past than there was future  but he was struck by the fact that what it flowed through all the time was now .   he replaced it carefully .   death knew that to tinker with the fate of one individual could destroy the whole world .  he knew this .  the knowledge was built into him .   to bill door  he realized  it was so much horse elbows .   oh  damn  he said .   and walked into the fire .         um .  it   s me  librarian     said windle  trying to shout through the keyhole .     windle poons .      he tried hammering some more .      why won   t he answer .         don   t know     said a voice behind him .      schleppel .         yes  mr .  poons .         why are you behind me .         i   ve got to be behind something  mr .  poons .  that   s what being a bogeyman is all about .         librarian .     said windle  hammering some more .      oook .         why won   t you let me in .         oook .         but i need to look something up .         oook oook .         well  yes .  i am .  what   s that got to do with it .         oook .         that   s   that   s unfair .         what   s he saying  mr .  poons .         he won   t let me in because i   m dead .         that   s typical .  that   s the sort of thing reg shoe is always going on about  you know .         is there anyone else that knows about life force .         there   s always mrs .  cake  i suppose .  but she   s a bit weird .         who   s mrs .  cake .     then windle realized what schleppel had just said .     anyway  you   re a bogeyman .         you never heard of mrs .  cake .         no .         i don   t suppose she   s interested in magic   anyway  mr .  shoe says we shouldn   t talk to her .  she exploits dead people  he says .         how .         she   s a medium .  well  more a small .         really .  all right  let   s go and see her .  and   schleppel .         yes .         it   s creepy  feeling you standing behind me the whole time .         i get very upset if i   m not behind something  mr .  poons .         can   t you lurk behind something else .         what do you suggest  mr .  poons .      windle thought about it .     yes  it might work     he said quietly     if i can find a screwdriver .         modo the gardener was on his knees mulching the dahlias when he heard a rhythmic scraping and thumping behind him  such as might be made by someone trying to move a heavy object .   he turned his head .         evening  mr .  poons .  still dead  i see .            evening  modo .  you   ve got the place looking very nice .         there   s someone moving a door along behind you  mr .  poons .         yes  i know .      the door edged cautiously along the path .  as it passed modo it pivoted awkwardly  as if whoever was carrying it was trying to keep as much behind it as possible .      it   s a kind of security door     said windle .   he paused .  there was something wrong .  he couldn   t quite be certain what it was  but there was suddenly a lot of wrongness about  like hearing one note out of tune in an orchestra .  he audited the view in front of him .      what   s that you   re putting the weeds into .     he said .   modo glanced at the thing beside him .      good  isn   t it .     he said .     i found it by the compost heaps .  my wheelbarrow   d broke  and i looked up  and there           i   ve never seen anything like it before     said windle .     who   d want to make a big basket out of wire .  and those wheels don   t look big enough .         but it pushes along well by the handle     said modo .     i   m amazed that anyone would want to throw it away .  why would anyone want to throw away something like this  mr .  poons .      windle stared at the trolley .  he couldn   t escape the feeling that it was watching him .   he heard himself say     maybe it got there by itself .         that   s right  mr .  poons .  it wanted a bit of peace  i expect .     said modo .     you are a one .         yes     said windle  unhappily .     it rather looks that way .      he stepped out into the city  aware of the scraping and thumping of the door behind him .   if someone had told me a month ago  he thought  that a few days after i died i   d be walking along the road followed by a bashful bogeyman hiding behind a door   why  i   d have laughed at them .   no  i wouldn   t .  i   d have said    eh .     and    what .     and    speak up .     and wouldn   t have understood anyway .   beside him  someone barked .   a dog was watching him .  it was a very large dog .  in fact  the only reason it could be called a dog and not a wolf was that everyone knew you didn   t get wolves in cities .   it winked .  windle thought  no full moon last night .      lupine .     he ventured .   the dog nodded .      can you talk .      the dog shook its head .      so what do you do now .      lupine shrugged .      want to come with me .      there was another shrug that almost vocalized the thought  why not .  what else have i got to do .   if someone had told me a month ago  windle thought  that a few days after i died i   d be walking along the road followed by a bashful bogeyman hiding behind a door and accompanied by a kind of negative version of a werewolf   why  i probably would have laughed at them .  after they   d repeated themselves a few times  of course .  in a loud voice .      the death of rats rounded up the last of his clients  many of whom had been in the thatch  and led the way through the flames toward wherever it was that good rats went .   he was surprised to pass a burning figure forcing its way through the incandescent mess of collapsed beams and crumbling floorboards .  as it mounted the blazing stairs it removed something from the disintegrating remains of its clothing and held it carefully in its teeth .   the death of rats did not wait to see what happened next .  while it was  in some respects  as ancient as the first proto rat  it was also less than a day old and still feeling its way as a death  and it was possibly aware that a deep  thumping noise that was making the building shake was the sound of brandy starting to boil in its barrels .   the thing about boiling brandy is that it doesn   t boil for long .      the fireball dropped bits of the inn half a mile away .  white hot flames erupted from the holes where the doors and windows had been .  the walls exploded .  burning rafters whirred overhead .  some buried themselves in neighboring roofs  starting more fires .   what was left was just an eye watering glow .   and then little pools of shadow  within the glow .   they moved and ran together and formed the shape of a tall figure striding forward  carrying something in front of it .   it passed through the blistered crowd and trudged up the cool dark road toward the farm .  the people picked themselves up and followed it  moving through the dusk like the tail of a dark comet .   bill door climbed the stairs to miss flitworth   s bedroom and laid the child on the bed .   she said there was an apothecary somewhere near here .   miss flitworth pushed her way through the crowd at the top of the stairs .      there   s one in chambly     she said .     but there   s a witch over lancre way .      no witches .  no magic .  send for him .  and everyone else  go away .   it wasn   t a suggestion .  it wasn   t even a command .  it was simply an irrefutable statement .   miss flitworth waved her skinny arms at the people .      come on  it   s all over .  shoo .  you   re all in my bedroom .  go on  get out .         how   d he do it .     said someone at the back of the crowd .     no one could have got out of there alive .  we saw it all blow up .      bill door turned around slowly .   we hid  he said  in the cellar .      there .  see .     said miss flitworth .     in the cellar .  makes sense .         but the inn hasn   t got       the doubter began  and stopped .  bill door was glaring at him .      in the cellar     he corrected himself .     yeah .  right .  clever .         very clever     said miss flintworth .     now get along with the lot of you .      he heard her shoo them down the stairs and back into the night .  the door slammed .  he didn   t hear her come back up the stairs with a bowl of cold water and a flannel .  miss flitworth could walk lightly  too  when she had a mind to .   she came in and shut the door behind her .      her parents   ll want to see her     she said .     her mum   s in a faint and big henry from the mill knocked her dad out when he tried to run into the flames  but they   ll be here directly .      she bent down and ran the flannel over the girl   s forehead .      where was she .      she was hiding in a cupboard .      from a fire .      bill door shrugged .      i   m amazed you could find anyone in all that heat and smoke     she said .   i suppose you would call it a knack .     and not a mark on her .      bill door ignored the question in her voice .   did you send someone for the apothecary .     yes .      he must not take anything away .      what do you mean .      stay here when he comes .  you must not take anything out of this room .      that   s silly .  why should he take anything .  what would he want to take .      it is very important .  and now i must leave you .      where are you going .      to the barn .  there are things i must do .  there may not be much time now .   miss flitworth stared at the small figure on the bed .  she felt far out of her depth  and all she could do was tread water .      she just looks as if she   s sleeping     she said helplessly .     what   s wrong with her .      bill door paused at the top of the stairs .   she is living on borrowed time  he said .       there was an old forge behind the barn .  it hadn   t been used for years .  but now red and yellow light spilled out into the yard  pulsing like a heart .   and like a heart  there was a regular thumping .  with every crash the light flared blue .   miss flitworth sidled through the open doorway .  if she was the kind of person who would swear  she would have sworn that she made no noise that could possibly be heard above the crackle of the fire and the hammering  but bill door spun around in a half crouch  holding a curved blade in front of him .      it   s me .      he relaxed  or at least moved into a different level of tension .      what the hell are you doing .      he looked at the blade in his hands as if he was seeing it for the first time .   i thought i would sharpen this scythe  miss flitworth .      at one o   clock in the morning .      he looked at it blankly .   it   s just as blunt at night  miss flitworth .   then he slammed it down on the anvil .   and i can   t sharpen it enough .      i think perhaps the heat has got to you     she said  and reached out and took his arm .      besides  it looks sharp enough to       she began  and paused .  her fingers moved on the bone of his arm .  they pulled away for a moment  and then closed again .   bill door shivered .   miss flitworth didn   t hesitate for long .  in seventy five years she had dealt with wars  famine  innumerable sick animals  a couple of epidemics and thousands of tiny  everyday tragedies .  a depressed skeleton wasn   t even in the top ten worst things she had seen .      so it is you     she said .   miss flitworth  i        i always knew you would come one day .      i think perhaps that        you know  i spent most of my life waiting for a knight on a white charger .     miss flitworth grinned .     the joke   s on me  eh .      bill door sat down on the anvil .      the apothecary came     she said .     he said he couldn   t do anything .  he said she was fine .  we just couldn   t wake her up .  and  you know  it took us ages to get her hand open .  she had it closed so tightly .      i said nothing was to be taken .      it   s all right .  it   s all right .  we left her holding it .      good .      what was it .      my time .      sorry .      my time .  the time of my life .      it looks like an eggtimer for very expensive eggs .      bill door looked surprised .  yes .  in a way .  i have given her some of my time .     how come you need time .      every living thing needs time .  and when it runs out  they die .  when it runs out  she will die .  and i will die  too .  in a few hours .      but you can   t        i can .  it   s hard to explain .      move up .      what .      i said move up .  i want to sit down .      bill door made space on the anvil .  miss flitworth sat down .      so you   re going to die     she said .   yes .      and you don   t want to .      no .      why not .      he looked at her as if she was mad .   because then there will be nothing .  because i won   t exist .      is that what happens for humans  too .      i don   t think so .  it   s different for you .  you have it all better organized .   they both sat watching the fading glow of the coals in the forge .      so what were you working on the scythe blade for .     said miss flitworth .   i thought perhaps i could   fight back        has it ever worked .  with you  i mean .      not usually .  sometimes people challenge me to a game .  for their lives  you know .      do they ever win .      no .  last year someone got three streets and all the utilities .      what .  what sort of game is that .      i don   t recall .     exclusion possession     i think .  i was the boot .      just a moment     said miss flitworth .     if you   re you  who will be coming for you .      death .  last night this was pushed under the door .   death opened his hand to reveal a small grubby piece of paper  on which miss flitworth could read  with some difficulty  the word  oooooeeeeeooooooeeeeeooooooeeeee .   i have received the badly written note of the banshee .   miss flitworth looked at him with her head on one side .      but   correct me if i   m wrong  but        the new death .   bill door picked up the blade .   he will be terrible .   the blade twisted in his hands .  blue light flickered along its edge .   i will be the first .   miss flitworth stared at the light as if fascinated .      exactly how terrible .      how terrible can you imagine .      oh .      exactly as terrible as that .   the blade tilted this way and that .      and for the child  too     said miss flitworth .   yes .      i don   t reckon i owe you any favors  mr .  door .  i don   t reckon anyone in the whole world owes you any favors .      you may be right .      mind you  life   s got one or two things to answer for too .  fair   s fair .      i cannot say .   miss flitworth gave him another long  appraising look .      there   s a pretty good grindstone in the corner     she said .   i   ve used it .      and there   s an oilstone in the cupboard .      i   ve used that  too .   she thought she could hear a sound as the blade moved .  a sort of faint whine of tensed air .      and it   s still not sharp enough .      bill door sighed .  it may never be sharp enough .      come on  man .  no sense in giving in     said miss flitworth .     where there   s life  eh .      where there   s life eh what .      there   s hope .      is there .      right enough .      bill door ran a bony finger along the edge .   hope .      got anything else left to try .      bill shook his head .  he   d tried a number of emotions  but this was a new one .   could you fetch me a steel .      it was an hour later .   miss flitworth sorted through her rag bag .      what next .     she said .   what have we had so far .      let   s see   hessian  calico  linen   how about satin .  here   s a piece .      bill door took the rag and wiped it gently along the blade .   miss flitworth reached the bottom of the bag  and pulled out a swatch of white cloth .   yes .      silk     she said softly .     finest white silk .  the real stuff .  never worn .      she sat back and stared at it .   after a while he took it tactfully from her fingers .   thank you .      well now     she said  waking up .     that   s it  isn   t it .      when he turned the blade  it made a noise like whommmm .  the fires of the forge were barely alive now  but the blade glowed with razor light .      sharpened on silk     said miss flitworth .     who   d believe it .      and still blunt .   bill door looked around the dark forge  and then darted into a corner .      what have you found .      cobweb .   there was a long thin whine  like the torturing of ants .      any good .      still too blunt .   she watched bill door stride out of the forge  and scuttled after him .  he went and stood in the middle of the yard  holding the scythe blade edge on to the faint  dawn breeze .   it hummed .      how sharp can a blade get  for goodness    sake .      it can get sharper than this .   down in his henhouse  cyril the cockerel awoke and stared blearily at the treacherous letters chalked on the board .  he took a deep breath .      floo a cockle dod .      bill door glanced at the rimward horizon and then  speculatively  at the little hill behind the house .   he jerked forward  legs clicking over the ground .      the new daylight sloshed onto the world .  discworld light is old  slow and heavy  it roared across the landscape like a cavalry charge .  the occasional valley slowed it for a moment and  here and there  a mountain range banked it up until it poured over the top and down the far slope .   it moved across a sea  surged up the beach and accelerated over the plains  driven by the lash of the sun .   on the fabled hidden continent of xxxx  somewhere near the rim  there is a lost colony of wizards who wear corks around their pointy hats and live on nothing but prawns .  there  the light is still wild and fresh as it rolls in from space  and they surf on the boiling interface between night and day .   if one of them had been carried thousands of miles inland on the dawn  he might have seen  as the light thundered over the high plains  a stick figure toiling up a low hill in the path of the morning .   it reached the top a moment before the light arrived  took a breath  and then spun around in a crouch  grinning .   it held a long blade upright between extended arms .   light struck   split   slid     not that the wizard would have paid much attention  because he   d be too busy worrying about the five thousand mile walk back home .      miss flitworth panted up as the new day streamed past .  bill door was absolutely still  only the blade moving between his fingers as he angled it against the light .   finally he seemed satisfied .   he turned around and swished it experimentally through the air .   miss flitworth stuck her hands on her hips .     oh  come on     she said .       she paused .   he waved the blade again .       down in the yard  cyril stretched his bald neck for another go .  bill door grinned  and swung the blade toward the sound .       then he lowered the blade .   that   s sharp .   his grin faded  or at least faded as much as it was able to .   miss flitworth turned  following the line of his gaze until it intersected a faint haze over the cornfields .   it looked like a pale gray robe  empty but still somehow maintaining the shape of its wearer  as if a garment on a washing line was catching the breeze .   it wavered for a moment  and then vanished .      i saw it     said miss flintworth .   that wasn   t it .  that was them .      them who .      they   re like   bill door waved a hand vaguely   servants .  watchers .  auditors .  inspectors .   miss flitworth   s eyes narrowed .      inspectors .  you mean like the revenoo .     she said .   i suppose so     miss flitworth   s face lit up .      why didn   t you say .      i   m sorry .      my father always made me promise never to help the revenoo .  even just thinking about the revenoo  he said  made him want to go and have a lie down .  he said that there was death and taxes  and taxes was worse  because at least death didn   t happen to you every year .  we had to go out of the room when he really got started about the revenoo .  nasty creatures .  always poking around asking what you   ve got hidden under the woodpile and behind the secret panels in the cellar and other stuff which is no concern whatsoever of anyone .      she sniffed .   bill door was impressed .  miss flitworth could actually give the word    revenue     which had two vowels and one diphthong  all the peremptoriness of the word    scum .         you should have said that they were after you right from the start     said miss flitworth .     the revenoo aren   t popular in these parts  you know .  in my father   s day  any revenooer came around here prying around by himself  we used to tie weights to their feet and heave    em into the pond .      but the pond is only a few inches deep  miss flitworth .      yeah  but it was fun watching    em find out .  you should have said .  everyone thought you were to do with taxes .      no .  not taxes .      well  well .  i didn   t know there was a revenoo up there  too .      yes .  in a way .   she sidled closer .      when will he come .      tonight .  i cannot be exact .  two people are living on the same timer .  it makes things uncertain .      i didn   t know people could give people some of their life .      it happens all the time .      and you   re sure about tonight .      yes .      and that blade will work  will it .      i don   t know .  it   s a million to one chance .      oh .     she seemed to be considering something .     so you   ve got the rest of the day free  then .      yes .         then you can start getting the harvest in .      what .      it   ll keep you busy .  keep your mind off things .  besides  i   m paying you sixpence a week .  and sixpence is sixpence .         mrs .  cake   s house was also in elm street .  windle knocked on the door .   after a while a muffled voice called out     is there anybody there .         knock once for yes     schleppel volunteered .   windle levered open the letter box .      excuse me .  mrs .  cake .      the door opened .   mrs .  cake wasn   t what windle had expected .  she was big  but not in the sense of being fat .  she was just built to a scale slightly larger than normal  the sort of person who goes through life crouching slightly and looking apologetic in case they inadvertently loom .  and she had magnificent hair .  it crowned her head and flowed out behind her like a cloak .  she also had slightly pointed ears and teeth which  while white and quite beautiful  caught the light in a disturbing way .  windle was amazed at the speed at which his heightened zombie senses reached a conclusion .  he looked down .   lupine was sitting bolt upright  too excited even to wag his tail .      i don   t think you could be mrs .  cake     said windle .      you want mother     said the tall girl .     mother .  there   s a gentleman .      a distant muttering became a closer muttering  and then mrs .  cake appeared around the side of her daughter like a small moon emerging from planetary shadow .      what d   yew want .     said mrs .  cake .   windle took a step backward .  unlike her daughter  mrs .  cake was quite short  and almost perfectly circular .  and still unlike her daughter  whose whole stance was dedicated to making herself look small  she loomed tremendously .  this was largely because of her hat  which he later learned she wore at all times with the dedication of a wizard .  it was huge and black and had things on it  like bird wings and wax cherries and hat pins  carmen miranda could have worn that hat to the funeral of a continent .  mrs .  cake traveled underneath it as the basket travels under a balloon .  people often found themselves talking to her hat .      mrs .  cake .     said windle  fascinated .      oim down    ere     said a reproachful voice .   windle lowered his gaze .      that   s    oo i am     said mrs .  cake .      am i addressing mrs .  cake .     said windle .      yes  oi know     said mrs .  cake .      my name   s windle poons .         oi knew that  too .         i   m a wizard  you see           all right  but see you wipes your feet .         may i come in .      windle poons paused .  he replayed the last few lines of conversation in the clicking control room of his brain .  and then he smiled .      that   s right     said mrs .  cake .      are you by any chance a natural clairvoyant .         about ten seconds usually  mr .  poons .      windle hesitated .      you gotta ask the question     said mrs .  cake quickly .     i gets a migraine if people goes and viciously not asks questions after i   ve already foreseen    em and answered    em .         how far into the future can you see  mrs .  cake .      she nodded .      roight  then     she said  apparently mollified  and led the way through the hall into a tiny sitting room .     and the bogey can come in  only he   s got to leave    is door outside and go in the cellar .  i don   t hold with bogeys wanderin    around the house .         gosh  it   s ages since i   ve been in a proper cellar     said schleppel .      it   s got spiders in it     said mrs .  cake .      wow .         and you   d like a cup of tea     said mrs .  cake to windle .  someone else might have said    i expect you   d like a cup of tea     or    do you want a cup of tea .     but this was a statement .      yes  please     said windle .     i   d love a cup of tea .         you shouldn   t     said mrs .  cake .     that stuff rots your teeth .      windle worked this one out .      two sugars  please     he said .      it   s all right .         this is a nice place you have here  mrs .  cake     said windle  his mind racing .  mrs .  cake   s habit of answering questions while they were still forming in your mind taxed the most active brain .      he   s been dead for ten years     she said .      er     said windle  but the question was already there in his larynx     i trust mr .  cake is in good health .         it   s okay .  oi speaks to him occasional     said mrs .  cake .      i   m sorry to hear that     said windle .      all right  if it makes you feel any better .         um  mrs .  cake .  i   m finding it a little confusing .  could you   switch off   your precognition    .      she nodded .      sorry .  oi gets into the habit of leavin    it on     she said     what with there only bein    me an    ludmilla and one man bucket .  he   s a ghost     she added .     oi knew you was goin    to ask that .         yes  i had heard that mediums have native spirit guides     said windle .         im .     e   s not a guide     e   s a sort of odd job ghost     said mrs .  cake .     i don   t hold with all that stuff with cards and trumpets and oo jar boards  mind you .  an    i think ectoplasm   s disgustin    .  oi won   t have it in the    ouse .  oi won   t .  you can   t get it out of the carpets  you know .  not even with vinegar .         my word     said windle poons .      or wailin    .  i don   t hold with it .  or messin    around with the supernatural .  it   s unnatural  the supernatural .  i won   t have it .         um     said windle cautiously .     there are those who might think that being a medium is a bit   you know   supernatural .         what .  what .  nothing supernatural about dead people .  load of nonsense .  everyone dies sooner or later .         i do hope so  mrs .  cake .         so what is it you   d be wanting  mr .  poons .  i   m not precognitin     so you have to tell me .         i want to know what   s happening  mrs .  cake .      there was a muted thump from under their feet and the faint  happy sound of schleppel .      oh  wow .  rats  too .         i went up and tried to tell you wizards     said mrs .  cake  primly .     an    no one listened .  i knew they weren   t going to  but i    ad to try  otherwise i wouldn   t    ave known .         who did you speak to .         the big one with the red dress and a mustache like he   s trying to swaller a cat .         ah .  the archchancellor     said windle  positively .      and there was a huge fat one .  walks like a duck .         he does  doesn   t he .  that was the dean     said windle .      they called me their good woman     said mrs .  cake .     they told me to be about my business .  don   t see why i should go around helpin    wizards who call me a good woman when i was only trying to help .         i   m afraid wizards don   t often listen     said windle .     i never listened for one hundred and thirty years .         why not .         in case i heard what rubbish i was saying  i expect .  what   s happening  mrs .  cake .  you can tell me .  i may be a wizard  but i   m a dead one .         well           schleppel told me it was all due to life force .         it   s buildin    up  see .         what does that mean .         there   s more   f it than there should be .  you get      she waved her hands vaguely      when things are like in a scales only not the same on both sides           imbalance .      mrs .  cake  who looked as though she was reading a distant script  nodded .      one of them things  yeah   see  sometimes it just happens a little bit  and you get ghosts  because the life is not in the body anymore but it hasn   t gone   and you get less of it in the winter  because it sort of drains away  and it comes back in the spring   and some things concentrate it           modo the university gardener hummed a little tune as he wheeled the strange trolley into his private little area between the library and the high energy magic  building  with a load of weeds bound for composthood .   there seemed to be a lot of excitement around at the moment .  it was certainly interesting  working with all these wizards .   teamwork  that   s what it was .  they looked after the cosmic balance  the universal harmonies and the dimensional equilibriums  and he saw to it that the aphids stayed off the roses .   there was a metallic tinkle .  he peered over the top of the heap of weeds .      another one .      a gleaming metal wire basket on little wheels sat on the path .   maybe the wizards had bought it for him .  the first one was quite useful  although it was a little bit hard to steer  the little wheels seemed to want to go in different directions .  there was probably a knack .   well  this one would be handy for carrying seed trays in .  he pushed the second trolley aside and heard  behind him  a sound which  if it had to be written down  and if he could write  he would probably have written down as  glop .   he turned around  saw the biggest of the compost heaps pulsating in the dark  and said     look what i brought you for your tea .      and then he saw that it was moving .         some places  too       said mrs .  cake .      but why should it build up .     said windle .      it   s like a thunderstorm  see .  you know how you get that prickly feelin    before a storm .  that   s what   s happening now .         yes  but why  mrs .  cake .         well   one man bucket says nothing   s dying .         what .         daft  isn   t it .  he says lots of lives are ending  but not going away .  they   re just staying here .         what  like ghosts .         not just ghosts .  just   it   s like puddles .  when you get a lot of puddles  it   s like the sea .  anyway  you only get ghosts from things like people .  you don   t get ghosts of cabbages .      windle poons sat back in his chair .  he had a vision of a vast pool of life  a lake being fed by a million short lived tributaries as living things came to the end of their span .  and life force was leaking out as the pressure built up .  leaking out wherever it could .      do you think i could have a word with one       he began  and then stopped .   he got up and lurched over to mrs .  cake   s mantelpiece .      how long have you had this  mrs .  cake .     he demanded  picking up a familiar glassy object .      that .  bought it yesterday .  pretty  ain   t it .      windle shook the globe .  it was almost identical to the ones under his floorboards .  snowflakes whirled up and settled on an exquisite model of unseen university .   it reminded him strongly of something .  well  the building obviously reminded him of the university  but the shape of the whole thing  there was a hint of  it made him think of        breakfast .      why is it happening .     he said  half to himself .     these damn things are turning up everywhere .         the wizards ran down the corridor .      how can you kill ghosts .         how should i know .  the question doesn   t usually arise .         you exorcise them  i think .         what .  jumpin    up and down  runnin    on the spot  that kind of thing .      the dean had been ready for this .     it   s spelled with an    o     archchancellor .  i don   t think one is expected to subject them to  er  physical exertion .         should think not  man .  we don   t want a lot of healthy ghosts buzzin    around .      there was a blood curdling scream .  it echoed around the dark pillars and arches  and was suddenly cut off .   the archchancellor stopped abruptly .  the wizards cannoned into him .      sounded like a blood curdlin    scream     he said .     follow me .      he ran around the corner .   there was a metallic crash  and a lot of swearing .   something small and striped red and yellow  with tiny dripping fangs and three pairs of wings  flew around the corner and shot over the dean   s head making a noise like a miniature buzzsaw .      anyone know what that was .     said the bursar  faintly .  the thing orbited the wizards and then disappeared into the darkness of the roof .     and i wish he wouldn   t swear so .         come on     said the dean .     we   d better see what   s happened to him .         must we .     said the senior wrangler .   they peered around the corner .  the archchancellor was sitting up  rubbing his ankle .      what idiot left this here .     he said .      left what .     said the dean .      this blasted wire baskety wheely thing     said the archchancellor .  beside him  a tiny purple spider like creature materialized out of the air and scuttled toward a crevice .  the wizards didn   t notice it .      what wire baskety wheely thing .     said the wizards  in unison .   ridcully looked around him .      i could have sworn       he began .   there was another scream .   ridcully scrambled to his feet .      come on  you fellows .     he said  limping heroically onward .      why does everyone run toward a blood curdling scream .     mumbled the senior wrangler .     it   s contrary to all sense .      they trotted out through the cloisters and into the quadrangle .   a rounded  dark shape was squatting in the middle of the ancient lawn .  steam was coming out of it in little  noisome wisps .      what is it .         it can   t be a compost heap in the middle of the lawn  can it .         modo will be very upset .      the dean peered closer .     er   especially because  i do believe  that   s his feet poking out from under it        the heap swiveled toward the wizards and made a glop  glop noise .   then it moved .      right  then     said ridcully  rubbing his hands together hopefully     which of you fellows has got a spell about them at the moment .      the wizards patted their pockets in an embarrassed fashion .      then i shall attract its attention while the bursar and the dean try to pull modo out     said ridcully .      oh  good     said the dean faintly .      how can you attract a compost heap   s attention .     said the senior wrangler .     i shouldn   t think it   s even got one .      ridcully removed his hat and stepped gingerly forward .      load of rubbish .     he roared .   the senior wrangler groaned and put his hand over his eyes .   ridcully flapped his hat in front of the heap .      biodegradable garbage .         poor green trash .     said the lecturer in recent runes helpfully .      that   s the ticket     said the archchancellor .     try to infuriate the bugger .      behind him  a slightly different variety of mad waspy creature popped out of the air and buzzed away .    the heap lunged at the hat .      midden .     said ridcully .      oh  i say     said the lecturer in recent runes  shocked .   the dean and the bursar crept forward  grabbed a gardener   s foot each  and pulled .  modo slid out of the heap .      it   s eaten through his clothes .     said the dean .      but is he all right .         he   s still breathing     said the bursar .      and if he   s lucky  he   s lost his sense of smell     said the dean .   the heap snapped at ridcully   s hat .  there was a glop .  the point of the hat had vanished .      hey  there was still almost half a bottle in there .     ridcully roared .  the senior wrangler grabbed his arm .      come on  archchancellor .      the heap swiveled and lunged toward the bursar .   the wizards backed away .      it can   t be intelligent  can it .     said the bursar .      all it   s doing is moving around slowly and eating things     said the dean .      put a pointy hat on it and it   d be a faculty member     said the archchancellor .   the heap came after them .      i wouldn   t call that moving slowly     said the dean .   they looked expectantly at the archchancellor .      run .      portly though most of the faculty were  they hit a fair turn of speed up the cloisters  fought one another through the door  slammed it behind them and leaned on it .  very soon afterward  there was a damp  heavy thud on the far side .      we   re well out of that     said the bursar .   the dean looked down .      i think it   s coming through the door  archchancellor     he said  in a tiny voice .      don   t be daft  man  we   re all leanin    on it .         i didn   t mean through  i mean   through        the archchancellor sniffed .      what   s burnin .         your boots  archchancellor     said the dean .   ridcully looked down .  a greenish yellow puddle was spreading under the door .  the wood was charring  the flagstones were hissing  and the leather soles of his boots were definitely in trouble .  he could feel himself getting lower .   he fumbled with the laces  and then took a standing jump onto a dry flagstone .      bursar .         yes  archchancellor .         give me your boots .         what .         dammit  man  i command you to give me your blasted boots .      this time  a long creature with four pairs of wings  two at each end  and three eyes  popped into existence over ridcully   s head and dropped onto his hat .      but           i am your archchancellor .         yes  but           i think the hinges are going     said the lecturer in recent runes .   ridcully looked around desperately .      we   ll regroup in the great hall     he said .     we   ll   strategically withdraw to previously prepared positions .         who prepared them .     said the dean .      we   ll prepare them when we get there     said the archchancellor through gritted teeth .     bursar .  your boots .  now .      they reached the double doors of the great hall just as the door behind them half collapsed  half dissolved .  the great hall   s doors were much sturdier .  bolts and bars were dragged into place .      clear the tables and pile them up in front of the door     snapped ridcully .      but it eats through wood     said the dean .   there was a moan from the small body of modo  which had been propped against a chair .  he opened his eyes .      quick .     said ridcully .     how can we kill a compost heap .         um .  i don   t think you can  mr .  ridcully  sir     said the gardener .      how about fire .  i could probably manage a small fireball     said the dean .      it wouldn   t work .  too soggy     said ridcully .      it   s right outside .  it   s eating away at the door .  it   s eating away at the door     sang the lecturer in recent runes .   the wizards backed further away down the length of the hall .      i hope it doesn   t eat too much wood     said the dazed modo  radiating genuine concern .     they   re a devil  excuse my klatchian  if you get too much carbon in them .  it   s far too heating .         you know  this is exactly the right time for a lecture on the dynamics of compost making  modo     said the dean .   dwarfs do not know the meaning of the word    irony .         well  all right .  ahem .  the correct balance of materials  correctly layered according to           there goes the door     said the lecturer in recent runes  lumbering toward the rest of them .   the mound of furniture started to move forward .   the archchancellor stared desperately around the hall  at a loss .  then his eyes were drawn to a familiar  heavy bottle on one of the sideboards .      carbon     he said .     that   s like charcoal  isn   t it .         how should i know .  i   m not an alchemist     sniffed the dean .   the compost heap emerged from the debris .  steam poured off it .   the archchancellor looked longingly at the bottle of wow wow sauce .  he uncorked it .  he took a deep sniff .      the cooks here just can   t make it properly  you know     he said .     it   ll be weeks before i can get anymore from home .      he tossed the bottle toward the advancing heap .   it vanished into the seething mass .      stinging nettles are always useful     said modo  behind him .     they add iron .  and comfrey  well  you can never get enough comfrey .  for the minerals  you know .  myself  i   ve always reckoned that a small quantity of wild yarrow        the wizards peered over the top of an overturned table .   the heap had stopped moving .      is it just me  or is it getting bigger .     said the senior wrangler .      and looking happier     said the dean .      it smells awful     said the bursar .      oh  well .  and that was nearly a full bottle of sauce  too     said the archchancellor sadly .     i   d hardly opened it .         nature   s a wonderful thing  when you come to think about it     said the senior wrangler .     you don   t all have to glare at me like that  you know .  i was only passing a remark .         there are times when       ridcully began  and then the compost heap exploded .   it wasn   t a bang or a boom .  it was the dampest  most corpulent eruption in the history of terminal flatulence .  dark red flame  fringed with black  roared up to the ceiling .  pieces of heap rocketed across the hall and slapped wetly into the walls .   the wizards peered out from their barricade  which was now thick with tea leaves .   a cabbage stalk dropped softly onto the dean   s head .   he looked at a small  bubbling patch on the flagstones .   his face split slowly into a grin .      wow     he said .   the other wizards unfolded themselves .  adrenaline backwash worked its seductive spell .  they grinned  too  and started playfully punching one another on the shoulder .      eat hot sauce .     roared the archchancellor .      up against the hedge  fermented rubbish .         can we kick ass  or can we kick ass .     burbled the dean happily .      you mean can   t the second time  not can .  and i   m not sure that a compost heap can be said to have an       the senior wrangler began  but the tide of excitement was flowing against him .      that   s one heap that won   t mess with wizards again     said the dean  who was getting carried away .     we   re keen and mean and           there   s three more of them out there  modo says     said the bursar .   they fell silent .      we could go and pick up our staffs  couldn   t we .     said the dean .   the archchancellor prodded a piece of exploded heap with the toe of his boot .      dead things coming alive     he murmured .     i don   t like that .  what   s next .  walking statues .      the wizards looked up at the statues of dead archchancellors that lined the great hall and  indeed  most of the corridors of the university .  the university had been in existence for thousands of years and the average archchancellor remained in office for about eleven months  so there were plenty of statues .      you know  i really wish you hadn   t said that     said the lecturer in recent runes .      it was just a thought     said ridcully .     come on  let   s have a look at the rest of those heaps .         yeah .     said the dean  now in the grip of a wild  unwizardly machismo .     we   re mean .  yeah .  are we mean .      the archchancellor raised his eyebrows  and then turned to the rest of the wizards .      are we mean .     he said .      er .  i   m feeling reasonably mean     said the lecturer in recent runes .      i   m definitely very mean  i think     said the bursar .     it   s having no boots that does it     he added .      i   ll be mean if everyone else is     said the senior wrangler .   the archchancellor turned back to the dean .      yes     he said     it appears that we are all mean .         yo .     said the dean .      yo what .     said ridcully .      it   s not a yo what  it   s just a yo     said the senior wrangler  behind him .     it   s a general street greeting and affirmative with convivial military ingroup and masculine bonding ritual overtones .         what .  what .  like    jolly good    .     said ridcully .      i suppose so     said the senior wrangler  reluctantly .   ridcully was pleased .  ankh morpork had never offered very good prospects for hunting .  he   d never thought it was possible to have so much fun in his own university .      right     he said .     let   s get those heaps .         yo .         yo .         yo .         yo yo .      ridcully sighed .     bursar .         yes  archchancellor .         just try to understand  all right .         clouds piled up over the mountains .  bill door strode up and down the first field  using one of the ordinary farm scythes  the sharpest one had been temporarily stored at the back of the barn  in case it was blunted by air convection .  some of miss flitworth   s tenants followed behind him  binding the sheaves and stacking them .  miss flitworth had never employed more than one man full time  bill door learned  she brought in other help as she needed it  to save pennies .      never seen a man cut corn with a scythe before     said one of them .     it   s a sickle job .      they stopped for lunch  and ate it under the hedge .   bill door had never paid a great deal of attention to the names and faces of people  beyond that necessary for business .  corn stretched over the hillside  it was made up of individual stalks  and to the eye of one stalk another stalk might be quite an impressive stalk  with a dozen amusing and distinctive little mannerisms that set it apart from all other stalks .  but to the reaper man  all stalks start off as   just stalks .   now he was beginning to recognize the little differences .   there was william spigot and gabby wheels and duke bottomley .  all old men  as far as bill door could judge  with skins like leather .  there were young men and women in the village  but at a certain age they seemed to flip straight over to being old  without passing through any intermediate stage .  and then they stayed old for a long time .  miss flitworth had said that before they could start a graveyard in these parts they   d had to hit someone over the head with the shovel .   william spigot was the one that sang when he worked  breaking into that long nasal whine which meant that folk song was about to be perpetrated .  gabby wheels never said anything  this  spigot had said  was why he had been called gabby .  bill door had failed to understand the logic of this  although it seemed transparent to the others .  and duke bottomley had been named by parents with upwardly mobile if rather simplistic ideas about class structure  his brothers were squire  earl and king .   now they sat in a row under the hedge  putting off the moment when they   d need to start work again .  a glugging noise came from the end of the row .      it   s not been a bad old summer  then     said spigot .     and good harvest weather for a change .         ah   many a slip    twixt dress and drawers     said duke .     last night i saw a spider spinnin    its web backward .  that   s a sure sign there   s going to be a dretful storm .         don   t see how spiders know things like that .      gabby wheels passed a big earthenware jug to bill door .  something sloshed .   what is this .      apple juice     said spigot .  the others laughed .   ah  said bill door .  strong distilled spirits  given humorously to the unsuspecting newcomer  thus to afford simple amusement when he becomes inadvertently inebriated .      cor     said spigot .  bill door took a long swig .      and i saw swallows flying low     said duke .     and partridges are heading for the woods .  and there   s a lot of big snails about .  and           i don   t reckon any of them buggers knows the first thing about meteorology     said spigot .     i reckon you goes around tellin    em .  eh  lads .  big storm comin     mr .  spider  so get on and do somethin    folklorish .      bill door took another drink .   what is the name of the blacksmith in the village .   spigot nodded .     that   s ned simnel  down by the green .  o   course  he   s real busy about now  what with the harvest and all .      i have some work for him .   bill door got up and strode away toward the gate .      bill .      he stopped .     yes .      you can leave the brandy behind  then .         the village forge was dark and stifling in the heat .  but bill door had very good eyesight .   something moved among a complicated heap of metal .  it turned out to be the lower half of a man .  his upper body was somewhere in the machinery  from which came the occasional grunt .   a hand shot out as bill door approached .      right .  give me a three eighths gripley .      bill looked around .  a variety of tools were strewn around the forge .      come on  come on     said a voice from somewhere in the machine .   bill door selected a piece of shaped metal at random  and placed it in the hand .  it was drawn inside .  there was metallic noise  and a grunt .      i said a gripley .  this isn   t a      there was the scringeing noise of a piece of metal giving way      my thumb  my thumb  you made me      there was a clang      aargh .  that was my head .  now look what you   ve made me do .  and the ratchet spring   s snapped off the trunnion armature again  do you realize .      no .  i am sorry .   there was a pause .      is that you  young egbert .      no .  it is me  old bill door .   there was a series of thumps and twanging noises as the top half of the human extricated itself from the machinery  and turned out to belong to a young man with black curly hair  a black face  black shirt  and black apron .  he wiped a cloth across his face  leaving a pink smear  and blinked the sweat out of his eyes .      who   re you .      good old bill door .  working for miss flitworth .      oh  yes .  the man in the fire .  hero of the hour  i heard .  put it there .      he extended a black hand .  bill door looked at it blankly .   i am sorry .  i still do not know what a three eighths gripley is .      i mean your hand  mr .  door .      bill door hesitated  and then put his hand in the young man   s palm .  the oil rimmed eyes glazed for a moment  as the brain overruled the sense of touch  and then the smith smiled .      the name   s simnel .  what do you think  eh .      it   s a good name .      no  i mean the machine .  pretty ingenious  eh .      bill door regarded it with polite incomprehension .  it looked  at first sight  like a portable windmill that had been attacked by an enormous insect  and at second sight like a touring torture chamber for an inquisition that wanted to get out and about a bit and enjoy the fresh air .  mysterious jointed arms stuck out at various angles .  there were belts  and long springs .  the whole thing was mounted on spiked metal wheels .      of course  you   re not seeing it at its best when it   s standing still     said simnel .     it needs a horse to pull it .  at the moment  anyway .  i   ve got one or two rather radical ideas in that direction     he added dreamily .   it is a device of some sort .   simnel looked mildly affronted .      i prefer the term machine     he said .     it will revolutionize farming methods  and drag them kicking and screaming into the century of the fruitbat .  my folk have had this forge for three hundred years  but ned simnel doesn   t intend to spend the rest of his life nailing bits of bent metal onto horses  i can tell you .      bill looked at him blankly .  then he bent down and glanced under the machine .  a dozen sickles were bolted to a big horizontal wheel .  ingenious linkages took power from the wheels  via a selection of pulleys  to a whirligig arrangement of metal arms .   he began to experience a horrible feeling about the thing in front of him  but he asked anyway .      well  the heart of it all is this cam shaft     said simnel  gratified at the interest .     the power comes up via the pulley here  and the cams move the swaging arms   that   s these things   and the combing gate  which is operated by the reciprocating mechanism  comes down just as the gripping shutter drops in this slot here  and of course at the same time the two brass balls go around and around and the fletching sheets carry off the straw while the grain drops with the aid of gravity down the riffling screw and into the hopper .  simple .      and the three eighths gripley .      good job you reminded me .     simnel fished around among the debris on the floor  picked up a small knurled object  and screwed it onto a protruding piece of the mechanism .     very important job .  it stops the elliptical cam gradually sliding up the beam shaft and catching on the flange rebate  with disastrous results as you can no doubt imagine .      simnel stood back and wiped his hands on a cloth  making them slightly more oily .      i   m calling it the combination harvester     he said .   bill door felt very old .  in fact he was very old .  but he   d never felt it as much as this .  somewhere in the shadow of his soul he felt he knew  without the blacksmith explaining  what it was that the combination harvester was supposed to do .   oh .      we   re going to give it a trial run this afternoon up in old peedbury   s big field .  it looks very promising  i must say .  what you   re looking at now  mr .  door  is the future .      yes .   bill door ran his hand over the framework .   and the harvest itself .      hmm .  what about it .      what will it think of it .  will it know .   simnel wrinkled his nose .     know .  know .  it won   t know anything .  corn   s corn .      and sixpence is sixpence .      exactly .     simnel hesitated .     what was it you were wanting .      the tall figure ran a disconsolate finger over the oily mechanism .      mr .  door .      pardon .  oh .  yes .  i had something for you to do     he strode out of the forge and returned almost immediately with something wrapped in silk .  he unwrapped it carefully .   he   d made a new handle for the blade   not a straight one  such as they used in the mountains  but the heavy double curved handle of the plains .      you want it beaten out .  a new grass nail .  metalwork replacing .      bill door shook his head .   i want it killed .      killed .      yes .  totally .  every bit destroyed .  so that it is absolutely dead .      nice scythe     said simnel .     seems a shame .  you   ve kept a good edge on it        don   t touch it .   simnel sucked his finger .      funny     he said     i could have sworn i didn   t touch it .  my hand was inches away .  well  it   s sharp  anyway .      he swished it through the air .     yes .       he paused  stuck his little finger in his ear and swiveled it around a bit .      you sure you know what you want .     he said .   bill door solemnly repeated his request .   simnel shrugged .     well  i suppose i could melt it down and burn the handle     he said .   yes .      well  okay .  it   s your scythe .  and you   re basically right  of course .  this is old technology now .  redundant .      i fear you may be right .   simnel jerked a grimy thumb toward the combination harvester .  bill door knew it was made only of metal and canvas  and therefore couldn   t possibly lurk .  but it was lurking .  moreover  it was doing so with a chilling  metallic smugness .      you could get miss flitworth to buy one of these  mr .  door .  it   d be just the job for a one man farm like that .  i can see you now  up there  up in the breeze  with the belts clacking away and the sparge arms oscillating        no .      go on .  she could afford it .  they say she   s got boxes full of treasure from the old days .      no .      er       simnel hesitated .  the last    no    contained a threat more certain than the creak of thin ice on a deep river .  it said that going any further could be the most foolhardy thing simnel would ever do .      i   m sure you know your own mind best     he mumbled .   yes .      then it   ll just be  oh  call it a farthing for the scythe     simnel gabbled .     sorry about that  but it   ll use a lot of coals  you see  and those dwarfs keep winding up the price of        here .  it must be done by tonight .   simnel didn   t argue .  arguing would mean that bill door remained in the forge  and he was getting quite anxious that this should not be so .     fine  fine .      you understand .     right .  right .      farewell  said bill door solemnly  and left .   simnel shut the doors after him  and leaned against them .  whew .  nice man  of course  everyone was talking about him  it was just that after a couple of minutes in his presence you got a pin and needles sensation that someone was walking over your grave and it hadn   t even been dug yet .   he wandered across the oily floor  filled the tea kettle and wedged it on a corner of the forge .  he picked up a spanner to do some final adjustments to the combination harvester  and spotted the scythe leaning against the wall .   he tiptoed toward it  and realized that tiptoeing was an amazingly stupid thing to do .  it wasn   t alive .  it couldn   t hear .  it just looked sharp .   he raised the spanner  and felt guilty about it .  but mr .  door had said   well  mr .  door had said something very odd  using the wrong sort of words to use in talking about a mere implement .  but he could hardly object to this .   simnel brought the spanner down hard .   there was no resistance .  he would have sworn  again  that the spanner sheared in two  as though it was made of bread  several inches from the edge of the blade .   he wondered if something could be so sharp that it began to possess  not just a sharp edge  but the very essence of sharpness itself  a field of absolute sharpness that actually extended beyond the last atoms of metal .       and then he remembered that this was sloppy and superstitious thinking for a man who knew how to bevel a three eighths gripley .  you knew where you were with a reciprocating linkage .  it either worked or it didn   t .  it certainly didn   t present you with mysteries .   he looked proudly at the combination harvester .  of course  you needed a horse to pull it .  that spoiled things a bit .  horses belonged to yesterday  tomorrow belonged to the combination harvester and its descendants  which would make the world a cleaner and better place .  it was just a matter of taking the horse out of the equation .  he   d tried clockwork  and that wasn   t powerful enough .  maybe if he tried winding a     behind him  the kettle boiled over and put the fire out .   simnel fought his way through the steam .  that was the bloody trouble  every time .  whenever someone was trying to do a bit of sensible thinking  there was always some pointless distraction .      mrs .  cake drew the curtains .      who exactly is one man bucket .     said windle .   she lit a couple of candles and sat down .         e belonged to one of them heathen howondaland tribes     she said shortly .      very strange name  one man bucket     said windle .      it   s not    is full name     said mrs .  cake darkly .     now  we   ve got to    old    ands .     she looked at him speculatively .     we need someone else .         i could call schleppel     said windle .      i ain   t    aving no bogey under my table trying to look up me drawers     said mrs .  cake .     ludmilla .     she shouted .  after a moment or two the bead curtain leading into the kitchen was swept aside and the young woman who had originally opened the door to windle came in .      yes  mother .         sit down  girl .  we need another one for the seancing .         yes  mother .      the girl smiled at windle .      this is ludmilla     said mrs .  cake shortly .      charmed  i   m sure     said windle .  ludmilla gave him the bright  crystalline smile perfected by people who had long ago learned not to let their feelings show .      we have already met     said windle .  it must be at least a day since full moon  he thought .  all the signs are nearly gone .  nearly .  well  well  well        she   s my shame     said mrs .  cake .      mother  you do go on     said ludmilla  without rancor .      join hands     said mrs .  cake .   they sat in the semi darkness .  then windle felt mrs .  cake   s hand being pulled away .      oi forgot about the glass     she said .      i thought  mrs .  cake  that you didn   t hold with ouija boards and that sort of       windle began .  there was a glugging noise from the sideboard .  mrs .  cake put a full glass on the tablecloth and sat down again .      oi don   t     she said .   silence descended again .  windle cleared his throat nervously .   eventually mrs .  cake said     all right  one man bucket  oi knows you   re there .      the glass moved .  the amber liquid inside sloshed gently .   a bodiless voice quavered  greetings  pale face  from the happy hunting ground        you stop that     said mrs .  cake .     everyone knows you got run over by a cart in treacle street because you was drunk  one man bucket .      s   not my fault .  not my fault .  is it my fault my great grandad moved here .  by rights i should have been mauled to death by a mountain lion or a giant mammoth or something .  i bin denied my deathright .      mr .  poons here wants to ask you a question  one man bucket     said mrs .  cake .   she is happy here and waiting for you to join her  said one man bucket .      who is .     said windle .   this seemed to fox one man bucket .  it was a line that generally satisfied without further explanation .   who would you like .  he asked cautiously .  can i have that drink now .      not yet  one man bucket     said mrs .  cake .   well  i need it .  it   s bloody crowded in here .      what .     said windle quickly .     with ghosts  you mean .      there   s hundreds of    em  said the voice of one man bucket .   windle was disappointed .      only hundreds .     he said .     that doesn   t sound a lot .         not many people become ghosts     said mrs .  cake .     to be a ghost  you got to have  like  serious unfinished business  or a terrible revenge to take  or a cosmic purpose in which you are just a pawn .      or a cruel thirst  said one man bucket .      will you hark at him     said mrs .  cake .   i wanted to stay in the spirit world  or even wine and beer  hngh .  hngh .  hngh .      so what happens to the life force if things stop living .     said windle .     is that what   s causing all this trouble .         you tell the man     said mrs .  cake  when one man bucket seemed reluctant to answer .   what trouble you talking about .      things unscrewing .  clothes running around by themselves .  everyone feeling more alive .  that sort of thing .      that .  that   s nothing .  see  the life force leaks back where it can .  you don   t need to worry about that .   windle put his hand over the glass .      but there   s something i should be worrying about  isn   t there     he said flatly .     it   s to do with the little glass souvenirs .      don   t like to say .      do tell him .      it was ludmilla   s voice   deep but  somehow  attractive .  lupine was watching her intently .  windle smiled .  that was one of the advantages about being dead .  you spotted things the living ignored .   one man bucket sounded shrill and petulant .   what   s he going to do if i tell him  then .  i could get into heap big trouble for that sort of thing .      well  can you tell me if i guess right .     said windle .   ye ess .  maybe .      you don   t have to say anythin        said mrs .  cake .     just knock twice for yes and once for no  like in the old days .      oh  all right .      go on  mr .  poons     said ludmilla .  she had the kind of voice windle wanted to stroke .   he cleared his throat .      i think     he began     that is  i think they   re some sort of eggs .  i thought   why breakfast .  and then i thought   eggs        knock .      oh .  well  perhaps it was a rather silly idea        sorry  was it once for yes or twice for yes .      twoice .     snapped the medium .   knock .  knock .      ah     breathed windle .     and they hatch into something with wheels on .      twice for yes  was it .      roight .      knock .  knock .      i thought so .  i thought so .  i found one under my floor that tried to hatch where there wasn   t enough room .     crowed windle .  then he frowned .      but hatch into what .         mustrum ridcully trotted into his study and took his wizard   s staff from its rack over the fireplace .  he licked his finger and gingerly touched the top of the staff .  there was a small octarine spark and a smell of greasy tin .   he headed back for the door .   then he turned around slowly  because his brain had just had time to analyze the study   s cluttered contents and spot the oddity .      what the hell   s that doin    there .     he said .   he prodded it with the tip of the staff .  it gave a jingling noise and rolled a little way .   it looked vaguely  but not very much  like the sort of thing the maids trundled around loaded with mops and fresh linen and whatever it was maids pushed around .  ridcully made a mental note to take it up with the housekeeper .  then he forgot about it .      damn wire wheely things are gettin    everywhere     he muttered .   upon the word    damn     something like a large bluebottle with cat sized dentures flopped out of the air  fluttered madly as it took stock of its surroundings  and then flew after the unheeding archchancellor .   the words of wizards have power .  and swearwords have power .  and with life force practically crystallising out of the air  it had to find outlets wherever it could .      cities .  said one man bucket .  i think they   re city eggs .      the senior wizards gathered again in the great hall .  even the senior wrangler was feeling a certain excitement .  it was considered bad form to use magic against fellow wizards  and using it against civilians was unsporting .  it did you good to have a really righteous zap occasionally .   the archchancellor looked them over .      dean  why have you got stripes all over your face .     he inquired .      camouflage  archchancellor .         camouflage  eh .         yo  archchancellor .         oh  well .  so long as you feel happy in yourself  that   s what matters .      they crept out toward the patch of ground that had been modo   s little territory .  at least  most of them crept .  the dean advanced in a series of spinning leaps  occasionally flattening himself against the wall  and saying    hut .  hut .  hut .     under his breath .   he was absolutely crestfallen when the other heaps turned out to be still where modo had built them .  the gardener  who had tagged along behind and had twice nearly been flattened by the dean  fussed around them for a while .      they   re just lying low     said the dean .     i say we blow up the godsdamn           they   re not even warm yet     said modo .     that one must have been the oldest .         you mean we haven   t got anything to fight .     said the archchancellor .   the ground shook underfoot .  and then there was a faint jangling noise  from the direction of the cloisters .   ridcully frowned .      someone   s pushing those damn wire baskety things around again     he said .     there was one in my study tonight .         huh     said the senior wrangler .     there was one in my bedroom .  i opened the wardrobe and there it was .         in your wardrobe .  what   d you put it in there for .     said ridcully .      i didn   t .  i told you .  it was probably the students .  it   s their kind of humor .  one of them put a hairbrush in my bed once .         i fell over one earlier     said the archchancellor     and then when i looked around for it  someone had taken it away .      the jingling noise got closer .      right  mr .  so called clever dick young fella me lad     said ridcully  tapping his staff once or twice on his palm in a meaningful way .   the wizards backed up against the wall .   the phantom trolley pusher was almost on them .   ridcully snarled  and leapt out of hiding .      aha  my fine young   bloody hellfire .            don   t be pullin    moi leg     said mrs .  cake .     cities ain   t alive .  i know people says they are  but they don   t mean really .      windle poons turned one of the snowballs around in his hand .      it must be laying thousands of them     he said .     but they wouldn   t all survive  of course .  otherwise we   d be up to here in cities  yes .         you telling us that these little balls hatch out into huge places .     said ludmilla .   not straight away .  there   s the mobile stage first .      something with wheels on     said windle .   that   s right .  i can see you know already .      i think i knew     said windle poons     but i didn   t understand .  and what happens after the mobile stage .      don   t know .   windle stood up .      then it   s time to find out     he said .   he glanced at ludmilla and lupine .  ah .  yes .  and why not .  if you can help somebody as you pass this way  windle thought  then your living  or whatever  shall not be in vain .   he let himself fall into a stoop and let a little crackle enter his voice .      but i   m rather unsteady on my legs these days     he quavered .     it would really be a great favor if someone could help me along .  could you see me as far as the university  young lady .         ludmilla doesn   t go out much these days because her health       mrs .  cake began briskly .      is absolutely fine     said ludmilla .     mother  you know it   s been a whole day since full moo           ludmilla .         well  it has .         it   s not safe for a young woman to walk the streets these days     said mrs .  cake .      but mr .  poons    wonderful dog would frighten away the most dangerous criminal     said ludmilla .   on cue  lupine barked helpfully and begged .  mrs .  cake regarded him critically .      he   s certainly a very obedient animal     she said  reluctantly .      that   s settled  then     said ludmilla .     i   ll fetch my shawl .      lupine rolled over .  windle nudged him with a foot .      be good     he said .   there was a meaningful cough from one man bucket .      all right  all right     said mrs .  cake .  she took a bundle of matches from the dresser  lit one absent mindedly with her fingernail  and dropped it into the whiskey glass .  it burned with a blue flame  and somewhere in the spirit world the specter of a stiff double lasted just long enough .   as windle poone left the house  he thought he could hear a ghostly voice raised in song .      the trolley stopped .  it swiveled from side to side  as if observing the wizards .  then it did a fast three point turn and trundled off at high speed .      get it .     bellowed the archchancellor .   he aimed his staff and got off a fireball which turned a small area of cobblestones into something yellow and bubbly .  the speeding trolley rocked wildly but kept going  with one wheel rattling and squeaking .      it   s from the dungeon dimensions .     said the dean .     cream the basket .      the archchancellor laid a steadying hand on his shoulder .     don   t be daft .  dungeon things have a lot more tentacles and things .  they don   t look made .      they turned at the sound of another trolley .  it rattled unconcernedly down a side passage  stopped when it saw or otherwise perceived the wizards  and did a creditable impression of a trolley that had just been left there by someone .   the bursar crept up to it .      it   s no use you looking like that     he said .     we know you can move .         we all seed you     said the dean .   the trolley maintained a low profile .      it can   t be thinking     said the lecturer in recent runes .     there   s no room for a brain .         who says it   s thinking .     said the archchancellor .     all it does is move .  who needs brains for that .  prawns move .      he ran his fingers over the metalwork .      actually  prawns are quite intell       the senior wrangler began .      shut up     said ridcully .     hmm .  is this made  though .         it   s wire     said the senior wrangler .     wire   s something that you have to make .  and there   s wheels .  hardly anything natural   s got wheels .         it   s just that up close  it looks              all one thing     said the lecturer in recent runes  who had knelt down painfully to inspect it the better .     like one unit .  made all in one lump .  like a machine that   s been grown .  but that   s ridiculous .         maybe .  isn   t there a sort of cuckoo in the ramtops that builds clocks to nest in .     said the bursar .      yes  but that   s just courtship ritual     said the lecturer in recent runes airily .     besides  they keep lousy time .      the trolley leapt for a gap in the wizards and would have made it except that the gap was occupied by the bursar  who gave a scream and pitched forward into the basket .  the trolley didn   t stop but rattled onward  toward the gates .   the dean raised his staff .  the archchancellor grabbed it .      you might hit the bursar     he said .      just one small fireball .         it   s tempting  but no .  come on .  after it .         yo .         if you like .      the wizards lumbered in pursuit .  behind them  as yet unnoticed  a whole flock of the archchancellor   s swearwords fluttered and buzzed .  and windle poons was leading a small deputation to the library .      the librarian of unseen university knuckled his way hurriedly across the floor as the door shook to a thunderous knocking .      i know you   re in there     came the voice of windle poons .     you must let us in .  it   s vitally important .         oook .         you won   t open the doors .         oook .         then you leave me no choice        ancient blocks of masonry moved aside slowly .  mortar crumbled .  then part of the wall fell in  leaving windle poons standing in a windle poons shaped hole .  he coughed on the dust .      i hate having to do that     he said .     i can   t help feeling it   s pandering to popular prejudice .      the librarian landed on his shoulders .  to the orangutan   s surprise  this made very little difference .  a     pound orangutan usually had a noticeable effect on a person   s rate of progress  but windle wore him like a collar .      i think we need ancient history     he said .     i wonder  could you stop trying to twist my head off .      the librarian looked around wildly .  it was a technique that normally never failed .   then his nostrils flared .   the librarian hadn   t always been an ape .  amagical library is a dangerous place to work  and he   d been turned into an orangutan as a result of a magical explosion .  he   d been a quite inoffensive human  although by now so many people had come to terms with his new shape that few people remembered it .  but with the change had come the key to a whole bundle of senses and racial memories .  and one of the deepest  most fundamental  most borne in the bone of all of them was to do with shapes .  it went back to the dawn of sapience .  shapes with muzzles  teeth and four legs were  in the evolving simian mind  definitely filed under bad news .   a very large wolf had padded through the hole in the wall  followed by an attractive young woman .  the librarian   s signal input was temporarily fused .      also     said windle     it is just possible that i could knot your arms behind you .         eeek .         he   s not an ordinary wolf .  you   d better believe it .         oook .      windle lowered his voice .     and she might not technically be a woman     he added .   the librarian looked at ludmilla .  his nostrils flared again .  his brow wrinkled .      oook .     .      all right  i may have put that rather clumsily .  do let go  there   s a good fellow .      the librarian released his grip very cautiously and sank to the floor  keeping windle between himself and lupine .   windle brushed mortar fragments off the remains of his robe .      we need to find out     he said     about the lives of cities .  specifically  i need to know        there was a faint jangling noise .   a wire basket rolled nonchalantly around the massive stack of the nearest bookcase .  it was full of books .  it stopped as soon as it realized that it had been seen and contrived to look as though it had never moved at all .      the mobile stage     breathed windle poons .   the wire basket tried to inch backward without appearing to move .  lupine growled .      is that what one man bucket was talking about .     said ludmilla .  the trolley vanished .  the librarian grunted  and went after it .      oh  yes .  something that would make itself useful     said windle  suddenly almost manically cheerful .     that   s how it   d work .  first  something that you   d want to keep  and put away somewhere .  thousands wouldn   t get the right conditions  but that wouldn   t matter  because there would be thousands .  and then the next stage would be something that would be handy  and get everywhere  and no one would ever think it had got there by itself .  but it   s all happening at the wrong time .         but how can a city be alive .  it   s only made up of dead parts .     said ludmilla .      so   re people .  take it from me .  i know .  but you are right .  i think .  this shouldn   t be happening .  it   s all this extra life force .  it   s   it   s tipping the balance .  it   s turning something that isn   t really real into a reality .  and it   s happening too early  and it   s happening too fast        there was a squeal from the librarian .  the trolley erupted from another row of shelves  wheels a blur  heading for the hole in the wall  with the orangutan hanging on grimly with one hand and flapping behind it like a very fat flag .   the wolf leapt .      lupine .     shouted windle .   but from the days when the first cavemen rolled a slice of log down a hill  canines have also had a deep racial urge to chase anything on wheels .  lupine was already snapping at the trolley .   his jaws met on a wheel .  there was a howl  a scream from the librarian  and ape  wolf and wire basket ended up in a heap against the wall .      oh  the poor thing .  look at him .      ludmilla rushed across the floor and knelt down by the stricken wolf .      it went right over his paws  look .         and he   s probably lost a couple of teeth     said windle .  he helped the librarian up .  there was a red glow in the ape   s eyes .  it had tried to steal his books .  this was probably the best proof any wizard could require that the trolleys were brainless .   he reached down and wrenched the wheels off the trolley .      ol       said windle .      oook .         no  not    with milk        said windle .   lupine was having his head cradled in ludmilla   s lap .  he had lost a tooth  and his fur was a mess .  he opened one eye and fixed windle with a conspiratorial yellow stare while his ears were stroked .  there   s a lucky dog  thought windle  who   s going to push his luck and hold up a paw and whine .      right     said windle .     now  librarian   you were about to help us  i think .         poor brave dog     said ludmilla .   lupine raised a paw pathetically  and whined .      burdened by the screaming form of the bursar  the other wire basket couldn   t get up to the speed of its departed comrade .  one wheel also trailed uselessly .  it canted recklessly from side to side and nearly fell over as it shot through the gates  moving sideways .      i can see it clear .  i can see it clear .     screamed the dean .      don   t .  you might hit the bursar .     bellowed ridcully .     you might damage university property .      but the dean couldn   t hear for the roar of unaccustomed testosterone .  a searing green fireball struck the skewing trolley .  the air was filled with flying wheels .   ridcully took a deep breath .      you stupid    .     he screamed .   the word he uttered was unfamiliar to those wizards who had not had his robust country up bringing and knew nothing of the finer points of animal husbandry .  but it plopped into existence a few inches from his face  it was fat  round  black and glossy  with horrible eyebrows .  it blew him an insectile raspberry and flew up to join the little swarm of curses .      what the hell was that .      a smaller thing flashed into existence by his ear .   ridcully snatched at his hat .      damn .       the swarm increased by one      something just bit me .      a squadron of newly hatched blasteds made a valiant bid for freedom .  he swatted at them ineffectually .      get away  you b       he began .      don   t say it .     said the senior wrangler .     shut up .      people never told the archchancellor to shut up .  shutting up was something that happened to other people .  he shut up out of shock .      i mean  every time you swear it comes alive     said the senior wrangler hurriedly .     ghastly little winged things pop out of the air .         bloody hellfire .     said the archchancellor .   pop .  pop .   the bursar crawled dazed out of the tangled wreckage of the wire trolley .  he found his pointy hat  dusted it off  tried it on  frowned  and took a wheel out of it .  his colleagues didn   t seem to be paying him much attention .   he heard the archchancellor say     but i   ve always done it .  nothing wrong with a good swear  it keeps the blood flowing .  watch out  dean  one of the bug           can   t you say something else .     shouted the senior wrangler  above the buzz and whine of the swarm .      like what .         like   oh   like   darn .         darn .     .      yes  or maybe poot .         poot .  you want me to say poot .      the bursar crept up to the group .  arguing over petty details at times of dimensional emergency was a familiar wizardly trait .      mrs .  whitlow the housekeeper always says    sugar .     when she drops something     he volunteered .   the archchancellor turned on him .      she may say sugar     he growled     but what she means is shi        the wizards ducked .  ridcully managed to stop himself .      oh  darn     he said miserably .  the swear words settled amiably on his hat .      they like you     said the dean .      you   re their daddy     said the lecturer in recent runes .   ridcully scowled .     you b   boys can stop being silly at your archchancellor   s expense and da   jolly well find out what   s going on     he said .   the wizards looked expectantly at the air .  nothing appeared .      you   re doing fine     said the lecturer in recent runes .     keep it up .         darn darn darn     said the archchancellor .     sugar sugar sugar .  pooty pootity poot .     he shook his head .     it   s no good  it doesn   t relieve my feelings one bit .         it   s cleared the air  at any rate     said the bursar .   they noticed his presence for the first time .   they looked at the remains of the trolley .      things zooming around     said ridcully .     things coming alive .      they looked up at a suddenly familiar squeaking noise .  two more wheeled baskets rattled across the square outside the gates .  one was full of fruit .  the other was half full of fruit and half full of small screaming child .   the wizards watched open mouthed .  a stream of people were galloping after the trolleys .  slightly in the lead  elbows scything through the air  a desperate and determined woman pounded past the university gates .   the archchancellor grabbed a heavy set man who was lumbering along gamely at the back of the crowd .      what happened .         i was just loading some peaches into that basket thing when it upped and ran away on me .         what about the child .         search me .  this woman had one of the baskets and she bought some peaches off of me an    then        they all turned .  a basket rattled out of the mouth of an alleyway  saw them  turned smartly and shot off across the square .      but why .     said ridcully .      they   re so handy to put things in  right .     said the man .     i got to get them peaches .  you know how they bruise .         and they   re all going in the same direction     said the lecturer in recent runes .     anyone else notice that .         after them .     screamed the dean .  the other wizards  too bewildered to argue  lumbered after him .      no       ridcully began  and realized that it was hopeless .  and he was losing the initiative .  he carefully formulated the most genteel battle cry in the history of bowdlerism .      darn them to heck .     he yelled  and ran after the dean .      bill door worked through the long heavy afternoon  at the head of a trail of binders and stackers .   until there was a shout  and the men ran toward the hedge .   iago peedbury   s big field was right on the other side .  his farmhands were wheeling the combination harvester through the gate .   bill joined the others leaning over the hedge .  the distant figure of simnel could be seen  giving instructions .  a frightened horse was backed into the shafts .  the blacksmith climbed into the little metal seat in the middle of the machinery and took up the reins .   the horse walked forward .  the sparge arms unfolded .  the canvas sheets started to revolve  and probably the riffling screw was turning  but that didn   t matter because something somewhere went    clonk    and everything stopped .   from the crowd at the hedge there were shouts of    get out and milk it .         we had one but the end fell off .         tuppence more and up goes the donkey .     and other time honored witticisms .   simnel got down  held a whispered conversation with peedbury and his men  and then disappeared into the machinery for a moment .      it   ll never fly .         veal will be cheap tomorrow .      this time the combination harvester got several feet before one of the rotating sheets split and folded up .   by now some of the older men at the hedge were doubled up with laughter .      any old iron  sixpence a load .         fetch the other one  this one   s broke .      simnel got down again .  distant catcalls drifted toward him as he untied the sheet and replaced it with a new one  he ignored them .   without moving his gaze from the scene in the opposite field  bill door pulled a sharpening stone out of his pocket and began to hone his scythe  slowly and deliberately .   apart from the distant clink of the blacksmith   s tools  the schip schip of stone on metal was the only sound in the heavy air .   simnel climbed back into the harvester and nodded to the man leading the horse .      here we go again .         any more for the skylark .         put a sock in it    .      the cries trailed off .   half a dozen pairs of eyes followed the combination harvester up the field  stared while it was turned around on the headland  watched it come back again .   it clicked past  reciprocating and oscillating .   at the bottom of the field it turned around neatly .   it whirred by again .   after a while one of the watchers said  gloomily     it   ll never catch on  you mark my words .         right enough .  who   s going to want a gadget like that .     said another .      sure and it   s only like a big clock .  can   t do anything more than go up and down a field              very fast              cutting the corn like that and stripping the grain off           it   s done three rows already .         bugger me .         you can   t hardly see the bits move .  what do you think of that  bill .  bill .      they looked around .   he was halfway up his second row  but accelerating .      miss flitworth opened the door a fraction .      yes .     she said  suspiciously .      it   s bill door  miss flitworth .  we   ve brought him home .      she opened the door wider .      what happened to him .      the two men shuffled in awkwardly  trying to support a figure a foot taller than they were .  it raised it   s head and squinted muzzily at miss flitworth .      don   t know what come over him     said duke bottomley .      he   s a devil for working     said william spigot .     you   re getting your money   s worth out of him all right  miss flitworth .         it   ll be the first time  then  in these parts     she said sourly .      up and down the field like a madman  trying to better that contraption of ned simnel   s .  took four of us to do the binding .  he nearly beat it  too .         put him down on the sofa .         he tole him he was doing too much in all that sun       duke craned his neck to see around the kitchen  just in case jewels and treasure were hanging out of the dresser drawers .   miss flitworth eclipsed his view .      i   m sure you did .  thank you .  now i expect you   ll be wanting to be off home .         if there   s anything we can do           i know where you live .  and you ain   t paid no rent there for five years  too .  goodbye  mr .  spigot .      she ushered them to the door and shut it in their faces .  then she turned around .      what the hell have you been doing  mr .  so called bill door .      i am tired and it won   t stop .   bill door clutched at his skull .   also spigot gave me a humorous apple juice fermented drink because of the heat and now i feel ill .      i ain   t surprised .  he makes it up in the woods .  apples isn   t the half of it .      i have never felt ill before .  or tired .      it   s all part of being alive .      how do humans stand it .      well  fermented apple juice can help .      bill door sat staring gloomily at the floor .   but we finished the field  he said  with a hint of triumph .  all stacked in stooks  or possibly the other way around .   he clutched at his skull again .   aargh .   miss flitworth disappeared into the scullery .  there was the creaking of a pump .  she returned with a damp flannel and a glass of water .   there   s a newt in it .      shows it   s fresh     said miss flitworth   fishing the amphibian out and releasing it on the flagstones  where it scuttled away into a crack .   bill door tried to stand up .   now i almost know why some people wish to die  he said .  i had heard of pain and misery but i had not hitherto fully understood what they meant .   miss flitworth peered through the dusty window .  the clouds that had been piling up all afternoon towered over the hills  gray with a menacing hint of yellow .  the heat pressed down like a vice .      there   s a big storm coming .      will it spoil my harvest .      no .  it   ll dry out after .      how is the child .   bill door unfolded his palm .  miss flitworth raised her eyebrows .  the golden glass was there  the top bulb almost empty .  but it shimmered in and out of vision .      how come you   ve got it .  it   s upstairs .  she was holding it like       she floundered      like someone holds something very tightly .      she still is .  but it is also here .  or anywhere .  it is only a metaphor  after all .      what she   s holding looks real enough .      just because something is a metaphor doesn   t mean it can   t be real .   miss flitworth was aware of a faint echo in the voice  as though the words were being spoken by two people almost  but not quite  in sync .      how long have you got .      a matter of hours .      and the scythe .      i gave the blacksmith strict instructions .   she frowned .     i   m not saying young simnel   s a bad lad  but are you sure he   ll do it .  it   s asking a lot of a man like him to destroy something like that .      i had no choice .  the little furnace here isn   t good enough .      it   s a wicked sharp scythe .      i fear it may not be sharp enough .      and no one ever tried this on you .      there is a saying  you can   t take it with you .      yes .      how many people have seriously believed it .      i remember reading once     said miss flitworth     about these heathen kings in the desert somewhere who build huge pyramids and put all sorts of stuff in them .  even boats .  even gels in transparent trousers and a couple of saucepan lids .  you can   t tell me that   s right .      i   ve never been very sure about what is right  said bill door .  i am not sure there is such a thing as right .  or wrong .  just places to stand .      no  right   s right and wrong   s wrong     said miss flitworth .     i was brought up to tell the difference .      by a contrabandistor .      a what .      a mover of contraband .      there   s nothing wrong with smuggling .      i merely point out that some people think otherwise .      they don   t count .      but     lightning struck  somewhere on the hill .  the thunderclap rocked the house  a few bricks from the chimney rattled into the grate .  then the windows shook to a fierce pounding .   bill door strode across the room and threw open the door .   hailstones the size of hens    eggs bounced off the doorstep and into the kitchen .   oh .  drama .      oh  hell .      miss flitworth ducked under his arm .      and where   s the wind come from .      the sky .  said bill door  surprised at the sudden excitement .      come on .     she whirled back into the kitchen and scrabbled on the dresser for a candle lantern and some matches .   but you said it would dry .      in a normal storm  yes .  in this lot .  it   s going to be ruined .  we   ll find it spread all over the hill in the morning .      she fumbled the candle alight and ran back again .   bill door looked out into the storm .  straws whirred past  tumbling on the gale .   ruined .  my harvest .  he straightened up .  bugger that .      the hail rumbled on the roof of the smithy .   ned simnel pumped the furnace bellows until the heart of the coals was white with the merest hint of yellow .   it had been a good day .  the combination harvester had worked better than he   d dared to hope  old peedbury had insisted on keeping it to do another field tomorrow  so it had been left out with a tarpaulin over it  securely tied down .  tomorrow he could teach one of the men to use it  and start work on a new improved model .  success was assured .  the future definitely lay ahead .   then there was the matter of the scythe .  he went to the wall where it had been hung .  a bit of a mystery  that .  here was the most superb instrument of its kind he   d ever seen .  you couldn   t even blunt it .  its sharpness extended well beyond its actual edge .  and yet he was supposed to destroy it .  where was the sense in that .  ned simnel was a great believer in sense  of a certain specialized kind .   maybe bill door just wanted to be rid of it  and that was understandable  because even now when it hung innocuously enough from the wall it seemed to radiate sharpness .  there was a faint violet corona around the blade  caused by the drafts in the room driving luckless air molecules to their severed death .   ned simnel picked it up with great care .   weird fellow  bill door .  he   d said he wanted to be sure it was absolutely dead .  as if you could kill a thing .      anyway  how could anyone destroy it .  oh  the handle would burn and the metal would calcine and  if he worked hard enough  eventually there   d be nothing more than a little heap of dust and ashes .  that was what the customer wanted .   on the other hand  presumably you could destroy it just by taking the blade off the handle   after all  it wouldn   t be a scythe if you did that .  it   d just be  well   bits .  certainly  you could make a scythe out of them  but you could probably do that with the dust and ashes if you knew how to do it .   ned simnel was quite pleased with this line of argument .  and  after all  bill door hadn   t even asked for proof that the thing had been  er  killed .   he took sight carefully and then used the scythe to chop the end off the anvil .  uncanny .   total sharpness .   he gave in .  it was unfair .  you couldn   t ask someone like him to destroy something like this .  it was a work of art .   it was better than that .  it was a work of craft .   he walked across the room to a stack of timber and thrust the scythe well out of the way behind the heap .  there was a brief  punctured squeak .   anyway  it would be all right .  he   d give bill his farthing back in the morning .      the death of rats materialized behind the heap in the forge  and trudged to the sad little heap of fur that had been a rat that got in the way of the scythe .   its ghost was standing beside it  looking apprehensive .  it didn   t seem very pleased to see him .      squeak .  squeak .      squeak  the death of rats explained .      squeak .      squeak  the death of rats confirmed .       preen whiskers   twitch nose  .      the death of rats shook its head .   squeak .   the rat was crestfallen .  the death of rats laid a bony but not entirely unkind paw on its shoulder .   squeak .   the rat nodded sadly .  it had been a good life in the forge .  ned   s housekeeping was almost nonexistent  and he was probably the world champion absent minded leaver of unfinished sandwiches .  it shrugged  and trooped after the small robed figure .  it wasn   t as if it had any choice .      people were streaming through the streets .  most of them were chasing trolleys .  most of the trolleys were full of whatever people had found a trolley useful to carry   firewood  children  shopping .   and they were no longer dodging  but moving blindly  all in the same direction .   you could stop a trolley by turning it over  when its wheels spun madly and uselessly .  the wizards saw a number of enthusiastic individuals trying to smash them  but the trolleys were practically indestructible   they bent but didn   t break  and if they had even one wheel left they   d make a valiant attempt to keep going .      look at that one .     said the archchancellor .     it   s got my laundry in it .  my actual laundry .  darn that for a lark .      he pushed his way through the crowds and rammed his staff into the trolley   s wheels  toppling it over .      we can   t get a clear shot at anything with all these civilians around     complained the dean .      there   s hundreds of trolleys .     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it   s just like vermine .   get away from me  you   you basket .      he flailed at an importunate trolley with his staff .   the tide of wheeled baskets was flowing out of the city .  the struggling humans gradually dropped out or fell under the wobbling wheels .  only the wizards stayed in the flowing tide  shouting at one another and attacking the silvery swarm with their staves .  it wasn   t that magic didn   t work .  it worked quite well .  a good zap could turn a trolley into a thousand intricate little wire puzzles .  but what good did that do .  a moment later two others would trundle over their stricken sibling .   around the dean trolleys were being splashed into metal droplets .      he   s really getting the hang of it  isn   t he .     said the senior wrangler  as he and the bursar levered yet another basket onto its back .      he   s certainly saying yo a lot     said the bursar .   the dean himself didn   t know when he   d been happier .  for sixty years he   d been obeying all the self regulating rules of wizardry  and suddenly he was having the time of his life .  he   d never realized that  deep down inside  what he really wanted to do was make things go splat .   fire leapt from the tip of his staff .  handles and bits of wire and pathetically spinning wheels tinkled down around him .  and what made it even better was that there was no end to the targets .  a second wave of trolleys  crammed into a tighter space  was trying to advance over the tops of those still in actual contact with the ground .  it wasn   t working  but they were trying anyway .  and trying desperately  because a third wave was already crunching and smashing its way over the top of them .  except that you couldn   t use the word    trying .     it suggested some sort of conscious effort  some sort of possibility that there might also be a state of    not trying .     something about the relentless movement  the way they crushed one another in their surge  suggested that the wire baskets had as much choice in the matter as water has about flowing downhill .      yo .     shouted the dean .  raw magic smacked into the grinding tangle of metal .  it rained wheels .      eat hot thaumaturgy  you m        the dean began .      don   t swear .  don   t swear .     shouted ridcully above the noise .  he tried to swat a silly bugger that was orbiting his hat .     there   s no telling what it might turn into .         bother .     screamed the dean .      it   s no good .  we might as well be trying to hold back the sea     said the senior wrangler .     i vote we head back to the university and pick up some really tough spells .         good idea     said ridcully .  he looked up at the advancing wall of twisted wire .     any idea how .     he said .      yo .  scallywags .     said the dean .  he aimed his staff again .  it made a sad little noise that  if it was written down  could only be spelled pfffft .  a feeble spark fell off the end and onto the cobbles .      windle poons slammed another book shut .  the librarian winced .      nothing .  volcanoes  tidal waves  wrath of gods  meddling wizards   i don   t want to know how other cities have been killed  i want to know how they ended        the librarian stacked another pile of books on the reading desk .  another plus about being dead  windle was finding  was an ability with languages .  he could see the sense in the words without knowing the actual meaning .  being dead wasn   t like falling asleep after all .  it was like waking up .   he glanced across the library to where lupine was having his paw bandaged .      librarian .     he said softly .      oook .         you   ve changed species in your time   what would you do if  for the sake of argument  you found a couple of people who   well  suppose there was a wolf that changed into a wolfman at the full moon  and a woman that changed into a wolfwoman at the full moon   you know  approaching the same shape but from opposite directions .  and they   d met .  what do you tell them .  do you let them sort it out for themselves .         oook     said the librarian  instantly .      it   s tempting .         oook .         mrs .  cake wouldn   t like it  though .         eeek oook .         you   re right .  you could have put it a little less coarsely  but you   re right .  everyone has to sort things out for themselves .      he sighed  and turned the page .  his eyes widened .      the city of kahn li     he said .     ever heard of it .  what   s this book .     stripfettle   s believe it or not grimoire .     says here      little carts   none knew from where they came   of such great use  men were employed to herd them and bring them into the city   of a sudden  like unto a rush of creatures   men followed them and behold  there was a new city outside the walls  a city as of merchants    booths wherein the carts ran           he turned the page .      it seems to say        i still haven   t understood it properly  he told himself .  one man bucket thinks we   re talking about the breeding of cities .  but that doesn   t feel right .   a city is alive .  supposing you were a great slow giant  like a counting pine  and looked down at a city .  you   d see buildings grow  you   d see attackers driven off  you   d see fires put out .  you   d see the city was alive but you wouldn   t see people  because they   d move too fast .  the life of a city  the thing that drives it  isn   t some sort of mysterious force .  the life of a city is people .   he turned the pages absently  not really looking     so we have the cities   big  sedentary creatures  growing from one spot and hardly moving at all for thousands of years .  they breed by sending out people to colonize new land .  they themselves just lie there .  they   re alive  but only in the same way that a jellyfish is alive .  or a fairly bright vegetable .  after all  we call ankh morpork the big wahooni     and where you get big slow living things  you get small fast things that eat them     windle poons felt the brain cells firing .  connections were made .  thought gushed along new channels .  had he ever really thought properly when he was alive .  he doubted it .  he   d just been a lot of complicated reactions attached to a lot of nerve endings  with everything from idle rumination about the next meal to random  distracting memories getting between him and real thought .   it   d grow inside the city  where it   s warm and protected .  and then it   d break out  outside the city  and build   something  not a real city  a false city   that pulls the people  the life  out of the host     the word we   re looking for here is predator .      the dean stared at his staff in disbelief .  he gave it a shake  and aimed it again .   this time the sound would be spelled pfwt .   he looked up .  a curling wave of trolleys  rooftop high  was poised to fall on him .      oh   shucks     he said  and folded his arms over his head .   someone grabbed the back of his robe and pulled him away as the trolleys crashed down .      come on     said ridcully .     if we run we can keep ahead of    em .         i   m out of magic .  i   m out of magic .     moaned the dean .      you   ll be out of a lot more if you don   t hurry     said the archchancellor .   trying to keep together  bumping into one another  the wizards staggered ahead of the trolleys .  streams of them were surging out of the city and across the fields .      know what this reminds me of .     said ridcully  as they fought their way through .      do tell     muttered the senior wrangler .      salmon run     said the archchancellor .      what .         not in the ankh  of course     said ridcully .     i don   t reckon a salmon could get upstream in our river           unless it walked     said the senior wrangler .         but i   ve seen    em thick as milk in some rivers     said ridcully .     fightin    to get ahead .  the whole river just a mass of silver .         fine  fine     said the senior wrangler .     what   d they do that for .         well   it   s all to do with breeding .         disgusting .  and to think we have to drink water     said the senior wrangler .      right  we   re in the open now  this is where we outflank    em     said ridcully .     we   ll just aim for a clear space and           i don   t think so     said the lecturer in recent runes .   every direction was filled with an advancing  grinding  fighting wall of trolleys .      they   re coming to get us .  they   re coming to get us .     wailed the bursar .  the dean snatched his staff .      hey  that   s mine .      the dean pushed him away and blew off the wheels of a leading trolley .      that   s my staff .      the wizards stood back to back in a narrowing ring of metal .      they   re not right for this city     said the lecturer in recent runes .      i know what you mean     said ridcully .     alien .         i suppose no one   s got a flying spell on them today .     the senior wrangler inquired .   the dean took aim again and melted a basket .      that   s my staff you   re using  you know .         shut up  bursar     said the archchancellor .     and  dean  you   re getting nowhere picking them off one by one like that .  okay  lads .  we want to do them all as much damage as possible .  remember   wild  uncontrolled bursts        the trolleys advanced .      ow .  ow .   miss flitworth staggered through the wet  rattling gloom .  hailstones crunched underfoot .  thunder cannonaded around the sky .      they sting  don   t they     she said .   they echo .   bill door fielded a stook as it was blown past  and stacked it with the others .  miss flitworth scuttled past him  bent double under a load of corn .   the two of them worked steadily  criss crossing the field in the teeth of the storm to snatch up the harvest before the wind and hail stole it away .  lightning flickered around the sky .  it wasn   t a normal storm .  it was war .      it   s going to pour with rain in a minute     screamed miss flitworth  above the noise .     we   ll never get it down to the barn .  go and fetch a tarpaulin or something .  that   ll do for tonight .      bill door nodded  and ran through the squelching darkness toward the farm buildings .  lightning was striking so many times around the fields that the air itself was sizzling  and corona danced along the top of the hedge .   and there was death .   he saw it looming ahead of him  a crouched skeletal shape poised to spring  its robe flapping and rattling behind it in the wind .   tightness gripped him  trying to force him to run while at the same time rooting him to the spot .  it invaded his mind and froze there  blocking all thought save for the innermost  tiny voice which said  quite calmly  so this is terror .   then death vanished as the lightning glow faded  reappeared as a fresh arc was struck on the next hill .   then the quiet  internal voice added  but why doesn   t it move .   bill door let himself inch forward slightly .  there was no response from the hunched thing .   then it dawned on him that the thing on the other side of the hedge was only a robed assemblage of ribs and femurs and vertebrae if viewed from one point of view but  if looked at slightly differently  was equally just a complexity of sparging arms and reciprocating levers that had been covered by a tarpaulin which was now blowing off .   the combination harvester was in front of him .   bill door grinned horribly .  un bill door thoughts rose up in his mind .  he stepped forward .      the wall of trolleys surrounded the wizards .   the last flare from a staff melted a hole  which was instantly filled up by more trolleys .   ridcully turned to his fellow wizards .  they were red in the face  their robes were torn  and several over enthusiastic shots had resulted in singed beards and burnt hats .      hasn   t anyone got any more spells on them .     he said .   they thought feverishly .      i think i can remember one     said the bursar hesitantly .      go on  man .  anything   s worth trying at a time like this .      the bursar stretched out a hand .  he shut his eyes .  he muttered a few syllables under his breath .   there was a brief flicker of octarine light and        oh     said the archchancellor .     and that   s all of it .            eringyas    surprising bouquet        said the bursar  bright eyed and twitching .     i don   t know why  but it   s one i   ve always been able to do .  just a knack  i suppose .      ridcully eyed the huge bunch of flowers now gripped in the bursar   s fist .      but not  i venture to point out  entirely useful at this time     he added .   the bursar looked at the approaching walls and his smile faded .      i suppose not     he said .      anyone else got any ideas .     said ridcully .   there was no reply .      nice roses  though     said the dean .         that was quick     said miss flitworth  when bill door arrived at the pile of stooks dragging a tarpaulin behind him .   yes  wasn   t it  he mumbled non committally  as she helped him drag it over the stack and weigh it down with stones .  the wind caught at it and tried to drag it out of his hands  it might as well have tried to blow a mountain over .   rain swept over the fields  among shreds of mist that shimmered with blue electric energies .      never known a night like it     miss flitworth said .   there was another crack of thunder .  sheet lightning fluttered around the horizon .   miss flitworth clutched bill door   s arm .      isn   t that   a figure on the hill .     she said .     thought i saw a   shape .      no  it   s merely a mechanical contrivance .   there was another flash .      on a horse .     said miss flitworth .   a third sheet seared across the sky .  and this time there was no doubt about it .  there was a mounted figure on the nearest hilltop .  hooded .  holding a scythe as proudly as a lance .   posing .  bill door turned toward miss flitworth .  posing .  i never did anything like that .  why do anything like that .  what purpose does it serve .   he opened his palm .  the gold timer appeared .      how much longer have you got .      perhaps an hour .  perhaps minutes .      come on  then .      bill door remained where he was  looking at the timer .      i said  come on .      it won   t work .  i was wrong to think that it would .  but it won   t .  there are some things that you cannot escape .  you cannot live forever .     why not .      bill door looked shocked .  what do you mean .      why can   t you live forever .      i don   t know .  cosmic wisdom .      what does cosmic wisdom know about it .  now  will you come on .      the figure on the hill hadn   t moved .   the rain had turned the dust into a fine mud .  they slithered down the slope and hurried across the yard and into the house .   i should have prepared more .  i had plans        but there was the harvest .      yes .      is there any way we can barricade the doors or something .      do you know what you   re saying .      well  think of something .  didn   t anything ever work against you .      no  said bill door  with a tiny touch of pride .   miss flitworth peered out of the window  and then flung herself dramatically against the wall on one side of it .      he   s gone .      it  said bill door .  it won   t be a he yet .      it   s gone .  it could be anywhere .      it can come through the wall .   she darted forward  and then glared at him .   very well .  fetch the child .  i think we should leave here .  a thought struck him .  he brightened up a little bit .  we do have some time .  what is the hour .      i don   t know .  you go around stopping the clocks the whole time .      but it is not yet midnight .      i shouldn   t think it   s more than a quarter past eleven .      then we have three quarters of an hour .      how can you be sure .      because of drama  miss flitworth .  the kind of death who poses against the skyline and gets lit up by lightning flashes  said bill door  disapprovingly  doesn   t turn up at five and twenty past eleven if he can possibly turn up at midnight .   she nodded  white faced  and disappeared upstairs .  after a minute or two she returned  with sal wrapped up in a blanket .      still fast asleep     she said .   that   s not sleep .   the rain had stopped  but the storm still marched around the hills .  the air sizzled  still seemed oven hot .   bill door led the way past the henhouse  where cyril and his elderly harem were crouched back in the darkness  all trying to occupy the same few inches of perch .   there was a pale green glow hovering around the farmhouse chimney .      we call that mother carey   s fire     said miss flitworth .     it   s an omen .      an omen of what .      what .  oh  don   t ask me .  just an omen  i suppose .  just basic omenery .  where are we going .      into the town .      to be near the scythe .      yes .   he disappeared into the barn .  after a while he came out leading binky  saddled and harnessed .  he mounted up  then leaned down and pulled both her and the sleeping child onto the horse in front of him .   if i   m wrong  he added  this horse will take you wherever you want to go .      i shan   t want to go anywhere except back home .      wherever .   binky broke into a trot as they turned onto the road to the town .  wind blew the leaves off the trees  which tumbled past them and on up the road .  the occasional flash of lightning still hissed across the sky .   miss flitworth looked at the hill beyond the farm .      bill        i know .         it   s there again        i know .     why isn   t it chasing us .      we   re safe until the sand runs out .     and you die when the sand runs out .     no .  when the sand runs out is when i should die .  i will be in the space between life and afterlife .      bill  it looked as though the thing it was riding   i thought it was a proper horse  just very skinny  but        it   s a skeletal steed .  impressive but impractical .  i had one once but the head fell off .     a bit like flogging a dead horse  i should think .      ha .  ha .  most amusing  miss flitworth .      i think that at a time like this you can stop calling me miss flitworth     said miss flitworth .   renata .   she looked startled .     how did you know my name .  oh .  you   ve probably seen it written down  right .      engraved .      on one of them hourglasses .      yes .      with all them sands of time pouring through .      yes .      everyone   s got one .      yes .      so you know how long i   ve        yes .      it must be very odd  knowing   the kind of things you know        do not ask me .      that   s not fair  you know .  if we knew when we were going to die  people would lead better lives .      if people knew when they were going to die  i think they probably wouldn   t live at all .      oh  very gnomic .  and what do you know about it  bill door .      everything .   binky trotted up one of the town   s meager handful of streets and over the cobbles of the square .  there was no one else around .  in cities like ankh morpork midnight was just late evening  because there was no civic night at all  just evenings fading into dawns .  but here people regulated their lives by things like sunsets and mispronounced cock crows .  midnight meant what it said .   even with the storm stalking the hills  the square itself was hushed .  the ticking of the clock in its tower  unnoticable at midday  now seemed to echo off the buildings .   as they approached  something whirred deep in its cogwheeled innards .  the minute hand moved with a clonk  and shuddered to a halt on the   .  a trapdoor opened in the clock face and two little mechanical figures whirred out self importantly and tapped a small bell with great apparent effort .   ting ting ting .   the figures lined up and wobbled back into the clock .      they   ve been there ever since i was a girl .  mr .  simnel   s great great grandad made them     said miss flitworth     i always wondered what they did between chimes  you know .  i thought they had a little house in there  or something .      i don   t think so .  they   re just a thing .  they   re not alive .      hmm .  well  they   ve been there for hundreds of years .  maybe life is something you sort of acquire .      yes .   they waited in silence  except for the occasional thud as the minute hand climbed the night .      it   s   been quite nice having you around the place  bill door .      he didn   t reply .      helping me with the harvest and everything .      it was   interesting .      it was wrong of me to delay you  just for a lot of corn .      no .  the harvest is important .   bill door unfolded his palm .  the timer appeared .      i still can   t work out how you do that .      it is not difficult .   the hiss of the sand grew until it filled the square .      have you got any last words .      yes .  i don   t want to go .      well .  succinct  anyway .      bill door was amazed to find she was trying to hold his hand .   above him  the hands of midnight came together .  there was a whirring from the clock .  the door opened .  the automata marched out .  they clicked to a halt on either side of the hour bell  bowed to one another  and raised their hammers .   dong .   and then there was the sound of a horse trotting .   miss flitworth found the edge of her vision filling with purple and blue blotches  like the flashes of after image with no image to come after .   if she jerked her head quickly and peered out of the tail of her eye  she could see small gray clad shapes hovering around the walls .   the revenooers  she thought .  they   ve come to make sure it all happens .      bill .     she said .   he closed his palm over the gold timer .   now it starts .   the hoofbeats grew louder  and echoed off the buildings behind them .   remember  you are in no danger .   bill door stepped back into the gloom .   then he reappeared momentarily .   probably  he added  and retreated into the darkness .   miss flitworth sat down on the steps of the clock  cradling the body of the girl across her knees .      bill .     she ventured .   a mounted figure rode into the square .   it was  indeed  on a skeletal horse .  blue flame crackled over the creature   s bones as it trotted forward  miss flitworth found herself wondering whether it was a real skeleton  animated in some way  something that had once been the inside of a horse  or a skeletal creature in its own right .  it was a ridiculous chain of thought to follow  but it was better than dwelling on the ghastly reality that was approaching .   did it get rubbed down  or just given a good polish .   its rider dismounted .  it was much taller than bill door had been  but the darkness of its robe hid any details .  it held something that wasn   t exactly a scythe but which might have had a scythe in its ancestry  in the same way that even the most cunningly fashioned surgical implement has a stick somewhere in its past .  it was a long way from any implement that ever touched a straw .   the figure stalked toward miss flitworth  scythe over its shoulder  and stopped .   where is he .      don   t know who you   re talking about     said miss flitworth .     and if i was you  young man  i   d feed my horse .      the figure appeared to have trouble digesting this information  but finally it seemed to reach a conclusion .  it unshipped the scythe and looked down at the child .   i will find him  it said .  but first     it stiffened .   a voice behind it said   drop the scythe  and turn around slowly .      something within the city  windle thought .  cities grow up full of people  but they   re also full of commerce and shops and religions and     this is stupid  he told himself .  they   re just things .  they   re not alive .   maybe life is something you acquire .   parasites and predators  but not like the sort affecting animals and vegetables .  they were some kind of big  slower  metaphorical lifeform  living off cities .  but they incubate in the cities  like those  what are they .  those icky newman wasp things .  he could remember now  just as he could remember everything  reading as a student about creatures that laid their eggs inside other creatures .  for months after he   d refused omelettes and caviar  just in case .   and the eggs would   look like the city  in a way  so that citizens would carry them home .  like cuckoo eggs .   i wonder how many cities died in the past .  ringed by parasites  like a coral reef surrounded by starfish .  they   d just become empty  they   d lose whatever spirit they had .   he stood up .      where   s everyone gone  librarian .         oook oook .         just like them .  i   d have done that .  rush off without thinking .  may the gods bless them and help them  if they can find the time from their eternal family squabbles .      and then he thought  well  what now .  i   ve thought  and what am i going to do .   rush off  of course .  but slowly .      the center of the heap of trolleys was no longer visible .  something was going on .  a pale blue glow hung over the huge pyramid of twisted metal  and there were occasional flashes of lightning deep within the pile .  trolleys slammed into it like asteroids accreting around the core of a new planet  but a few arrivals did something else .  they headed for tunnels that had opened within the structure  and disappeared into the glittering core .   then there was a movement at the tip of the mountain and something thrust its way up through the broken metal .  it was a glistening spike  supporting a globe about two meters across .  it did nothing very much for a minute or two and then  as the breeze dried it out  it split and crumbled .   white objects cascaded out  were caught by the wind  and fountained over ankh morpork and the watching crowds .   one of them zig zagged gently down across the rooftops and landed at the feet of windle poons as he lurched outside the library .   it was still damp  and there was writing on it .  at least  an attempt at writing .  it looked like the strange organic inscription of the snowflake balls   words created by something that was not at all at home with words       windle reached the university gateway .  people were streaming past .   windle knew his fellow citizens .  they   d go to look at anything .  they were suckers for anything written down with more than one exclamation mark after it .   he felt someone looking at him  and turned .  a trolley was watching from an alleyway  it backed up and whizzed away .      what   s happening  mr .  poons .     said ludmilla .   there was something unreal about the expression of the passers by .  they wore an expression of unbudgeable anticipation .   you didn   t have to be a wizard to know that something was wrong .  and windle   s senses were whining like a dynamo .   lupine leapt at a drifting sheet of paper and brought it to him .       windle shook his head sadly .  five exclamation marks  the sure sign of an insane mind .   and then he heard the music .   lupine sat back on his haunches and howled .      in the cellar under mrs .  cake   s house  schleppel the bogeyman paused halfway through his third rat and listened .   then he finished his meal and reached for his door .      count arthur winkings notfaroutoe was working on the crypt .   personally  he could have lived  or re lived  or unlived  or whatever it was he was supposed to be doing  without a crypt .  but you had to have a crypt .  doreen had been very definite about the crypt .  it gave the place ton  she said .  you had to have a crypt and a vault  otherwise the rest of vampire society would look down their teeth at you .   they never told you about that sort of thing when you started vampiring .  they never told you to build your own crypt out of some cheap two by four from chalky the troll   s wholesale building supplies .  it wasn   t something that happened to most vampires  arthur reflected .  not your proper vampires .  your actual count jugular  for example .  no  a toff like him   d have someone for it .  when the villagers came to burn the place down  you wouldn   t catch the count his own self whipping down to the gate to drop the drawbridge .  oh  no .  he   d just say     igor      as it might be      igor  just svort it out  chop chop .      huh .  well  they   d had an advert in mr .  keeble   s job shop for months now .  bed  three meals a day  and hump provided if necessary .  not so much as an enquiry .  and people said there was all this unemployment around .  it made you livid .   he picked up another piece of wood and measured it  grimacing as he unfolded the ruler .   arthur   s back ached from digging the moat .  and that was another thing your posh vampire didn   t have to worry about .  the moat came with the job  style of thing .  and it went all the way round  because other vampires didn   t have the street out in front of them and old mrs .  pivey complaining on one side and a family of trolls doreen wasn   t speaking to on the other and therefore they didn   t end up with a moat that just went across the back yard .  arthur kept falling in it .   and then there was the biting the necks of young women .  or rather  there wasn   t .  arthur was always prepared to see the other person   s point of view  but he felt certain that young women came into the vampiring somewhere  whatever doreen said .  in diaphanous pegnoyers .  arthur wasn   t quite certain what a diaphanous pegnoyer was  but he   d read about them and he definitely felt that he   d like to see one before he died   or whatever     and other vampires didn   t suddenly find their wives talking with vs instead of ws .  the reason being  your natural vampire talked like that anyway .   arthur sighed .   it was no life  or half life or after life or whatever it was  being a lower middle class wholesale fruit and vegetable merchant with an upper class condition .   and then the music filtered in through the hole in the wall that he   d knocked out to put in the barred window .      ow     he said  and clutched at his jaw .     doreen .         reg shoe thumped his portable podium .         and  let me say  we shall not lie back and let the grass grow over our heads     he bellowed .     so what is your seven point plan for equal opportunities with the living  i hear you cry .      the wind blew the dried grasses in the cemetery .  the only creature apparently paying any attention to reg was a solitary raven .   reg shoe shrugged and lowered his voice .     you might at least make some effort     he said  to the next world at large .     here   s me wearing my fingers to the bone      he flexed his hands to demonstrate      and do i hear a word of thanks .      he paused  just in case .   the raven  which was one of the extra large  fat ones that infested the rooftops of the university  put its head on one side and gave reg shoe a thoughtful look .      you know     said reg     sometimes i just feel like giving up        the raven cleared its throat .   reg shoe spun around .      you say one word     he said     just one bloody word        and then he heard the music .       ludmilla risked removing her hands from her ears .      it   s horrible .  what is it  mr .  poons .      windle tried to pull the remains of his hat over his ears .      don   t know     he said .     it could be music .  if you   d never heard music before .      there weren   t notes .  there were strung together noises that might have been intended to be notes  put together as one might draw a map of a country that one had never seen .   hnyip .  ynyip .  hwyomp .      it   s coming from outside the city     said ludmilla .     where all the people   are   going   they can   t like it  can they .         i can   t imagine why they should     said windle .      it   s just that   you remember the trouble with the rats last year .  that man who said he had a pipe that played music only rats could hear .         yes  but that wasn   t really true  it was all a fraud  it was just the amazing maurice and his educated rodents           but supposing it could have been true .      windle shook his head .      music to attract humans .  is that what you   re getting at .  but that can   t be true .  it   s not attracting us .  quite the reverse  i assure you .         yes  but you   re not human   exactly     said ludmilla .     and       she stopped  and went red in the face .   windle patted her on the shoulder .      good point .  good point     was all he could think of to say .      you know  don   t you     she said  without looking up .      yes .  i don   t think it   s anything to be ashamed of  if that   s any help .         mother said it would be dreadful if anyone ever found out .         that probably depends on who it is     said windle  glancing at lupine .      why is your dog staring at me like that .     said ludmilla .      he   s very intelligent     said windle .   windle felt in his pocket  tipped out a couple of handfuls of soil  and unearthed his diary .  twenty days to next full moon .  still  it   d be something to look forward to .      the metal debris of the heap started to collapse .  trolleys whirred around it  and a large crowd of ankh morpork   s citizens were standing in a big circle  trying to peer inside .  the unmusical music filled the air .      there   s mr .  dibbler     said ludmilla  as they pushed their way through the unresisting people .      what   s he selling this time .         i don   t think he   s trying to sell anything  mr .  poons .         it   s that bad .  then we   re probably in lots of trouble .      blue light shone out from one of the holes in the heap .  bits of broken trolley tinkled to the ground like metal leaves .   windle bent down stiffly and picked up a pointy hat .  it was battered and had been run over by a lot of trolleys  but it was still recognizable as something that by rights should be on someone   s head .      there   s wizards in there     he said .   silver light glittered off the metal .  it moved like oil .  windle reached out and a fat spark jumped across and grounded itself on his fingers .      hmm     he said .     lot of potential  too        then he heard the cry of the vampires .      coo ee  mr .  poons .      he turned .  the notfaroutoes were bearing down on him .      we   i mean  ve vould have been here sooner  only              i couldn   t find the blasted collar stud     muttered arthur  looking hot and flustered .  he was wearing a collapsible opera hat  which was fine on the collapsible part but regrettably lacking in hatness  so that arthur appeared to be looking at the world from under a concertina .      oh  hallo     said windle .  there was something dreadfully fascinating about the winkings    dedication to accurate vampirism .      unt who iss the yunk laty .     said doreen  beaming at ludmilla .      pardon .     said windle .      vot .         doreen   i mean  the countess asked who she is     arthur supplied  wearily .      i understood what i said     snapped doreen  in the more normal tones of one born and brought up in ankh morpork rather than some transylvanian fastness .     honestly  if i left it to you  we   d have no standards at all           my name   s ludmilla     said ludmilla .      charmed     said the countess notfaroutoe graciously  extending a hand that would have been thin and pale if it had not been pink and stubby .     alvays nice to meet fresh blood .  if you ever fancy a dog biscuit when you   re out and about  our door iss alwace open .      ludmilla turned to windle poons .      it   s not written on my forehead  is it .     she said .      these are a special kind of people     said windle gently .      i should think so     said ludmilla  levelly .     i hardly know anyone who wears an opera cloak the whole time .         you   ve got to have the cloak     said count arthur .     for the wings  you see .  like        he spread the cloak dramatically .  there was a brief  implosive noise  and a small fat bat hung in the air .  it looked down  gave an angry squeak  and nose dived onto the soil .  doreen picked it up by its feet and dusted it off .      it   s having to sleep with the window open all night that i object to     she said vaguely .     i wish they   d stop that music .  i   m getting a headache .      there was another whoomph .  arthur reappeared upside down and landed on his head .      it   s the drop  you see     said doreen .     it   s like a run up  sort of thing .  if he doesn   t get at least a one story start he can   t get up a proper airspeed .         i can   t get a proper airspeed     said arthur  struggling to his feet .      excuse me     said windle     the music doesn   t affect you .         it puts my teeth on edge is what it does     said arthur .     which is not a good thing for a vampire  i prob   ly don   t have to tell you .         mr .  poons thinks it does something to people     said ludmilla .      sets everyone   s teeth on edge .     said arthur .   windle looked at the crowd .  no one was taking any notice of the fresh starters .      they look as though they   re waiting for something     said doreen .     vaiting  i mean .         it   s scary     said ludmilla .      nothing wrong with scary     said doreen .     we   re scary .         mr .  poons wants to go inside the heap     said ludmilla .      good idea .  get them to turn that damn music off     said arthur .      but you could get killed .     said ludmilla .   windle clapped his hands together  and rubbed them thoughtfully .      ah     he said     that   s where we   re ahead of the game .      he walked into the glow .   he   d never seen such bright light .  it seemed to emanate from everywhere  hunting down every last shadow and eradicating it ruthlessly .  it was much brighter than daylight without being anything like it   there was a blue edge to it that cut vision like a knife .      you all right  count .     he said .      fine  fine     said arthur .   lupine growled .   ludmilla pulled at a tangle of metal .      there   s something under this  you know .  it looks like   marble .  orange colored marble .     she ran her hand over it .     but warm .  marble shouldn   t be warm  should it .         it can   t be marble .  there can   t be this much marble in the whole world   vorld     said doreen .     we tried to get marble for the vault     she tasted the sound of the word and nodded to herself     the vault  yes .  those dwarfs should be shot  the prices they charge .  it   s a disgrace .         i don   t think dwarfs built this     said windle .  he knelt down awkwardly to examine the floor .      i shouldn   t think so  the lazy little buggers .  they wanted nearly seventy dollars to do our vault .  didn   t they  arthur .         nearly seventy dollars     said arthur .      i don   t think anyone built it     said windle quietly .  cracks .  there should be cracks  he thought .  edges and things  where one slab joins another .  it shouldn   t be all one piece .  and slightly sticky .      so  arthur did it himself .         i did it myself .      ah .  here was an edge .  well  not exactly an edge .  the marble became clear  like a window  looking into another brightly lit space .  there were things in there  indistinct and melted looking  but no way in to them .   the chatter of the winkings flowed over him as he crept forward .         more of a vaultette  really .  but he got a dungeon in  even if you have to go out into the hall to shut the door properly        gentility meant all sorts of things  windle thought .  to some people it was not being a vampire .  to others it was a matched set of flying plaster bats on the wall .   he ran his fingers over the clear substance .  the world here was all rectangles .  there were corners  and the corridor was lined on both sides with the clear panels .  and the non music played all the time .   it couldn   t be alive  could it .  life was   more rounded .      what do you think  lupine .     he said .   lupine barked .      hmm .  not a lot of help .      ludmilla knelt down and put her hand on windle   s shoulder .      what did you mean  no one built it .     she said .   windle scratched his head .      i   m not sure   but i think maybe it was   secreted .         secreted .  from what .  by what .      they looked up .  a trolley whirred out of the mouth of a side corridor and skidded away down another on the opposite side of the passage .      them .     said ludmilla .      i shouldn   t think so .  i think they   re more like servants .  like ants .  bees in a hive  maybe .         what   s the honey .         not sure .  but it   s not ripe yet .  i don   t think things are quite finished .  no one touch anything .      they walked onward .  the passage opened up into a wide  bright  domed area .  stairways led up and down to different floors  and there was a fountain and a grove of potted plants that looked too healthy to be real .      isn   t it nice .     said doreen .      you keep thinking there should be people     said ludmilla .     lots of people .         there should at least be wizards     muttered windle poons .     half a dozen wizards don   t just disappear .      the five of them moved closer .  passages the size of the one they   d just walked down could have accommodated a couple of elephants walking abreast .      do you think it might be a good idea to go back outside .     said doreen .      what good would that do .     said windle .      well  it   d get us out of here .      windle turned  counting .  five of the passages radiated equidistantly out of the domed area .      and presumably it   s the same above and below     he said aloud .      it   s very clean here     doreen said nervously .     isn   t it clean  arthur .         it   s very clean .         what   s that noise .     said ludmilla .      what noise .         that noise .  like something sucking something .      arthur looked around with a certain amount of interest .      it   s not me .         it   s the stairs     said windle .      don   t be silly  mr .  poons .  stairs don   t suck .      windle looked down .      these do .      they were black  like a sloping river .  as the dark substance flowed out from under the floor it humped itself into something resembling steps  which traveled up the slope until they disappeared under the floor again  somewhere above .  when the steps emerged they made a slow  rhythmic shlupshlup noise  like someone investigating a particularly annoying dental cavity .      do you know     said ludmilla     that   s quite possibly the most unpleasant thing i   ve ever seen .         i   ve seen worse     said windle .     but it   s pretty bad .  shall we go up or down .         you want to stand on them .         no .  but the wizards aren   t on this floor and it   s that or slide down the handrail .  have you looked closely at the handrail .      they looked at the handrail .      i think     said doreen nervously     that down is more us .      they went down in silence .  arthur fell over at the point where the traveling stairs were sucked into the floor again .      i had this horrible feeling it was going to drag me under     he said apologetically  and then looked around him .      it   s big     he concluded .     roomy .  i could do wonders down here with some stone effect wallpaper .      ludmilla wandered over to the nearest wall .      you know     she said     there   s more glass than i   ve seen before  but these clear bits look like shops .  does that make sense .  a great big shop full of shops .         and not ripe yet     said windle .      sorry .         just thinking aloud .  can you see what the merchandise is .      ludmilla shaded her eyes .      it just looks like a lot of color and glitter .         let me know if you see a wizard .      someone screamed .      or hear one  for example     windle added .   lupine bounded off down a passageway .  windle lurched swiftly after him .   someone was on their back  trying desperately to fight off a couple of the trolleys .  they were bigger than the ones windle had seen before  with a golden sheen to them .      hey .     he yelled .   they stopped trying to gore the prone figure and three point turned toward him .      oh     he said  as they got up speed .   the first one dodged lupine   s jaws and butted windle full in the knees  knocking him over .  as the second passed over him he reached up wildly  grabbed randomly at the metal  and pulled hard .  a wheel spun off and the trolley cartwheeled into the wall .   he scrambled up in time to see arthur hanging grimly onto the handle of the other trolley as the two of them whirred around in a mad centrifugal waltz .      let go .  let go .     doreen screamed .      i can   t .  i can   t .         well  do something .      there was a pop of inrushing air .  the trolley was suddenly not straining against the weight of a middle aged wholesale fruit and vegetable entrepreneur but only against a small terrified bat .  it rocketed into a marble pillar  bounced off  hit a wall and landed on its back  wheels spinning .      the wheels .     shouted ludmilla .     pull the wheels off .         i   ll do that     said windle .     you help reg .         is that reg down there .     said doreen .   windle jerked his thumb toward the distant wall .  the words    better late than nev    ended in a desperate streak of paint .      show him a wall and a paint pot and he doesn   t know what world he   s in     said doreen .      he   s only got a choice of two     said windle  throwing the trolley wheels across the floor .     lupine  keep a look out in case there   s anymore .      the wheels had been sharp  like ice skates .  he was definitely feeling tattered around the legs .  now  how did healing go .   reg shoe was helped into a sitting position .      what   s happening .     he said .     no one else was coming in  and i came down here to see where the music was coming from  and the next thing  there   s these wheels        count arthur returned to his approximately human form  looked around proudly  realized that no one was paying him any attention  and sagged .      they looked a lot tougher than the others     said ludmilla .     bigger and nastier and covered in sharp edges .         soldiers     said windle .     we   ve seen the workers .  and now there   s soldiers .  just like ants .         i had an ant farm when i was a lad     said arthur  who had hit the floor rather heavily and was having temporary trouble with the nature of reality .      hang on     said ludmilla .     i know about ants .  we have ants in the backyard .  if you have workers and soldiers  then you must also have a           i know .  i know     said windle .         mind you  they called it a farm  i never saw them doing any farming        ludmilla leaned against the wall .      it   ll be somewhere close     she said .      i think so     said windle .      what does it look like  do you think .            what you do is  you get two bits of glass and some ants           i don   t know .  how should i know .  but the wizards will be somewhere near it .         i don   t see vy you   re bothering about them     said doreen .     they buried you alive just because you vere dead .      windle looked up at the sound of wheels .  adozen warrior baskets turned the corner and pulled up in formation .      they thought they were doing it for the best     said windle .     people often do .  it   s amazing  the things that seem a good idea at the time .         the new death straightened up .   or .   ah .   er .   bill door stepped back  turned around  and ran for it .   it was  as he was wonderfully well placed to know  merely putting off the inevitable .  but wasn   t that what living was all about .   no one had ever run away from him after they were dead .  many had tried it before they were dead  often with great ingenuity .  but the normal reaction of a spirit  suddenly pitched from one world into the next  was to hang around hopefully .  why run  after all .  it wasn   t as if you knew where you were running to .   the ghost of bill door knew where he was running to .   ned simnel   s smithy was locked up for the night  although this did not present a problem .  not alive and not dead  the spirit of bill door lived through the wall .   the fire was a barely visible glow  settling in the forge .  the smithy was full of warm darkness .   what it didn   t contain was the ghost of a scythe .   bill door looked around desperately .   squeak .   there was a small  dark robed figure sitting on a beam above him .  it gestured frantically toward the corner .   he saw a dark handle sticking out from the load of timber .  he tried to pull at it with fingers now as substantial as a shadow .   he said he would destroy it for me .   the death of rats shrugged sympathetically .   the new death stepped through the wall  scythe held in both hands .   it advanced on bill door .   there was a rustling .  the gray robes were pouring into the smithy .   bill door grinned in terror .   the new death stopped  posing dramatically in the glow from the forge .   it swung .   it almost lost its balance .   you   re not supposed to duck .   bill door dived through the wall again and pounded across the square  skull down  spectral feet making no noise on the cobbles .  he reached the little group by the clock .   on the horse .  go .      what   s happening .  what   s happening .      it hasn   t worked .   miss flitworth gave him a panicky look but put the unconscious child on binky   s back and climbed up after her .  then bill door brought his hand down hard on the horse   s flank .  there at least there was contact   binky existed in all worlds .   go .   he didn   t look around but darted on up the road toward the farm .   a weapon .   something he could hold .   the only weapon in the undead world was in the hands of the new death .   as bill door ran he was aware of a faint  higher pitched clicking noise .  he looked down .  the death of rats was keeping pace with him .   it gave him an encouraging squeak .   he skidded through the farm gate and flung himself against the wall .   there was the distant rumble of the storm .  apart from that  silence .   he relaxed slightly  and crept cautiously along the wall toward the back of the farmhouse .   he caught a glimpse of something metallic .  leaning against the wall there  where the men from the village had left it when they brought him back  was his scythe  not the one he   d carefully prepared  but the one he   d used for the harvest .  what edge it had had been achieved only by the whetstone and the caress of the stalks  but it was a familiar shape and he made a tentative grab at it .  his hand passed right through .   the further you run  the closer you get .   the new death stepped unhurriedly out of the shadows .   you should know that  it added .   bill door straightened up .   we will enjoy this .   enjoy .   the new death advanced .  bill door backed away .   yes .  the taking of one death is the same as achieving the end of a billion lesser lives .   lesser lives .  this is not a game .   the new death hesitated .  what is a game .   bill door felt the tiny flicker of hope .   i could show you     the end of the scythe handle caught him under the chin and knocked him against the wall  where he slid to the ground .   we detect a trick .  we do not listen .  the reaper does not listen to the harvest .   bill door tried to get up .   the scythe handle struck him again .   we will not make the same mistakes .   bill door looked up .  the new death was holding the golden timer  the top bulb was empty .  around both of them the landscape shifted  reddened  began to take on the unreal appearance of reality seen from the other side     you   re out of time  mr .  bill door .   the new death raised his cowl .   there was no face there .  there was not even a skull .  smoke curled formlessly between the robe and a golden crown .   bill door raised himself on his elbows .   a crown .  his voice shook with rage .  i never wore a crown .   you never wanted to rule .   the death swung the scythe back .   and then it dawned on the old death and the new death that the hissing of passing time had not  in fact  stopped .   the new death hesitated  and took out the golden glass .   it shook it .   bill door looked into the empty face under the crown .  there was an expression of puzzlement there  even with no features actually to wear it  the expression hung in the air all by itself .   he saw the crown turn .   miss flitworth stood with her hands held a foot apart and her eyes closed .  between her hands  in the air in front of her hovered the faint outline of a lifetimer  its sand pouring away in a torrent .   the deaths could just make out  on the glass  the spidery name  renata flitworth .   the new death   s featureless expression became one of terminal puzzlement .  it turned to bill door .   for you .   but bill door was already rising and unfolding like the wrath of kings .  he reached behind him  growling  living on loaned time  and his hands closed around the harvest scythe .   the crowned death saw it coming and raised its own weapon but there was very possibly nothing in the world that would stop the worn blade as it snarled through the air  rage and vengeance giving it an edge beyond any definition of sharpness .  it passed through the metal without slowing .   no crown  said bill door  looking directly into the smoke .  no crown .  only the harvest .   the robe folded up around his blade .  there was a thin wail  rising beyond the peak of hearing .  a black column  like the negative of lightning  flashed up from the ground and disappeared into the clouds .   death waited for a moment  and then gingerly gave the robe a prod with his foot .  the crown  bent slightly out of shape  rolled out of it a little way before evaporating .   oh  he said  dismissively .  drama .   he walked over to miss flitworth and gently pressed her hands together .  the image of the lifetimer disappeared .  the blue and violet fog on the edge of sight faded as solid reality flowed back .   down in the town  the clock finished striking midnight .   the old woman was shivering .  death snapped his fingers in front of her eyes .   miss flitworth .  renata .      i   i didn   t know what to do and you said it wasn   t difficult and        death walked into the barn .  when he came out  he was wearing his black robe .   she was still standing there .      i didn   t know what to do     she repeated  possibly not to him .     what happened .  is it all over .      death looked around .  the gray shapes were pouring into the yard .   possibly not  he said .      more trolleys appeared behind the row of soldiers .  they looked like the small silvery workers with the occasional pale golden gleam of a warrior .      we should retreat back to the stairs     said doreen .      i think that   s where they want us to go     said windle .      then that   s fine by me .  anyway  i vouldn   t think those wheels could manage steps  could they .         and you can   t exactly fight to the death     said ludmilla .  lupine was keeping close to her  yellow eyes fixed on the slowly advancing wheels .      chance would be a fine thing     said windle .  they reached the moving stairs .  he looked up .  trolleys clustered around the top of the upward stair  but the way to the floor below looked clear .      perhaps we could find another way up .     said ludmilla hopefully .   they shuffled onto the moving stair .  behind them  the trolleys moved in to block their return .   the wizards were on the floor below .  they were standing so still among the potted plants and fountains that windle passed them at first  assuming that they were some sort of statue or piece of esoteric furniture .   the archchancellor had a false red nose and was holding some balloons .  beside him  the bursar was juggling colored balls  but like a machine  his eyes staring blankly at nothing .   the senior wrangler was standing a little way off  wearing a pair of sandwich boards .  the writing on them hadn   t fully ripened yet  but windle would have bet his afterlife that it would eventually say something like sale .  .  .  .   the other wizards were clustered together like dolls whose clockwork hadn   t been wound up .  each one had a large oblong badge on his robe .  the familiar organic looking writing was growing into a word that looked like       although why it was doing so was a complete mystery .  the wizards certainly didn   t look very secure .   windle snapped his fingers in front of the dean   s pale eyes .  there was no response .      he   s not dead     said reg .      just resting     said windle .     switched off .      reg gave the dean a push .  the wizard tottered forward  and then staggered to a precarious  swaying halt .      well  we   ll never get them out     said arthur .     not like that .  can   t you wake them up .         light a feather under their nose     doreen volunteered .      i don   t think that will work     said windle .  he based the statement on the fact that reg shoe was very nearly under their noses  and anyone whose nasal equipment failed to register mr .  shoe would certainly not react to a mere burning feather .  or a heavy weight dropped from a great height  if it came to that .      mr .  poons     said ludmilla .      i used to know a golem looked like him     said reg shoe .     just like him .  great big chap  made out of clay .  that   s what your typical golem basically is .  you just have to write a special holy word on    em to start    em up .         what  like    security    .         could be .      windle peered at the dean .     no     he said at last     no one   s got that much clay .     he looked around them .     we ought to find out where that blasted music   s coming from .         where the musicians are hidden  you mean .         i don   t think there are musicians .         you   ve got to have musicians  brother     said reg .     that   s why it   s called music .         firstly  this isn   t like any music .  i   ve ever heard  and secondly i always thought you   ve got to have oil lamps or candles to make light and there aren   t any and there   s still light shining everywhere     said windle .      mr .  poons .     said ludmilla again  prodding him .      yes .         here come some trolleys again .      they were blocking all five passages leading off the central space .      there   s no stairs down     said windle .      maybe it   s   she   s   in one of the glassy bits     said ludmilla .     the shops .         i don   t think so .  they don   t look finished .  anyway  that feels wrong        lupine growled .  spikes glistened on the leading trolleys  but they weren   t rushing to attack .      they must have seen what we did to the others     said arthur .      yes .  but how could they .  that was upstairs     said windle .      well  maybe they talk to each other .         how can they talk .  how can they think .  there can   t be any brains in a lot of wire     said ludmilla .      ants and bees don   t think  if it comes to that     said windle .     they   re just controlled        he looked upward .   they looked upward .      it   s coming from somewhere in the ceiling     he said .     we   ve got to find it right now .         there   s just panels of light     said ludmilla .      something else .  look for something it could be coming from .         it   s coming from everywhere .         whatever you   re thinking of doing     said doreen  picking up a potted plant and holding it like a club     i hope you do it fast .         what   s that around black thing up there .     said arthur .      where .         there .     arthur pointed .      okay  reg and me will help you up  come on           me .  but i can   t stand heights .         i thought you could turn into a bat .         yeah  but a very nervous one .         stop complaining .  right   one foot here  now your hand here  now put your foot on reg   s shoulder           and don   t go through     said reg .      i don   t like this .     arthur moaned  as they hoisted him up .   doreen stopped glaring at the creeping trolleys .      artor .  nobblyesse obligay .         what .  is that some sort of vampire code .     reg whispered .      it means something like  a count   s gotta do what a count   s gotta do     said windle .      count .     snarled arthur  swaying dangerously .     i never should have listened to that lawyer .  i should have known nothing good ever comes in a long brown envelope .  and i can   t reach the bloody thing anyway .         can   t you jump .     said windle .      can   t you drop dead .         no .         and i   m not jumping .         fly  then .  turn into a bat and fly .         i can   t get the airspeed .         you could throw him up     said ludmilla .     you know  like a paper dart .         blow that .  i   m a count .         you just said you didn   t want to be     said windle mildly .      on the ground i don   t want to be  but when it comes to being chucked around like a frisbee           arthur .  do what mr .  poons says .         i don   t see why           arthur .      arthur as a bat was surprisingly heavy .  windle held him by the ears like a misshapen bowling ball and tried to take aim .      remember   i   m an endangered species .     the count squeaked  as windle brought his arm back .   it was an accurate throw .  arthur fluttered to the disc in the ceiling and gripped it in his claws .      can you move it .         no .         then hang on tight and change back .         no .         we   ll catch you .         no .         arthur .     screamed doreen  prodding an advancing trolley with her makeshift club .      oh  all right .      there was a momentary vision of arthur winkings clinging desperately to the ceiling  and then he dropped on windle and reg  the disc clasped to his chest .   the music stopped abruptly .  pink tubing poured out of the ravaged hole above them and coiled upon arthur  making him look like a very cheap plate of spaghetti and meatballs .  the fountains seemed to operate in reverse for a moment  and then dried up .   the trolleys halted .  the ones at the back ran into the ones at the front  and there was a chorus of pathetic clanking noises .   tubing still poured out of the hole .  windle picked up a bit .  it was an unpleasant pink  and sticky .      what do you think it is .     said ludmilla .      i think     said windle     that we   d better get out of here now .      the floor trembled .  steam gushed from the fountain .      if not sooner     windle added .   there was a groan from the archchancellor .  the dean slumped forward .  the other wizards remained upright  but only just .      they   re coming out of it     said ludmilla .     but i don   t think they   ll manage the stairs .         i don   t think anyone should even think about trying to manage the stairs     said windle .     look at them .      the moving stairs weren   t .  the black steps glistened in the shadowless light .      i see what you mean     said ludmilla .     i   d rather try and walk on quicksand .         it   d probably be safer     said windle .      maybe there   s a ramp .  there must be some way for the trolleys to get around .         good idea .      ludmilla eyed the trolleys .  they were milling around aimlessly .     i think i might have an even better one       she said  and grabbed a passing handle .   the trolley fought for a moment and then  lacking any contrary instructions  settled down docilely .      the ones that can walk   ll walk  and the ones that can   t walk   ll get pushed .  come on  grandad .     this was to the bursar  who was persuaded to flop across the trolley .  he said    yo     faintly  and shut his eyes again .   the dean was manhandled on top of him .       and now where .     said doreen .   a couple of floor tiles buckled upward .  a heavy gray vapor started to pour out .      it must be somewhere at the end of a passage     said ludmilla .     come on .      arthur looked down at the mists coiling around his feet .      i wonder how you can do that .     he said .     it   s amazingly difficult to get stuff that does that .  we tried it  you know  to make our crypt more   more cryptic  but it just smokes up the place and sets fire to the curtains           come on  arthur .  we are going .         you don   t think we   ve done too much damage  do you .  perhaps we should leave a note           yeah  i could write something on the wall if you like     said reg .   he picked up a struggling worker trolley by its handle and  with some satisfaction  smashed it against a pillar until its wheels dropped off .   windle watched the fresh start club head up the nearest passage  pushing a bargain assortment of wizardry .      well  well  well     he said .     as simple as that .  that   s all we had to do .  hardly any drama at all .      he went to move forward  and stopped .   pink tubes were forcing their way through the floor and were already coiled tightly around his legs .   more floor tiles leapt into the air .  the stairways shattered  revealing the dark  serrated and above all living tissue that had powered them .  the walls pulsed and caved inward  the marble cracking to reveal purple and pinkness underneath .   of course  thought a tiny calm part of windle   s mind  none of this is really real .  buildings aren   t really alive .  it   s just a metaphor  only at the moment metaphors are like candles in a firework factory .   that being said  what sort of creature is the queen .  like a queen bee  except she   s also the hive .  like a caddis fly  which builds  if i   m not mistaken  a shell out of bits of stone and things  to camouflage itself .  or like a nautilus  which adds onto its shell as it gets bigger .  and very much  to judge by the way the floors are ripping up  like a very angry starfish .   i wonder how cities would defend themselves against this sort of thing .  creatures generally evolve some sort of defense against predators .  poisons and stings and spikes and things .   here and now  that   s probably me .  spiky old windle poons .   at least i can try to see to it that the others get out all right .  let   s make my presence felt     he reached down  grabbed a double handful of pulsating tubes  and heaved .   the queen   s screech of rage was heard all the way to the university .      the storm clouds sped toward the hill .  they piled up in a towering mass  very fast .  lightning flashed  somewhere in the core .   there   s too much life around  said death .  not that i   m one to complain .  where   s the child .      i put her to bed .  she   s sleeping now .  just ordinary sleep .      lightning struck on the hill  like a thunderbolt .  it was followed by a clanking  grinding noise  somewhere in the middle distance .   death sighed .   ah .  more drama .   he walked around the barn  so that he could command a good view of the dark fields .  miss flitworth followed very closely on his heels  using him as a shield against whatever terrors were out there .   a blue glow crackled behind a distant hedge .  it was moving .      what is it .      it was the combination harvester .      was .  what is it now .      death glanced at the clustering watchers .   a poor loser .   the harvester tore across the soaking fields  cloth arms whirring  levers moving inside an electric blue nimbus .  the shafts for the horse waved uselessly in the air .      how can it go without a horse .  it had a horse yesterday .      it doesn   t need one .   he looked around at the gray watchers .  there were ranks of them now .      binky   s still in the yard .  come on .      no .   the combination harvester accelerated toward them .  the schip schip of its blades became a whine .      is it angry because you stole its tarpaulin .      that   s not all i stole .   death grinned at the watchers .  he picked up his scythe  turned it over in his hands and then  when he was sure their gaze was fixed upon it  let it fall to the ground .   then he folded his arms again .   miss flitworth dragged at him .      what do you think you   re doing .      drama .   the harvester reached the gate into the yard and came through in a cloud of sawdust .      are you sure we   ll be all right .      death nodded .      well .  that   s all right then .      the harvester   s wheels were a blur .   probably .   and then        something in the machinery went clonk .   then the harvester was still traveling  but in pieces .  sparks fountained up from its axles .  a few spindles and arms managed to hold together  jerking madly as they spun away from the whirling  slowing confusion .  the circle of blades tore free  smashed up through the machine  and skimmed away across the fields .   there was a jangle  a clatter  and then the last isolated boing  which is the audible equivalent of the famous pair of smoking boots .   and then there was silence .   death reached down calmly and picked up a complicated looking spindle as it pinwheeled toward his feet .  it had been bent into a right angle .   miss flitworth peered around him .      what happened .      i think the elliptical cam has gradually slid up the beam shaft and caught on the flange rebate  with disastrous results .   death stared defiantly at the gray watchers .  one by one  they began to disappear .   he picked up the scythe .   and now i must go  he said .   miss flitworth looked horrified .     what .  just like that .      yes .  exactly like that .  i have a lot of work to do .      and i won   t see you again .  i mean        oh  yes .  soon .  he sought for the right words  and gave up .  that   s a promise .   death pulled up his robe and reached into the pocket of his bill door overall  which he was still wearing underneath .   when mr .  simnel comes to collect the bits in the morning he will probably be looking for this  he said  and dropped something small and bevelled into her hand .      what is it .      a three eighths gripley .   death walked over to his horse  and then remembered something .   and he owes me a farthing  too .      ridcully opened one eye .  people were milling around .  there were lights and excitement .  lots of people were talking at once .   he seemed to be sitting in a very uncomfortable pram  with some strange insects buzzing around him .   he could hear the dean complaining  and there were groans that could only be coming from the bursar  and the voice of a young woman .  people were being ministered to  but no one was paying him any attention .  well  if there was ministering going on  he was damn well going to get ministered to as well .   he coughed loudly .      you could try     he said  to the cruel world in general     forcing some brandy between m   lips .      an apparition appeared above him holding a lamp over its head .  it was a size five face in a size thirteen skin  it said    oook .     in a concerned way .      oh  it   s you     said ridcully .  he tried to sit up quickly  just in case the librarian tried the kiss of life .   confused memories wobbled across his brain .  he could remember a wall of clanking metal  and then pinkness  and then   music .  endless music  designed to turn the living brain to cream cheese .   he turned around .  there was a building behind him  surrounded by crowds of people .  it was squat and clung to the ground in a strangely animal way  as if it might be possible to lift up a wing of the building and hear the pop pop pop of suckers letting go .  light streamed out of it  and steam curled out of its doors .      ridcully   s woken up .      more faces appeared .  ridcully thought  it   s not soul cake night  so they   re not wearing masks .  oh  blast .   behind them he heard the dean say     i vote we work up herpetty   s seismic reorganizer and lob it through the door .  no more problem .         no .  we   re too close to the city walls .  we just need to drop quondum   s attractive point in the right place           or sumpjumper   s incendiary surprise  perhaps .     this was the bursar   s voice .     burn it out  it   s the best way           yeah .  yeah .  and what do you know about military tactics .  you can   t even say    yo    properly .      ridcully gripped the sides of the trolley .      would anyone mind tellin    me     he said     what the   what the heck is goin    on .      ludmilla pushed her way through the members of the fresh start club .      you   ve got to stop them  archchancellor .     she said .     they   re talking about destroying the big shop .      more nasty recollections settled on ridcully   s mind .      good idea     he said .      but mr .  poons is still in there .      ridcully tried to focus on the glowing building .      what  dead windle poons .         arthur flew back when we realized he wasn   t with us and he said windle was fighting something that   d come out of the walls .  we saw lots of trolleys but they weren   t bothered about us .  he let us get out .         what  dead windle poons .         you can   t magic the place to bits with one of your wizards in there .         what  dead windle poons .         yes .         but he   s dead     said ridcully .     isn   t he .  he said he was .         ha .     said someone who had much less skin than ridcully would have liked him to have .     that   s typical .  that   s naked vitalism  that is .  i bet they   d rescue someone in there if they happened to be alive .         but he wanted   he wasn   t keen on   he       ridcully hazarded .  a lot of this was beyond him  but to people like ridcully this didn   t matter for very long .  ridcully was simple minded .  this doesn   t mean stupid .  it just meant that he could only think properly about things if he cut away all the complicated bits around the edges .   he concentrated on the single main fact .  someone who was technically a wizard was in trouble .  he could relate to that .  it struck a chord .  the whole dead or alive business could wait .   there was another minor point that nagged at him  though .         arthur .    flew .            hallo .      ridcully turned his head .  he blinked slowly .      nice teeth you got there     he said .      thank you     said arthur winkings .      all your own  are they .         oh  yes .         amazing .  of course  i expect you brush regularly .         yes .         hygienic .  that   s the important thing .         so what are you going to do .     said ludmilla .      well  we   ll just go and fetch him out     said ridcully .  what was it about the girl .  he felt a strange urge to pat her on the head .     we   ll get some magic and get him out .  yes .  dean .         yo .         we   re just going to go in there to get windle out .         yo .         what .     said the senior wrangler .     you must be out of your mind .      ridcully tried to look as dignified as possible  given his situation .      remember that i am your archchancellor     he snapped .      then you must be out of your mind  archchancellor .     said the senior wrangler .  he lowered his voice .     anyway  he   s an undead .  i don   t see how you can save undeads .  it   s a sort of contradiction in terms .         a dichotomy     said the bursar helpfully .      oh  i don   t think surgery is involved .         anyway  didn   t we bury him .     said the lecturer of recent runes .      and now we dig him up again     said the archchancellor .     it   s probably a miracle of existence .         like pickles     said the bursar  happily .   even the fresh starters went blank .      they do that in parts of howondaland     said the bursar .     they make these big  big jars of special pickles and then they bury them in the ground for months to ferment and they get this lovely piquant           tell me     ludmilla whispered to ridcully     is this how wizards usually behave .         the senior wrangler is an amazingly fine example     said ridcully .     got the same urgent grasp of reality as a cardboard cutout .  proud to have him on the team .     he rubbed his hands together .     okay  lads .  volunteers .         yo .  hut .     said the dean  who was in an entirely different world now .      i would be remiss in my duty if i failed to help a brother     said reg shoe .      oook .         you .  we can   t take you     said the dean  glaring at the librarian .     you don   t know a thing about guerrilla warfare .         oook .     said the librarian  and made a surprisingly comprehensive gesture to indicate that  on the other hand  what he didn   t know about orangutan warfare could be written on the very small pounded up remains of  for example  the dean .      four of us should be enough     said the archchancellor .      i   ve never even heard him say    yo        muttered the dean .   he removed his hat  something a wizard doesn   t ordinarily do unless he   s about to pull something out of it  and handed it to the bursar .  then he tore a thin strip off the bottom of his robe  held it dramatically in both hands  and tied it around his forehead .      it   s part of the ethos     he said  in answer to their penetratingly unspoken question .     that   s what the warriors on the counterweight continent do before they go into battle .  and you have to shout       he tried to remember some far off reading      er  bonsai .  yes .  bonsai .         i thought that meant chopping bits off trees to make them small     said the senior wrangler .   the dean hesitated .  he wasn   t too sure himself  if it came to it .  but a good wizard never let uncertainty stand in his way .      no  it   s definitely got to be bonsai     he said .  he considered it some more and then brightened up .     on account of it all being part of bushido .  like   small trees .  bush i do .  yeah .  makes sense  when you think about it .         but you can   t shout    bonsai .     here     said the lecturer of recent runes .     we   ve got a totally different cultural background .  it   d be useless .  no one will know what you mean .         i   ll work on it     said the dean .   he noticed ludmilla standing with her mouth open .      this is wizard talk     he said .      it is  isn   t it     said ludmilla .     i never would have guessed .      the archchancellor had got out of the trolley and was wheeling it experimentally back and forth .  it usually took quite a long time for a fresh idea to fully lodge in ridcully   s mind  but he felt instinctively that there were all sorts of uses for a wire basket on four wheels .      are we going or are we standin    around all night bandagin    our heads .     he said .      yo .     snapped the dean .      yo .     said reg shoe .      oook .         was that a yo .     said the dean  suspiciously .      oook .         well   all right  then .         death sat on a mountaintop .  it wasn   t particularly high  or bare  or sinister .  no witches held naked sabbats on it  discworld witches  on the whole  didn   t hold with taking off anymore clothes than was absolutely necessary for the business in hand .  no specters haunted it .  no naked little men sat on the summit dispensing wisdom  because the first thing the truly wise man works out is that sitting around on mountaintops gives you not only hemorrhoids but frostbitten hemorrhoids .   occasionally people would climb the mountain and add a stone or two to the cairn at the top  if only to prove that there is nothing really damn stupid that humans won   t do .   death sat on the cairn and ran a stone down the blade of his scythe in long  deliberate strokes .   there was a movement of air .  three gray servants popped into existence .   one said  you think you have won .   one said  you think you have triumphed .   death turned the stone in his hand  to get a fresh surface  and brought it slowly down the length of the blade .   one said  we will inform azrael .   one said  you are only  after all  a little death .   death held the blade up to the moonlight  twisting it this way and that  noting the play of light on the tiny flecks of metal on its edge .   then he stood up  in one quick movement .  the servants backed away hurriedly .   he reached out with the speed of a snake and grasped a robe  pulling its empty hood level with his eye sockets .   do you know why the prisoner in the tower watches the flight of birds .  he said .   it said  take your hands off me   oops     blue flame flared for a moment .   death lowered his hand and looked around at the other two .   one said  you haven   t heard the last of this .   they vanished .   death brushed a speck of ash off his robe  and then planted his feet squarely on the mountaintop .  he raised the scythe over his head in both hands  and summoned up all the lesser deaths that had arisen in his absence .   after a while they streamed up the mountain in a faint black wave .   they flowed together like dark mercury .   it went on for a long time and then stopped .   death lowered the scythe  and examined himself .  yes  all there .  once again  he was the death  containing all the deaths of the world .  except for     for a moment he hesitated .  there was one tiny area of emptiness somewhere  some fragment of his soul  something unaccounted for     he couldn   t be quite certain what it was .   he shrugged .  doubtless he   d find out .  in the meantime  there was a lot of work to be done     he rode away .   far off  in his den under the barn  the death of rats relaxed his determined grip on a beam .      windle poons brought both feet down heavily on a tentacle snaking out from under the tiles  and lurched off through the steam .  a slab of marble smashed down  showering him with fragments .  then he kicked the wall  savagely .   there was very probably no way out now  he realized  and even if there was he couldn   t find it .  anyway  he was already inside the thing .  it was shaking its own walls down in an effort to get at him .  at least he could give it a really bad case of indigestion .   he headed toward an orifice that had once been the entrance to a wide passage  and dived awkwardly through it just before it snapped shut .  silver fire crackled over the walls .  there was so much life here it couldn   t be contained .   there were a few trolleys still here  skittering madly across the shaking floor  as lost as windle .   he set off along another likely looking corridor  although most corridors he   d been down in the last one hundred and thirty years hadn   t pulsated and dripped so much .   another tentacle thrust through the wall and tripped him up .   of course  it couldn   t kill him .  but it could make him bodiless .  like old one man bucket .  a fate worse than death  probably .   he pulled himself up .  the ceiling bounced down on him  flattening him against the floor .   he counted under his breath and scampered forward .  steam washed over him .   he slipped again  and thrust out his hands .   he could feel himself losing control .  there were too many things too operate .  never mind the spleen  just keeping heart and lungs going was taking too much effort        topiary .         what the heck do you mean .         topiary .  get it .  yo .         oook .      windle looked up through foggy eyes .   ah .  obviously he was losing control of his brain  too .   a trolley came sideways out of the steam with shadowy figures clinging onto its sides .  one hairy arm and one arm that was barely an arm anymore reached down  picked him up bodily and dumped him into the basket .  four tiny wheels skidded on the floor  the trolley bounced off the wall  and then it righted itself and rattled away .   windle was only vaguely aware of voices .      off you go  dean .  i know you   ve been looking forward to it .     that was the archchancellor .      yo .         you   ll kill it totally .  i don   t think we want it ending up at the fresh start club .  i don   t think it   s a joiner .     that was reg shoe .      oook .     that was the librarian .      don   t you worry  windle .  the dean is going to do something military  apparently     said ridcully .      yo .  hut .         oh  good grief .      windle saw the dean   s hand float past with something glittering in it .      what are you going to use .     said ridcully  as the trolley rocketed through the steam .     the seismic reorganizer  the attractive point or the incendiary surprise .         yo     said the dean  with satisfaction .      what  all three at once .         yo .         that   s going a bit far  isn   t it .  and incidentally  if you say    yo    one more time  dean  i will personally have you thrown out of the university  pursued to the rim of the world by the finest demons that thaumaturgy can conjure up  torn into extremely small pieces  minced  turned into a mixture reminiscent of steak tartare  and turned out into a dog bowl .         y       the dean caught ridcully   s eyes .     yes .  yes .  oh  go on  archchancellor .  what   s the good of having mastery over cosmic balance and knowing the secrets of fate if you can   t blow something up .  please .  i   ve got them all ready .  you know how it upsets the inventory if you don   t use them after you   ve got them ready        the trolley whirred up a trembling slope and cornered on two wheels .      oh  all right     said ridcully .     if it means that much to you .         y   sorry .      the dean started to mutter urgently under his breath  and then screamed .      i   ve gone blind .         your bonsai bandage has slipped over your eyes  dean .      windle groaned .      how are you feeling  brother poons .     reg shoe   s ravaged features occluded windle   s view .      oh  you know     said windle .     could be better  could be worse .      the trolley ricocheted off a wall and jerked away in another direction .      how are those spells coming along  dean .     said ridcully  through gritted teeth .     i   m having real difficulties controlling this thing .      the dean muttered a few more words  and then waved his hands dramatically .  octarine flame spurted from his fingertips and earthed itself somewhere in the mists .      yee haw .     he crowed .      dean .         yes  archchancellor .         the comment i made recently about the y word           yes .  yes .         you can definitely include yee haw  too .      the dean hung his head .      oh .  yes  archchancellor .         and why hasn   t everythin    gone boom .         i put a slight delay on it  archchancellor .  i thought perhaps we ought to get out before things happened .         good thinking  that man .         soon have you out  windle     said reg shoe .     we don   t leave our people in there .  isn   t this        and then the floor erupted ahead of them .   and then  behind them .   the thing that arose from the shattered tiles was either formless or many forms at once .  it writhed angrily  snapping its tubing at them .   the trolley skewed to a halt .      got anymore magic  dean .         er   no  archchancellor .         and the spells you just said will go off    .         and second now  archchancellor .         so   whatever   s going to happen   is going to happen to us .         yes  archchancellor .      ridcully patted windle on the head .      sorry about this     he said .   windle turned awkwardly to look down the passageway .   there was something behind the queen .  it looked like a perfectly ordinary bedroom door  advancing in a series of small steps  as though someone was carefully pushing it along in front of them .      what is it .     said red .   windle raised himself as far as he could .      schleppel .         oh  come on     said reg .      it   s schleppel .     shouted windle .     schleppel .  it   s us .  can you help us out .      the door paused .  then it was flung aside .   schleppel unfolded himself to his full height .      hallo  mr .  poons .  hallo  reg     he said .   they stared at the hairy shape that nearly filled the passageway .      er  schleppel   er   could you clear the way for us .     windle quavered .      no problem  mr .  poons .  anything for a friend .      a hand the size of a wheelbarrow glided through the steam and tore into the blockage  ripping it out with incredible ease .      hey  look at me .     said schleppel .     you   re right .  a bogeyman needs a door like a fish needs a bicycle .  say it now and say it loud  i   m           and now could you get out of the way  please .         sure .  sure .  wow .     schleppel took another swipe at the queen .   the trolley shot forward .      and you   d better come with us .     windle shouted  as schleppel disappeared in the mists .      no he shouldn   t     said the archchancellor  as they sped along .     believe me .  what was it .         he   s a bogeyman     said windle .      i thought you only get them in closets and things .     shouted ridcully .      he   s come out of the closet     said reg shoe proudly .     and he   s found himself .         just so long as we can lose him .         we can   t just leave him           we can .  we can .     snapped ridcully .   there was a sound behind them like an eruption of swamp gas .  green light streamed past .      the spells are starting to go off .     shouted the dean .     move it .      the trolley whirred out of the entrance and soared up into the cool of the night  wheels screaming .      yo .     bellowed ridcully  as the crowd scattered ahead of them .      does that mean i can say yo too .     said the dean .      all right .  just once .  everyone can say it just once .         yo .         yo .     echoed reg shoe .      oook .         yo .     said windle poons .      yo .     said schleppel .    somewhere in the darkness  where the crowd was thinnest  the gaunt shape of mr .  ixolite  the world   s last surviving banshee  sidled up to the shaking building and bashfully shoved a note under the door .   it said  ooooeeeoooeeeoooeee .    the trolley plowed to a very definitive stop .  no one turned around .  reg said  slowly     you   re behind us  right .         that   s right  mr .  shoe     said schleppel happily .      should we worry when he   s in front of us .     said ridcully .     or is it worse because we know he   s behind us .         hah .  no more closets and cellars for this bogey     said schleppel .      that   s a shame  because we   ve got some really big cellars at the university     said windle poons quickly .   schleppel was silent for a while .  then he said  in an exploratory tone of voice     how big .         huge .         yeah .  with rats .         rats aren   t the half of it .  there   s escaped demons and all sorts down there .  infested  they are .         what are you doing .     hissed ridcully .     that   s our cellars you   re talking about .         you   d prefer him under your bed  would you .     murmured windle .     or walking around behind you .      ridcully nodded briskly .      wow  yes  those rats are getting really out of hand down there     he said loudly .     some of them   oh  about two feet long  wouldn   t you say  dean .         three feet     said the dean .     at least .         fat as butter  too     said windle .   schleppel gave this some thought .     well  all right     he said reluctantly .     maybe i   ll just wander in and have a look at them .      the big store exploded and imploded at the same time  something it is almost impossible to achieve without a huge special effects budget or three spells all working against one another .  there was the impression of a vast cloud expanding but at the same time moving away so rapidly that the overall effect was of a shrinking point .  walls buckled and were sucked in .  soil ripped up from the ravaged fields and spiraled into the vortex .  there was a violent burst of non music  which died almost instantly .   and then nothing  except a muddy field .   and  floating down from the early morning sky like snow  thousands of white flakes .  they slid silently through the air and landed lightly on the crowd .      it   s not seeding  is it .     said reg shoe .   windle grabbed one of the flakes .  it was a crude rectangle  uneven and blotchy .  it was just about possible  with a certain amount of imagination  to make out the words          no     said windle .     probably not .      he lay back and smiled .  it was never too late to have a good life .   and when no one was looking  the last surviving trolley on the discworld rattled off sadly into the oblivion of the night  lost and alone .          pog a grodle fig .      miss flitworth sat in her kitchen .   outside  she could hear the despondent clanking as ned simnel and his apprentice picked up the tangled remains of the combination harvester .  a handful of other people were theoretically helping  but were really taking the opportunity to have a good look around .  she   d made a tray of tea  and left them to it .   now she sat with her chin in her hands  staring at nothing .   there was a knock at the open door .  spigot poked his red face into the room .      please  miss flitworth           hmm .         please  miss flitworth  there   s a skeleton of a horse walking around in the barn .  it   s eating hay .         how .         and it   s all falling through .         really .  we   ll keep it  then .  at least it   ll be cheap to feed .      spigot hung around for a while  twisting his hat in his hands .      you all right  miss flitworth .            you all right  mr .  poons .      windle stared at nothing .      windle .     said reg shoe .      hmm .         the archchancellor just asked if you wanted a drink .         he   d like a glass of distilled water     said mrs .  cake .      what  just water .     said ridcully .      that   s what he wants     said mrs .  cake .      i   d like a glass of distilled water  please     said windle .   mrs .  cake looked smug .  at least  as much of her as was visible looked smug  which was that part between the hat and her handbag  which was a sort of counterpart of the hat and so big that when she sat clasping it on her lap she had to reach up to hold the handles .  when she   d heard that her daughter had been invited to the university she   d come too .  mrs .  cake always assumed that an invitation to ludmilla was an invitation to ludmilla   s mother as well .  mothers like her exist everywhere  and apparently nothing can be done about them .   the fresh starters were being entertained by the wizards  and trying to look as though they were enjoying it .  it was one of those problematical occasions with long silences  sporadic coughs  and people saying isolated things like     well  isn   t this nice .         you looked a bit lost there  windle  for a moment     said ridcully .      i   m just a bit tired  archchancellor .         i thought you zombies never slept .         i   m still tired     said windle .      you   re sure you wouldn   t like us to have another go with the burial and everything .  we could do it properly this time .         thank you all the same  but no .  i   m just not cut out for the undead life  i think .     windle looked at reg shoe .     sorry about that .  i don   t know how you manage it .     he grinned apologetically .      you   ve got every right to be alive or dead  just as you choose     said reg severely .      one man bucket says people are dying properly again     said mrs .  cake .     so you could probably get an appointment .      windle looked around .      she   s taken your dog for a walk     said mrs .  cake .      where   s ludmilla .     he said .   windle smiled awkwardly .  mrs .  cake   s premonitions could be very wearing .      it   d be nice to know that lupine was being looked after if i   went     he said .     i wonder  could you take him in .         well       said mrs .  cake uncertainly .      but he   s       reg shoe began  and then saw windle   s expression .      i must admit it   d be a relief to have a dog around the place     said mrs .  cake .     i   m always worrying about ludmilla .  there   s a lot of strange people around .         but your dau       reg began again .      shut up  reg     said doreen .      that   s all settled  then     said windle .     and have you got any trousers .         what .         any trousers in the house .         well  i suppose i   ve got some that belonged to the late mr .  cake  but why           sorry     said windle .     my mind was wandering .  don   t know what i   m saying  half the time .         ah     said reg  brightly     i see .  what you   re saying is that when he        doreen nudged him viciously .      oh     said reg .     sorry .  don   t mind me .  i   d forget my own head if it wasn   t sewn on .      windle leaned back  and shut his eyes .  he could hear the occasional scrap of conversation .  he could hear arthur winkings asking the archchancellor who did his decorating  and where the university got its vegetables .  he heard the bursar moaning about the cost of exterminating all the cursewords  which had somehow survived the recent changes and had taken up residence in the darkness of the roof .  he could even  if he strained his perfect hearing  hear the whoops of schleppel in the distant cellars .   they didn   t need him .  at last .  the world didn   t need windle poons .   he got up quietly and lurched to the door .      i   m just going out     he said .     i may be some time .      ridcully gave him a half hearted nod  and concentrated on what arthur had to say about how the great hall could be entirely transformed with some pine effect wallpaper .   windle shut the door behind him and leaned against the thick  cool wall .   oh  yes .  there was one other thing .      are you there  one man bucket .     he said softly .  how did you know .      you   re generally around .      heh heh  you   ve caused some real trouble there .  you know what   s going to happen next full moon .      yes  i do .  and i think  somehow  that they do too .      but he   ll become a wolfman .      yes .  and she   ll become a wolfwoman .      all right  but what kind of relationship can people have one week in four .      maybe at least as good a chance of happiness as most people get .  life isn   t perfect  one man bucket .      you   re telling me .      now  can i ask you a personal question .     said windle .     i mean i   ve just got to know        huh .      after all  you   ve got the astral plane to yourself again .      oh  all right .      why are you called one        is that all .  i thought you could work that one out  a clever man like you .  in my tribe we   re traditionally named after the first thing the mother sees when she looks out of the teepee after the birth .  it   s short for one man pouring a bucket of water over two dogs .      that   s pretty unfortunate     said windle .   it   s not too bad  said one man bucket .  it was my twin brother you had to feel sorry for .  she looked out ten seconds before me to give him his name .   windle poons thought about it .      don   t tell me  let me guess     he said .     two dogs fighting .      two dogs fighting .  two dogs fighting .  said one man bucket .  wow  he   d have given his right arm to be called two dogs fighting .      it was later that the story of windle poons really came to an end  if    story    means all that he did and caused and set in motion .  in the ramtop village where they dance the real morris dance  for example  they believe that no one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away   until the clock he wound up winds down  until the wine she made has finished its ferment  until the crop they planted is harvested .  the span of someone   s life  they say  is only the core of their actual existence .   as he walked through the foggy city to an appointment he had been awaiting ever since he was born  windle felt that he could predict that final end .   it would be in a few weeks    time  when the moon was full again .  a sort of codicil or addendum to the life of windle poons   born in the year of the significant triangle in the century of the three lice  he   d always preferred the old calendar with its ancient names to all this new fangled numbering they did today  and died in the year of the notional serpent in the century of the fruitbat  more or less .   there   d be two figures running across the high moorland under the moon .  not entirely wolves  not entirely human .  with any luck  they   d have best of both worlds .  not just feeling   but knowing .   always best to have both worlds .      death sat in his chair in his dark study  his hands steepled in front of his face .   occasionally he   d swivel the chair backward and forward .   albert brought him in a cup of tea and exited with diplomatic soundlessness .   there was one lifetimer left on death   s desk .  he stared at it .   swivel  swivel .  swivel  swivel .   in the hall outside  the great clock ticked on  killing time .   death drummed his skeletal fingers on the desk   s scarred woodwork .  in front of him  stacked up with impromptu bookmarks in their pages  were the lives of some of the discworld   s great lovers .   their fairly repetitive experiences hadn   t been any help at all .   he got up and stalked to a window and stared out at his dark domain  his hands clenching and unclenching behind his back .   then he snatched up the lifetimer and strode out of the room .   binky was waiting in the warm fug of the stables .  death saddled him quickly and led him out into the courtyard  and then rode up into the night  toward the distant glittering jewel of the discworld .   he touched down silently in the farmyard  at sunset .   he drifted through a wall .   he reached the foot of the stairs .   he raised the hourglass and watched the draining of time .   and then he paused .  there was something he had to know .  bill door had been curious about things  and he could remember everything about being bill door .  he could look at emotions laid out like trapped butterflies  pinned on cork  under glass .   bill door was dead  or at least had ceased his brief existence .  but   what was it .    someone   s actual life was only the core of their real existence .  bill door had gone  but he had left echoes .  the memory of bill door was owed something .   death had always wondered why people put flowers on graves .  it made no sense to him .  the dead had gone beyond the scent of roses  after all .  but now   it wasn   t that he felt he understood  but at least he felt that there was something there capable of understanding .   in the curtained blackness of miss flitworth   s parlor a darker shape moved through the darkness  heading toward the three chests on the dresser .   death opened one of the smaller ones .  it was full of gold coins .  they had an untouched look about them .  he tried the other small chest .  it was also full of gold .   he   d expected something more from miss flitworth  although probably not even bill door would have known what .   he tried the large chest .   there was a layer of tissue paper .  under the paper  some white silky thing  some sort of a veil  now yellowed and brittle with age .  he gave it an uncomprehending stare and laid it aside .  there were some white shoes .  quite impractical for farm wear  he felt .  no wonder they   d been packed away .   there was more paper  a bundle of letters tied together .  he put them on top of the veil .  there was never anything to be gained from observing what humans said to one another   language was just there to hide their thoughts .   and then there was  right at the bottom  a smaller box .  he pulled it out and turned it over and over in his hands .  then he unclicked the little latch and lifted the lid .   clockwork whirred .   the tune wasn   t particularly good .  death had heard all the music that had ever been written  and almost all of it had been better than this tune .  it had a plinkety plonkety quality  a tinny little one two three rhythm .   in the musical box  over the busily spinning gears  two wooden dancers jerked around in a parody of a waltz .   death watched them until the clockwork ran down .  then he read the inscription .   it had been a present .   beside him  the lifetimer poured its grains into the bottom bulb .  he ignored it .   when the clockwork ran down  he wound it up again .  two figures  spinning through time .  and when the music stopped  all you needed was to turn the key .   when it ran down again  he sat in the silence and the dark  and reached a decision .   there were only seconds left .  seconds had meant a lot to bill door  because he   d had a limited supply .  they meant nothing at all to death  who   d never had any .   he left the sleeping house  mounted up  and rode away .   the journey took an instant that would have taken mere light three hundred million years  but death travels inside that space where time has no meaning .  light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong .  no matter how fast light travels it finds the darkness has always got there first  and is waiting for it .   there was company on the ride   galaxies  stars  ribbons of shining matter  streaming and eventually spiraling toward the distant goal .   death on his pale horse moved down the darkness like a bubble on a river .   and every river flows somewhere .   and then  below  a plain .  distance was as meaningless here as time  but there was a sense of hugeness .  the plain could have been a mile away  or a million miles  it was marked by long valleys or rills which flowed away to either side as he got closer .   and landed .   he dismounted  and stood in the silence .  then he went down on one knee .   change the perspective .  the furrowed landscape falls away into immense distances  curves at the edges  becomes a fingertip .   azrael raised his finger to a face that filled the sky  lit by the faint glow of dying galaxies .   there are a billion deaths  but they are all aspects of the one death  azrael  the great attractor  the death of universes  the beginning and end of time .   most of the universe is made up of dark matter  and only azrael knows who it is .   eyes so big that a supernova would be a mere suggestion of a gleam on the iris turned slowly and focused on the tiny figure on the immense whorled plains of his fingertips .  beside azrael the big clock hung in the center of the entire web of the dimensions  and ticked onward .  stars glittered in azrael   s eyes .   the death of the discworld stood up .   lord  i ask for     three of the servants of oblivion slid into existence alongside him .   one said  do not listen .  he stands accused of meddling .   one said  and morticide .   one said  and pride .  and living with intent to survive .   one said  and siding with chaos against good order .   azrael raised an eyebrow .   the servants drifted away from death  expectantly .   lord  we know there is no good order except that which we create     azrael   s expression did not change .   there is no hope but us .  there is no mercy but us .  there is no justice .  there is just us .   the dark  sad face filled the sky .   all things that are  are ours .  but we must care .  for if we do not care  we do not exist .  if we do not exist  then there is nothing but blind oblivion .   and even oblivion must end some day .  lord  will you grant me just a little time .  for the proper balance of things .  to return what was given .  for the sake of prisoners and the flight of birds .   death took a step backward .   it was impossible to read expression in azrael   s features .   death glanced sideways at the servants .   lord  what can the harvest hope for  if not for the care of the reaper man .   he waited .   lord .  said death .   in the time it took to answer  several galaxies unfolded  whirled around azrael like paper streamers  impacted  and were gone .   then azrael said       and another finger reached out across the darkness toward the clock .   there were faint screams of rage from the servants  and then screams of realization  and then three brief  blue flames .   all other clocks  even the handless clock of death  were reflections of the clock .  exactly reflections of the clock  they told the universe what the time was  but the clock told time what time is .  it was the mainspring from which all time poured .   and the design of the clock was this  that the biggest hand only went around once .   the second hand whirred along a circular path that even light would take days to travel  forever chased by the minutes  hours  days  months  years  centuries and ages .  but the universe hand went around once .   at least  until someone wound up the clockwork .   and death returned home with a handful of time .      a shop bell jangled .   druto pole  florist  looked over a spray of floribrunda mrs .  shover .  someone was standing among the vases of flowers .  they looked slightly indistinct  in fact  even afterward  druto was never sure who had been in his shop and how his words had actually sounded .   he oiled forward  rubbing his hands .      how may i hel        flowers .   druto hesitated only for a moment .      and the  er  destination for these        a lady .      and do you have any pref        lilies .      ah .  are you sure that lilies are    .      i like lilies .      um   it   s just that lilies are a little bit somber        i like somb     the figure hesitated .   what do you recommend .   druto slipped smoothly into gear .     roses are always very well received     he said .     or orchids .  many gentlemen these days tell me that ladies find a single specimen orchid more acceptable than a bunch of roses        give me lots .      would that be orchids or roses .      both .   druto   s fingers twined sinuously  like eels in grease .      and i wonder if i could interest you in these marvelous sprays of nervousa gloriosa        lots of them .      and if sir   s budget would stretch  may i suggest a single specimen of the extremely rare        yes .      and possibly        yes .  everything .  with a ribbon .   when the shop bell had jangled the purchaser out  druto looked at the coins in his hand .  many of them were corroded  all of them were strange  and one or two were golden .      um     he said .     that will do nicely        he became aware of a soft pattering sound .   around him  all over the shop  petals were falling like rain .      and these .      that   s our de luxe assortment     said the lady in the chocolate shop .  it was such a high class establishment that it sold  not sweets  but confectionery   often in the form of individual gold wrapped swirly things that made even larger holes in a bank balance than they did in a tooth .   the tall dark customer picked up a box that was about two feet square .  on a lid like a satin cushion it had a picture of a couple of hopelessly cross eyed kittens looking out of a boot .   what for is this box padded .  is it to be sat on .  can it be that it is cat flavored .  he added  his tone taking on a definite menace  or rather more menace than it had already .      um  no .  that   s our supreme assortment .      the customer tossed it aside .   no .   the shopkeeper looked both ways and then pulled open a drawer under the counter  at the same time lowering her voice to a conspiratorial whisper .     of course     she said     for that very special occasion        it was quite a small box .  it was also entirely black  except for the name of the contents in small white letters  cats  even in pink ribbons  wouldn   t be allowed within a mile of a box like this .  to deliver a box of chocolates like this  dark strangers drop from chairlifts and abseil down buildings .   the dark stranger peered at the lettering .      dark enchantments     he said .  i like it .      for those intimate moments     said the lady .   the customer appeared to consider the relevance of this .   yes .  that seems appropriate .   the shopkeeper beamed .      shall i wrap them up  then .      yes .  with a ribbon .      and will there be anything else  sir .      the customer seemed to panic .   else .  should there be anything else .  is there something else .  what is it that should be done .     i   m sorry  sir .      a present for a lady .   the shopkeeper was left a little adrift by this sudden turning of the tide of conversation .  she swam toward a reliable clich   .      well  they do say  don   t they  that diamonds are a girl   s best friend .     she said brightly .   diamonds .  oh .  diamonds .  is that so .      they glittered like bits of starlight on a black velvet sky .      this one     said the merchant     is a particularly excellent stone  don   t you think .  note the fire  the exceptional        how friendly is it .   the merchant hesitated .  he knew about carats  about adamantine luster  about    water    and    make    and    fire     but he   d never before been called upon to judge gems in terms of general affability .      quite well disposed .     he hazarded .   no .   the merchant   s fingers seized on another splinter of frozen light .      now this     he said  confidence flowing back into his voice     is from the famous shortshanks mine .  may i draw your attention to the exquisite        he felt the penetrating stare drill through the back of his head .      but not  i must admit  noted for its friendliness     he said lamely .   the dark customer looked disapprovingly around the shop .  in the gloom  behind troll proof bars  gems glowed like the eyes of dragons in the back of a cave .   are any of these friendly .  he said .      sir  i think i can say  without fear of contradiction  that we have never based our purchasing policy on the amiability of the stones in question     said the merchant .  he was uncomfortably aware that things were wrong  and that somewhere in the back of his mind he knew what was wrong with them  and that somehow his mind was not letting him make that final link .  and it was getting on his nerves .   where is the biggest diamond in the world .      the biggest .  that   s easy .  it   s the tear of offler  it   s in the innermost sanctuary of the lost jewelled temple of doom of offler the crocodile god in darkest howandaland  and it weighs eight hundred and fifty carats .  and  sir  to forestall your next question  i personally would go to bed with it .         one of the nice things about being a priest in the lost jewelled temple of doom of offler the crocodile god was that you got to go home early most afternoons .  this was because it was lost .  most worshippers never found their way there .  they were the lucky ones .   traditionally  only two people ever went into the innermost sanctuary .  they were the high priest and the other priest who wasn   t high .  they had been there for years  and took turns at being the high one .  it was an undemanding job  given that most prospective worshippers were impaled  squashed  poisoned or sliced by booby traps even before making it as far as the little box and the jolly drawing of a thermometer  outside the vestry .   they were playing cripple mr .  onion on the high altar  beneath the very shadow of the jewel encrusted statue of offler himself  when they heard the distant creak of the main door .   the high priest didn   t look up .      heyup     he said .     another one for the big rolling ball  then .      there was a thump and a rumbling  grinding sound .  and then a very final bang .      now     said the high priest .     what was the stake .         two pebbles     said the low priest .      right .     the high priest peered at his cards .     okay  i   ll see your two peb        there was the faint sound of footsteps .      chap with a whip got as far as the big sharp spikes last week     said the low priest .   there was a sound like the flushing of a very old dry lavatory .  the footsteps stopped .   the high priest smiled to himself .      right     he said .     see your two pebbles and raise you two pebbles .      the low priest threw down his cards .      double onion     he said .   the high priest looked down suspiciously .   the low priest consulted a scrap of paper .      that   s three hundred thousand  nine hundred and sixty four pebbles you owe me     he said .   there was the sound of footsteps .   the priests exchanged glances .      haven   t had one for poisoned dart alley for quite some time     said the high priest .      five says he makes it     said the low priest .      you   re on .      there was a faint clatter of metal points on stone .      it   s a shame to take your pebbles .      there were footsteps again .      all right  but there   s still the       a creak  a splash       crocodile tank .      there were footsteps .      no one   s ever got past the dreaded guardian of the portals        the priests looked into one another   s horrified faces .      hey     said the one who was not high .     you don   t think it could be           here .  oh  come on .  we   re in the middle of a godsdamn jungle .     the high priest tried to smile .     there   s no way it could be        the footsteps got nearer .   the priests clutched at one another in terror .      mrs .  cake .      the doors exploded inward .  a dark wind drove into the room  blowing out the candles and scattering the cards like polka dot snow .   the priests heard the chink of a very large diamond being lifted out of its socket .   thank you .   after a while  when nothing else seemed to be happening  the priest who wasn   t high managed to find a tinder box and  after several false starts  got a candle alight .   the two priests looked up through the dancing shadows at the statue  where a hole now gaped that should have contained a very large diamond .   after a while  the high priest sighed and said     well  look at it like this  apart from us  who   s going to know .         yeah .  never thought of it like that .  hey  can i be high priest tomorrow .         it   s not your turn until thursday .         oh  come on .      the high priest shrugged  and removed his high priesting hat .      it   s very depressing  this kind of thing    he said  glancing up at the ravaged statue .     some people just don   t know how to behave in a house of religion .         death sped across the world  landing once again in the farmyard .  the sun was on the horizon when he knocked on the kitchen door .   miss flitworth opened it  wiping her hands on her apron .  she grimaced short sightedly at the visitor  and then took a step back .      bill door .  you gave me quite a start        i have brought you some flowers .   she stared at the dry  dead stems .   also some chocolate assortment  the sort ladies like .   she stared at the black box .   also here is a diamond to be friends with you .   it caught the last rays of the setting sun .   miss flitworth finally found her voice .      bill door  what are you thinking of .      i have come to take you away from all this .      you have .  where to .      death hadn   t thought this far .   where would you like .      i ain   t proposing to go anywhere tonight except to the dance     said miss flitworth firmly .   death hadn   t planned for this  either .   what is this dance .      harvest dance .  you know .  it   s tradition .  when the harvest is in .  it   s a sort of celebration  and like a thanksgiving .      thanksgiving to who .      dunno .  no one in particular  i reckon .  just general thankfulness  i suppose .      i had planned to show you marvels .  fine cities .  anything you wanted .     anything .      yes .     then we   re going to the dance  bill door .  i always go every year .  they rely on me .  you know how it is .      yes  miss flitworth .   he reached out and took her hand .      what  you mean now .     she said     i   m not ready        look .   she looked down at what she was suddenly wearing .      that   s not my dress .  it   s got all glitter on it .      death sighed .  the great lovers of history had never encountered miss flitworth .  casanunder would have handed in his stepladder .   they   re diamonds .  a king   s ransom in diamonds .      which king .      any king .      coo .         binky walked easily along the road to the town .  after the length of infinity  a mere dusty road was a bit of a relief .   sitting sidesaddle behind death  miss flitworth explored the rustling contents of the box of dark enchantments .      here     she said     someone   s had all the rum truffles .     there was another crackle of paper .     and from the bottom layer  too  i hate that  people starting the bottom layer before the top one   s been properly finished .  and i can tell you   ve been doing it because there   s a little map in the lid and by rights there should be rum truffles  bill door .      i   m sorry  miss flitworth .      this big diamond   s a bit heavy .  nice  though     she added  grudgingly .     where   d you get it .      from people who thought it was the tear of a god .      and is it .      no .  gods never weep .  it is common carbon that has been subject to great heat and pressure  that is all .      inside every lump of coal there   s a diamond waiting to get out  right .      yes  miss flitworth .   there was no sound for a while  except the clip clop of binky   s hoofs .  then miss flitworth said  archly      i do know what   s going on  you know .  i saw how much sand there was .  and so you thought    she   s not a bad old stick  i   ll show her a good time for a few hours  and then when she   s not expecting it  it   ll be time for the old cut de grass     am i right .      death said nothing .      i am right  aren   t i .      i can   t hide anything from you  miss flitworth .      huh  i suppose i should be flattered .  yes .  i expect you   ve got a lot of calls on your time .      more than you could possibly imagine  miss flitworth .      in the circumstances  then  you might as well go back to calling me renata again .      there was a bonfire in the meadow beyond the archery field .  death could see figures moving in front of it .  an occasional tortured squeak suggested that someone was tuning up a fiddle .      i always come along to the harvest dance     said miss flitworth  conversationally .     not to dance  of course .  i generally look after the food and so on .      why .      well  someone   s got to look after the food .      i meant why don   t you dance .         cos i   m old  that   s why .      you are as old as you think you are .      huh .  yeah .  really .  that   s the kind of stupid thing people always say .  they always say  my word  you   re looking well .  they say  there   s life in the old dog yet .  many a good tune played on an old fiddle .  that kind of stuff .  it   s all stupid .  as if being old was some kind of thing you should be glad about .  as if being philosophical about it will earn you marks .  my head knows how to think young  but my knees aren   t that good at it .  or my back .  or my teeth .  try telling my knees they   re as old as they think they are and see what good it does you .  or them .      it may be worth a try .   more figures moved in front of the firelight .  death could see striped poles strung with bunting .     the lads usually bring a couple of barn doors down here and nail   em together for a proper floor     observed miss flitworth .     then everyone can join in .      folk dancing .  said death  wearily .      no .  we have some pride  you know .      sorry .      hey  it   s bill door  isn   t it .     said a figure looming out of the dusk .      it   s good old bill .         hey  bill .      death looked at a circle of guileless faces .      hallo  my friends .      we heard you   d gone away     said duke bottomley .  he glanced at miss flitworth  as death helped her down from the horse .  his voice faltered a bit as he tried to analyze the situation .      you   re looking very   sparkly   tonight  miss flitworth     he finished  gallantly .   the air smelled of warm  damp grass .  an amateur orchestra was still setting up under an awning .   there were trestle tables covered with the kind of food that   s normally associated with the word    repast      pork pies like varnished military fortifications  vats of demonical pickled onions  jacket potatoes wallowing in a cholesterol ocean of melted butter .  some of the local elders had already established themselves on the benches provided  and were chewing stoically if toothlessly through the food with the air of people determined to sit there all night  if necessary .      nice to see the old people enjoying themselves     said miss flitworth .   death looked at the eaters .  most of them were younger than miss flitworth .   there was a giggle from somewhere in the scented darkness beyond the firelight .      and the young people    miss flitworth added  evenly .     we used to have a saying about this time of year .  let   s see   something like    corn be ripe  nuts be brown  petticoats up       something .     she sighed .     don   t time fly  eh .      yes .      you know  bill door  maybe you were right about the power of positive thinking .  i feel a lot better tonight .      yes .   miss flitworth looked speculatively at the dance floor .     i used to be a great dancer when i was a gel .  i could dance anyone off their feet .  i could dance down the moon .  i could dance the sun up .      she reached up and removed the bands that held her hair in its tight bun  and shook it out in a waterfall of white .      i take it you do dance  mr .  bill door .      famed for it  miss flitworth .   under the band   s awning  the lead fiddler nodded to his fellow musicians  stuck his fiddle under his chin  and pounded on the boards with his foot        hwun .  htwo .  hwun htwo three four           picture a landscape  with the orange light of a crescent moon drifting across it .  and  down below  a circle of firelight in the night .   there were the old favorites   the square dances  the reels  the whirling  intricate measures which  if the dancers had carried lights  would have traced out topological complexities beyond the reach of ordinary physics  and the sort of dances that lead perfectly sane people to shout out things like    do si do .     and    och aye .     without feeling massively ashamed for quite a long time .   when the casualties were cleared away the survivors went on to polka  mazurka  fox trot  turkey trot and trot a variety of other birds and beasts  and then to those dances where people form an arch and other people dance down it  which are incidentally generally based on folk memories of executions  and other dances where people form a circle  which are generally based on folk memories of plagues .   through it all two figures whirled as though there was no tomorrow .   the lead fiddler was dimly aware that  when he paused for breath  a spinning figure tap danced a storm out of the m  l  e and a voice by his ear said   you will continue  i promise you .   when he flagged a second time a diamond as big as his fist landed on the boards in front of him .  a smaller figure sashayed out of the dancers and said      if you boys don   t go on playing  william spigot  i will personally make sure your life becomes absolutely foul .      and it returned to the press of bodies .   the fiddler looked down at the diamond .  it could have ransomed any five kings the world would care to name .  he kicked it hurriedly behind him .      more power to your elbow  eh .     said the drummer  grinning .      shut up and play .      he was aware that tunes were turning up at the ends of his fingers that his brain had never known .  the drummer and the piper felt it too .  music was pouring in from somewhere .  they weren   t playing it .  it was playing them .   it is time for a new dance to begin .     duurrrump da dum dum     hummed the fiddler  the sweat running off his chin as he was caught up in a different tune .   the dancers milled around uncertainly  unsure about the steps .  but one pair moved purposefully through them at a predatory crouch  arms clasped ahead of them like the bowsprit of a killer galleon .  at the end of the floor they turned in a flurry of limbs that appeared to defy normal anatomy and began the angular advance back through the crowd .      what   s this one called .      tango .      can you get put in prison for it .      i don   t believe so .      amazing .      the music changed .      i know this one .  it   s the quirmish bullfight dance .  oh lay .         with milk    .   a high speed fusillade of hollow snapping noises suddenly kept time with the music .      who   s playing the maracas .      death grinned .   maracas .  i don   t need   maracas .   and then it was now .   the moon was a ghost of itself on one horizon .  on the other there was already the distant glow of the advancing day .   they left the dance floor .   whatever had been propelling the band through the hours of the night drained slowly away .  they looked at one another .  spigot the fiddler glanced down at the jewel .  it was still there .   the drummer tried to massage some life back into his wrists .   spigot stared helplessly at the exhausted dancers .      well  then       he said  and raised the fiddle one more time .      miss flitworth and her companion listened from the mists that were threading around the field in the dawn light .   death recognized the slow  insistent beat .  it made him think of wooden figures  whirling through time until the spring unwound .   i don   t know that one .      it   s the last waltz .   i suspect there   s no such thing .      you know     said miss flitworth     i   ve been wondering all evening how it   s going to happen .  how you   re going to do it .  i mean  people have to die of something  don   t they .  i thought maybe it was going to be of exhaustion  but i   ve never felt better .  i   ve had the time of my life and i   m not even out of breath .  in fact it   s been a real tonic  bill door .  and i        she stopped .      i   m not breathing  am i .     it wasn   t a question .  she held a hand in front of her face and huffed on it .   no .      i see .  i   ve never enjoyed myself so much in all my life   ha .  so   when    .      you know when you said that seeing me gave you quite a start .      yes .      it gave you quite a stop .   miss flitworth didn   t appear to hear him .  she kept turning her hand backward and forward  as if she   d never seen it before .      i see you made a few changes  bill door     she said .   no .  it is life that makes many changes .      i mean that i appear to be younger .      that   s what i meant also .   he snapped his fingers .  binky stopped his grazing by the hedge and trotted over .      you know     said miss flitworth     i   ve often thought   i often thought that everyone has their  you know  natural age .  you see children of ten who act as though they   re thirty five .  some people are born middle aged  even .  it   d be nice to think i   ve been       she looked down at herself     oh  let   s say eighteen   all my life .  inside .      death said nothing .  he helped her up onto the horse .      when i see what life does to people  you know  you don   t seem so bad     she said nervously .   death made a clicking noise with his teeth .  binky walked forward .      you   ve never met life  have you .      i can say in all honesty that i have not .      probably some great white crackling thing .  like an electric storm in trousers     said miss flitworth .   i think not .   binky rose up into the morning sky .      anyway   death to all tyrants    said miss flitworth .   yes .      where are we going .      binky was galloping  but the landscape did not move .      that   s a pretty good horse you   ve got there     said miss flitworth  her voice shaking .   yes .      but what is he doing .      getting up speed .      but we   re not going anywhere        they vanished .      they reappeared .   the landscape was snow and green ice on broken mountains .  these weren   t old mountains  worn down by time and weather and full of gentle ski slopes  but young  sulky  adolescent mountains .  they held secret ravines and merciless crevices .  one yodel out of place would attract  not the jolly echo of a lonely goatherd  but fifty tons of express delivery snow .   the horse landed on a snowbank that should not  by rights  have been able to support it .   death dismounted and helped miss flitworth down .   they walked over the snow to a frozen muddy track that hugged the mountain side .      why are we here .     said the spirit of miss flitworth .   i do not speculate on cosmic matters .      i mean here on this mountain .  here on this geography     said miss flitworth patiently .   this is not geography .      what is it  then .      history .   they rounded a bend in the track .  there was a pony there  eating a bush  with a pack on its back .  the track ended in a wall of suspiciously clean snow .   death removed a lifetimer from the recesses of his robe .   now  he said  and stepped into the snow .   she watched it for a moment  wondering if she could have done that too .  solidity was an awfully hard habit to give up .   and then she didn   t have to .   someone came out .      death adjusted binky   s bridle  and mounted up .  he paused for a moment to watch the two figures by the avalanche .  they had faded almost to invisibility  their voices no more than textured air .      all he said was    wherever you go  you go together .     i said where .  he said he didn   t know .  what   s happened .         rufus   you   re going to find this very hard to believe  my love           and who was that masked man .      they both looked around .   there was no one there .      in the village in the ramtops where they understand what the morris dance is all about  they dance it just once  at dawn  on the first day of spring .  they don   t dance it after that  all through the summer .  after all  what would be the point .  what use would it be .   but on a certain day when the nights are drawing in  the dancers leave work early and take  from attics and cupboards  the other costume  the black one  and the other bells .  and they go by separate ways to a valley among the leafless trees .  they don   t speak .  there is no music .  it   s very hard to imagine what kind there could be .   the bells don   t ring .  they   re made of octiron  a magic metal .  but they   re not  precisely  silent bells .  silence is merely the absence of noise .  they make the opposite of noise  a sort of heavily textured silence .   and in the cold afternoon  as the light drains from the sky  among the frosty leaves and in the damp air  they dance the other morris .  because of the balance of things .   you   ve got to dance both  they say .  otherwise you can   t dance either .      windle poons wandered across the brass bridge .  it was the time in ankh morpork   s day when the night people were going to bed and the day people were waking up .  for once  there weren   t many of either around .   windle had felt moved to be here  at this place  on this night  now .  it wasn   t exactly the feeling he   d had when he knew he was going to die .  it was more the feeling that a cogwheel gets inside a clock   things turn  the spring unwinds  and this is where you   ve got to be     he stopped  and leaned over .  the dark water  or at least very runny mud  sucked at the stone supports .  there was an old legend   what was it  now .  if you threw a coin into the ankh from the brass bridge you   d be sure to return .  or was it if you just threw up into the ankh .  probably the former .  most of the citizens  if they dropped a coin into the river  would be sure to come back if only to look for the coin .   a figure loomed out of the mist .  he tensed .      morning  mr .  poons .      windle let himself relax .      oh .  sergeant colon .  i thought you were someone else .         just me  your lordship     said the watchman cheerfully .     turning up like a bad copper .         i see the bridge has got through another night without being stolen  sergeant .  well done .         you can   t be too careful  i always say .         i   m sure we citizens can sleep safely in one another   s beds knowing that no one can make off with a five thousand ton bridge overnight     said windle .   unlike modo the dwarf  sergeant colon did know the meaning of the word    irony .     he thought it meant    sort of like iron .     he gave windle a respectful grin .      you have to think quick to keep ahead of today   s international criminal  mr .  poons     he said .      good man .  er .  you haven   t  er  seen anyone else around  have you .         dead quiet tonight     said the sergeant .  he remembered himself and added     no offense meant .         oh .         i   ll be moving along  then     said the sergeant .      fine .  fine .         are you all right  mr .  poons .         fine .  fine .         not going to throw yourself in the river again .         no .         sure .         yes .         oh .  well .  good night  then .     he hesitated .     forget my own head next     he said .     chap over there asked me to give this to you .     he held out a grubby envelope .   windle peered into the mists .      what chap .         that ch   oh  he   s gone .  tall chap .  bit odd looking .      windle unfolded the scrap of paper  on which was written  oooooeeeeoooeeeeoooeee .      ah     he said .      bad news .     said the sergeant .      that depends     said windle     on your point of view .         oh .  right .  fine .  well   good night  then .         goodbye .      sergeant colon hesitated for a moment  and then shrugged and strolled on .   as he wandered away  the shadow behind him moved and grinned .   windle poons .   windle didn   t look around .      yes .      out of the corner of his eye windle saw a pair of bony arms rest themselves on the parapet .  there was the faint sound of a figure trying to make itself comfortable  and then a restful silence .      ah     said windle .     i suppose you   ll want to be getting along .      no rush .      i thought you were always so punctual .      in the circumstances  a few minutes more will not make a lot of difference .   windle nodded .  they stood side by side in silence  while around them was the muted roar of the city .      you know     said windle     it   s a wonderful afterlife .  where were you .      i was busy .   windle wasn   t really listening .     i   ve met people i never even knew existed .  i   ve done all sorts of things .  i   ve really got to know who windle poons is .      who is he  then .      windle poons .      i can see where that must have come as a shock .      well  yes .      all these years and you never suspected .   windle poons did know exactly what irony meant  and he could spot sarcasm too .      it   s all very well for you     he mumbled .   perhaps .   windle looked down at the river again .      it   s been great     he said .     after all this time .  being needed is important .      yes .  but why .   windle looked surprised .      i don   t know .  how should i know .  because we   re all in this together  i suppose .  because we don   t leave our people in there .  because you   re a long time dead .  because anything is better than being alone .  because humans are human .      and sixpence is sixpence .  but corn is not just corn .      it isn   t .      no .   windle leaned back .  the stone of the bridge was still warm from the day   s heat .   to his surprise  death leaned back as well .   because you   re all you   ve got  said death .      what .  oh .  yes .  that as well .  it   s a great big cold universe out there .      you   d be amazed .      one lifetime just isn   t enough .      oh  i don   t know .      hmm .      windle poons .      yes .      that was your life .   and  with great relief  and general optimism  and a feeling that on the whole everything could have been much worse  windle poons died .      somewhere in the night  reg shoe looked both ways  took a furtive paintbrush and small pot of paint from inside his jacket  and painted on a handy wall  inside every living person is a dead person waiting to get out     and then it was all over .  the end .      death stood at the window of his dark study  looking out onto his garden .  nothing moved in that still domain .  dark lilies bloomed by the trout pool  where little plaster skeleton gnomes fished .  there were distant mountains .   it was his own world .  it appeared on no map .   but now  somehow  it lacked something .   death selected a scythe from the rack in the huge hall .  he strode past the huge clock without hands and went outside .  he stalked through the black orchard  where albert was busy about the beehives  and on until he climbed a small mound on the edge of the garden .  beyond  to the mountains  was unformed land   it would bear weight  it had an existence of sorts  but there had never been any reason to define it further .   until now  anyway .   albert came up behind him  a few dark bees still buzzing around his head .      what are you doing  master .     he said .   remembering .      ah .      i remember when all this was stars .   what was it .  oh  yes     he snapped his fingers .  fields appeared  following the gentle curves of the land .     golden     said albert .     that   s nice .  i   ve always thought we could do with a bit more color around here .      death shook his head .  it wasn   t quite right yet .  then he realized what it was .  the lifetimers  the great room filled with the roar of disappearing lives  was efficient and necessary  you needed something like that for good order .  but     he snapped his fingers again and a breeze sprang up .  the cornfields moved  billow after billow unfolding across the slopes .   albert .      yes  master .      have you not got something to do .  some little job .      i don   t think so     said albert .   away from here  is what i mean .      ah .  what you mean is  you want to be alone     said albert .   i am always alone .  but just now i want to be alone by myself .      right .  i   ll just go and  uh  do some little jobs back at the house  then     said albert .   you do that .   death stood alone  watching the wheat dance in the wind .  of course  it was only a metaphor .  people were more than corn .  they whirled through tiny crowded lives  driven literally by clock work  filling their days from edge to edge with the sheer effort of living .  and all lives were exactly the same length .  even the very long and very short ones .  from the point of view of eternity  anyway .   somewhere  the tiny voice of bill door said  from the point of view of the owner  longer ones are best .   squeak .   death looked down .   a small figure was standing by his feet .   he reached down and picked it up  held it up to an investigative eye socket .   i knew i   d missed someone .   the death of rats nodded .   squeak .   death shook his head .   no  i can   t let you remain  he said .  it   s not as though i   m running a franchise or something .   squeak .   are you the only one left .   the death of rats opened a tiny skeletal hand .  the tiny death of fleas stood up  looking embarrassed but hopeful .   no .  this shall not be .  i am implacable .  i am death   alone .   he looked at the death of rats .   he remembered azrael in his tower of loneliness .   alone     the death of rats looked back at him .   squeak .      picture a tall  dark figure  surrounded by cornfields     no  you can   t ride a cat .  who ever heard of the death of rats riding a cat .  the death of rats would ride some kind of dog .   picture more fields  a great horizon spanning network of fields  rolling in gentle waves     don   t ask me i don   t know .  some kind of terrier  maybe .      fields of corn  alive  whispering in the breeze     right  and the death of fleas can ride it too .  that way you kill two birds with one stone .      awaiting the clockwork of the seasons .   metaphorically .      and at the end of all stories azrael  who knew the secret  thought  i remember when all this will be again .    in this case  three better places .  the front gates of nos        and    elm street  ankh morpork .       at least  until the day they suddenly pick up a paper knife and carve their way out through cost accounting and into forensic history .      the post of senior wrangler was an unusual one  as was the name itself .  in some centers of learning  the senior wrangler is a leading philosopher  in others  he   s merely someone who looks after horses .  the senior wrangler at unseen university was a philosopher who looked like a horse  thus neatly encapsulating all definitions .      it is true that the undead cannot cross running water .  however  the naturally turbid river ankh  already heavy with the mud of the plains  does not  after having passed through the city  pop .             necessarily qualify under the term    running    or  for that matter     water .          although not common on the discworld there are  indeed  such things as anti crimes  in accordance with the fundamental law that everything in the multiverse has an opposite .  they are  obviously  rare .  merely giving someone something is not the opposite of robbery  to be an anti crime  it has to be done in such a way as to cause outrage and or humiliation to the victim .  so there is breaking and decorating  proffering with embarrassment  as in most retirement presentations  and whitemailing  as in threatening to reveal to his enemies a mobster   s secret donations  for example  to charity  .  anti crimes have never really caught on .       i . e .   everywhere outside the shades .       rains of fish  for example  were so common in the little landlocked village of pine dressers that it had a flourishing smoking  canning and kipper filleting industry .  and in the mountain regions of syrrit many sheep  left out in the fields all night  would be found in the morning to be facing the other way  without the apparent intervention of any human agency .       someone who will put certainly salt and probably pepper on any meal you put in front of them whatever it is and regardless of how much it   s got on it already and regardless of how it tastes .  behavioural psychiatrists working for fast food outlets around the universe have saved billions of whatever the local currency is by noting the autocondimenting phenomenon and advising their employers to leave seasoning out in the first place .  this is really true .       many songs have been written about the bustling metropolis  the most famous of course being     ankh morpork .  ankh morpork .  so good they named it ankh morpork .      but others have included    carry me away from old ankh morpork        i fear i   m going back to ankh morpork    and the old favorite     ankh morpork malady .          it would say  for example  that you would shortly undergo a painful bowel movement .       mrs .  cake was aware that some religions had priestesses .  what mrs .  cake thought about the ordination of women was unprintable .  the religions with priestesses in ankh morpork tended to attract a large crowd of plain clothes priests from other denominations who were looking for a few hours    respite somewhere where they wouldn   t encounter mrs .  cake .       a song which  in various languages  is common on every known world in the multiverse .  it is always sung by the same people  viz .   the people who  when they grow up  will be the people who the next generation sing    we shall overcome    at .       the only building on the campus less than a thousand years old .  the senior wizards have never bothered much about what the younger  skinnier and more bespectacled wizards get up to in there  treating their endless requests for funding for thaumic particle accelerators and radiation shielding as one treats pleas for more pocket money  and listening with amusement to their breathless accounts of the search for the elementary particles of magic itself .  this may one day turn out to be a major error on the part of the senior wizards  especially if they do let the younger wizards build whatever that blasted thing is they keep wanting to build in the squash court .   the senior wizards know that the proper purpose of magic is to form a social pyramid with the wizards on top of it  eating big dinners  but in fact the hem building has helped provide one of the rarest foods in the universe   antipasta .  ordinary pasta is prepared some hours before being eaten .  antipasta is created some hours after the meal  whereupon it then exists backward in time  and if properly prepared should arrive on the taste buds at exactly the same moment  thus creating a true taste explosion .  it costs five thousand dollars a forkful  or a little more if you include the cost of cleaning the tomato sauce off the walls afterward .       people have believed for hundreds of years that newts in a well mean that the water   s fresh and drinkable  and in all that time never asked themselves whether the newts got out to go to the lavatory .       vermine are small black and white rodents found in the ramtop mountains .  they are ancestors of the lemming  which as is well known throws itself over cliffs and drowns in lakes on a regular basis .  vermine used to do that  too .  the point is  though  that dead animals don   t breed  and over the millennia more and more vermine were descendants of those vermine who  when faced with a cliff edge  squeaked the rodent equivalent of blow that for a game of soldiers .  vermine now abseil down cliffs  and build small boats to cross lakes .  when their rush leads them to the seashore they sit around avoiding one another   s gaze for a while  and then leave early to get home before the rush .       the ability of skinny old ladies to carry huge loads is phenomenal .  studies have shown that an ant can carry one hundred times its own weight  but there is no known limit to the lifting power of the average tiny eighty year old spanish peasant grandmother .       it is traditional  when loading wire trolleys  to put the most fragile items at the bottom .       it is generally thought  on those worlds where the mall lifeform has seeded  that people take the wire baskets away and leave them in strange and isolated places  so that squads of young men have to be employed to gather them together and wheel them back .  this is exactly the opposite of the truth .  in reality the men are hunters  stalking their rattling prey across the landscape  trapping them  breaking their spirit  taming them and herding them to a life of slavery .  possibly .       the most enthusiastic of these was the small but persistent and incredibly successful casanunder the dwarf  a name mentioned with respect and awe wherever stepladder owners are gathered together .
