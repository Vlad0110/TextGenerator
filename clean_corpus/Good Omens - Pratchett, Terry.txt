good omens   neil gaiman  and  terry pratchett      table of contents      in the beginning      good omens      dramatis personae      eleven years ago      wednesday      thursday      friday      saturday      sunday      in the beginning   it was a nice day .   all the days had been nice .  there had been rather more than seven of them so far  and rain hadn t been invented yet .  but clouds massing east of eden suggested that the first thunderstorm was on its way  and it was going to be a big one .   the angel of the eastern gate put his wings over his head to shield himself from the first drops .    i m sorry   he said politely .   what was it you were saying .     i said  that one went down like a lead balloon   said the serpent .    oh .  yes   said the angel  whose name was aziraphale .    i think it was a bit of an overreaction  to be honest   said the serpent .   i mean  first offense and everything .  i can t see what s so bad about knowing the difference between good and evil  anyway .     it must be bad   reasoned aziraphale  in the slightly concerned tones of one who can t see it either  and is worrying about it   otherwise you wouldn t have been involved .     they just said  get up there and make some trouble   said the serpent  whose name was crawly  although he was thinking of changing it now .  crawly  he d decided  was not him .    yes  but you re a demon .  i m not sure if it s actually possible for you to do good   said aziraphale .   it s down to your basic  you know  nature .  nothing personal  you understand .     you ve got to admit it s a bit of a pantomime  though   said crawly .   i mean  pointing out the tree and saying  don t touch  in big letters .  not very subtle  is it .  i mean  why not put it on top of a high mountain or a long way off .  makes you wonder what he s really planning .     best not to speculate  really   said aziraphale .   you can t second guess ineffability  i always say .  there s right  and there s wrong .  if you do wrong when you re told to do right  you deserve to be punished .  er .    they sat in embarrassed silence  watching the raindrops bruise the first flowers .   eventually crawly said   didn t you have a flaming sword .     er   said the angel .  a guilty expression passed across his face  and then came back and camped there .    you did  didn t you .   said crawly .   it flamed like anything .     er  well       it looked very impressive  i thought .     yes  but  well       lost it  have you .     oh no .  no  not exactly lost  more       well .    aziraphale looked wretched .   if you must know   he said  a trifle testily   i gave it away .    crawly stared up at him .    well  i had to   said the angel  rubbing his hands distractedly .   they looked so cold  poor things  and she s expecting already  and what with the vicious animals out there and the storm coming up i thought  well  where s the harm  so i just said  look  if you come back there s going to be an almighty row  but you might be needing this sword  so here it is  don t bother to thank me  just do everyone a big favor and don t let the sun go down on you here .    he gave crawly a worried grin .    that was the best course  wasn t it .     i m not sure it s actually possible for you to do evil   said crawly sarcastically .  aziraphale didn t notice the tone .    oh  i do hope so   he said .   i really do hope so .  it s been worrying me all afternoon .    they watched the rain for a while .    funny thing is   said crawly   i keep wondering whether the apple thing wasn t the right thing to do  as well .  a demon can get into real trouble  doing the right thing .   he nudged the angel .   funny if we both got it wrong  eh .  funny if i did the good thing and you did the bad one  eh .     not really   said aziraphale .   crawly looked at the rain .    no   he said  sobering up .   i suppose not .    slate black curtains tumbled over eden .  thunder growled among the hills .  the animals  freshly named  cowered from the storm .   far away  in the dripping woods  something bright and fiery flickered among the trees .   it was going to be a dark and stormy night .       good omens   a narrative of certain events occurring in the last eleven years of human history  in strict accordance as shall be shewn with   the nice and accurate prophecies of agnes nutter  compiled and

  brian  a boy   full chorus of tibetans  aliens  americans  atlanteans and other rare and strange creatures of the last days .       and   dog  satanical hellhound and cat worrier       eleven years ago   current theories on the creation of the universe state that  if it was created at all and didn t just start  as it were  unofficially  it came into being between ten and twenty thousand million years ago .  by the same token the earth itself is generally supposed to be about four and a half thousand million years old .   these dates are incorrect .   medieval jewish scholars put the date of the creation at      b . c .  greek orthodox theologians put creation as far back as      b . c .   these suggestions are also incorrect .   archbishop james usher               published annales veteris et novi testaments in       which suggested that the heaven and the earth were created in      b . c .  one of his aides took the calculation further  and was able to announce triumphantly that the earth was created on sunday the   st of october       b . c .   at exactly      a . m .   because god liked to get work done early in the morning while he was feeling fresh .   this too was incorrect .  by almost a quarter of an hour .   the whole business with the fossilized dinosaur skeletons was a joke the paleontologists haven t seen yet .   this proves two things   firstly  that god moves in extremely mysterious  not to say  circuitous ways .  god does not play dice with the universe  he plays an ineffable game of his own devising  which might be compared  from the perspective of any of the other players   ie .   everybody .   to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch dark room  with blank cards  for infinite stakes  with a dealer who won t tell you the rules  and who smiles all the time .   secondly  the earth s a libra .   the astrological prediction for libra in the  your stars today  column of the tadfield advertiser  on the day this history begins  read as follows       libra .     september      october .   you may be feeling run down and always in the same old daily round home and family matters are highlighted and are hanging fire .  avoid unnecessary risks .  a friend is important to you .  shelve major decisions until the way ahead seems clear .  you may be vulnerable to a stomach upset today  so avoid salads .  help could come from an unexpected quarter .       this was perfectly correct on every count except for the bit about the salads .          it wasn t a dark and stormy night .   it should have been  but that s the weather for you .  for every mad scientist who s had a convenient thunderstorm just on the night his great work is finished and lying on the slab  there have been dozens who ve sat around aimlessly under the peaceful stars while igor clocks up the overtime .   but don t let the fog  with rain later  temperatures dropping to around forty five degrees  give anyone a false sense of security .  just because it s a mild night doesn t mean that dark forces aren t abroad .  they re abroad all the time .  they re everywhere .   they always are .  that s the whole point .   two of them lurked in the ruined graveyard .  two shadowy figures  one hunched and squat  the other lean and menacing  both of them olympic grade lurkers .  if bruce springsteen had ever recorded  born to lurk   these two would have been on the album cover .  they had been lurking in the fog for an hour now  but they had been pacing themselves and could lurk for the rest of the night if necessary  with still enough sullen menace left for a final burst of lurking around dawn .   finally  after another twenty minutes  one of them said   bugger this for a lark .  he should of been here hours ago .    the speaker s name was hastur .  he was a duke of hell .          many phenomena   wars  plagues  sudden audits   have been advanced as evidence for the hidden hand of satan in the affairs of man  but whenever students of demonology get together the m   london orbital motorway is generally agreed to be among the top contenders for exhibit a .   where they go wrong  of course  is in assuming that the wretched road is evil simply because of the incredible carnage and frustration it engenders every day .   in fact  very few people on the face of the planet know that the very shape of the m   forms the sigh odegra in the language of the black priesthood of ancient mu  and means  hail the great beast  devourer of worlds .   the thousands of motorists who daily fume their way around its serpentine lengths have the same effect as water on a prayer wheel  grinding out an endless fog of low grade evil to pollute the metaphysical atmosphere for scores of miles around .   it was one of crowley s better achievements .  it had taken years to achieve  and had involved three computer hacks  two break ins  one minor bribery and  on one wet night when all else had failed  two hours in a squelchy field shifting the marker pegs a few but occultly incredibly significant meters .  when crowley had watched the first thirty mile long tailback he d experienced the lovely warm feeling of a bad job well done .   it had earned him a commendation .   crowley was currently doing     mph somewhere east of slough .  nothing about him looked particularly demonic  at least by classical standards .  no horns  no wings .  admittedly he was listening to a best of queen tape  but no conclusions should be drawn from this because all tapes left in a car for more than about a fortnight metamorphose into best of queen albums .  no particularly demonic thoughts were going through his head .  in fact  he was currently wondering vaguely who moey and chandon were .   crowley had dark hair and good cheekbones and he was wearing snakeskin shoes  or at least presumably he was wearing shoes  and he could do really weird things with his tongue .  and  whenever he forgot himself  he had a tendency to hiss .   he also didn t blink much .   the car he was driving was a      black bentley  one owner from new  and that owner had been crowley .  he d looked after it .   the reason he was late was that he was enjoying the twentieth century immensely .  it was much better than the seventeenth  and a lot better than the fourteenth .  one of the nice things about time  crowley always said  was that it was steadily taking him further away from the fourteenth century  the most bloody boring hundred years on god s  excuse his french  earth .  the twentieth century was anything but boring .  in fact  a flashing blue light in his rearview mirror had been telling crowley  for the last fifty seconds  that he was being followed by two men who would like to make it even more interesting for him .   he glanced at his watch  which was designed for the kind of rich deep sea diver who likes to know what the time is in twenty one world capitals while he s down there .   it was custom made for crowley .  getting just one chip custom made is incredibly expensive but he could afford it .  this watch gave the time in twenty world capitals and in a capital city in another place  where it was always one time  and that was too late   the bentley thundered up the exit ramp  took the corner on two wheels  and plunged down a leafy road .  the blue light followed .   crowley sighed  took one hand from the wheel  and  half turning  made a complicated gesture over his shoulder .   the flashing light dimmed into the distance as the police car rolled to a halt  much to the amazement of its occupants .  but it would be nothing to the amazement they d experience when they opened the hood and found out what the engine had turned into .          in the graveyard  hastur  the tall demon  passed a dogend back to ligur  the shorter one and the more accomplished lurker .    i can see a light   he said .   here he comes now  the flash bastard .     what s that he s drivin  .   said ligur .    it s a car .  a horseless carriage   explained hastur .   i expect they didn t have them last time you was here .  not for what you might call general use .     they had a man at the front with a red flag   said ligur .    they ve come on a bit since then  i reckon .     what s this crowley like .   said ligur .   hastur spat .   he s been up here too long   he said .   right from the start .  gone native  if you ask me .  drives a car with a telephone in it .    ligur pondered this .  like most demons  he had a very limited grasp of technology  and so he was just about to say something like  i bet it needs a lot of wire  when the bentley rolled to a halt at the cemetery gate .    and he wears sunglasses   sneered hastur   even when he dunt need to .   he raised his voice .   all hail satan   he said .    all hail satan   ligur echoed .    hi   said crowley  giving them a little wave .   sorry i m late  but you know how it is on the a   at denham  and then i tried to cut up towards chorley wood and then       now we art all here   said hastur meaningfully   we must recount the deeds of the day .     yeah .  deeds   said crowley  with the slightly guilty look of one who is attending church for the first time in years and has forgotten which bits you stand up for .   hastur cleared his throat .    i have tempted a priest   he said .   as he walked down the street and saw the pretty girls in the sun  i put doubt into his mind .  he would have been a saint  but within a decade we shall have him .     nice one   said crowley  helpfully .    i have corrupted a politician   said ligur .   i let him think a tiny bribe would not hurt .  within a year we shall have him .    they both looked expectantly at crowley  who gave them a big smile .    you ll like this   he said .   his smile became even wider and more conspiratorial .    i tied up every portable telephone system in central london for forty five minutes at lunchtime   he said .   there was silence  except for the distant swishing of cars .    yes .   said hastur .   and then what .     look  it wasn t easy   said crowley .    that s all .   said ligur .    look  people       and exactly what has that done to secure souls for our master .   said hastur .   crowley pulled himself together .   what could he tell them .  that twenty thousand people got bloody furious .  that you could hear the arteries clanging shut all across the city .  and that then they went back and took it out on their secretaries or traffic wardens or whatever  and they took it out on other people .  in all kinds of vindictive little ways which  and here was the good bit  they thought up themselves for the rest of the day .  the pass along effects were incalculable .  thousands and thousands of souls all got a faint patina of tarnish  and you hardly had to lift a finger .   but you couldn t tell that to demons like hastur and ligur .  fourteenth century minds  the lot of them .  spending years picking away at one soul .  admittedly it was craftsmanship  but you had to think differently these days .  not big  but wide .  with five billion people in the world you couldn t pick the buggers off one by one any more  you had to spread your effort .  but demons like ligur and hastur wouldn t understand .  they d never have thought up welsh language television  for example .  or valueadded tax .  or manchester .   he d been particularly pleased with manchester .    the powers that be seem to be satisfied   he said .   times are changing .  so what s up .    hastur reached down behind a tombstone .    this is   he said .   crowley stared at the basket .    oh   he said .   no .     yes   said hastur  grinning .    already .     yes .     and  er  it s up to me to    .     yes .   hastur was enjoying this .    why me .   said crowley desperately .   you know me  hastur  this isn t  you know  my scene       oh  it is  it is   said hastur .   your scene .  your starring role .  take it .  times are changing .     yeah   said ligur  grinning .   they re coming to an end  for a start .     why me .     you are obviously highly favored   said hastur maliciously .   i imagine ligur here would give his right arm for a chance like this .     that s right   said ligur .  someone s right arm  anyway  he thought .  there were plenty of right arms around  no sense in wasting a good one .   hastur produced a clipboard from the grubby recesses of his mack .    sign .  here   he said  leaving a terrible pause between the words .   crowley fumbled vaguely in an inside pocket and produced a pen .  it was sleek and matte black .  it looked as though it could exceed the speed limit .    s nice pen   said ligur .    it can write under water   crowley muttered .    whatever will they think of next .   mused ligur .    whatever it is  they d better think of it quickly   said hastur .   no .  not a .  j .  crowley .  your real name .    crowley nodded mournfully  and drew a complex  wiggly sigh on the paper .  it glowed redly in the gloom  just for a moment  and then faded .    what am i supposed to do with it .   he said .    you will receive instructions .   hastur scowled .   why so worried  crowley .  the moment we have been working for all these centuries is at hands .     yeah .  right   said crowley .  he did not look  now  like the lithe figure that had sprung so lithely from the bentley a few minutes ago .  he had a hunted expression .    our moment of eternal triumph awaits .     eternal .  yeah   said crowley .    and you will be a tool of that glorious destiny .     tool .  yeah   muttered crowley .  he picked up the basket as if it might explode .  which  in a manner of speaking  it would shortly do .    er .  okay   he said .   i ll  er  be off then .  shall i .  get it over with .  not that i want to get it over with   he added hurriedly  aware of the things that could happen if hastur turned in an unfavorable report .   but you know me .  keen .    the senior demons did not speak .    so i ll be popping along   crowley babbled .   see you guys ar   see you .  er .  great .  fine .  ciao .    as the bentley skidded off into the darkness ligur said   wossat mean .     it s italian   said hastur .   i think it means  food  .     funny thing to say  then .   ligur stared at the retreating taillights .   you trust him .   he said .    no   said hastur .    right   said ligur .  it d be a funny old world  he reflected  if demons went round trusting one another .          crowley  somewhere west of amersham  hurtled through the night  snatched a tape at random and tried to wrestle it out of its brittle plastic box while staying on the road .  the glare of a headlight proclaimed it to be vivaldi s four seasons .  soothing music  that s what he needed .   he rammed it into the blaupunkt .    ohshitohshitohshit .  why now .  why me .   he muttered  as the familiar strains of queen washed over him .   and suddenly  freddie mercury was speaking to him   because you ve earned it  crowley  crowley blessed under his breath .  using electronics as a means of communication had been his idea and below had  for once  taken it up and  as usual  got it dead wrong .  he d hoped they could be persuaded to subscribe to cellnet  but instead they just cut in to whatever it happened to be that he was listening to at the time and twisted it .   crowley gulped .    thank you very much  lord   he said .   we have great faith in you  crowley   thank you  lord .    this is important  crowley   i know  i know .    this is the big one  crowley   leave it to me  lord .    that is what we are doing  crowley and if it goes wrong  then those involved will suffer greatly .  even you  crowley especially you .    understood  lord .    here are your instructions  crowley  and suddenly he knew .  he hated that .  they could just as easily have told him  they didn t suddenly have to drop chilly knowledge straight into his brain .  he had to drive to a certain hospital .    i ll be there in five minutes  lord  no problem .    good .  i see a little silhouetto of a man scaramouche scaramouche will you do the fandango     crowley thumped the wheel .  everything had been going so well  he d had it really under his thumb these few centuries .  that s how it goes  you think you re on top of the world  and suddenly they spring armageddon on you .  the great war  the last battle .  heaven versus hell  three rounds  one fall  no submission .  and that d be that .  no more world .  that s what the end of the world meant .  no more world .  just endless heaven or  depending who won  endless hell .  crowley didn t know which was worse .   well  hell was worse  of course  by definition .  but crowley remembered what heaven was like  and it had quite a few things in common with hell .  you couldn t get a decent drink in either of them  for a start .  and the boredom you got in heaven was almost as bad as the excitement you got in hell .   but there was no getting out of it .  you couldn t be a demon and have free will .   i will not let you go  let him go      well  at least it wouldn t be this year .  he d have time to do things .  unload long term stocks  for a start .   he wondered what would happen if he just stopped the car here  on this dark and damp and empty road  and took the basket and swung it round and round and let go and     something dreadful  that s what .   he d been an angel once .  he hadn t meant to fall .  he d just hung around with the wrong people .   the bentley plunged on through the darkness  its fuel gauge pointing to zero .  it had pointed to zero for more than sixty years now .  it wasn t all bad  being a demon .  you didn t have to buy petrol  for one thing .  the only time crowley had bought petrol was once in       to get the free james bond bullet hole in the windscreen transfers  which he rather fancied at the time .   on the back seat the thing in the basket began to cry  the air raid siren wail of the newly born .  high .  wordless .  and old .          it was quite a nice hospital  thought mr .  young .  it would have been quiet  too  if it wasn t for the nuns .   he quite liked nuns .  not that he was a  you know  left footer or anything like that .  no  when it came to avoiding going to church  the church he stolidly avoided going to was st .  cecil and all angels  nononsense c .  of e .   and he wouldn t have dreamed of avoiding going to any other .  all the others had the wrong smell   floor polish for the low  somewhat suspicious incense for the high .  deep in the leather armchair of his soul  mr .  young knew that god got embarrassed at that sort of thing .   but he liked seeing nuns around  in the same way that he liked seeing the salvation army .  it made you feel that it was all all right  that people somewhere were keeping the world on its axis .   this was his first experience of the chattering order of saint beryl  however .   saint beryl articulatus of cracow  reputed to have been martyred in the middle of the fifth century .  according to legend  beryl was a young woman who was betrothed against her will to a pagan  prince casimir .  on their wedding night she prayed to the lord to intercede  vaguely expecting a miraculous beard to appear  and she had in fact already laid in a small ivory handled razor  suitable for ladies  against this very eventuality  instead the lord granted beryl the miraculous ability to chatter continually about whatever was on her mind  however inconsequential  without pause for breath or food .   according to one version of the legend  beryl was strangled by prince casimir three weeks after the wedding  with their marriage still unconsummated .  she died a virgin and a martyr  chattering to the end .   according to another version of the legend  casimir bought himself a set of earplugs  and she died in bed  with him  at the age of sixty two .   the chattering order of saint beryl is under a vow to emulate saint beryl at all times  except on tuesday afternoons  for half an hour  when the nuns are permitted to shut up  and  if they wish  to play table tennis .    deirdre had run across them while being involved in one of her causes  possibly the one involving lots of unpleasant south americans fighting other unpleasant south americans and the priests egging them on instead of getting on with proper priestly concerns  like organizing the church cleaning rota .   the point was  nuns should be quiet .  they were the right shape for it  like those pointy things you got in those chambers mr .  young was vaguely aware your hi fi got tested in .  they shouldn t be  well  chattering all the time .   he filled his pipe with tobacco   well  they called it tobacco  it wasn t what he thought of as tobacco  it wasn t the tobacco you used to get   and wondered reflectively what would happen if you asked a nun where the gents was .  probably the pope sent you a sharp note or something .  he shifted his position awkwardly  and glanced at his watch .   one thing  though  at least the nuns had put their foot down about him being present at the birth .  deirdre had been all for it .  she d been reading things again .  one kid already and suddenly she s declaring that this confinement was going to be the most joyous and sharing experience two human beings could have .  that s what came of letting her order her own newspapers .  mr .  young distrusted papers whose inner pages had names like  lifestyle  or  options .    well  he hadn t got anything against joyous sharing experiences .  joyous sharing experiences were fine by him .  the world probably needed more joyous sharing experiences .  but he had made it abundantly clear that this was one joyous sharing experience deirdre could have by herself .   and the nuns had agreed .  they saw no reason for the father to be involved in the proceedings .  when you thought about it  mr .  young mused  they probably saw no reason why the father should be involved anywhere .   he finished thumbing the so called tobacco into the pipe and glared at the little sign on the wall of the waiting room that said that  for his own comfort  he would not smoke .  for his own comfort  he decided  he d go and stand in the porch .  if there was a discreet shrubbery for his own comfort out there  so much the better .   he wandered down the empty corridors and found a doorway that led out onto a rain swept courtyard full of righteous dustbins .   he shivered  and cupped his hands to light his pipe .   it happened to them at a certain age  wives .  twenty five blameless years  then suddenly they were going off and doing these robotic exercises in pink socks with the feet cut out and they started blaming you for never having had to work for a living .  it was hormones  or something .   a large black car skidded to a halt by the dustbins .  a young man in dark glasses leaped out into the drizzle holding what looked like a carrycot and snaked toward the entrance .   mr .  young took his pipe out of his mouth .   you ve left your lights on   he said helpfully .   the man gave him the blank look of someone to whom lights are the least of his worries  and waved a hand vaguely toward the bentley .  the lights went out .    that s handy   said mr .  young .   infra red  is it .    he was mildly surprised to see that the man did not appear to be wet .  and that the carrycot appeared to be occupied .    has it started yet .   said the man .   mr .  young felt vaguely proud to be so instantly recognizable as a parent .    yes   he said .   they made me go out   he added thankfully .    already .  any idea how long we ve got .    we  mr .  young noted .  obviously a doctor with views about co parenting .    i think we were  er  getting on with it   said mr .  young .    what room is she in .   said the man hurriedly .    we re in room three   said mr .  young .  he patted his pockets  and found the battered packet which  in accord with tradition  he had brought with him .    would we care to share a joyous cigar experience .   he said .   but the man had gone .   mr .  young carefully replaced the packet and looked reflectively at his pipe .  always in a rush  these doctors .  working all the hours god sent .          there s a trick they do with one pea and three cups which is very hard to follow  and something like it  for greater stakes than a handful of loose change  is about to take place .   the text will be slowed down to allow the sleight of hand to be followed .   mrs .  deirdre young is giving birth in delivery room three .  she is having a golden haired male baby we will call baby a .   the wife of the american cultural attach    mrs .  harriet bowling  is giving birth in delivery room four .  she is having a golden haired male baby we will call baby b .   sister mary loquacious has been a devout satanist since birth .  she went to sabbat school as a child and won black stars for handwriting and liver .  when she was told to join the chattering order she went obediently  having a natural talent in that direction and  in any case  knowing that she would be among friends .  she would be quite bright  if she was ever put in a position to find out  but long ago found that being a scatterbrain  as she d put it  gave you an easier journey through life .  currently she is being handed a golden haired male baby we will call the adversary  destroyer of kings  angel of the bottomless pit  great beast that is called dragon  prince of this world  father of lies  spawn of satan  and lord of darkness .   watch carefully .  round and round they go      is that him .   said sister mary  staring at the baby .   only i d expected funny eyes .  red  or green .  or teensy weensy little hoofikins .  or a widdle tail .   she turned him around as she spoke .  no horns either .  the devil s child looked ominously normal .    yes  that s him   said crowley .    fancy me holding the antichrist   said sister mary .   and bathing the antichrist .  and counting his little toesy wosies      she was now addressing the child directly  lost in some world of her own .  crowley waved a hand in front of her wimple .   hallo .  hallo .  sister mary .     sorry  sir .  he is a little sweetheart  though .  does he look like his daddy .  i bet he does .  does he look like his daddywaddykins       no   said crowley firmly .   and now i should get up to the delivery rooms  if i were you .     will he remember me when he grows up  do you think .   said sister mary wistfully  sidling slowly down the corridor .    pray that he doesn t   said crowley  and fled .   sister mary headed through the nighttime hospital with the adversary  destroyer of kings  angel of the bottomless pit  great beast that is called dragon  prince of this world  father of lies  spawn of satan  and lord of darkness safely in her arms .  she found a bassinet and laid him down in it .   he gurgled .  she gave him a tickle .   a matronly head appeared around a door .  it said   sister mary  what are you doing here .  shouldn t you be on duty in room four .     master crowley said       just glide along  there s a good nun .  have you seen the husband anywhere .  he s not in the waiting room .     i ve only seen master crowley  and he told me       i m sure he did   said sister grace voluble firmly .   i suppose i d better go and look for the wretched man .  come in and keep an eye on her  will you .  she s a bit woozy but the baby s fine .   sister grace paused .   why are you winking .  is there something wrong with your eye .     you know .   sister mary hissed archly .   the babies .  the exchange       of course  of course .  in good time .  but we can t have the father wandering around  can we .   said sister grace .   no telling what he might see .  so just wait here and mind the baby  there s a dear .    she sailed off down the polished corridor .  sister mary  wheeling her bassinet  entered the delivery room .   mrs .  young was more than woozy .  she was fast asleep  with the look of determined self satisfaction of someone who knows that other people are going to have to do the running around for once .  baby a was asleep beside her  weighed and nametagged .  sister mary  who had been brought up to be helpful  removed the nametag  copied it out  and attach  d the duplicate to the baby in her care .   the babies looked similar  both being small  blotchy  and looking sort of  though not really  like winston churchill .   now  thought sister mary  i could do with a nice cup of tea .   most of the members of the convent were old fashioned satanists  like their parents and grandparents before them .  they d been brought up to it and weren t  when you got right down to it  particularly evil .  human beings mostly aren t .  they just get carried away by new ideas  like dressing up in jackboots and shooting people  or dressing up in white sheets and lynching people  or dressing up in tie dye jeans and playing guitars at people .  offer people a new creed with a costume and their hearts and minds will follow .  anyway  being brought up as a satanist tended to take the edge off it .  it was something you did on saturday nights .  and the rest of the time you simply got on with life as best you could  just like everyone else .  besides  sister mary was a nurse and nurses  whatever their creed  are primarily nurses  which had a lot to do with wearing your watch upside down  keeping calm in emergencies  and dying for a cup of tea .  she hoped someone would come soon  she d done the important bit  now she wanted her tea .   it may help to understand human affairs to be clear that most of the great triumphs and tragedies of history are caused  not by people being fundamentally good or fundamentally bad  but by people being fundamentally people .   there was a knock at the door .  she opened it .    has it happened yet .   asked mr .  young .   i m the father .  the husband .  whatever .  both .    sister mary had expected the american cultural attach   to look like blake carrington or j .  r .  ewing .  mr .  young didn t look like any american she d ever seen on television  except possibly for the avuncular sheriff in the better class of murder mystery .   with a little old lady as the sleuth  and no car chases unless they re done very slowly .   he was something of a disappointment .  she didn t think much of his cardigan  either .   she swallowed her disappointment .   oooh  yes   she said .   congratulations .  your lady wife s asleep  poor pet .    mr .  young looked over her shoulder .   twins .   he said .  he reached for his pipe .  he stopped reaching for his pipe .  he reached for it again .   twins .  no one said anything about twins .     oh  not  said sister mary hurriedly .   this one s yours .  the other one s    er    someone else s .  just looking after him till sister grace gets back .  no   she reiterated  pointing to the adversary  destroyer of kings  angel of the bottomless pit  great beast that is called dragon  prince of this world  father of lies  spawn of satan  and lord of darkness   this one s definitely yours .  from the top of his head to the tips of his hoofywoofies   which he hasn t got   she added hastily .   mr .  young peered down .    ah  yes   he said doubtfully .   he looks like my side of the family .  all  er  present and correct  is he .     oh  yes   said sister mary .   he s a very normal child   she added .   very  very normal .    there was a pause .  they stared at the sleeping baby .    you don t have much of an accent   said sister mary .   have you been over here long .     about ten years   said mr .  young  mildly puzzled .   the job moved  you see  and i had to move with it .     it must be a very exciting job  i ve always thought   said sister mary .  mr .  young looked gratified .  not everyone appreciated the more stimulating aspects of cost accountancy .    i expect it was very different where you were before   sister mary went on .    i suppose so   said mr .  young  who d never really thought about it .  luton  as far as he could remember  was pretty much like tadfield .  the same sort of hedges between your house and the railway station .  the same sort of people .    taller buildings  for one thing   said sister mary  desperately .   mr .  young stared at her .  the only one he could think of was the alliance and leicester offices .    and i expect you go to a lot of garden parties   said the nun .   ah .  he was on firmer ground here .  deirdre was very keen on that sort of thing .    lots   he said  with feeling .   deirdre makes jam for them  you know .  and i normally have to help with the white elephant .    this was an aspect of buckingham palace society that had never occurred to sister mary  although the pachyderm fitted right in .    i expect they re the tribute   she said .   i read where these foreign potentates give her all sorts of things .     i m sorry .     i m a big fan of the royal family  you know .     oh  so am i   said mr .  young  leaping gratefully onto this new ice floe in the bewildering stream of consciousness .  yes  you knew where you were with the royals .  the proper ones  of course  who pulled their weight in the hand waving and bridge opening department .  not the ones who went to discos all night long and were sick all over the paparazzi .   it is possibly worth mentioning at this point that mr .  young thought that paparazzi was a kind of italian linoleum .     that s nice   said sister mary .   i thought you people weren t too keen on them  what with revoluting and throwing all those tea sets into the river .    she chattered on  encouraged by the order s instruction that members should always say what was on their minds .  mr .  young was out of his depth  and too tired now to worry about it very much .  the religious life probably made people a little odd .  he wished mrs .  young would wake up .  then one of the words in sister mary s wittering struck a hopeful chord in his mind .    would there be any possibility of me possibly being able to have a cup of tea  perhaps .   he ventured .    oh my   said sister mary  her hand flying to her mouth   whatever am i thinking of .    mr .  young made no comment .    i ll see to it right away   she said .   are you sure you don t want coffee  though .  there s one of those vendible machines on the next floor .     tea  please   said mr .  young .    my word  you really have gone native  haven t you   said sister mary gaily  as she bustled out .   mr .  young  left alone with one sleeping wife and two sleeping babies  sagged onto a chair .  yes  it must be all that getting up early and kneeling and so on .  good people  of course  but not entirely compost mentis .  he d seen a ken russell film once .  there had been nuns in it .  there didn t seem to be any of that sort of thing going on  but no smoke without fire and so on     he sighed .   it was then that baby a awoke  and settled down to a really good wail .   mr .  young hadn t had to quiet a screaming baby for years .  he d never been much good at it to start with .  he d always respected sir winston churchill  and patting small versions of him on the bottom had always seemed ungracious .    welcome to the world   he said wearily .   you get used to it after a while .    the baby shut its mouth and glared at him as if he were a recalcitrant general .   sister mary chose that moment to come in with the tea .  satanist or not  she d also found a plate and arranged some iced biscuits on it .  they were the sort you only ever get at the bottom of certain teatime assortments .  mr .  young s was the same pink as a surgical appliance  and had a snowman picked out on it in white icing .    i don t expect you normally have these   she said .   they re what you call cookies .  we call them biscults .    mr .  young had just opened his mouth to explain that  yes  so did he  and so did people even in luton  when another nun rushed in  breathless .   she looked at sister mary  realized that mr .  young had never seen the inside of a pentagram  and confined herself to pointing at baby a and winking .   sister mary nodded and winked back .   the nun wheeled the baby out .   as methods of human communication go  a wink is quite versatile .  you can say a lot with a wink .  for example  the new nun s wink said   where the hell have you been .  baby b has been born  we re ready to make the switch  and here s you in the wrong room with the adversary  destroyer of kings  angel of the bottomless pit .  great beast that is called dragon  prince of this world  father of lies  spawn of satan  and lord of darkness  drinking tea .  do you realize i ve nearly been shot .   and  as far as she was concerned  sister mary s answering wink meant   here s the adversary  destroyer of kings  angel of the bottomless pit  great beast that is called dragon  prince of this world  father of lies  spawn of satan  and lord of darkness  and i can t talk now because there s this outsider here .   whereas sister mary  on the other hand  had thought that the orderly s wink was more on the lines of   well done  sister mary switched over the babies all by herself .  now indicate to me the superfluous child and i shall remove it and let you get on with your tea with his royal excellency the american culture .   and therefore her own wink had meant   there you go  dearie  that s baby b  now take him away and leave me to chat to his excellency .  i ve always wanted to ask him why they have those tall buildings with all the mirrors on them .   the subtleties of all this were quite lost on mr .  young  who was extremely embarrassed at all this clandestine affection and was thinking  that mr .  russell  he knew what he was talking about  and no mistake .   sister mary s error might have been noticed by the other nun had not she herself been severely rattled by the secret service men in mrs .  dowling s room  who kept looking at her with growing unease .  this was because they had been trained to react in a certain way to people in long flowing robes and long flowing headdresses  and were currently suffering from a conflict of signals .  humans suffering from a conflict of signals aren t the best people to be holding guns  especially when they ve just witnessed a natural childbirth  which definitely looked an un american way of bringing new citizens into the world .  also  they d heard that there were missals in the building .   mrs .  young stirred .    have you picked a name for him yet .   said sister mary archly .    hmm .   said mr .  young .   oh .  no  not really .  if it was a girl it would have been lucinda after my mother .  or germaine .  that was deirdre s choice .     wormwood s a nice name   said the nun  remembering her classics .   or damien .  damien s very popular .           anathema device   her mother  who was not a great student of religious matters  happened to read the word one day and thought it was a lovely name for a girl   was eight and a half years old  and she was reading the book  under the bedclothes  with a torch .   other children learned to read on basic primers with colored pictures of apples  balls  cockroaches  and so forth .  not the device family .  anathema had learned to read from the book .   it didn t have any apples and balls in it .  it did have a rather good eighteenth century woodcut of agnes nutter being burned at the stake and looking rather cheerful about it .   the first word she could recognize was nice .  very few people at the age of eight and a half know that nice also means  scrupulously exact   but anathema was one of them .   the second word was accurate .   the first sentence she had ever read out loud was    i tell ye thif  and i charge ye with my wordes .  four shalle ryde  and four shalle alfo ryde  and three sharl ryde the skye as twixt  and wonne shal ryde in flames  and theyr shall be no stopping themme  not fish  nor rayne  nor rode  neither deville nor angel .  and ye shalle be theyr alfo  anathema .    anathema liked to read about herself .    there were books which caring parents who read the right sunday papers could purchase with their children s names printed in as the heroine or hero .  this was meant to interest the child in the book .  in anathema s case  it wasn t only her in the book   and it had been spot on so far   but her parents  and her grandparents  and everyone  back to the seventeenth century .  she was too young and too self centered at this point to attach any importance to the fact that there was no mention made of her children  or indeed  any events in her future further away than eleven years  time .  when you re eight and a half  eleven years is a lifetime  and of course  if you believed the book  it would be .    she was a bright child  with a pale face  and black eyes and hair .  as a rule she tended to make people feel uncomfortable  a family trait she had inherited  along with being more psychic than was good for her  from her great great great great great grandmother .   she was precocious  and self possessed .  the only thing about anathema her teachers ever had the nerve to upbraid her for was her spelling  which was not so much appalling as     years too late .          the nuns took baby a and swapped it with baby b under the noses of the attach  s wife and the secret service men  by the cunning expedient of wheeling one baby away   to be weighed  love  got to do that  it s the law   and wheeling another baby back  a little later .   the cultural attach   himself  thaddeus j .  dowling  had been called back to washington in a hurry a few days earlier  but he had been on the phone to mrs .  dowling throughout the birth experience  helping her with her breathing .   it didn t help that he had been talking on the other line to his investment counselor .  at one point he d been forced to put her on hold for twenty minutes .   but that was okay .   having a baby is the single most joyous co experience that two human beings can share  and he wasn t going to miss a second of it .   he d got one of the secret service men to videotape it for him .          evil in general does not sleep  and therefore doesn t see why anyone else should .  but crowley liked sleep  it was one of the pleasures of the world .  especially after a heavy meal .  he d slept right through most of the nineteenth century  for example .  not because he needed to  simply because he enjoyed it .   although he did have to get up in      to go to the lavatory .    one of the pleasures of the world .  well  he d better start really enjoying them now  while there was still time .   the bentley roared through the night  heading east .   of course  he was all in favor of armageddon in general terms .  if anyone had asked him why he d been spending centuries tinkering in the affairs of mankind he d have said   oh  in order to bring about armageddon and the triumph of hell .   but it was one thing to work to bring it about  and quite another for it to actually happen .   crowley had always known that he would be around when the world ended  because he was immortal and wouldn t have any alternative .  but he d hoped it would be a long way off .   because he rather liked people .  it was a major failing in a demon .   oh  he did his best to make their short lives miserable  because that was his job  but nothing he could think up was half as bad as the stuff they thought up themselves .  they seemed to have a talent for it .  it was built into the design  somehow .  they were born into a world that was against them in a thousand little ways  and then devoted most of their energies to making it worse .  over the years crowley had found it increasingly difficult to find anything demonic to do which showed up against the natural background of generalized nastiness .  there had been times  over the past millennium  when he d felt like sending a message back below saying  look  we may as well give up right now  we might as well shut down dis and pandemonium and everywhere and move up here  there s nothing we can do to them that they don t do themselves and they do things we ve never even thought of  often involving electrodes .  they ve got what we lack .  they ve got imagination . and electricity  of course .   one of them had written it  hadn t he     hell is empty  and all the devils are here .    crowley had got a commendation for the spanish inquisition .  he had been in spain then  mainly hanging around cantinas in the nicer parts  and hadn t even known about it until the commendation arrived .  he d gone to have a look  and had come back and got drunk for a week .   that hieronymous bosch .  what a weirdo .   and just when you d think they were more malignant than ever hell could be  they could occasionally show more grace than heaven ever dreamed of .  often the same individual was involved .  it was this free will thing  of course .  it was a bugger .   aziraphale had tried to explain it to him once .  the whole point  he d said   this was somewhere around       when they d first reached their little arrangement   the whole point was that when a human was good or bad it was because they wanted to be .  whereas people like crowley and  of course  himself  were set in their ways right from the start .  people couldn t become truly holy  he said  unless they also had the opportunity to be definitively wicked .   crowley had thought about this for some time and  around about       had said  hang on  that only works  right  if you start everyone off equal  okay .  you can t start someone off in a muddy shack in the middle of a war zone and expect them to do as well as someone born in a castle .   ah  aziraphale had said  that s the good bit .  the lower you start  the more opportunities you have .   crowley had said  that s lunatic .   no  said aziraphale  it s ineffable .   aziraphale .  the enemy  of course .  but an enemy for six thousand years now  which made him a sort of friend .   crowley reached down and picked up the car phone .   being a demon  of course  was supposed to mean you had no free will .  but you couldn t hang around humans for very long without learning a thing or two .          mr .  young had not been too keen on damien  or wormwood .  or any of sister mary loquacious  other suggestions  which had covered half of hell  and most of the golden years of hollywood .    well   she said finally  a little hurt   i don t think there s anything wrong with errol .  or cary .  very nice american names  both of them .     i had fancied something more  well  traditional   explained mr .  young .   we ve always gone in for good simple names in our family .    sister mary beamed .   that s right .  the old names are always the best  if you ask me .     a decent english name  like people had in the bible   said mr .  young .   matthew  mark  luke  or john   he said  speculatively .  sister mary winced .   only they ve never struck me as very good bible names  really   mr .  young added .   they sound more like cowboys and footballers .     saul s nice   said sister mary  making the best of it .    i don t want something too old fashioned   said mr .  young .    or cain .  very modern sound  cain  really   sister mary tried .    hmm .   mr .  young looked doubtful .    or there s always    well  there s always adam   said sister mary .  that should be safe enough  she thought .    adam .   said mr .  young .          it would be nice to think that the satanist nuns had the surplus baby   baby b   discreetly adopted .  that he grew to be a normal  happy  laughing child  active and exuberant  and after that  grew further to become a normal  fairly contented adult .   and perhaps that s what happened .   let your mind dwell on his junior school prize for spelling  his unremarkable although quite pleasant time at university  his job in the payroll department of the tadfield and norton building society  his lovely wife .  possibly you would like to imagine some children  and a hobby   restoring vintage motorcycles  perhaps  or breeding tropical fish .   you don t want to know what could have happened to baby b .   we like your version better  anyway .   he probably wins prizes for his tropical fish .          in a small house in dorking  surrey  a light was on in a bedroom window .   newton pulsifer was twelve  and thin  and bespectacled  and he should have been in bed hours ago .   his mother  though  was convinced of her child s genius  and let him stay up past his bedtime to do his  experiments .    his current experiment was changing a plug on an ancient bakelite radio his mother had given him to play with .  he sat at what he proudly called his  work top   a battered old table covered in curls of wire  batteries  little light bulbs  and a homemade crystal set that had never worked .   he hadn t managed to get the bakelite radio working yet either  but then again  he never seemed able to get that far .   three slightly crooked model airplanes hung on cotton cords from his bedroom ceiling .  even a casual observer could have seen that they were made by someone who was both painstaking and very careful  and also no good at making model airplanes .  he was hopelessly proud of all of them  even the spitfire  where he d made rather a mess of the wings .   he pushed his glasses back up the bridge of his nose  squinted down at the plug  and put down the screwdriver .   he had high hopes for it this time  he had followed all the instructions on plug changing on page five of the boy s own book of practical electronics  including a hundred and one safe and educational things to do with electricity .  he had attached the correct color coded wires to the correct pins  he d checked that it was the right amperage fuse  he d screwed it all back together .  so far  no problems .   he plugged it in to the socket .  then he switched the socket on .   every light in the house went out .   newton beamed with pride .  he was getting better .  last time he d done it he d blacked out the whole of dorking  and a man from the electric had come over and had a word with his mum .   he had a burning and totally unrequited passion for things electrical .  they had a computer at school  and half a dozen studious children stayed on after school doing things with punched cards .  when the teacher in charge of the computer had finally acceded to newton s pleas to be allowed to join them  newton had only ever got to feed one little card into the machine .  it had chewed it up and choked fatally on it .   newton was certain that the future was in computers  and when the future arrived he d be ready  in the forefront of the new technology .   the future had its own ideas on this .  it was all in the book .          adam  thought mr .  young .  he tried saying it  to see how it sounded .   adam .   hmm     he stared down at the golden curls of the adversary  destroyer of kings  angel of the bottomless pit  great beast that is called dragon  prince of this world  father of lies  spawn of satan  and lord of darkness .    you know   he concluded  after a while   i think he actually looks like an adam .           it had not been a dark and stormy night .   the dark and stormy night occurred two days later  about four hours after both mrs .  dowling and mrs .  young and their respective babies had left the building .  it was a particularly dark and stormy night  and just after midnight  as the storm reached its height  a bolt of lightning struck the convent of the chattering order  setting fire to the roof of the vestry .   no one was badly hurt by the fire  but it went on for some hours  doing a fair amount of damage in the process .   the instigator of the fire lurked on a nearby hilltop and watched the blaze .  he was tall  thin  and a duke of hell .  it was the last thing that needed to be done before his return to the nether regions  and he had done it .   he could safely leave the rest to crowley .   hastur went home .          technically aziraphale was a principality  but people made jokes about that these days .   on the whole  neither he nor crowley would have chosen each other s company  but they were both men  or at least men shaped creatures  of the world  and the arrangement had worked to their advantage all this time .  besides  you grew accustomed to the only other face that had been around more or less consistently for six millennia .   the arrangement was very simple  so simple in fact that it didn t really deserve the capital letter  which it had got for simply being in existence for so long .  it was the sort of sensible arrangement that many isolated agents  working in awkward conditions a long way from their superiors  reach with their opposite number when they realize that they have more in common with their immediate opponents than their remote allies .  it meant a tacit non interference in certain of each other s activities .  it made certain that while neither really won  also neither really lost  and both were able to demonstrate to their masters the great strides they were making against a cunning and well informed adversary .   it meant that crowley had been allowed to develop manchester  while aziraphale had a free hand in the whole of shropshire .  crowley took glasgow  aziraphale had edinburgh  neither claimed any responsibility for milton keynes   note for americans and other aliens  milton keynes is a new city approximately halfway between london and birmingham .  it was built to be modern  efficient  healthy  and  all in all  a pleasant place to live .  many britons find this amusing .   but both reported it as a success  .   and then  of course  it had seemed even natural that they should  as it were  hold the fort for one another whenever common sense dictated .  both were of angel stock  after all .  if one was going to hull for a quick temptation  it made sense to nip across the city and carry out a standard brief moment of divine ecstasy .  it d get done anyway  and being sensible about it gave everyone more free time and cut down on expenses .   aziraphale felt the occasional pang of guilt about this  but centuries of association with humanity was having the same effect on him as it was on crowley  except in the other direction .   besides  the authorities didn t seem to care much who did anything  so long as it got done .   currently  what aziraphale was doing was standing with crowley by the duck pond in st .  james  park .  they were feeding the ducks .   the ducks in st .  james  park are so used to being fed bread by secret agents meeting clandestinely that they have developed their own pavlovian reaction .  put a st .  james  park duck in a laboratory cage and show it a picture of two men   one usually wearing a coat with a fur collar  the other something somber with a scarf   and it ll look up expectantly .  the russian cultural attach  s black bread is particularly sought after by the more discerning duck  while the head of m   s soggy hovis with marmite is relished by the connoisseurs .   aziraphale tossed a crust to a scruffy looking drake  which caught it and sank immediately .   the angel turned to crowley .    really  my dear   he murmured .    sorry   said crowley .   i was forgetting myself .   the duck bobbed angrily to the surface .    of course  we knew something was going on   aziraphale said .   but one somehow imagines this sort of thing happening in america .  they go in for that sort of thing over there .     it might yet do  at that   said crowley gloomily .  he gazed thoughtfully across the park to the bentley  the back wheel of which was being industriously clamped .    oh  yes .  the american diplomat   said the angel .   rather showy  one feels .  as if armageddon was some sort of cinematographic show that you wish to sell in as many countries as possible .     every country   said crowley .   the earth and all the kingdoms thereof .    aziraphale tossed the last scrap of bread at the ducks  who went off to pester the bulgarian naval attach   and a furtive looking man in a cambridge tie  and carefully disposed of the paper bag in a wastepaper bin .   he turned and faced crowley .    we ll win  of course   he said .    you don t want that   said the demon .    why not  pray .     listen   said crowley desperately   how many musicians do you think your side have got  eh .  first grade  i mean .    aziraphale looked taken aback .    well  i should think     he began .    two   said crowley .   elgar and liszt .  that s all .  we ve got the rest .  beethoven  brahms  all the bachs  mozart  the lot .  can you imagine eternity with elgar .    aziraphale shut his eyes .   all too easily   he groaned .    that s it  then   said crowley  with a gleam of triumph .  he knew aziraphale s weak spot all right .   no more compact discs .  no more albert hall .  no more proms .  no more glyndbourne .  just celestial harmonies all day long .     ineffable   aziraphale murmured .    like eggs without salt  you said .  which reminds me .  no salt  no eggs .  no gravlax with dill sauce .  no fascinating little restaurants where they know you .  no daily telegraph crossword .  no small antique shops .  no bookshops  either .  no interesting old editions .  no    crowley scraped the bottom of aziraphale s barrel of interests    regency silver snuffboxes       but after we win life will be better .   croaked the angel .    but it won t be as interesting .  look  you know i m right .  you d be as happy with a harp as i d be with a pitchfork .     you know we don t play harps .     and we don t use pitchforks .  i was being rhetorical .    they stared at one another .   aziraphale spread his elegantly manicured hands .    my people are more than happy for it to happen  you know .  it s what it s all about  you see .  the great final test .  flaming swords  the four horsemen  seas of blood  the whole tedious business .   he shrugged .    and then game over  insert coin .   said crowley .    sometimes i find your methods of expression a little difficult to follow .     i like the seas as they are .  it doesn t have to happen .  you don t have to test everything to destruction just to see if you made it right .    aziraphale shrugged again .    that s ineffable wisdom for you  i m afraid .   the angel shuddered  and pulled his coat around him .  gray clouds were piling up over the city .    let s go somewhere warm   he said .    you re asking me .   said crowley glumly .   they walked in somber silence for a while .    it s not that i disagree with you   said the angel  as they plodded across the grass .   it s just that i m not allowed to disobey .  you know that .     me too   said crowley .   aziraphale gave him a sidelong glance .   oh  come now   he said   you re a demon  after all .     yeah .  but my people are only in favor of disobedience in general terms .  it s specific disobedience they come down on heavily .     such as disobedience to themselves .     you ve got it .  you d be amazed .  or perhaps you wouldn t be .  how long do you think we ve got .   crowley waved a hand at the bentley  which unlocked its doors .    the prophecies differ   said aziraphale  sliding into the passenger seat .   certainly until the end of the century  although we may expect certain phenomena before then .  most of the prophets of the past millennium were more concerned with scansion than accuracy .    crowley pointed to the ignition key .  it turned .    what .   he said .    you know   said the angel helpfully    and thee worlde unto an ende shall come  in tumpty tumpty tumpty one .   or two  or three  or whatever .  there aren t many good rhymes for six  so it s probably a good year to be in .     and what sort of phenomena .     two headed calves  signs in the sky  geese flying backwards  showers of fish .  that sort of thing .  the presence of the antichrist affects the natural operation of causality .     hmm .    crowley put the bentley in gear .  then he remembered something .  he snapped his fingers .   the wheel clamps disappeared .    let s have lunch   he said .   i owe you one from  when was it       paris         said aziraphale .    oh  yes .  the reign of terror .  was that one of yours  or one of ours .     wasn t it yours .     can t recall .  it was quite a good restaurant  though .    as they drove past an astonished traffic warden his notebook spontaneously combusted  to crowley s amazement .    i m pretty certain i didn t mean to do that   he said .   aziraphale blushed .    that was me   he said .   i had always thought that your people invented them .     did you .  we thought they were yours .    crowley stared at the smoke in the rearview mirror .    come on   he said .   let s do the ritz .    crowley had not bothered to book .  in his world  table reservations were things that happened to other people .          aziraphale collected books .  if he were totally honest with himself he would have to have admitted that his bookshop was simply somewhere to store them .  he was not unusual in this .  in order to maintain his cover as a typical second hand book seller  he used every means short of actual physical violence to prevent customers from making a purchase .  unpleasant damp smells  glowering looks  erratic opening hours   he was incredibly good at it .   he had been collecting for a long time  and  like all collectors  he specialized .   he had more than sixty books of predictions concerning developments in the last handful of centuries of the second millennium .  he had a penchant for wilde first editions .  and he had a complete set of the infamous bibles  individually named from error s in typesetting .   these bibles included the unrighteous bible  so called from a printer s error which caused it to proclaim  in i corinthians   know ye not that the unrighteous shall inherit the kingdom of god .    and the wicked bible  printed by barker and lucas in       in which the word not was omitted from the seventh commandment   making it  thou shaft commit adultery .   there were the discharge bible  the treacle bible  the standing fishes bible  the charing cross bible and the rest .  aziraphale had them all .  even the very rarest  a bible published in      by the london publishing firm of bilton and scaggs .   it had been the first of their three great publishing disasters .   the book was commonly known as the buggre alle this bible .  the lengthy compositor s error  if such it may be called  occurs in the book of ezekiel  chapter     verse five .         .  and bye the border of dan  from rne the east side to the west side  a portion for afher .     .  and bye the border of afher  fromme the east side even untoe the west side  a portion for naphtali .     .  and bye the border of naphtali from the east side untoe the west side  a portion for manaff  eh .     .  buggre alle this for a larke i amme sick to mye hart of typefettinge .  master biltonn if no gentelmann  and master scagges noe more than a tighte fisted southwarke knobbefticke .  i telle you  onne a daye laike thif ennywone withe half an oz of sense shoulde bee oute in the sunneshain  ane nott stucke here alle the liuelong dale inn thif mowldey olde by our lady workefhoppe .     .  and bye the border of ephraim  from the east fide even untoe the west fide  a portion for reuben .        the buggre alle this bible was also noteworthy for having twenty seven verses in the third chapter of genesis  instead of the more usual twenty four .   they followed verse     which in the king james version reads        so he drove out the man  and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims  and a flaming sword which turned every way  to keep the way of the tree of life        and read          .  and the lord spake unto the angel that guarded the eastern gate  saying where is the flaming sword which was given unto thee .      .  and the angel said  i had it here only a moment ago  i must have put it down some where  forget my own head next .      .  and the lord did not ask him again .       it appears that these verses were inserted during the proof stage .  in those days it was common practice for printers to hang proof sheets to the wooden beams outside their shops  for the edification of the populace and some free proofreading  and since the whole print run was subsequently burned anyway  no one bothered to take up this matter with the nice mr .  a .  ziraphale  who ran the bookshop two doors along and was always so helpful with the translations  and whose handwriting was instantly recognizable .    bilton and scaggs  second great publishing disaster occurred in      .  by a stroke of rare good fortune they had obtained one of the famed   lost quartos    the three shakespeare plays never reissued in folio edition  and now totally lost to scholars and playgoers .  only their names have come down to us .  this one was shakespeare s earliest play  the comedie of robin hoode  or  the forest of sherwoode .   the other two are the trapping of the mouse  and golde diggers of      .    master bilton had paid almost six guineas for the quarto  and believed he could make nearly twice that much back on the hardcover folio alone .   then he lost it .   bilton and scaggs  third great publishing disaster was never entirely comprehensible to either of them .  everywhere you looked  books of prophecy were selling like crazy .  the english edition of nostradamus  centuries had just gone into its third printing  and five nostradamuses  all claiming to be the only genuine one  were on triumphant signing tours .  and mother shipton s collection of prophecies was sprinting out of the shops .   each of the great london publishers   there were eight of them had at least one book of prophecy on its list .  every single one of the books was wildly inaccurate  but their air of vague and generalized omnipotence made them immensely popular .  they sold in the thousands  and in the tens of thousands .    it is a licence to printe monney .   said master bilton to master scaggs .   who had already had a few thoughts in that direction  and spent the last years of his life in newgate prison when he eventually put them into practice .    the public are crying out for such rubbishe .  we must straightway printe a booke of prophecie by some hagge .    the manuscript arrived at their door the next morning  the author s sense of timing  as always  was exact .   although neither master bilton nor master scaggs realized it  the manuscript they had been sent was the sole prophetic work in all of human history to consist entirely of completely correct predictions concerning the following three hundred and forty odd years  being a precise and accurate description of the events that would culminate in armageddon .  it was on the money in every single detail .   it was published by bilton and scaggs in september       in good time for the christmas trade   another master stroke of publishing genius  because oliver cromwell s puritan parliament had made christmas illegal in      .   and it was the first book printed in england to be remaindered .   it didn t sell .   not even the copy in the tiny lancashire shop with  locale author  on a piece of cardboard next to it .   the author of the book  one agnes nutter  was not surprised by this  but then  it would have taken an awful lot to surprise agnes nutter .   anyway  she had not written it for the sales  or the royalties  or even for the fame .  she had written it for the single gratis copy of the book that an author was entitled to .   no one knows what happened to the legions of unsold copies of her book .  certainly none remain in any museums or private collections .  even aziraphale does not possess a copy  but would go weak at the knees at the thought of actually getting his exquisitely manicured hands on one .   in fact  only one copy of agnes nutter s prophecies remained in the entire world .   it was on a bookshelf about forty miles away from where crowley and aziraphale were enjoying a rather good lunch and  metaphorically  it had just begun to tick .          and now it was three o clock .  the antichrist had been on earth for fifteen hours  and one angel and one demon had been drinking solidly for three of them .   they sat opposite one another in the back room of aziraphale s dingy old bookshop in soho .   most bookshops in soho have back rooms  and most of the back rooms are filled with rare  or at least very expensive  books .  but aziraphale s books didn t have illustrations .  they had old brown covers and crackling pages .  occasionally  if he had no alternative  he d sell one .   and  occasionally  serious men in dark suits would come calling and suggest  very politely  that perhaps he d like to sell the shop itself so that it could be turned into the kind of retail outlet more suited to the area .  sometimes they d offer cash  in large rolls of grubby fifty pound notes .  or  sometimes  while they were talking  other men in dark glasses would wander around the shop shaking their heads and saying how inflammable paper was  and what a fire trap he had here .   and aziraphale would nod and smile and say that he d think about it .  and then they d go away .  and they d never come back  just because you re an angel doesn t mean you have to be a fool .   the table in front of the two of them was covered with bottles .    the point is   said crowley   the point is .  the point is .   he tried to focus on aziraphale .    the point is   he said  and tried to think of a point .    the point i m trying to make   he said  brightening   is the dolphins .  that s my point .     kind of fish   said aziraphale .    nononono   said crowley  shaking a finger .    s mammal .  your actual mammal .  difference is     crowley waded through the swamp of his mind and tried to remember the difference .   difference is  they       mate out of water .   volunteered aziraphale .   crowley s brow furrowed .   don t think so .  pretty sure that s not it .  something about their young .  whatever .   he pulled himself together .   the point is .  the point is .  their brains .    he reached for a bottle .    what about their brains .   said the angel .    big brains .  that s my point .  size of .  size of .  size of damn big brains .  and then there s the whales .  brain city  take it from me .  whole damn sea full of brains .     kraken   said aziraphale  staring moodily into his glass .   crowley gave him the long cool look of someone who has just had a girder dropped in front of his train of thought .    uh .     great big bugger   said aziraphale .   sleepeth beneath the thunders of the upper deep .  under loads of huge and unnumbered polypol polipo bloody great seaweeds  you know .  supposed to rise to the surface right at the end  when the sea boils .     yeah .     fact .     there you are  then   said crowley  sitting back .   whole sea bubbling  poor old dolphins so much seafood gumbo  no one giving a damn .  same with gorillas .  whoops  they say  sky gone all red  stars crashing to ground  what they putting in the bananas these days .  and then       they make nests  you know  gorillas   said the angel  pouring another drink and managing to hit the glass on the third go .    nah .     god s truth .  saw a film .  nests .     that s birds   said crowley .    nests   insisted aziraphale .   crowley decided not to argue the point .    there you are then   he said .   all creatures great and smoke .  i mean small .  great and small .  lot of them with brains .  and then  bazamm .     but you re part of it   said aziraphale .   you tempt people .  you re good at it .    crowley thumped his glass on the table .   that s different .  they don t have to say yes .  that the ineffable bit  right .  your side made it up .  you ve got to keep testing people .  but not to destruction .     all right .  all right .  i don t like it any more than you  but i told you .  i can t disod disoy not do what i m told .   m a nangel .     there s no theaters in heaven   said crowley .   and very few films .     don t you try to tempt me   said aziraphale wretchedly .   i know you  you old serpent .     just you think about it   said crowley relentlessly .   you know what eternity is .  you know what eternity is .  i mean  d you know what eternity is .  there s this big mountain  see  a mile high  at the end of the universe  and once every thousand years there s this little bird       what little bird .   said aziraphale suspiciously .    this little bird i m talking about .  and every thousand years       the same bird every thousand years .    crowley hesitated .   yeah   he said .    bloody ancient bird  then .     okay .  and every thousand years this bird flies          limps       flies all the way to this mountain and sharpens its beak       hold on .  you can t do that .  between here and the end of the universe there s loads of     the angel waved a hand expansively  if a little unsteadily .   loads of buggerall  dear boy .     but it gets there anyway   crowley persevered .    how .     it doesn t matter .     it could use a space ship   said the angel .   crowley subsided a bit .   yeah   he said .   if you like .  anyway  this bird       only it is the end of the universe we re talking about   said aziraphale .   so it d have to be one of those space ships where your descendants are the ones who get out at the other end .  you have to tell your descendants  you say  when you get to the mountain  you ve got to     he hesitated .   what have they got to do .     sharpen its beak on the mountain   said crowley .   and then it flies back          in the space ship       and after a thousand years it goes and does it all again   said crowley quickly .   there was a moment of drunken silence .    seems a lot of effort just to sharpen a beak   mused aziraphale .    listen   said crowley urgently   the point is that when the bird has worn the mountain down to nothing  right  then      aziraphale opened his mouth .  crowley just knew he was going to make some point about the relative hardness of birds  beaks and granite mountains  and plunged on quickly .       then you still won t have finished watching the sound of music .    aziraphale froze .    and you ll enjoy it   crowley said relentlessly .   you really will .     my dear boy       you won t have a choice .     listen       heaven has no taste .     now       and not one single sushi restaurant .    a look of pain crossed the angel s suddenly very serious face .    i can t cope with this while  m drunk   he said .   i m going to sober up .     me too .    they both winced as the alcohol left their bloodstreams  and sat up a bit more neatly .  aziraphale straightened his tie .    i can t interfere with divine plans   he croaked .   crowley looked speculatively into his glass  and then filled it again .   what about diabolical ones .   he said .    pardon .     well  it s got to be a diabolical plan  hasn t it .  we re doing it .  my side .     ah  but it s all part of the overall divine plan   said aziraphale .   your side can t do anything without it being part of the ineffable divine plan   he added  with a trace of smugness .    you wish .     no  that s the     aziraphale snapped his finger irritably .   the thing .  what d you call it in your colorful idiom .  the line at the bottom .     the bottom line .     yes .  it s that .     well    if you re sure     said crowley .    no doubt about it .    crowley looked up slyly .    then you can t be certain  correct me if i m wrong  you can t be certain that thwarting it isn t part of the divine plan too .  i mean  you re supposed to thwart the wiles of the evil one at every turn  aren t you .    aziraphale hesitated .    there is that  yes .     you see a wile  you thwart .  am i right .     broadly  broadly .  actually i encourage humans to do the actual thwarting .  because of ineffability  you understand .     right .  right .  so all you ve got to do is thwart .  because if i know anything   said crowley urgently   it s that the birth is just the start .  it s the upbringing that s important .  it s the influences .  otherwise the child will never learn to use its powers .   he hesitated .   at least  not necessarily as intended .     certainly our side won t mind me thwarting you   said aziraphale thoughtfully .   they won t mind that at all .     right .  it d be a real feather in your wing .   crowley gave the angel an encouraging smile .    what will happen to the child if it doesn t get a satanic upbringing  though .   said aziraphale .    probably nothing .  it ll never know .     but genetics       don t tell me from genetics .  what ve they got to do with it .   said crowley .   look at satan .  created as an angel  grows up to be the great adversary .  hey  if you re going to go on about genetics  you might as well say the kid will grow up to be an angel .  after all  his father was really big in heaven in the old days .  saying he ll grow up to be a demon just because his dad became one is like saying a mouse with its tail cut off will give birth to tailless mice .  no .  upbringing is everything .  take it from me .     and without unopposed satanic influences       well  at worst hell will have to start all over again .  and the earth gets at least another eleven years .  that s got to be worth something  hasn t it .    now aziraphale was looking thoughtful again .    you re saying the child isn t evil of itself .   he said slowly .    potentially evil .  potentially good  too  i suppose .  just this huge powerful potentiality  waiting to be shaped   said crowley .  he shrugged .   anyway  why re we talking about this good and evil .  they re just names for sides .  we know that .     i suppose it s got to be worth a try   said the angel .  crowley nodded encouragingly .    agreed .   said the demon  holding out his hand .   the angel shook it  cautiously .    it ll certainly be more interesting than saints   he said .    and it ll be for the child s own good  in the long run   said crowley .   we ll be godfathers  sort of .  overseeing his religious upbringing  you might say .    aziraphale beamed .    you know  i d never have thought of that   he said .   godfathers .  well  i ll be damned .     it s not too bad   said crowley   when you get used to it .           she was known as scarlett .  at that time she was selling arms  although it was beginning to lose its savor .  she never stuck at one job for very long .  three  four hundred years at the outside .  you didn t want to get in a rut .   her hair was true auburn  neither ginger nor brown  but deep and burnished copper color  and it fell to her waist in tresses that men would kill for  and indeed often had .  her eyes were a startling orange .  she looked twenty five  and always had .   she had a dusty  brick red truck full of assorted weaponry  and an almost unbelievable skill at getting it across any border in the world .  she had been on her way to a small west african country  where a minor civil war was in progress  to make a delivery which would  with any luck  turn it into a major civil war .  unfortunately the truck had broken down  far beyond even her ability to repair it .   and she was very good with machinery these days .   she was in the middle of a city  nominally a city .  it was the size of an english county town  or  translated into american terms  a shopping mall .   at the time .  the city in question was the capital of kumbolaland  an african nation which had been at peace for the last three thousand years .  for about thirty years it was sir humphrey clarksonland  but since the country had absolutely no mineral wealth and the strategic importance of a banana  it was accelerated toward self government with almost unseemly haste .  kumbolaland was poor  perhaps  and undoubtedly boring  but peaceful .  its various tribes  who got along with one another quite happily  had long since beaten their swords into ploughshares  a fight had broken out in the city square in      between a drunken ox drover and an equally drunken ox thief .  people were still talking about it .   scarlett yawned in the heat .  she fanned her head with her broadbrimmed hat  left the useless truck in the dusty street  and wandered into a bar .   she bought a can of beer  drained it  then grinned at the barman .   i got a truck needs repairing   she said .   anyone around i can talk to .    the barman grinned white and huge and expansively .  he d been impressed by the way she drank her beer .   only nathan  miss .  but nathan has gone back to kaounda to see his father in law s farm .    scarlett bought another beer .   so  this nathan .  any idea when he ll be back .     perhaps next week .  perhaps two weeks  time  dear lady .  ho  that nathan  he is a scamp  no .    he leaned forward .    you travelling alone  miss .   he said .    yes .     could be dangerous .  some funny people on the roads these days .  bad men .  not local boys   he added quickly .   scarlett raised a perfect eyebrow .   despite the heat  he shivered .    thanks for the warning   scarlett purred .  her voice sounded like something that lurks in the long grass  visible only by the twitching of its ears  until something young and tender wobbles by .   she tipped her hat to him  and strolled outside .   the hot african sun beat down on her  her truck sat in the street with a cargo of guns and ammunition and land mines .  it wasn t going anywhere .   scarlett stared at the truck .   a vulture was sitting on its roof .  it had traveled three hundred miles with scarlett so far .  it was belching quietly .   she looked around the street  a couple of women chatted on a street corner  a bored market vendor sat in front of a heap of colored gourds  fanning the flies  a few children played lazily in the dust .    what the hell   she said quietly .   i could do with a holiday anyway .    that was wednesday .   by friday the city was a no go area .   by the following tuesday the economy of kumbolaland was shattered  twenty thousand people were dead  including the barman  shot by the rebels while storming the market barricades   almost a hundred thousand people were injured  all of scarlett s assorted weapons had fulfilled the function for which they had been created  and the vulture had died of greasy degeneration .   scarlett was already on the last train out of the country .  it was time to move on  she felt .  she d been doing arms for too damn long .  she wanted a change .  something with openings .  she quite fancied herself as a newspaper journalist .  a possibility .  she fanned herself with her hat  and crossed her long legs in front of her .   farther down the train a fight broke out .  scarlett grinned .  people were always fighting  over her  and around her  it was rather sweet  really .          sable had black hair  a trim black beard  and he had just decided to go corporate .   he did drinks with his accountant .    how we doing  frannie .   he asked her .    twelve million copies sold so far .  can you believe that .    they were doing drinks in a restaurant called top of the sixes  on the top of     fifth avenue  new york .  this was something that amused sable ever so slightly .  from the restaurant windows you could see the whole of new york  at night  the rest of new york could see the huge red    s that adorned all four sides of the building .  of course  it was just another street number .  if you started counting  you d be bound to get to it eventually .  but you had to smile .   sable and his accountant had just come from a small  expensive  and particularly exclusive restaurant in greenwich village  where the cuisine was entirely nouvelle  a string bean  a pea  and a sliver of chicken breast  aesthetically arranged on a square china plate .   sable had invented it the last time he d been in paris .   his accountant had polished her meat and two veg off in under fifty seconds  and had spent the rest of the meal staring at the plate  the cutlery  and from time to time at her fellow diners  in a manner that suggested that she was wondering what they d taste like  which was in fact the case .  it had amused sable enormously .   he toyed with his perrier .    twelve million  huh .  that s pretty good .     that s great .     so we re going corporate .  it s time to blow the big one  am i right .  california  i think .  i want factories  restaurants  the whole schmear .  we ll keep the publishing arm  but it s time to diversify .  yeah .    frannie nodded .   sounds good  sable .  we ll need      she was interrupted by a skeleton .  a skeleton in a dior dress  with tanned skin stretched almost to snapping point over the delicate bones of the skull .  the skeleton had long blond hair and perfectly made up lips  she looked like the person mothers around the world would point to  muttering   that s what ll happen to you if you don t eat your greens   she looked like a famine relief poster with style .   she was new york s top fashion model  and she was holding a book .  she said   uh  excuse me  mr .  sable  i hope you don t mind me intruding  but  your book  it changed my life  i was wondering  would you mind signing it for me .   she stared imploringly at him with eyes deepsunk in gloriously eyeshadowed sockets .   sable nodded graciously  and took the book from her .   it was not surprising that she had recognized him  for his dark gray eyes stared out from his photo on the foil embossed cover .  foodless dieting  slim yourself beautiful  the book was called  the diet book of the century .    how do you spell your name .   he asked .    sherryl .  two rs  one y  one l .     you remind me of an old  old friend   he told her  as he wrote swiftly and carefully on the title page .   there you go .  glad you liked it .  always good to meet a fan .    what he d written was this   sherryl  a measure of wheat for a penny  and three measures of barley for a penny  and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine rev .      .   dr .  raven sable .    it s from the bible   he told her .   she closed the book reverently and backed away from the table  thanking sable  he didn t know how much this meant to her  he had changed her life  truly he had     he had never actually earned the medical degree he claimed  since there hadn t been any universities in those days  but sable could see she was starving to death .  he gave her a couple of months at the outside .  handle your weight problem  terminally .   frannie was stabbing at her laptop computer hungrily  planning the next phase in sable s transformation of the eating habits of the western world .  sable had bought her the machine as a personal present .  it was very  very expensive  very powerful  and ultra slim .  he liked slim things .    there s a european outfit we can buy into for the initial toehold   holdings  holdings  incorporated .  that ll give us the liechtenstein tax base .  now  if we channel funds out through the caymans  into luxembourg  and from there to switzerland  we could pay for the factories in      but sable was no longer listening .  he was remembering the exclusive little restaurant .  it had occurred to him that he had never seen so many rich people so hungry .   sable grinned  the honest  open grin that goes with job satisfaction  perfect and pure .  he was just killing time until the main event  but he was killing it in such exquisite ways .  time  and sometimes people .          sometimes he was called white  or blanc  or albus  or chalky  or weiss  or snowy  or any one of a hundred other names .  his skin was pale  his hair a faded blond  his eyes light gray .  he was somewhere in his twenties at a casual glance  and a casual glance was all anyone ever gave him .   he was almost entirely unmemorable .   unlike his two colleagues  he could never settle down in any one job for very long .   he had had all manner of interesting jobs in lots of interesting places .    he had worked at the chernobyl power station  and at windscale  and at three mile island  always in minor jobs that weren t very important .    he had been a minor but valued member of a number of scientific research establishments .    he had helped to design the petrol engine  and plastics  and the ring pull can .    he could turn his hand to anything .   nobody really noticed him .  he was unobtrusive  his presence was cumulative .  if you thought about it carefully  you could figure out he had to have been doing something  had to have been somewhere .  maybe he even spoke to you .  but he was easy to forget  was mr .  white .   at this time he was working as deckhand on an oil tanker  heading toward tokyo .   the captain was drunk in his cabin .  the first mate was in the head .  the second mate was in the galley .  that was pretty much it for the crew  the ship was almost completely automated .  there wasn t much a person could do .   however  if a person just happened to press the emergency cargo release switch on the bridge  the automatic systems would take care of releasing huge quantities of black sludge into the sea  millions of tons of crude oil  with devastating effect on the birds  fish  vegetation  animals  and humans of the region .  of course  there were dozens of failsafe interlocks and foolproof safety backups but  what the hell  there always were .   afterwards  there was a huge amount of argument as to exactly whose fault it was .  in the end it was left unresolved  the blame was apportioned equally .  neither the captain  the first mate  nor the second mate ever worked again .   for some reason nobody gave much of a thought to seaman white  who was already halfway to indonesia on a tramp steamer piled high with rusting metal barrels of a particularly toxic weedkiller .          and there was another .  he was in the square in kumbolaland .  and he was in the restaurants .  and he was in the fish  and in the air  and in the barrels of weedkiller .  he was on the roads  and in houses  and in palaces  and in hovels .   there was nowhere that he was a stranger  and there was no getting away from him .  he was doing what he did best  and what he was doing was what he was .   he was not waiting .  he was working .          harriet dowling returned home with her baby  which  on the advice of sister faith prolix  who was more persuasive than sister mary  and with the telephonic agreement of her husband  she had named warlock .   the cultural attach   returned home a week later  and pronounced the baby the spit of his side of the family .  he also had his secretary advertise in the lady for a nanny .   crowley had seen mary poppins on television one christmas  indeed  behind the scenes  crowley had had a hand in most television  although it was on the invention of the game show that he truly prided himself  .  he toyed with the idea of a hurricane as an effective and incredibly stylish way of disposing of the queue of nannies that would certainly form  or possible stack up in a holding pattern  outside the cultural attache s regent s park residence .   he contented himself with a wildcat tube strike  and when the day came  only one nanny turned up .   she wore a knit tweed suit and discreet pearl earrings .  something about her might have said nanny  but it said it in an undertone of the sort employed by british butlers in a certain type of american film .  it also coughed discreetly and muttered that she could well be the sort of nanny who advertises unspecified but strangely explicit services in certain magazines .   her flat shoes crunched up the gravel drive  and a gray dog padded silently by her side  white flecks of saliva dripping from its jaw .  its eyes glinted scarlet  and it glanced from side to side hungrily .   she reached the heavy wooden door  smiled to herself  a brief satisfied flicker  and rang the bell .  it donged gloomily .   the door was opened by a butler  as they say  of the old school .   a night school just off the tottenham court road  run by an elderly actor who had played butlers and gentlemen s gentlemen in films and television and on the stage since the     s .     i am nanny ashtoreth   she told him .   and this   she continued  while the gray dog at her side eyed the butler carefully  working out  perhaps  where it would bury the bones   is rover .    she left the dog in the garden  and passed her interview with flying colors  and mrs .  dowling led the nanny to see her new charge .   she smiled unpleasantly .   what a delightful child   she said .   he ll be wanting a little tricycle soon .    by one of those coincidences  another new member of staff arrived the same afternoon .  he was the gardener  and as it turned out he was amazingly good at his job .  no one quite worked out why this should be the case  since he never seemed to pick up a shovel and made no effort to rid the garden of the sudden flocks of birds that filled it and settled all over him at every opportunity .  he just sat in the shade while around him the residence gardens bloomed and bloomed .   warlock used to come down to see him  when he was old enough to toddle and nanny was doing whatever it was she did on her afternoons off .    this here s brother slug   the gardener would tell him   and this tiny little critter is sister potato weevil .  remember  warlock  as you walk your way through the highways and byways of life s rich and fulsome path  to have love and reverence for all living things .     nanny says that wivving fings is fit onwy to be gwound under my heels  mr .  fwancis   said little warlock  stroking brother slug  and then wiping his hand conscientiously on his kermit the frog overall .    you don t listen to that woman   francis would say .   you listen to me .    at night  nanny ashtoreth sang nursery rhymes to warlock .       oh  the grand old duke of york  he had ten thousand men  he marched them up to the top of the hill  and crushed all the nations of the world and brought them  under the rule of satan our master .       this little piggy went to hades  this little piggy stayed home  this little piggy ate raw and steaming human flesh  this little piggy violated virgins  and this little piggy clambered over a heap of dead bodies to  get to the top .        bwuvver fwancis the gardener says that i mus  selfwesswy pwactice virtue an  wuv to all wivving fings   said warlock .    you don t listen to that man  darling   the nanny would whisper  as she tucked him into his little bed .   you listen to me .    and so it went .   the arrangement worked perfectly .  a no score win .  nanny ashtoreth bought the child a little tricycle  but could never persuade him to ride it inside the house .  and he was scared of rover .   in the background crowley and aziraphale met on the tops of buses  and in art galleries  and at concerts  compared notes  and smiled .   when warlock was six  his nanny left  taking rover with her  the gardener handed in his resignation on the same day .  neither of them left with quite the same spring in their step with which they d arrived .   warlock now found himself being educated by two tutors .   mr .  harrison taught him about attila the hun  vlad drakul  and the darkness intrinsicate in the human spirit .   he avoided mentioning that attila was nice to his mother  or that vlad drakul was punctilious about saying his prayers every day .   he tried to teach warlock how to make rabble rousing political speeches to sway the hearts and minds of multitudes .   mr .  cortese taught him about florence nightingale   except for the bits about syphilis .  abraham lincoln  and the appreciation of art .  he tried to teach him about free will  self denial  and doing unto others as you would wish them to do to you .   they both read to the child extensively from the book of revelation .   despite their best efforts warlock showed a regrettable tendency to be good at maths .  neither of his tutors was entirely satisfied with his progress .   when warlock was ten he liked baseball  he liked plastic toys that transformed into other plastic toys indistinguishable from the first set of plastic toys except to the trained eye  he liked his stamp collection  he liked banana flavor bubble gum  he liked comics and cartoons and his b . m . x .  bike .   crowley was troubled .   they were in the cafeteria of the british museum  another refuge for all weary foot soldiers of the cold war .  at the table to their left two ramrod straight americans in suits were surreptitiously handing over a briefcase full of deniable dollars to a small dark woman in sunglasses  at the table on their right the deputy head of m   and the local kgb section officer argued over who got to keep the receipt for the tea and buns .   crowley finally said what he had not even dared to think for the last decade .    if you ask me   crowley said to his counterpart   he s too bloody normal .    aziraphale popped another deviled egg into his mouth  and washed it down with coffee .  he dabbed his lips with a paper napkin .    it s my good influence   he beamed .   or rather  credit where credit s due  that of my little team .    crowley shook his head .   i m taking that into account .  look   by now he should be trying to warp the world around him to his own desires  shaping it in his own image  that kind of stuff .  well  not actually trying .  he ll do it without even knowing it .  have you seen any evidence of that happening .     well  no  but       by now he should be a powerhouse of raw force .  is he .     well  not as far as i ve noticed  but       he s too normal .   crowley drummed his fingers on the table .   i don t like it .  there s something wrong .  i just can t put my finger on it .    aziraphale helped himself to crowley s slice of angel cake .   well  he s a growing boy .  and  of course  there s been the heavenly influence in his life .    crowley sighed .   i just hope he ll know how to cope with the hellhound  that s all .    aziraphale raised one eyebrow .   hell hound .     on his eleventh birthday .  i received a message from hell last night .   the message had come during  the golden girls   one of crowley s favorite television programs .  rose had taken ten minutes to deliver what could have been quite a brief communication  and by the time noninfernal service was restored crowley had quite lost the thread of the plot .   they re sending him a hell hound  to pad by his side and guard him from all harm .  biggest one they ve got .     won t people remark on the sudden appearance of a huge black dog .  his parents  for a start .    crowley stood up suddenly  treading on the foot of a bulgarian cultural attach    who was talking animatedly to the keeper of her majesty s antiques .   nobody s going to notice anything out of the ordinary .  it s reality  angel .  and young warlock can do what he wants to that  whether he knows it or not .     when does it turn up  then .  this dog .  does it have a name .     i told you .  on his eleventh birthday .  at three o clock in the afternoon .  it ll sort of home in on him .  he s supposed to name it himself .  it s very important that he names it himself .  it gives it its purpose .  it ll be killer  or terror  or stalks by night  i expect .     are you going to be there .   asked the angel  nonchalantly .    wouldn t miss it for the worlds   said crowley .   i do hope there s nothing too wrong with the child .  we ll see how he reacts to the dog  anyway .  that should tell us something .  i hope he ll send it back  or be frightened of it .  if he does name it  we ve lost .  he ll have all his powers and armageddon is just around the corner .     i think   said aziraphale  sipping his wine  which had just ceased to be a slightly vinegary beaujolais  and had become a quite acceptable  but rather surprised  chateau lafitte         i think i ll see you there .        wednesday   it was a hot  fume filled august day in central london .   warlock s eleventh birthday was very well attended .   there were twenty small boys and seventeen small girls .  there were a lot of men with identical blond crew cuts  dark blue suits  and shoulder holsters .  there was a crew of caterers  who had arrived bearing jellies  cakes  and bowls of crisps .  their procession of vans was led by a vintage bentley .   the amazing harvey and wanda  children s parties a specialty  had both been struck down by an unexpected tummy bug  but by a providential turn of fortune a replacement had turned up  practically out of the blue .  a stage magician .   everyone has his little hobby .  despite crowley s urgent advice  aziraphale was intending to turn his to good use .   aziraphale was particularly proud of his magical skills .  he had attended a class in the     s run by john maskelyne  and had spent almost a year practicing sleight of hand  palming coins  and taking rabbits out of hats .  he had got  he had felt at the time  quite good at it .  the point was that although aziraphale was capable of doing things that could make the entire magic circle hand in their wands  he never applied what might be called his intrinsic powers to the practice of sleight of hand conjuring .  which was a major drawback .  he was beginning to wish that he d continued practicing .   still  he mused  it was like riding a velocipede .  you never forgot how .  his magician s coat had been a little dusty  but it felt good once it was on .  even his old patter began to come back to him .   the children watched him in blank  disdainful incomprehension .  behind the buffet crowley  in his white waiter s coat  cringed with contact embarrassment .    now then  young masters and mistresses  do you see my battered old top hat .  what a shocking bad hat  as you young uns do say .  and see  there s nothing in it .  but bless my britches  who s this rum customer .  why  it s our furry friend  harry the rabbit .     it was in your pocket   pointed out warlock .  the other children nodded agreement .  what did he think they were .  kids .   aziraphale remembered what maskelyne had told him about dealing with hecklers .   make a joke of it  you pudding heads   and i do mean you  mr .  fell   the name aziraphale had adopted at that time    make  em laugh  and they ll forgive you anything .     ho  so you ve rumbled my hat trick   he chuckled .  the children stared at him impassively .    you re rubbish   said warlock .   i wanted cartoons anyway .     he s right  you know   agreed a small girl with a pony tail .   you are rubbish .  and probably a faggot .    aziraphale stared desperately at crowley .  as far as he was concerned young warlock was obviously infernally tainted  and the sooner the black dog turned up and they could get away from this place  the better .    now  do any of you young uns have such a thing as a thruppenny bit about your persons .  no  young master .  then what s this i see behind your ear    .     i got cartoons at my birthday   announced the little girl .   an i gotter transformer anna mylittleponyer anna decepticonattacker anna thundertank anna      crowley groaned .  children s parties were obviously places where any angel with an ounce of common sense should fear to tread .  piping infant voices were raised in cynical merriment as aziraphale dropped three linked metal rings .   crowley looked away  and his gaze fell on a table heaped high with presents .  from a tall plastic structure two beady little eyes stared back at him .   crowley scrutinized them for a glint of red fire .  you could never be certain when you were dealing with the bureaucrats of hell .  it was always possible that they had sent a gerbil instead of a dog .   no  it was a perfectly normal gerbil .  it appeared to be living in an exciting construction of cylinders  spheres  and treadmills  such as the spanish inquisition would have devised if they d had access to a plastics molding press .   he checked his watch .  it had never occurred to crowley to change its battery  which had rotted away three years previously  but it still kept perfect time .  it was two minutes to three .   aziraphale was getting more and more flustered .    do any of the company here assembled possess such a thing about their persons as a pocket handkerchief .  no .   in victorian days it had been unheard of for people not to carry handkerchiefs  and the trick  which involved magically producing a dove who was even now pecking irritably at aziraphale s wrist  could not proceed without one .  the angel tried to attract crowley s attention  failed  and  in desperation  pointed to one of the security guards  who shifted uneasily .    you  my fine jack sauce .  come here .  now  if you inspect your breast pocket  i think you might find a fine silk handkerchief .     nossir .   mafraidnotsir   said the guard  staring straight ahead .   aziraphale winked desperately .   no  go on  dear boy  take a look  please .    the guard reached a hand inside his inside pocket  looked surprised  and pulled out a handkerchief  duck egg blue silk  with lace edging .  aziraphale realized almost immediately that the lace had been a mistake  as it caught on the guard s holstered gun  and sent it spinning across the room to land heavily in a bowl of jelly .   the children applauded spasmodically .   hey  not bad .   said the pony tailed girl .   warlock had already run across the room  and grabbed the gun .    hands up  dogbreaths .   he shouted gleefully .   the security guards were in a quandary .   some of them fumbled for their own weapons  others started edging their way toward  or away from  the boy .  the other children started complaining that they wanted guns as well  and a few of the more forward ones started trying to tug them from the guards who had been thoughtless enough to take their weapons out .   then someone threw some jelly at warlock .   the boy squeaked  and pulled the trigger of the gun .  it was a magnum  .     cia issue  gray  mean  heavy  capable of blowing a man away at thirty paces  and leaving nothing more than a red mist  a ghastly mess  and a certain amount of paperwork .   aziraphale blinked .   a thin stream of water squirted from the nozzle and soaked crowley  who had been looking out the window  trying to see if there was a huge black dog in the garden .   aziraphale looked embarrassed .   then a cream cake hit him in the face .   it was almost five past three .   with a gesture  aziraphale turned the rest of the guns into water pistols as well  and walked out .   crowley found him on the pavement outside  trying to extricate a rather squishy dove from the arm of his frock coat .    it s late   said aziraphale .    i can see that   said crowley .   comes of sticking it up your sleeve .   he reached out and pulled the limp bird from aziraphale s coat  and breathed life back into it .  the dove cooed appreciatively and flew off  a trifle warily .    not the bird   said the angel .   the dog .  it s late .    crowley shook his head  thoughtfully .   we ll see .    he opened the car door  flipped on the radio .   i   should   be   solucky    lucky   lucky   lucky   lucky    i   should   be   so   lucky   in   hello crowley .     hello .  um  who is this .     dagon  lord of the files  master of madness  under duke of the seventh torment .  what can i do for you .     the hell hound .  i m just  uh  just checking that it got off okay .     released ten minutes ago .  why .  hasn t it arrived .  is something wrong .     oh no .  nothing s wrong .  everything s fine .  oops  i can see it now .  good dog .  nice dog .  everything s terrific .  you re doing a great job down there  people .  well  lovely talking to you  dagon .  catch you soon  huh .    he flipped off the radio .   they stared at each other .  there was a loud bang from inside the house  and a window shattered .   oh dear   muttered aziraphale  not swearing with the practiced ease of one who has spent six thousand years not swearing  and who wasn t going to start now .   i must have missed one .     no dog   said crowley .    no dog   said aziraphale .   the demon sighed .   get in the car   he said .   we ve got to talk about this .  oh  and aziraphale    .     yes .     clean off that blasted cream cake before you get in .           it was a hot  silent august day far from central london .  by the side of the tadfield road the dust weighed down the hogweed .  bees buzzed in the hedges .  the air had a leftover and reheated feel .   there was a sound like a thousand metal voices shouting  hail .   cut off abruptly .   and there was a black dog in the road .   it had to be a dog .  it was dog shaped .   there are some dogs which  when you meet them  remind you that  despite thousands of years of man made evolution  every dog is still only two meals away from being a wolf .  these dogs advance deliberately  purposefully  the wilderness made flesh  their teeth yellow  their breath a stink  while in the distance their owners witter   he s an old soppy really  just poke him if he s a nuisance   and in the green of their eyes the red campfires of the pleistocene gleam and flicker     this dog would make even a dog like that slink nonchalantly behind the sofa and pretend to be extremely preoccupied with its rubber bone .   it was already growling  and the growl was a low  rumbling snarl of spring coiled menace  the sort of growl that starts in the back of one throat and ends up in someone else s .   saliva dripped from its jaws and sizzled on the tar .   it took a few steps forward  and sniffed the sullen air .   its ears flicked up .   there were voices  a long way off .  a voice .  a boyish voice  but one it had been created to obey  could not help but obey .  when that voice said  follow   it would follow  when it said  kill   it would kill .  his master s voice .   it leapt the hedge and padded across the field beyond .  a grazing bull eyed it for a moment  weighed its chances  then strolled hurriedly toward the opposite hedge .   the voices were coming from a copse of straggly trees .  the black hound slunk closer  jaws streaming .   one of the other voices said   he never will .  you re always saying he will  and he never does .  catch your dad giving you a pet .  an int restin  pet  anyway .  it ll prob ly be stick insects .  that s your dad s idea of int restin  .    the hound gave the canine equivalent of a shrug  but immediately lost interest because now the master  the center of its universe  spoke .    it ll be a dog   it said .    huh .  you don t know it s going to be a dog .  no one s said it s going to be a dog .  how d you know it s goin  to be a dog if no one s said .  your dad d be complaining about the food it eats the whole time .     privet .   this third voice was rather more prim than the first two .  the owner of a voice like that would be the sort of person who  before making a plastic model kit  would not only separate and count all the parts before commencing  as per the instructions  but also paint the bits that needed painting first and leave them to dry properly prior to construction .  all that separated this voice from chartered accountancy was a matter of time .    they don t eat privet  wensley .  you never saw a dog eatin  privet .     stick insects do  i mean .  they re jolly interesting  actually .  they eat each other when they re mating .    there was a thoughtful pause .  the hound slunk closer  and realized that the voices were coming from a hole in the ground .   the trees in fact concealed an ancient chalk quarry  now half overgrown with thorn trees and vines .  ancient  but clearly not disused .  tracks crisscrossed it  smooth areas of slope indicated regular use by skateboards and wall of death  or at least wall of seriously grazed knee  cyclists .  old bits of dangerously frayed rope hung from some of the more accessible greenery .  here and there sheets of corrugated iron and old wooden boards were wedged in branches .  a burnt out  rusting triumph herald estate was visible  half submerged in a drift of nettles .   in one corner a tangle of wheels and corroded wire marked the site of the famous lost graveyard where the supermarket trolleys came to die .   if you were a child  it was paradise .  the local adults called it the pit .   the hound peered through a clump of nettles  and spotted four figures sitting in the center of the quarry on that indispensable prop to good secret dens everywhere  the common milk crate .    they don t .     they do .     bet you they don t   said the first speaker .  it had a certain timbre to it that identified it as young and female  and it was tinted with horrified fascination .    they do  actually .  i had six before we went on holiday and i forgot to change the privet and when i came back i had one big fat one .     nah .  that s not stick insects  that s praying mantises .  i saw on the television where this big female one ate this other one and it dint hardly take any notice .    there was another crowded pause .    what re they prayin  about .   said his master s voice .    dunno .  prayin  they don t have to get married  i s pect .    the hound managed to get one huge eye against an empty knothole in the quarry s broken down fence  and squinted downward .    anyway  it s like with bikes   said the first speaker authoritatively .   i thought i was going to get this bike with seven gears and one of them razorblade saddles and purple paint and everything  and they gave me this light blue one .  with a basket .  a girl s bike .     well .  you re a girl   said one of the others .    that s sexism  that is .  going around giving people girly presents just because they re a girl .     i m going to get a dog   said his master s voice  firmly .  his master had his back to him  the hound couldn t quite make out his features .    oh  yeah  one of those great big rottenweilers  yeah .   said the girl  with withering sarcasm .    no  it s going to be the kind of dog you can have fun with   said his master s voice .   not a big dog         the eye in the nettles vanished abruptly downwards         but one of those dogs that s brilliantly intelligent and can go down rabbit holes and has one funny ear that always looks inside out .  and a proper mongrel  too .  a pedigree mongrel .    unheard by those within  there was a tiny clap of thunder on the lip of the quarry .  it might have been caused by the sudden rushing of air into the vacuum caused by a very large dog becoming  for example  a small dog .   the tiny popping noise that followed might have been caused by one ear turning itself inside out .    and i ll call him     said his master s voice .   i ll call him       yes .   said the girl .   what re you goin  to call it .    the hound waited .  this was the moment .  the naming .  this would give it its propose  its function  its identity .  its eyes glowed a dull red  even though they were a lot closer to the ground  and it dribbled into the nettles .    i ll call him dog   said his master  positively .   it saves a lot of trouble  a name like that .    the hell hound paused .  deep in its diabolical canine brain it knew that something was wrong  but it was nothing if not obedient and its great sudden love of its master overcame all misgivings .  who was it to say what size it should be  anyway .   it trotted down the slope to meet its destiny .   strange  though .  it had always wanted to jump up at people but  now  it realized that against all expectation it wanted to wag its tail at the same time .           you said it was him .   moaned aziraphale  abstractedly picking the final lump of cream cake from his lapel .  he licked his fingers clean .    it was him   said crowley .   i mean  i should know  shouldn t i .     then someone else must be interfering .     there isn t anyone else .  there s just us  right .  good and evil .  one side or the other .    he thumped the steering wheel .    you ll be amazed at the kind of things they can do to you  down there   he said .    i imagine they re very similar to the sort of things they can do to one up there   said aziraphale .    come off it .  your lot get ineffable mercy   said crowley sourly .    yes .  did you ever visit gomorrah .     sure   said the demon .   there was this great little tavern where you could get these terrific fermented date palm cocktails with nutmeg and crushed lemongrass       i meant afterwards .     oh .    aziraphale said   something must have happened in the hospital .     it couldn t have .  it was full of our people .     whose people .   said aziraphale coldly .    my people   corrected crowley .   well  not my people .  mmm  you know .  satanists .    he tried to say it dismissively .  apart from  of course  the fact that the world was an amazing interesting place which they both wanted to enjoy for as long as possible  there were few things that the two of them agreed on  but they did see eye to eye about some of those people who  for one reason or another  were inclined to worship the prince of darkness .  crowley always found them embarrassing .  you couldn t actually be rude to them  but you couldn t help feeling about them the same way that  say  a vietnam veteran would feel about someone who wears combat gear to neighborhood watch meetings .   besides  they were always so depressingly enthusiastic .  take all that stuff with the inverted crosses and pentagrams and cockerels .  it mystified most demons .  it wasn t the least bit necessary .  all you needed to become a satanist was an effort of will .  you could be one all your life without ever knowing what a pentagram was  without ever seeing a dead cockerel other than as chicken marengo .   besides  some of the old style satanists tended  in fact  to be quite nice people .  they mouthed the words and went through the motions  just like the people they thought of as their opposite numbers  and then went home and lived lives of mild unassuming mediocrity for the rest of the week with never an unusually evil thought in their heads .   and as for the rest of it     there were people who called themselves satanists who made crowley squirm .  it wasn t just the things they did  it was the way they blamed it all on hell .  they d come up with some stomach churning idea that no demon could have thought of in a thousand years  some dark and mindless unpleasantness that only a fully functioning human brain could conceive  then shout  the devil made me do it  and get the sympathy of the court when the whole point was that the devil hardly ever made anyone do anything .  he didn t have to .  that was what some humans found hard to understand .  hell wasn t a major reservoir of evil  any more than heaven  in crowley s opinion  was a fountain of goodness  they were just sides in the great cosmic chess game .  where you found the real mccoy  the real grace and the real heart stopping evil  was right inside the human mind .    huh   said aziraphale .   satanists .     i don t see how they could have messed it up   said crowley .   i mean  two babies .  it s not exactly taxing  is it    .   he stopped .  through the mists of memory he pictured a small nun  who had struck him at the time as being remarkably loose headed even for a satanist .  and there had been someone else .  crowley vaguely recalled a pipe  and a cardigan with the kind of zigzag pattern that went out of style in      .  a man with  expectant father  written all over him .   there must have been a third baby .   he told aziraphale .    not a lot to go on   said the angel .    we know the child must be alive   said crowley   so       how do we know .     if it had turned up down there again  do you think i d still be sitting here .     good point .     so all we ve got to do is find it   said crowley .   go through the hospital records .   the bentley s engine coughed into life and the car leapt forward  forcing aziraphale back into the seat .    and then what .   he said .    and then we find the child .     and then what .   the angel shut his eyes as the car crabbed around a corner .    don t know .     good grief .     i suppose   get off the road you clown   your people wouldn t consider    and the scooter you rode in on .    giving me asylum .     i was going to ask you the same thing   watch out for that pedestrian .     it s on the street  it knows the risks it s taking .   said crowley  easing the accelerating car between a parked car and a taxi and leaving a space which would have barely accepted even the best credit card .    watch the roadl watch the road .  where is this hospital  anyway .     somewhere south of oxford .    aziraphale grabbed the dashboard .   you can t do ninety miles an hour in central london .    crowley peered at the dial .   why not .   he said .    you ll get us killed .   aziraphale hesitated .   inconveniently discorporated   he corrected  lamely  relaxing a little .   anyway  you might kill other people .    crowley shrugged .  the angel had never really come to grips with the twentieth century  and didn t realize that it is perfectly possible to do ninety miles an hour down oxford street .  you just arranged matters so that no one was in the way .  and since everyone knew that it was impossible to do ninety miles an hour down oxford street  no one noticed .   at least cars were better than horses .  the internal combustion engine had been a godse   a blessi   a windfall for crowley .  the only horses he could be seen riding on business  in the old days  were big black jobs with eyes like flame and hooves that struck sparks .  that was de rigueur for a demon .  usually  crowley fell off .  he wasn t much good with animals .   somewhere around chiswick  aziraphale scrabbled vaguely in the scree of tapes in the glove compartment .    what s a velvet underground .   he said .    you wouldn t like it   said crowley .    oh   said the angel dismissively .   be bop .     do you know  aziraphale  that probably if a million human beings were asked to describe modern music  they wouldn t use the term  bebop  .   said crowley .    ah  this is more like it .  tchaikovsky   said aziraphale  opening a case and slotting its cassette into the blaupunkt .    you won t enjoy it   sighed crowley .   it s been in the car for more than a fortnight .    a heavy bass beat began to thump through the bentley as they sped past heathrow .   aziraphale s brow furrowed .    i don t recognize this   he said .   what is it .     it s tchaikovsky s  another one bites the dust    said crowley  closing his eyes as they went through slough .   to while away the time as they crossed the sleeping chilterns  they also listened to william byrd s  we are the champions  and beethoven s  i want to break free .   neither were as good as vaughan williams s  fat bottomed girls .           it is said that the devil has all the best tunes .   this is broadly true .  but heaven has the best choreographers .          the oxfordshire plain stretched out to the west  with a scattering of lights to mark the slumbering villages where honest yeomen were settling down to sleep after a long day s editorial direction  financial consulting  or software engineering .   up here on the hill a few glow worms were lighting up .   the surveyor s theodolite is one of the more direful symbols of the twentieth century .  set up anywhere in open countryside  it says  there will come road widening  yea  and two thousand home estates in keeping with the essential character of the village .  executive developments will be manifest .   but not even the most conscientious surveyor surveys at midnight  and yet here the thing was  tripod legs deep in the turf .  not many theodolites have a hazel twig strapped to the top  either  or crystal pendulums hanging from them and celtic runes carved into the legs .   the soft breeze flapped the cloak of the slim figure who was adjusting the knobs of the thing .  it was quite a heavy cloak  sensibly waterproof  with a warm lining .   most books on witchcraft will tell you that witches work naked .  this is because most books on witchcraft are written by men .   the young woman s name was anathema device .  she was not astonishingly beautiful .  all her features  considered individually  were extremely pretty  but the entirety of her face gave the impression that it had been put together hurriedly from stock without reference to any plan .  probably the most suitable word is  attractive   although people who knew what it meant and could spell it might add  vivacious   although there is something very fifties about  vivacious   so perhaps they wouldn t .   young women should not go alone on dark nights  even in oxfordshire .  but any prowling maniac would have had more than his work cut out if he had accosted anathema device .  she was a witch  after all .  and precisely because she was a witch  and therefore sensible  she put little faith in protective amulets and spells  she saved it all for a foot long bread knife which she kept in her belt .   she sighted through the glass and made another adjustment .   she muttered under her breath .   surveyors often mutter under their breath .  they mutter things like  soon have a relief road through here faster than you can say jack robinson   or  that s three point five meters  give or take a gnat s whisker .    this was an entirely different kind of muttering .    darksome night and shining moon   muttered anathema   east by south by west by southwest    west southwest    got you      she picked up a folded ordinance survey map and held it in the torchlight .  then she produced a transparent ruler and a pencil and carefully drew a line across the map .  it intersected another pencil line .   she smiled  not because anything was particularly amusing  but because a tricky job had been done well .   then she collapsed the strange theodolite  strapped it onto the back of a sit up and beg black bicycle leaning against the hedge  made sure the book was in the basket  and wheeled everything out to the misty lane .   it was a very ancient bike  with a frame apparently made of drainpipes .  it had been built long before the invention of the three speed gear  and possibly only just after the invention of the wheel .   but it was nearly all downhill to the village .  hair streaming in the wind  cloak ballooning behind her like a sheet anchor  she let the twowheeled juggernaut accelerate ponderously through the warm air .  at least there wasn t any traffic at this time of night .          the bentley s engine went pink  pink as it cooled .  crowley s temper  on the other hand  was heating up .    you said you saw it signposted   he said .    well  we flashed by so quickly .  anyway  i thought you d been here before .     eleven years ago .    crowley hurled the map onto the back seat and started the engine again .    perhaps we should ask someone   said aziraphale .    oh  yes   said crowley .   we ll stop and ask the first person we see walking along a a track in the middle of the night  shall we .    he jerked the car into gear and roared out into the beech hung lane .    there s something odd about this area   said aziraphale .   can t you feel it .     what .     slow down a moment .    the bentley slowed again .    odd   muttered the angel   i keep getting these flashes of  of      he raised his hands to his temples .    what .  what .   said crowley .   aziraphale stared at him .    love   he said .   someone really loves this place .     pardon .     there seems to be this great sense of love .  i can t put it any better than that .  especially not to you .     do you mean like     crowley began .   there was a whirr  a scream  and a chink .  the car stopped .   aziraphale blinked  lowered his hands  and gingerly opened the door .    you ve hit someone   he said .    no i haven t   said crowley .   someone s hit me .    they got out .  behind the bentley a bicycle lay in the road  its front wheel bent into a creditable mobius shape  its back wheel clicking ominously to a standstill .    let there be light   said aziraphale .  a pale blue glow filled the lane .   from the ditch beside them someone said   how the hell did you do that .    the light vanished .    do what .   said aziraphale guiltily .    uh .   now the voice sounded muzzy .   i think i hit my head on something      crowley glared at a long metallic streak on the bentley s glossy paintwork and a dimple in the bumper .  the dimple popped back into shape .  the paint healed .    up you get  young lady   said the angel  hauling anathema out of the bracken .   no bones broken .   it was a statement  not a hope  there had been a minor fracture  but aziraphale couldn t resist an opportunity to do good .    you didn t have any lights   she began .    nor did you   said crowley guiltily .   fair s fair .     doing a spot of astronomy  were we .   said aziraphale  setting the bike upright .  various things clattered out of its front basket .  he pointed to the battered theodolite .    no   said anathema   i mean  yes .  and look what you ve done to poor old phaeton .     i m sorry .   said aziraphale .    my bicycle .  it s bent all to       amazingly resilient  these old machines   said the angel brightly  handing it to her .  the front wheel gleamed in the moonlight  as perfectly round as one of the circles of hell .   she stared at it .    well  since that s all sorted out   said crowley   perhaps it d be best if we just all got on our  er .  er .  you wouldn t happen to know the way to lower tadfield  would you .    anathema was still staring at her bicycle .  she was almost certain that it hadn t had a little saddlebag with a puncture repair kit when she set out .    it s just down the hill   she said .   this is my bike  isn t it .     oh  certainly   said aziraphale  wondering if he d overdone things .    only i m sure phaeton never had a pump .    the angel looked guilty again .    but there s a place for one   he said  helplessly .   two little hooks .     just down the hill  you said .   said crowley  nudging the angel .    i think perhaps i must have knocked my head   said the girl .    we d offer to give you a lift  of course   said crowley quickly   but there s nowhere for the bike .     except the luggage rack   said aziraphale .    the bentley hasn t   oh .  huh .    the angel scrambled the spilled contents of the bike s basket into the back seat and helped the stunned girl in after them .    one does not   he said to crowley   pass by on the other side .     your one might not .  this one does .  we have got other things to do  you know .   crowley glared at the new luggage rack .  it had tartan straps .   the bicycle lifted itself up and tied itself firmly in place .  then crowley got in .    where do you live  my dear .   aziraphale oozed .    my bike didn t have lights  either .  well  it did  but they re the sort you put those double batteries in and they went moldy and i took them off   said anathema .  she glared at crowley .   i have a bread knife  you know   she said .   somewhere .    aziraphale looked shocked at the implication .    madam  i assure you      crowley switched on the lights .  he didn t need them to see by  but they made the other humans on the road less nervous .  then he put the car into gear and drove sedately down the hill .  the road came out from under the trees and  after a few hundred yards  reached the outskirts of a middlesized village .   it had a familiar feel to it .  it had been eleven years  but this place definitely rang a distant bell .    is there a hospital around here .   he said .   run by nuns .    anathema shrugged .   don t think so   she said .   the only large place is tadfield manor .  i don t know what goes on there .     divine planning   muttered crowley under his breath .    and gears   said anathema .   my bike didn t have gears .  i m sure my bike didn t have gears .    crowley leaned across to the angel .    oh lord  heal this bike   he whispered sarcastically .    i m sorry  i just got carried away   hissed aziraphale .    tartan straps .     tartan is stylish .    crowley growled .  on those occasions when the angel managed to get his mind into the twentieth century  it always gravitated to      .    you can drop me off here   said anathema  from the back seat .    our pleasure   beamed the angel .  as soon as the car had stopped he had the back door open and was bowing like an aged retainer welcoming the young massa back to the old plantation .   anathema gathered her things together and stepped out as haughtily as possible .   she was quite sure neither of the two men had gone around to the back of the car  but the bike was unstrapped and leaning against the gate .   there was definitely something very weird about them  she decided .   aziraphale bowed again .   so glad to have been of assistance   he said .    thank you   said anathema  icily .    can we get on .   said crowley .   goodnight  miss .  get in  angel .    ah .  well  that explained it .  she had been perfectly safe after all .   she watched the car disappear toward the center of the village  and wheeled the bike up the path to the cottage .  she hadn t bothered to lock it .  she was sure that agnes would have mentioned it if she was going to be burgled  she was always very good at personal things like that .   she d rented the cottage furnished  which meant that the actual furniture was the special sort you find in these circumstances and had probably been left out for the dustmen by the local war on want shop .  it didn t matter .  she didn t expect to be here long .   if agnes was right  she wouldn t be anywherelong .  nor would anyone else .   she spread her maps and things out on the ancient table under the kitchen s solitary light bulb .   what had she learned .  nothing much  she decided .  probably it was at the north end of the village  but she d suspected that anyway .  if you got too close the signal swamped you  if you were too far away you couldn t get an accurate fix .   it was infuriating .  the answer must be in the book somewhere .  the trouble was that in order to understand the predictions you had to be able to think like a half crazed  highly intelligent seventeenth century witch with a mind like a crossword puzzle dictionary .  other members of the family had said that agnes made things obscure to conceal them from the understanding of outsiders  anathema  who suspected she could occasionally think like agnes  had privately decided that it was because agnes was a bloody minded old bitch with a mean sense of humor .   she d not even     she didn t have the book .   anathema stared in horror at the things on the table .  the maps .  the homemade divinatory theodolite .  the thermos that had contained hot bovril .  the torch .   the rectangle of empty air where the prophecies should have been .   she d lost it .   but that was ridiculous .  one of the things agnes was always very specific about was what happened to the book .   she snatched up the torch and ran from the house .           a feeling like  oh  like the opposite of the feeling you re having when you say things like  this feels spooky    said aziraphale .   that s what i mean .     i never say things like  this feels spooky    said crowley .   i m all for spooky .     a cherishedfeel   said aziraphale desperately .    nope .  can t sense a thing   said crowley with forced jolliness .   you re just over sensitive .     it s my job   said aziraphale .   angels can t be over sensitive .     i expect people round here like living here and you re just picking it up .     never picked up anything like this in london   said aziraphale .    there you are  then .  proves my point   said crowley .   and this is the place .  i remember the stone lions on the gateposts .    the bentley s headlights lit up the groves of overgrown rhododendrons that lined the drive .  the tires crunched over gravel .    it s a bit early in the morning to be calling on nuns   said aziraphale doubtfully .    nonsense .  nuns are up and about at all hours   said crowley .   it s probably compline  unless that s a slimming aid .     oh  cheap  very cheap   said the angel .   there s really no need for that sort of thing .     don t get defensive .  i told you  these were some of ours .  black nuns .  we needed a hospital close to the air base  you see .     you ve lost me there .     you don t think american diplomats  wives usually give birth in little religious hospitals in the middle of nowhere  do you .  it all had to seem to happen naturally .  there s an air base at lower tadfield  she went there for the opening  things started to happen  base hospital not ready  our man there said   there s a place just down the road   and there we were .  rather good organization .     except for one or two minor details   said aziraphale smugly .    but it nearly worked   snapped crowley  feeling he should stick up for the old firm .    you see  evil always contains the seeds of its own destruction   said the angel .   it is ultimately negative  and therefore encompasses its downfall even at its moments of apparent triumph .  no matter how grandiose  how well planned  how apparently foolproof an evil plan  the inherent sinfulness will by definition rebound upon its instigators .  no matter how apparently successful it may seem upon the way  at the end it will wreck itself .  it will founder upon the rocks of iniquity and sink headfirst to vanish without trace into the seas of oblivion .    crowley considered this .   nah   he said  at last .   for my money  it was just average incompetence .  hey      he whistled under his breath .   the graveled forecourt in front of the manor was crowded with cars  and they weren t nun cars .  the bentley was if anything outclassed .  a lot of the cars had gt or turbo in their names and phone aerials on their roofs .  they were nearly all less than a year old .   crowley s hands itched .  aziraphale healed bicycles and broken bones  he longed to steal a few radios  let down some tires  that sort of thing .  he resisted it .    well  well   he said .   in my day nuns were packed four to a morris traveller .     this can t be right   said aziraphale .    perhaps they ve gone private .   said crowley .    or you ve got the wrong place .     it s the right place  i tell you .  come on .    they got out of the car .  thirty seconds later someone shot both of them .  with incredible accuracy .          if there was one thing that mary hodges  formerly loquacious  was good at  it was attempting to obey orders .  she liked orders .  they made the world a simpler place .   what she wasn t good at was change .  she d really liked the chattering order .  she d made friends for the first time .  she d had a room of her own for the first time .  of course  she knew that it was engaged in things which might  from certain viewpoints  be considered bad  but mary hodges had seen quite a lot of life in thirty years and had no illusions about what most of the human race had to do in order to make it from one week to the next .  besides  the food was good and you got to meet interesting people .   the order  such as was left of it  had moved after the fire .  after all  their sole purpose in existing had been fulfilled .  they went their separate ways .   she hadn t gone .  she d rather liked the manor and  she said  someone ought to stay and see it was properly repaired  because you couldn t trust workmen these days unless you were on top of them the whole time  in a manner of speaking .  this meant breaking her vows  but mother superior said this was all right  nothing to worry about  breaking vows was perfectly okay in a black sisterhood  and it would all be the same in a hundred years  time or  rather  eleven years  time  so if it gave her any pleasure here were the deeds and an address to forward any mail unless it came in long brown envelopes with windows in the front .   then something very strange had happened to her .  left alone in the rambling building  working from one of the few undamaged rooms  arguing with men with cigarette stubs behind their ears and plaster dust on their trousers and the kind of pocket calculator that comes up with a different answer if the sums involved are in used notes  she discovered something she never knew existed .   she d discovered  under layers of silliness and eagerness to please  mary hodges .   she found it quite easy to interpret builders  estimates and do vat calculations .  she d got some books from the library  and found finance to be both interesting and uncomplicated .  she d stopped reading the kind of women s magazine that talks about romance and knitting and started reading the kind of women s magazine that talks about orgasms  but apart from making a mental note to have one if ever the occasion presented itself she dismissed them as only romance and knitting in a new form .  so she d started reading the kind of magazine that talked about mergers .   after much thought  she d bought a small home computer from an amused and condescending young dealer in norton .  after a crowded weekend  she took it back .  not  as he thought when she walked back into the shop  to have a plug put on it  but because it didn t have a     coprocessor .  that bit he understood   he was a dealer  after all  and could understand quite long words   but after that the conversation rapidly went downhill from his point of view .  mary hodges produced yet more magazines .  most of them had the term  pc  somewhere in their title  and many of them had articles and reviews that she had circled carefully in red ink .   she read about new women .  she hadn t ever realized that she d been an old woman  but after some thought she decided that titles like that were all one with the romance and the knitting and the orgasms  and the really important thing to be was yourself  just as hard as you could .  she d always been inclined to dress in black and white .  all she needed to do was raise the hemlines  raise the heels  and leave off the wimple .   it was while leafing through a magazine one day that she learned that  around the country  there was an apparently insatiable demand for commodious buildings in spacious grounds run by people who understood the needs of the business community .  the following day she went out and ordered some stationery in the name of the tadfield manor conference and management training center  reasoning that by the time it had been printed she d know all that was necessary to know about running such places .   the ads went out the following week .   it had turned out to be an overwhelming success  because mary hodges realized early in her new career as herself that management training didn t have to mean sitting people down in front of unreliable slide projectors .  firms expected far more than that these days .   she provided it .          crowley sank down with his back against a statue .  aziraphale had already toppled backward into a rhododendron bush  a dark stain spreading across his coat .   crowley felt dampness suffusing his own shirt .   this was ridiculous .  the last thing he needed now was to be killed .  it would require all sorts of explanations .  they didn t hand out new bodies just like that  they always wanted to know what you d done with the old one .  it was like trying to get a new pen from a particularly bloody minded stationery department .   he looked at his hand in disbelief .   demons have to be able to see in the dark .  and he could see that his hand was yellow .  he was bleeding yellow .   gingerly  he tasted a finger .   then he crawled over to aziraphale and checked the angel s shirt .  if the stain on it was blood  something had gone very wrong with biology .    oo  that stung   moaned the fallen angel .   got me right under the ribs .     yes  but do you normally bleed blue .   said crowley .   aziraphale s eyes opened .  his right hand patted his chest .  he sat up .  he went through the same crude forensic self examination as crowley .    paint .   he said .   crowley nodded .    what re they playing at .   said aziraphale .    i don t know   said crowley   but i think it s called silly buggers .   his tone suggested that he could play  too .  and do it better .   it was a game .  it was tremendous fun .  nigel tompkins  assistant head  purchasing   squirmed through the undergrowth  his mind aflame with some of the more memorable scenes of some of the better clint eastwood movies .  and to think he d believed that management training was going to be boring  too     there had been a lecture  but it had been about the paint guns and all the things you should never do with them  and tompkins had looked at the fresh young faces of his rival trainees as  to a man  they resolved to do them all if there was half a chance of getting away with it .  if people told you business was a jungle and then put a gun in your hand  then it was pretty obvious to tompkins that they weren t expecting you to simply aim for the shirt  what it was all about was the corporate head hanging over your fireplace .   anyway  it was rumored that someone over in united consolidated had done his promotion prospects a considerable amount of good by the anonymous application of a high speed earful of paint to an immediate superior  causing the latter to complain of little ringing noises in important meetings and eventually to be replaced on medical grounds .   and there were his fellow trainees   fellow sperms  to switch metaphors  all struggling forward in the knowledge that there could only ever be one chairman of industrial holdings  holdings  plc  and that the job would probably go to the biggest prick .   of course  some girl with a clipboard from personnel had told them that the courses they were going on were just to establish leadership potential  group cooperation  initiative  and so on .  the trainees had tried to avoid one another s faces .   it had worked quite well so far .  the white water canoeing had taken care of johnstone  punctured eardrum  and the mountain climbing in wales had done for whittaker  groin strain  .   tompkins thumbed another paint pellet into the gun and muttered business mantras to himself .  do unto others before they do unto you .  kill or be killed .  either shit or get out of the kitchen .  survival of the fittest .  make my day .   he crawled a little nearer to the figures by the statue .  they didn t seem to have noticed him .   when the available cover ran out  he took a deep breath and leapt to his feet .    okay  douchebags  grab some sk   ohnoooeeeeee      where one of the figures had been there was something dreadful .  he blacked out .   crowley restored himself to his favorite shape .    i hate having to do that   he murmured .   i m always afraid i ll forget how to change back .  and it can ruin a good suit .     i think the maggots were a bit over the top  myself   said aziraphale  but without much rancor .  angels had certain moral standards to maintain and so  unlike crowley  he preferred to buy his clothes rather than wish them into being from raw firmament .  and the shirt had been quite expensive .    i mean  just look at it   he said .   i ll never get the stain out .     miracle it away   said crowley  scanning the undergrowth for any more management trainees .    yes  but i ll always know the stain was there .  you know .  deep down  i mean   said the angel .  he picked up the gun and turned it over in his hands .   i ve never seen one of these before   he said .   there was a pinging noise  and the statue beside them lost an ear .    let s not hang around   said crowley .   he wasn t alone .     this is a very odd gun  you know .  very strange .     i thought your side disapproved of guns   said crowley .  he took the gun from the angel s plump hand and sighted along the stubby barrel .    current thinking favors them   said aziraphale .   they lend weight to moral argument .  in the right hands  of course .     yeah .   crowley snaked a hand over the metal .   that s all right  then .  come on .    he dropped the gun onto the recumbent form of tompkins and marched away across the damp lawn .   the front door of the manor was unlocked .  the pair of them walked through unheeded .  some plump young men in army fatigues spattered with paint were drinking cocoa out of mugs in what had once been the sisters  refectory  and one or two of them gave them a cheery wave .   something like a hotel reception desk now occupied one end of the hall .  it had a quietly competent look .  aziraphale gazed at the board on an aluminum easel beside it .   in little plastic letters let into the black fabric of the board were the words  august          united holdings  holdings  plc initiative combat course .   meanwhile crowley had picked up a pamphlet from the desk .  it showed glossy pictures of the manor  with special references to its jacuzzis and indoor heated swimming pool  and on the back was the sort of map that conference centers always have  which makes use of a careful misscaling to suggest that it is handy for every motorway exit in the nation while carefully leaving out the labyrinth of country lanes that in fact surrounds it for miles on every side .    wrong place .   said aziraphale .    no .     wrong time  then .     yes .   crowley leafed through the booklet  in the hope of any clue .  perhaps it was too much to hope that the chattering order would still be here .  after all  they d done their bit .  he hissed softly .  probably they d gone to darkest america or somewhere  to convert the christians  but he read on anyway .  sometimes this sort of leaflet had a little historical bit  because the kind of companies that hired places like this for a weekend of interactive personnel analysis or a conference on the strategic marketing dynamic liked to feel that they were strategically interacting in the very building   give or take a couple of complete rebuildings  a civil war  and two major fires   that some elizabethan financier had endowed as a plague hospital .   not that he was actually expecting a sentence like  until eleven years ago the manor was used as a convent by an order of satanic nuns who weren t in fact all that good at it  really   but you never knew .   a plump man wearing desert camouflage and holding a polystyrene cup of coffee wandered up to them .    who s winning .   he said chummily .   young evanson of forward planning caught me a right zinger on the elbow  you know .     we re all going to lose   said crowley absently .   there was a burst of firing from the grounds .  not the snap and zing of pellets  but the full throated crackle of aerodynamically shaped bits of lead traveling extremely fast .   there was an answering stutter .   the redundant warriors stared one on another .  a further burst took out a rather ugly victorian stained glass window beside the door and stitched a row of holes in the plaster by crowley s head .   aziraphale grabbed his arm .    what the hell is it .   he said .   crowley smiled like a snake .          nigel tompkins had come to with a mild headache and a vaguely empty space in his recent memory .  he was not to know that the human brain  when faced with a sight too terrible to contemplate  is remarkably good at scabbing it over with forced forgetfulness  so he put it down to a pellet strike on the head .   he was vaguely aware that his gun was somewhat heavier  but in his mildly bemused state he did not realize why until some time after he d pointed it at trainee manager norman wethered from internal audit and pulled the trigger .           i don t see why you re so shocked   said crowley .   he wanted a real gun .  every desire in his head was for a real gun .     but you ve turned him loose on all those unprotected people .   said aziraphale .    oh  no   said crowley .   not exactly .  fair s fair .           the contingent from financial planning were lying flat on their faces in what had once been the haha  although they weren t very amused .    i always said you couldn t trust those people from purchasing   said the deputy financial manager .   the bastards .    a shot pinged off the wall above him .   he crawled hurriedly over to the little group clustered around the fallen wethered .    how does it look .   he said .   the assistant head of wages turned a haggard face toward him .    pretty bad   he said .   the bullet went through nearly all of them .  access  barclaycard  diners   the lot .     it was only the american express gold that stopped it   said wethered .   they looked in mute horror at the spectacle of a credit card wallet with a bullet hole nearly all the way through it .    why d they do it .   said a wages officer .   the head of internal audit opened his mouth to say something reasonable  and didn t .  everyone had a point where they crack  and his had just been hit with a spoon .  twenty years in the job .  he d wanted to be a graphic designer but the careers master hadn t heard of that .  twenty years of double checking form bf    .  twenty years of cranking the bloody hand calculator  when even the people in forward planning had computers .  and now for reasons unknown  but possibly to do with reorganization and a desire to do away with all the expense of early retirement  they were shooting at him with bullets .   the armies of paranoia marched behind his eyes .   he looked down at his own gun .  through the mists of rage and bewilderment he saw that it was bigger and blacker than it had been when it was issued to him .  it felt heavier  too .   he aimed it at a bush nearby and watched a stream of bullets blow the bush into oblivion .   oh .  so that was their game .  well  someone had to win .   he looked at his men .    okay  guys   he said   let s get the bastards .            the way i see it   said crowley   no one has to pull the trigger .   he gave aziraphale a bright and brittle grin .    come on   he said .   let s have a look around while everyone s busy .           bullets streaked across the night .   jonathan parker  purchasing section  was wriggling through the bushes when one of them put an arm around his neck .   nigel tompkins spat a cluster of rhododendron leaves out of his mouth .    down there it s company law   he hissed  through mud encrusted features   but up here it s me       that was a pretty low trick   said aziraphale  as they strolled along the empty corridors .    what d i do .  what d i do .   said crowley  pushing open doors at random .    there are people out there shooting one another .     well  that s just it  isn t it .  they re doing it themselves .  it s what they really want to do .  i just assisted them .  think of it as a microcosm of the universe .  free will for everyone .  ineffable  right .    aziraphale glared .    oh  all right   said crowley wretchedly .   no one s actually going to get killed .  they re all going to have miraculous escapes .  it wouldn t be any fun otherwise .    aziraphale relaxed .   you know  crowley   he said  beaming   i ve always said that  deep down inside  you re really quite a       all right  all right   crowley snapped .   tell the whole blessed world  why don t you .           after a while  loose alliances began to emerge .  most of the financial departments found they had interests in common  settled their differences  and ganged up on forward planning .   when the first police car arrived  sixteen bullets from a variety of directions had hit it in the radiator before it had got halfway up the drive .  two more took out its radio antenna  but they were too late  too late .          mary hodges was just putting down the phone when crowley opened her office door .    it must be terrorists   she snapped .   or poachers .   she peered at the pair of them .   you are the police  aren t you .   she said .   crowley saw her eyes begin to widen .   like all demons  he had a good memory for faces  even after ten years  the loss of a wimple  and the addition of some rather severe makeup .  he snapped his fingers .  she settled back in her chair  her face becoming a blank and amiable mask .    there was no need for that   said aziraphale .    good    crowley glanced at his watch    morning  ma am   he said  in a sing song voice .   we re just a couple of supernatural entities and we were just wondering if you might help us with the whereabouts of the notorious son of satan .   he smiled coldly at the angel .   i ll wake her up again  shall i .  and you can say it .     well .  since you put it like that     said the angel slowly .    sometimes the old ways are best   said crowley .  he turned to the impassive woman .    were you a nun here eleven years ago .   he said .    yes   said mary .    there .   said crowley to aziraphale .   see .  i knew i wasn t wrong .     luck of the devil   muttered the angel .    your name then was sister talkative .  or something .     loquacious   said mary hodges in a hollow voice .    and do you recall an incident involving the switching of newborn babies .   said crowley .   mary hodges hesitated .  when she did speak  it was as though memories that had been scabbed over were being disturbed for the first time in years .    yes   she said .    is there any possibility that the switch could have gone wrong in some way .     i do not know .    crowley thought for a bit .   you must have had records   he said .   there are always records .  everyone has records these days .   he glanced proudly at aziraphale .   it was one of my better ideas .     oh  yes   said mary hodges .    and where are they .   said aziraphale sweetly .    there was a fire just after the birth .    crowley groaned and threw his hands in the air .   that was hastur  probably   he said .   it s his style .  can you believe those guys .  i bet he thought he was being really clever .     do you recall any details about the other child .   said aziraphale .    yes .     please tell me .     he had lovely little toesie wosies .     oh .     and he was very sweet   said mary hodges wistfully .   there was the sound of a siren outside  abruptly broken off as a bullet hit it .  aziraphale nudged crowley .    get a move on   he said .   we re going to be knee deep in police at any moment and i will of course be morally obliged to assist them in their enquiries .   he thought for a moment .   perhaps she can remember if there were any other women giving birth that night  and      there was the sound of running feet downstairs .    stop them   said crowley .   we need more time .     any more miracles and we ll really start getting noticed by up there   said aziraphale .   if you really want gabriel or someone wondering why forty policemen have gone to sleep       okay   said crowley .   that s it .  that s it .  it was worth a try .  let s get out of here .     in thirty seconds you will wake up   said aziraphale  to the entranced ex nun .   and you will have had a lovely dream about whatever you like best  and       yes  yes  fine   sighed crowley .   now can we go .           no one noticed them leaving .  the police were too busy herding in forty adrenaline drunk  fighting mad management trainees .  three police vans had gouged tracks in the lawn  and aziraphale made crowley back up for the first of the ambulances  but then the bentley swished into the night .  behind them the summerhouse and gazebo were already ablaze .    we ve really left that poor woman in a dreadful situation   said the angel .    you think .   said crowley  trying to hit a hedgehog and missing .   bookings will double  you mark my words .  if she plays her cards right  sorts out the waivers  ties up all the legal bits .  initiative training with real guns .  they ll form queues .     why are you always so cynical .     i said .  because it s my job .    they drove in silence for a while .  then aziraphale said   you d think he d show up  wouldn t you .  you d think we could detect him in some way .     he won t show up .  not to us .  protective camouflage .  he won t even know it  but his powers will keep him hidden from prying occult forces .     occult forces .     you and me   explained crowley .    i m not occult   said aziraphale .   angels aren t occult .  we re ethereal .     whatever   snapped crowley  too worried to argue .    is there some other way of locating him .    crowley shrugged .   search me   he said .   how much experience do you think i ve got in these matters .  armageddon only happens once  you know .  they don t let you go around again until you get it right .    the angel stared out at the rushing hedgerows .    it all seems so peaceful   he said .   how do you think it will happen .     well  thermonuclear extinction has always been very popular .  although i must say the big boys are being quite polite to each other at the moment .     asteroid strike .   said aziraphale .   quite the fashion these days  i understand .  strike into the indian ocean  great big cloud of dust and vapor  goodbye all higher life forms .     wow   said crowley  taking care to exceed the speed limit .  every little bit helped .    doesn t bear thinking about it  does it   said aziraphale gloomily .    all the higher life forms scythed away  just like that .     terrible .     nothing but dust and fundamentalists .     that was nasty .     sorry .  couldn t resist it .    they stared at the road .    maybe some terrorist    .   aziraphale began .    not one of ours   said crowley .    or ours   said aziraphale .   although ours are freedom fighters  of course .     i ll tell you what   said crowley  scorching rubber on the tadfield bypass .   cards on the table time .  i ll tell you ours if you tell me yours .     all right .  you first .     oh  no .  you first .     but you re a demon .     yes  but a demon of my word  i should hope .    aziraphale named five political leaders .  crowley named six .  three names appeared on both lists .    see .   said crowley .   it s just like i ve always said .  they re cunning buggers  humans .  you can t trust them an inch .     but i don t think any of ours have any big plans afoot   said aziraphale .   just minor acts of ter   political protest   he corrected .    ah   said crowley bitterly .   you mean none of this cheap  massproduced murder .  just personal service  every bullet individually fired by skilled craftsmen .    aziraphale didn t rise to it .   what are we going to do now .     try and get some sleep .     you don t need sleep .  i don t need sleep .  evil never sleeps  and virtue is ever vigilant .     evil in general  maybe .  this specific part of it has got into the habit of getting its head down occasionally .   he stared into the headlights .  the time would come soon enough when sleep would be right out of the question .  when those below found out that he  personally  had lost the antichrist  they d probably dig out all those reports he d done on the spanish inquisition and try them out on him  one at a time and then all together .   he rummaged in the glove compartment  fumbled a tape at random  and slotted it into the player .  a little music would         bee elzebub has a devil put aside for me  for me      for me   murmured crowley .  his expression went blank for a moment .  then he gave a strangled scream and wrenched at the on off knob .    of course  we might be able to get a human to find him   said aziraphale thoughtfully .    what .   said crowley  distractedly .    humans are good at finding other humans .  they ve been doing it for thousands of years .  and the child is human .  as well as    you know .  he would be hidden from us  but other humans might be able to    oh  sense him  perhaps .  or spot things we wouldn t think of .     it wouldn t work .  he s the antichrist .  he s got this    sort of automatic defense  hasn t he .  even if he doesn t know it .  it won t even let people suspect him .  not yet .  not till it s ready .  suspicion will slide off him like  like    whatever it is water slides off of   he finished lamely .    got any better ideas .  got one single better idea .   said aziraphale .    no .     right  then .  it could work .  don t tell me you haven t got any front organizations you could use .  i know i have .  we could see if they can pick up the trail .     what could they do that we couldn t do .     well  for a start  they wouldn t get people to shoot one another  they wouldn t hypnotize respectable women  they       okay .  okay .  but it hasn t got a snowball s chance in hell .  believe me  i know .  but i can t think of anything better .   crowley turned onto the motorway and headed for london .    i have a   a certain network of agents   said aziraphale  after a while .   spread across the country .  a disciplined force .  i could set them searching .     i  er  have something similar   crowley admitted .   you know how it is  you never know when they might come in handy       we d better alert them .  do you think they ought to work together .    crowley shook his head .    i don t think that would be a good idea   he said .   they re not very sophisticated  politically speaking .     then we ll each contact our own people and see what they can manage .     got to be worth a try  i suppose   said crowley .   it s not as if i haven t got lots of other work to do  god knows .    his forehead creased for a moment  and then he slapped the steering wheel triumphantly .    ducks .   he shouted .    what .     that s what water slides off .    aziraphale took a deep breath .    just drive the car  please   he said wearily .   they drove back through the dawn  while the cassette player played j .  s .  bach s mass in b minor  vocals by f .  mercury .   crowley liked the city in the early morning .  its population consisted almost entirely of people who had proper jobs to do and real reasons for being there  as opposed to the unnecessary millions who trailed in after   a . m .   and the streets were more or less quiet .  there were double yellow no parking lines in the narrow road outside aziraphale s bookshop  but they obediently rolled back on themselves when the bentley pulled in to the curb .    well  okay   he said  as aziraphale got his coat from the back seat .   we ll keep in touch .  okay .     what s this .   said aziraphale  holding up a brown oblong .   crowley squinted at it .   a book .   he said .   not mine .    aziraphale turned a few of the yellowed pages .  tiny bibliophilic bells rang in the back of his mind .    it must have belonged to that young lady   he said slowly .   we ought to have got her address .     look  i m in enough trouble as it is  i don t want it to get about that i go around returning people s property to them   said crowley .   aziraphale reached the title page .  it was probably a good job .  crowley couldn t see his expression .    i suppose you could always send it to the post office there   said crowley   if you really feel you must .  address it to the mad woman with the bicycle .  never trust a woman who gives funny names to means of transport       yes  yes  certainly   said the angel .  he fumbled for his keys  dropped them on the pavement  picked them up  dropped them again  and hurried to the shop door .    we ll be in touch then  shall we .   crowley called after him .   aziraphale paused in the act of turning the key .    what .   he said .   oh .  oh .  yes .  fine .  jolly good .   and he slammed the door .    right   mumbled crowley  suddenly feeling very alone .          torchlight flicked in the lanes .   the trouble with trying to find a brown covered book among brown leaves and brown water at the bottom of a ditch of brown earth in the brown  well  grayish light of dawn  was that you couldn t .   it wasn t there .   anathema tried every method of search she could think of .  there was the methodical quartering of the ground .  there was the slapdash poking at the bracken by the roadside .  there was the nonchalant sidling up to it and looking out of the side of her eye .  she even tried the one which every romantic nerve in her body insisted should work  which consisted of theatrically giving up  sitting down  and letting her glance fall naturally on a patch of earth which  if she had been in any decent narrative  should have contained the book .   it didn t .   which meant  as she had feared all along  that it was probably in the back of a car belonging to two consenting cycle repairmen .   she could feel generations of agnes nutter s descendants laughing at her .   even if those two were honest enough to want to return it  they d hardly go to all the trouble of finding a cottage they d barely seen in the dark .   the only hope was that they wouldn t know what it was they d got .          aziraphale  like many soho merchants who specialized in hard to find books for the discerning connoisseur  had a back room  but what was in there was far more esoteric than anything normally found inside a shrink wrapped bag for the customer who knows what he wants .   he was particularly proud of his books of prophecy .   first editions  usually .   and every one was signed .   he d got robert nixon   a sixteenth century half wit  not related to any u . s .  president .   and martha the gypsy  and ignatius sybilla  and old ottwell binns .  nostradamus had signed   to myne olde friend azerafel  with beste wishes   mother shipton had spilled drink on his copy  and in a climate controlled cabinet in one corner was the original scroll in the shaky handwriting of st .  john the divine of patmos  whose  revelation  had been the all time best seller .  aziraphale had found him a nice chap  if a bit too fond of odd mushrooms .   what the collection did not have was a copy of the nice and accurate prophecies of agnes nutter  and aziraphale walked into the room holding it as a keen philatelist might hold a mauritius blue that had just turned up on a postcard from his aunt .   he d never even seen a copy before  but he d heard about it .  everyone in the trade  which considering it was a highly specialized trade meant about a dozen people  had heard of it .  its existence was a sort of vacuum around which all sorts of strange stories had been orbiting for hundreds of years .  aziraphale realized he wasn t sure if you could orbit a vacuum  and didn t care  the nice and accurate prophecies made the hitler diaries look like  well  a bunch of forgeries .   his hands hardly shook at all as he laid it down on a bench  pulled on a pair of surgical rubber gloves  and opened it reverentially .  aziraphale was an angel  but he also worshiped books .   the title page said       the nife and accurate prophefies of agnes nutter  in slightly smaller type   being a certaine and prefice hiftory from  the prefent day unto the endinge of this world .   in slightly larger type   containing therein many diuerse wonders and  precepts for the wife  in a different type   more complete than ever yet before publifhed  in smaller type but in capitals   concerning the strange times aheade  in slightly desperate italics   and events of a wonderful nature  in larger type once more    reminifent of noftradamus at hif beft      ursula shipton      the prophecies were numbered  and there were more than four thousand of them .    steady  steady   aziraphale muttered to himself .  he went into the little kitchenette and made himself some cocoa and took some deep breaths .   then he came back and read a prophecy at random .   forty minutes later  the cocoa was still untouched .          the red haired woman in the corner of the hotel bar was the most successful war correspondent in the world .  she now had a passport in the name of carmine zuigiber  and she went where the wars were .   well .  more or less .   actually she went where the wars weren t .  she d already been where the wars were .   she was not well known  except where it counted .  get half a dozen war correspondents together in an airport bar  and the conversation will  like a compass orienting to north  swing around to murchison of the new york times  to van home of newsweek  to anforth of i . t . n .  news .  the war correspondents  war correspondents .   but when murchison  and van home  and anforth ran into each other in a burnt out tin shack in beirut  or afghanistan  or the sudan  after they d admired each other s scars and had downed a few  they would exchange awed anecdotes of  red  zuigiber  from the national world weekly .    that dumb rag   murchison would say   it doesn t goddamn know what it s goddamn got .    actually the national world weekly did know just what it had got  it had a war correspondent .  it just didn t know why  or what to do with one now it had her .   a typical national world weekly would tell the world how jesus  face was seen on a big mac bun bought by someone from des moines  with an artist s impression of the bun  how elvis presley was recently sighted working in a burger lord in des moines  how listening to elvis records cured a des moines housewife s cancer  how the spate of werewolves infesting the midwest are the offspring of noble pioneer women raped by bigfoot  and that elvis was taken by space aliens in      because he was too good for this world .   remarkably  one of these stories is indeed true .    that was the national world weekly .  they sold four million copies a week  and they needed a war correspondent like they needed an exclusive interview with the general secretary of the united nations .   the interview was done in      and went as follows   q  you re the secretary of the united nations  then .   a  si .   q  ever sighted elvis .   so they paid red zuigiber a great deal of money to go and find wars  and ignored the bulging  badly typed envelopes she sent them occasionally from around the globe to justify her   generally fairly reasonable   expense claims .   they felt justified in this because  as they saw it  she really wasn t a very good war correspondent although she was undoubtedly the most attractive  which counted for a lot on the national world weekly .  her war reports were always about a bunch of guys shooting at each other  with no real understanding of the wider political ramifications  and  more importantly  no human interest .   occasionally they would hand one of her stories over to a rewrite man to fix up .    jesus appeared to nine year old manuel gonzalez during a pitched battle on the rio concorsa  and told him to go home because his mother worried about him .   i knew it was jesus   said the brave little child   because he looked like he did when his picture miraculously appeared on my sandwich box .      mostly the national world weekly left her alone  and carefully filed her stories in the rubbish bin .   murchison  and van home  and anforth didn t care about this .  all they knew was that whenever a war broke out  ms .  zuigiber was there first .  practically before .    how does she do it .   they would ask each other incredulously .   how the hell does she do it .   and their eyes would meet  and silently say  if she was a car she d be made by ferrari  she s the kind of woman you d expect to see as the beautiful consort to the corrupt generalissimo of a collapsing third world country  and she hangs around with guys like us .  we re the lucky guys  right .   ms .  zuigiber just smiled and bought another round of drinks for everybody  on the national world weekly .  and watched the fights break out around her .  and smiled .   she had been right .  journalism suited her .   even so  everyone needs a holiday  and red zuigiber was on her first in eleven years .   she was on a small mediterranean island which made its money from the tourist trade  and that in itself was odd .  red looked to be the kind of woman who  if she took a holiday on any island smaller than australia  would be doing so because she was friends with the man who owned it .  and had you told any islander a month before that war was coming  he would have laughed at you and tried to sell you a raffiawork wine holder or a picture of the bay done in seashells  that was then .   this was now .   now a deep religio political divide  concerning which of four small mainland countries they weren t actually a part of  had split the country into three factions  destroyed the statue of santa maria in the town square  and done for the tourist trade .   red zuigiber sat in the bar of the hotel de palomar del sol  drinking what passed for a cocktail .  in one corner a tired pianist played  and a waiter in a toupee crooned into a microphone    aaaaaaaaaaaonce   pon   a   time   dere   was  little white boool  aaaaaaaaaaavery   sad   because   e   was  little white bool      a man threw himself through the window  a knife between his teeth  a kalashnikov automatic rifle in one hand  a grenade in the other .    i glaim gis oteg id der gaing og der     he paused .  he took the knife out of his mouth and began again .   i claim this hotel in the name of the pro turkish liberation faction .    the last two holidaymakers remaining on the island  mr .  and mrs .  thomas threlfall  of    the elms  paignton .  they always maintained that one of the nice things about going on holiday was not having to read the newspapers or listen to the news  just getting away from it all really .  and due to a tummy bug contracted by mr .  threlfall  and mrs .  threlfall rather overdoing it in the sun their first day  this was their first time out of their hotel room for a week and a half .   climbed underneath their table .  red unconcernedly withdrew the maraschino cherry from her drink  put it to her scarlet lips  and sucked it slowly off its stick in a way that made several men in the room break into a cold sweat .   the pianist stood up  reached into his piano  and pulled out a vintage sub machine gun .   this hotel has already been claimed by the progreek territorial brigade .   he screamed .   make one false move  and i shoot out your living daylight .    there was a motion at the door .  a huge  black bearded individual with a golden smile and a genuine antique gatling gun stood there  with a cohort of equally huge although less impressively armed men behind him .    this strategically important hotel  for years a symbol of the fascist imperialist turko greek running dog tourist trade  is now the property of the italo maltese freedom fighters .   he boomed affably .   now we kill everybody .     rubbish .   said the pianist .   is not strategically important .  just has extremely well stocked wine cellar .     he s right  pedro   said the man with the kalashnikov   that s why my lot wanted it .  il general ernesto de montoya said to me  he said  fernando  the war ll be over by saturday  and the lads ll be wanting a good time .  pop down to the hotel de palomar del sol and claim it as booty  will you .    the bearded man turned red .   is bloddy important strategically  fernando chianti .  i drew big map of the island and is right in the middle  which makes it pretty bloddy strategically important  i can tell you .     ha .   said fernando .   you might as well say that just because little diego s house has a view of the decadent capitalist topless private beach  that it s strategically important .    the pianist blushed a deep red .   our lot got that this morning   he admitted .   there was silence .   in the silence was a faint  silken rasping .  red had uncrossed her legs .   the pianist s adam s apple bobbed up and down .   well  it s pretty strategically important   he managed  trying to ignore the woman on the bar stool .   i mean  if someone landed a submarine on it  you d want to be somewhere you could see it all .    silence .    well  it s a lot more strategically important than this hotel anyway   he finished .   pedro coughed  ominously .   the next person who says anything .  anything at all .  is dead .   he grinned .  hefted his gun .   right .  now everyone against far wall .    nobody moved .  they weren t listening to him any more .  they were listening to a low  indistinct murmuring from the hallway behind him  quiet and monotonous .   there was some shuffling among the cohort in the doorway .  they seemed to be doing their best to stand firm  but they were being inexorably edged out of the way by the muttering  which had begun to resolve itself into audible phrases .   don t mind me  gents  what a night  eh .  three times round the island  nearly didn t find the place  someone doesn t believe in signposts  eh .  still  found it in the end  had to stop and ask four times  finally asked at the post office  they always know at the post office  had to draw me a map though  got it here somewhere      sliding serenely past the men with guns  like a pike through a trout pond  came a small  bespectacled man in a blue uniform  carrying a long  thin  brown paper wrapped parcel  tied with string .  his sole concession to the climate were his open toed brown plastic sandals  although the green woolen socks he wore underneath them showed his deep and natural distrust of foreign weather .   he had a peaked cap on  with international express written on it in large white letters .   he was unarmed  but no one touched him .  no one even pointed a gun at him .  they just stared .   the little man looked around the room  scanning the faces  and then looking back down at his clipboard  then he walked straight over to red  still sitting on her bar stool .   package for you  miss   he said .   red took it  and began to untie the string .   the international express man coughed discreetly and presented the journalist with a well thumbed receipt pad and a yellow plastic ballpoint pen attached to the clipboard by a piece of string .   you have to sign for it  miss .  just there .  print your full name over here  signature down there .     of course .   red signed the receipt pad  illegibly  then printed her name .  the name she wrote was not carmine zuigiber .  it was a much shorter name .   the man thanked her kindly  and made his way out  muttering lovely place you ve got here  gents  always meant to come out here on holiday  sorry to trouble you  excuse me  sir    and he passed out of their lives as serenely as he had come .   red finished opening the parcel .  people began to edge around to get a better look .  inside the package was a large sword .   she examined it .  it was a very straightforward sword  long and sharp  it looked both old and unused  and it had nothing ornamental or impressive about it .  this was no magical sword  no mystic weapon of power and might .  it was very obviously a sword created to slice  chop  cut  preferably kill  but  failing that  irreparably maim  a very large number of people indeed .  it had an indefinable aura of hatred and menace .   red clasped the hilt in her exquisitely manicured right hand  and held it up to eye level .  the blade glinted .    awwwright .   she said  stepping down from the stool .   finally .    she finished the drink  hefted the sword over one shoulder  and looked around at the puzzled factions  who now encircled her completely .   sorry to run out on you  chaps   she said .   would love to stay and get to know you better .    the men in the room suddenly realized that they didn t want to know her better .  she was beautiful  but she was beautiful in the way a forest fire was beautiful  something to be admired from a distance  not up close .   and she held her sword  and she smiled like a knife .   there were a number of guns in that room  and slowly  tremblingly  they were focused on her chest  and her back  and head .   they encircled her completely .    don t move .   croaked pedro .   everybody else nodded .   red shrugged .  she began to walk forward .   every finger on every trigger tightened  almost of its own accord .  lead and the smell of cordite filled the air .  red s cocktail glass smashed in her hand .  the room s remaining mirrors exploded in lethal shards .  part of the ceiling fell down .   and then it was over .   carmine zuigiber turned and stared at the bodies surrounding her as if she hadn t the faintest idea of how they came to be there .   she licked a spatter of blood   someone else s   from the back of her hand with a scarlet  cat like tongue .  then she smiled .   and she walked out of the bar  her heels clicking on the tiles like the tapping of distant hammers .   the two holidaymakers climbed out from under the table and surveyed the carnage .    this wouldn t of happened if we d of gone to torremolinos like we usually do   said one of them  plaintively .    foreigners   sighed the other .   they re just not like us  patricia .     that settles it  then .  next year we go to brighton   said mrs .  threlfall  completely missing the significance of what had just happened .   it meant there wouldn t be any next year .   it rather lowered the odds on there being any next week to speak of .       thursday   there was a newcomer in the village .   new people were always a source of interest and speculation among the them   it didn t matter what the four had called their gang over the years  the frequent name changes usually being prompted by whatever adam had happened to have read or viewed the previous day  the adam young squad  adam and co .   the hole in the chalk gang  the really well known four  the legion of really super heroes  the quarry gang  the secret four  the justice society of tadfield  the galaxatrons  the four just persons  the rebels  .  everyone else always referred to them darkly as them  and eventually they did too .   but this time pepper had impressive news .    she s moved into jasmine cottage and she s a witch   she said .   i know  because mrs .  henderson does the cleaning and she told my mother she gets a witches  newspaper .  she gets loads of ordinary newspapers  too  but she gets this special witches  one .     my father says there s no such thing as witches   said wensleydale  who had fair  wavy hair  and peered seriously out at life through thick black rimmed spectacles .  it was widely believed that he had once been christened jeremy  but no one ever used the name  not even his parents  who called him youngster .  they did this in the subconscious hope that he might take the hint  wensleydale gave the impression of having been born with a mental age of forty seven .    don t see why not   said brian  who had a wide  cheerful face  under an apparently permanent layer of grime .   i don t see why witches shouldn t have their own newspaper .  with stories about all the latest spells and that .  my father gets anglers  mail  and i bet there s more witches than anglers .     it s called psychic news   volunteered pepper .    that s not witches   said wensleydale .   my aunt has that .  that s just spoon bending and fortune telling and people thinking they were queen elizabeth the first in another life .  there s no witches any more  actually .  people invented medicines and that and told  em they didn t need  em any more and started burning  em .     it could have pictures of frogs and things   said brian  who was reluctant to let a good idea go to waste .   an    an  road tests of broomsticks .  and a cats  column .     anyway  your aunt could be a witch   said pepper .   in secret .  she could be your aunt all day and go witching at night .     not my aunt   said wensleydale darkly .    an  recipes   said brian .   new uses for leftover toad .     oh  shut up   said pepper .   brian snorted .  if it had been wensley who had said that  there d have been a half hearted scuffle  as between friends .  but the other them had long ago learned that pepper did not consider herself bound by the informal conventions of brotherly scuffles .  she could kick and bite with astonishing physiological accuracy for a girl of eleven .  besides  at eleven years old the them were beginning to be bothered by the dim conception that laying hands on good ole pep moved things into blood thumping categories they weren t entirely at home with yet  besides earning you a snake fast blow that would have floored the karate kid .   but she was good to have in your gang .  they remembered with pride the time when greasy johnson and his gang had taunted them for playing with a girl .  pepper had erupted with a fury that had caused greasy s mother to come round that evening and complain .    greasy johnson was a sad and oversized child .  there s one in every school  not exactly fat  but simply huge and wearing almost the same size clothes as his father .  paper tore under his tremendous fingers  pens shattered in his grip .  children whom he tried to play with in quiet  friendly games ended up getting under his huge feet  and greasy johnson had become a bully almost in self defense .  after all  it was better to be called a bully  which at least implied some sort of control and desire  than to be called a big clumsy oaf .  he was the despair of the sports master  because if greasy johnson had taken the slightest interest in sport  then the school could have been champions .  but greasy johnson had never found a sport that suited him .  he was instead secretly devoted to his collection of tropical fish  which won him prizes .  greasy johnson was the same age as adam young  to within a few hours  and his parents had never told him he was adopted .  see .  you were right about the babies .    pepper looked upon him  a giant male  as a natural enemy .   she herself had short red hair and a face which was not so much freckled as one big freckle with occasional areas of skin .   pepper s given first names were pippin galadriel moonchild .  she had been given them in a naming ceremony in a muddy valley field that contained three sick sheep and a number of leaky polythene teepees .  her mother had chosen the welsh valley of pant y gyrdl as the ideal site to return to nature .   six months later  sick of the rain  the mosquitoes  the men  the tent trampling sheep who ate first the whole commune s marijuana crop and then its antique minibus  and by now beginning to glimpse why almost the entire drive of human history has been an attempt to get as far away from nature as possible  pepper s mother returned to pepper s surprised grandparents in tadfield  bought a bra  and enrolled in a sociology course with a deep sigh of relief .    there are only two ways a child can go with a name like pippin galadriel moonchild  and pepper had chosen the other one  the three male them had learned this on their first day of school  in the playground  at the age of four .   they had asked her her name  and  all innocent  she had told them .   subsequently a bucket of water had been needed to separate pippin galadriel moonchild s teeth from adam s shoe .  wensleydale s first pair of spectacles had been broken  and brian s sweater needed five stitches .   the them were together from then on  and pepper was pepper forever  except to her mother  and  when they were feeling especially courageous  and the them were almost out of earshot  greasy johnson and the johnsonites  the village s only other gang .   adam drummed his heels on the edge of the milk crate that was doing the office of a seat  listening to this bickering with the relaxed air of a king listening to the idle chatter of his courtiers .   he chewed lazily on a straw .  it was a thursday morning .  the holidays stretched ahead  endless and unsullied .  they needed filling up .   he let the conversation float around him like the buzzing of grasshoppers or  more precisely  like a prospector watching the churning gravel for a glint of useful gold .    in our sunday paper it said there was thousands of witches in the country   said brian .   worshiping nature and eating health food an  that .  so i don t see why we shouldn t have one round here .  they were floodin  the country with a wave of mindless evil  it said .     what  by worshipin  nature and eatin  health food .   said wensleydale .    that s what it said .    the them gave this due consideration .  they had once   at adam s instigation   tried a health food diet for a whole afternoon .  their verdict was that you could live very well on healthy food provided you had a big cooked lunch beforehand .   brian leaned forward conspiratorially .    andit said they dance round with no clothes on   he added .   they go up on hills and stonehenge and stuff  and dance with no clothes on .    this time the consideration was more thoughtful .  the them had reached that position where  as it were  the roller coaster of life had almost completed the long haul to the top of the first big humpback of puberty so that they could just look down into the precipitous ride ahead  full of mystery  terror  and exciting curves .    huh   said pepper .    not my aunt   said wensleydale  breaking the spell .   definitely not my aunt .  she just keeps trying to talk to my uncle .     your uncle s dead   said pepper .    she says he still moves a glass about   said wensleydale defensively .   my father says it was moving glasses about the whole time that made him dead in the first place .  don t know why she wants to talk to him   he added   they never talked much when he was alive .     that s necromancy  that is   said brian .   it s in the bible .  she ought to stop it .  god s dead against necromancy .  and witches .  you can go to hell for it .    there was a lazy shifting of position on the milk crate throne .  adam was going to speak .   the them fell silent .  adam was always worth listening to .  deep in their hearts  the them knew that they weren t a gang of four .  they were a gang of three  which belonged to adam .  but if you wanted excitement  and interest  and crowded days  then every them would prize a lowly position in adam s gang above leadership of any other gang anywhere .    don t see why everyone s so down on witches   adam said .   the them glanced at one another .  this sounded promising .    well  they blight crops   said pepper .   and sink ships .  and tell you if you re going to be king and stuff .  and brew up stuff with herbs .     my mother uses herbs   said adam .   so does yours .     oh  those are all right   said brian  determined not to lose his position as occult expert .   i expect god said it was all right to use mint and sage and so on .  stands to reason there s nothing wrong with mint and sage .     and they can make you be ill just by looking at you   said pepper .   it s called the evil eye .  they give you a look  and then you get ill and no one knows why .  and they make a model of you and stick it full of pins and you get ill where all the pins are   she added cheerfully .    that sort of thing doesn t happen any more   reiterated wensleydale  the rational thinking person .    cos we invented science and all the vicars set fire to the witches for their own good .  it was called the spanish inquisition .     then i reckon we should find out if her at jasmine cottage is a witch and if she is we should tell mr .  pickersgill   said brian .  mr .  pickersgill was the vicar .  currently he was in dispute with the them over subjects ranging from climbing the yew tree in the churchyard to ringing the bells and running away .    i don t reckon it s allowed  going round setting fire to people   said adam .   otherwise peopled be doin  it all the time .     it s all right if you re religious   said brian reassuringly .   and it stops the witches from goin  to hell  so i expect they d be quite grateful if they understood it properly .     can t see picky setting fire to anyone   said pepper .    oh  i dunno   said brian  meaningfully .    not actually setting them on actual fire   sniffed pepper .   he s more likely to tell their parents  and leave it up to them if anyone s goin  to be set on fire or not .    the them shook their heads in disgust at the current low standards of ecclesiastical responsibility .  then the other three looked expectantly at adam .   they always looked expectantly at adam .  he was the one that had the ideas .    p raps we ought to do it ourselves   he said .   someone ought to be doing something if there s all these witches about .  it s   it s like that neighborhood watch scheme .     neighborhood witch   said pepper .    no   said adam coldly .    but we can t be the spanish inquisition   said wensleydale .   we re not spanish .     i bet you don t have to be spanish to be the spanish inquisition   said adam .   i bet it s like scottish eggs or american hamburgers .  it just has to look spanish .  we ve just got to make it look spanish .  then everyone would know it s the spanish inquisition .    there was silence .   it was broken by the crackling of one of the empty crisp packets that accumulated wherever brian was sitting .  they looked at him .    i ve got a bullfight poster with my name on it   said brian  slowly .          lunchtime came and went .  the new spanish inquisition reconvened .   the head inquisitor inspected it critically .    what re those .   he demanded .    you click them together when you dance   said wensleydale  a shade defensively .   my aunt brought them back from spain years ago .  they re called maracas  i think .  they ve got a picture of a spanish dancer on them  look .     what s she dancing with a bull for .   said adam .    that s to show it s spanish   said wensleydale .  adam let it pass .   the bullfight poster was everything brian had promised .   pepper had something rather like a gravy boat made out of raffia .    it s for putting wine in   she said defiantly .   my mother brought it back from spain .     it hasn t got a bull on it   said adam severely .    it doesn t have to   pepper countered  moving just ever so slightly into a fighting stance .   adam hesitated .  his sister sarah and her boyfriend had also been to spain .  sarah had returned with a very large purple toy donkey which  while definitely spanish  did not come up to what adam instinctively felt should be the tone of the spanish inquisition .  the boyfriend  on the other hand  had brought back a very ornate sword which  despite its tendency to bend when picked up and go blunt when asked to cut paper  proclaimed itself to be made of toledo steel .  adam had spent an instructive half hour with the encyclopedia and felt that this was just what the inquisition needed .  subtle hints had not worked  however .   in the end adam had taken a bunch of onions from the kitchen .  they might well have been spanish .  but even adam had to concede that  as decor for the inquisitorial premises  they lacked that certain something .  he was in no position to argue too vehemently about raffia wine holders .    very good   he said .    you certain they re spanish onions .   said pepper  relaxing .     course   said adam .   spanish onions .  everyone knows that .     they could be french   said pepper doggedly .   france is famous for onions .     it doesn t matter   said adam  who was getting fed up with onions .   france is nearly spanish  an  i don t expect witches know the difference  what with spendin  all their time flyin  around at night .  it all looks like the continong to witches .  anyway  if you don t like it you can jolly well go and start your own inquisition  anyway .    for once  pepper didn t push it .  she d been promised the post of head torturer .  no one doubted who was going to be chief inquisitor .   wensleydale and brian were less enthralled with their roles of inquisitorial guards .    well  you don t know any spanish   said adam  whose lunch hour had included ten minutes with a phrase book sarah had bought in a haze of romanticism in alicante .    that doesn t matter  because actually you have to talk in latin   said wensleydale  who had also been doing some slightly more accurate lunchtime reading .    and spanish   said adam firmly .   that s why it s the spanish inquisition .     i don t see why it shouldn t be a british inquisition   said brian .   don t see why we should of fought the armada and everything  just to have their smelly inquisition .    this had been slightly bothering adam s patriotic sensibilities as well .    i reckon   he said   that we should sort of start spanish  and then make it the british inquisition when we ve got the hang of it .  and now   he added   the inquisitorial guard will go and fetch the first witch  por favor .    the new inhabitant of jasmine cottage would have to wait  they d decided .  what they needed to do was start small and work their way up .           art thou a witch  oh lay .   said the chief inquisitor .    yes   said pepper s little sister  who was six and built like a small golden haired football .    you mustn t say yes  you ve got to say no   hissed the head torturer  nudging the suspect .    and then what .   demanded the suspect .    and then we torture you to make you say yes   said the head torturer .   i told you .  it s good fun  the torturin  .  it doesn t hurt .  hastar lar visa  she added quickly .   the little suspect gave the decor of the inquisitorial headquarters a disparaging look .  there was a decided odor of onions .    huh   she said .   i want to be a witch  wiv a warty nose an  a green skin an  a lovely cat an  i d call it blackie  an  lots of potions an       the head torturer nodded to the chief inquisitor .    look   said pepper  desperately   no one s saying you can t be a witch  you jus  have to say you re not a witch .  no point in us taking all this trouble   she added severely   if you re going to go round saying yes the minute we ask you .    the suspect considered this .    but i wants to be a witch   she wailed .  the male them exchanged exhausted glances .  this was out of their league .    if you just say no   said pepper   you can have my sindy stable set .  i ve never ever used it   she added  glaring at the other them and daring them to make a comment .    you have used it   snapped her sister   i ve seen it and it s all worn out and the bit where you put the hay is broke and      adam gave a magisterial cough .    art thou a witch  viva espana .   he repeated .   the sister took a look at pepper s face  and decided not to chance it .    no   she decided .          it was a very good torture  everyone agreed .  the trouble was getting the putative witch off it .   it was a hot afternoon and the inquisitorial guards felt that they were being put upon .    don t see why me and brother brian should have to do all the work   said brother wensleydale  wiping the sweat off his brow .   i reckon it s about time she got off and we had a go .  benedictine ina decanter .     why have we stopped .   demanded the suspect  water pouring out of her shoes .   it had occurred to the chief inquisitor during his researches that the british inquisition was probably not yet ready for the reintroduction of the iron maiden and the choke pear .  but an illustration of a medieval ducking stool suggested that it was tailor made for the purpose .  all you needed was a pond and some planks and a rope .  it was the sort of combination that always attracted the them  who never had much difficulty in finding all three .   the suspect was now green to the waist .    it s just like a seesaw   she said .   whee .     i m going to go home unless i can have a go   muttered brother brian .   don t see why evil witches should have all the fun .     it s not allowed for inquisitors to be tortured too   said the chief inquisitor sternly  but without much real feeling .  it was a hot afternoon  the inquisitorial robes of old sacking were scratchy and smelled of stale barley  and the pond looked astonishingly inviting .    all right  all right   he said  and turned to the suspect .   you re a witch  all right  don t do it again  and now you get off and let someone else have a turn .  oh lay   he added .    what happens now .   said pepper s sister .   adam hesitated .  setting fire to her would probably cause no end of trouble  he reasoned .  besides  she was too soggy to burn .   he was also distantly aware that at some future point there would be questions asked about muddy shoes and duckweed encrusted pink dresses .  but that was the future  and it lay at the other end of along warm afternoon that contained planks and ropes and ponds .  the future could wait .          the future came and went in the mildly discouraging way that futures do  although mr .  young had other things on his mind apart from muddy dresses and merely banned adam from watching television  which meant he had to watch it on the old black and white set in his bedroom .    i don t see why we should have a hosepipe ban   adam heard mr .  young telling mrs .  young .   i pay my rates like everyone else .  the garden looks like the sahara desert .  i m surprised there was any water left in the pond .  i blame it on the lack of nuclear testing  myself .  you used to get proper summers when i was a boy .  it used to rain all the time .    now adam slouched alone along the dusty lane .  it was a good slouch .  adam had a way of slouching along that offended all right thinking people .  it wasn t that he just allowed his body to droop .  he could slouch with inflections  and now the set of his shoulders reflected the hurt and bewilderment of those unjustly thwarted in their selfless desire to help their fellow men .   dust hung heavy on the bushes .    serve everyone right if the witches took over the whole country and made everyone eat health food and not go to church and dance around with no clothes on   he said  kicking a stone .  he had to admit that  except perhaps for the health food  the prospect wasn t too worrying .    i bet if they d jus  let us get started properly we could of found hundreds of witches   he told himself  kicking a stone .   i bet ole torturemada dint have to give up jus  when he was getting started just because some stupid witch got her dress dirty .    dog slouched along dutifully behind his master .  this wasn t  insofar as the hell hound had any expectations  what he had imagined life would be like in the last days before armageddon  but despite himself he was beginning to enjoy it .   he heard his master say   bet even the victorians didn t force people to have to watch black and white television .    form shapes nature .  there are certain ways of behavior appropriate to small scruffy dogs which are in fact welded into the genes .  you can t just become small dog shaped and hope to stay the same person  a certain intrinsic small dogness begins to permeate your very being .   he d already chased a rat .  it had been the most enjoyable experience of his life .    serve  em right if we re all overcome by evil forces   his master grumbled .   and then there were cats  thought dog .  he d surprised the huge ginger cat from next door and had attempted to reduce it to cowering jelly by means of the usual glowing stare and deep throated growl  which had always worked on the damned in the past .  this time they earned him a whack on the nose that had made his eyes water .  cats  dog considered  were clearly a lot tougher than lost souls .  he was looking forward to a further cat experiment  which he d planned would consist of jumping around and yapping excitedly at it .  it was a long shot  but it might just work .    they just better not come running to me when ole picky is turned into a frog  that s all   muttered adam .   it was at this point that two facts dawned on him .  one was that his disconsolate footsteps had led him past jasmine cottage .  the other was that someone was crying .   adam was a soft touch for tears .  he hesitated a moment  and then cautiously peered over the hedge .   to anathema  sitting in a deck chair and halfway through a packet of kleenex  it looked like the rise of a small  dishevelled sun .   adam doubted that she was a witch .  adam had a very clear mental picture of a witch .  the youngs restricted themselves to the only possible choice amongst the better class of sunday newspaper  and so a hundred years of enlightened occultism had passed adam by .  she didn t have a hooked nose or warts  and she was young    well  quite young .  that was good enough for him .    hallo   he said  unslouching .   she blew her nose and stared at him .   what was looking over the hedge should be described at this point .  what anathema saw was  she said later  something like a prepubescent greek god .  or maybe a biblical illustration  one which showed muscular angels doing some righteous smiting .  it was a face that didn t belong in the twentieth century .  it was thatched with golden curls which glowed .  michelangelo should have sculpted it .   he probably would not have included the battered sneakers  frayed jeans  or grubby t shirt  though .    who re you .   she said .    i m adam young   said adam .   i live just down the lane .     oh .  yes .  i ve heard of you   said anathema  dabbing at her eyes .  adam preened .    mrs .  henderson said i was to be sure to keep an eye out for you   she went on .    i m well known around here   said adam .    she said you were born to hang   said anathema .   adam grinned .  notoriety wasn t as good as fame  but was heaps better than obscurity .    she said you were the worst of the lot of them   said anathema  looking a little more cheerful .  adam nodded .    she said   you watch out for them  miss  they re nothing but a pack of ringleaders .  that young adam s full of the old adam    she said .    what ve you been cryin  for .   said adam bluntly .    oh .  oh  i ve just lost something   said anathema .   a book .     i ll help you look for it  if you like   said adam gallantly .   i know quite a lot about books  actually .  i wrote a book once .  it was a triffic book .  it was nearly eight pages long .  it was about this pirate who was a famous detective .  and i drew the pictures .   and then  in a flash of largess  he added   if you like i ll let you read it .  i bet it was a lot more excitin  than any book you ve lost .   specially the bit in the spaceship where the dinosaur comes out and fights with the cowboys .  i bet it d cheer you up  my book .  it cheered up brian no end .  he said he d never been so cheered up .     thank you  i m sure your book is a very good book   she said  endearing herself to adam forever .   but i don t need you to help look for my book   i think it s too late now .    she looked thoughtfully at adam .   i expect you know this area very well .   she said .    for miles an  miles   said adam .    you haven t seen two men in a big black car .   said anathema .    did they steal it .   said adam  suddenly full of interest .  foiling a gang of international book thieves would make a rewarding end to the day .    not really .  sort of .  i mean  they didn t mean to .  they were looking for the manor  but i went up there today and no one knows anything about them .  there was some sort of accident or something  i believe .    she stared at adam .  there was something odd about him  but she couldn t put her finger on it .  she just had an urgent feeling that he was important and shouldn t be allowed to drift away .  something about him      what s the book called .   said adam .    the nice and accurate prophecies of agnes nutter  witch   said anathema .    which what .     no .  witch .  like in macbeth   said anathema .    i saw that   said adam .   it was really interesting  the way them kings carried on .  gosh .  what s nice about  em .     nice used to mean  well  precise .  or exact .   definitely something strange .  a sort of laid back intensity .  you started to feel that if he was around  then everyone else  even the landscape  was just background .   she d been here a month .  except for mrs .  henderson  who in theory looked after the cottage and probably went through her things given half a chance  she hadn t exchanged more than a dozen real words with anyone .  she let them think she was an artist .  this was the kind of countryside that artists liked .   actually  it was bloody beautiful .  just around this village it was superb .  if turner and landseer had met samuel palmer in a pub and worked it all out  and then got stubbs to do the horses  it couldn t have been better .   and that was depressing  because this was where it was going to happen .  according to agnes  anyway .  in a book which she  anathema  had allowed to be lost .  she had the file cards  of course  but they just weren t the same .   if anathema had been in full control of her own mind at that moment   and no one around adam was ever in full control of his or her own mind   she d have noticed that whenever she tried to think about him beyond a superficial level her thoughts slipped away like a duck off water .    wicked .   said adam  who had been turning over in his mind the implications of a book of nice and accurate prophecies .   it tells you who s going to win the grand national  does it .     no   said anathema .    any spaceships in it .     not many   said anathema .    robots .   said adam hopefully .    sorry .     doesn t sound very nice to me  then   said adam .   don t see what the future s got in it if there s no robots and spaceships .    about three days  thought anathema glumly .  that s what it s got in it .    would you like a lemonade .   she said .   adam hesitated .  then he decided to take the bull by the horns .    look   scuse me for askin   if it s not a personal question  but are you a witch .   he said .   anathema narrowed her eyes .  so much for mrs .  henderson poking around .    some people might say so   she said .   actually  i m an occultist .     oh .  well .  that s all right  then   said adam  cheering up .   she looked him up and down .    you know what an occultist is  do you .   she said .    oh  yes   said adam confidently .    well  so long as you re happier now   said anathema .   come on in .  i could do with a drink myself .  and    adam young .     yes .     you were thinking  nothin  wrong with my eyes  they don t need examining   weren t you .     who  me .   said adam guiltily .          dog was the problem .  he wouldn t go in the cottage .  he crouched on the doorstep  growling .    come on  you silly dog   said adam .   it s only old jasmine cottage .   he gave anathema an embarrassed look .   normally he does everything i say  right off .     you can leave him in the garden   said anathema .    no   said adam .   he s got to do what he s tole .  i read it in a book .  trainin  is very important .  any dog can be trained  it said .  my father said i can only keep him if he s prop ly trained .  now  dog .  go inside .    dog whined and gave him a pleading look .  his stubby tail thumped on the floor once or twice .   his master s voice .   with extreme reluctance  as if making progress in the teeth of a gale  he slunk over the doorstep .    there   said adam proudly .   good boy .    and a little bit more of hell burned away     anathema shut the door .   there had always been a horseshoe over the door of jasmine cottage  ever since its first tenant centuries before  the black death was all the rage at the time and he d considered that he could use all the protection he could get .   it was corroded and half covered with the paint of centuries .  so neither adam nor anathema gave it a thought  or noticed how it was now cooling from a white heat .          aziraphale s cocoa was stone cold .   the only sound in the room was the occasional turning of a page .   every now and again there was a rattling at the door when prospective customers of intimate books next door mistook the entrance .  he ignored it .   occasionally he would very nearly swear .          anathema hadn t really made herself at home in the cottage .  most of her implements were piled up on the table .  it looked interesting .  it looked  in fact  as though a voodoo priest had just had the run of a scientific equipment store .    brilliant .   said adam  prodding at it .   what s the thing with the three legs .     it s a theodolite   said anathema from the kitchen .   it s for tracking ley lines .     what are they  then .   said adam .   she told him .    cor   he said .   are they .     yes .     all over the place .     yes .     i ve never seen  em .  amazin   there bein  all these invisible lines of force around and me not seeing  em .    adam didn t often listen  but he spent the most enthralling twenty minutes of his life  or at least of his life that day .  no one in the young household so much as touched wood or threw salt over their shoulder .  the only nod in the direction of the supernatural was a half hearted pretense  when adam had been younger  that father christmas came down the chimney .   if adam had been in full possession of his powers in those days  the youngs  christmas would have been spoiled by the discovery of a dead fat man upside down in their central heating duct .    he d been starved of anything more occult than a harvest festival .  her words poured into his mind like water into a quire of blotting paper .   dog lay under the table and growled .  he was beginning to have serious doubts about himself .   anathema didn t only believe in ley lines  but in seals  whales  bicycles  rain forests  whole grain in loaves  recycled paper  white south africans out of south africa  and americans out of practically everywhere down to and including long island .  she didn t compartmentalize her beliefs .  they were welded into one enormous  seamless belief  compared with which that held by joan of arc seemed a mere idle notion .  on any scale of mountain moving it shifted at least point five of an alp .   it may be worth noting here that most human beings can rarely raise more than  .   of an alp     centi alps  .  adam believed things on a scale ranging from   through to        everests .    no one had even used the word  environment  in adam s hearing before .  the south american rain forests were a closed book to adam  and it wasn t even made of recycled paper .   the only time he interrupted her was to agree with her views on nuclear power   i ve been to a nucular power station .  it was boring .  there was no green smoke and bubbling stuff in tubes .  shouldn t be allowed  not having proper bubbling stuff when people have come all the way to see it  and having just a lot of men standin  around not even wearin  space suits .     they do all the bubbling after visitors have gone home   said anathema grimly .    huh   said adam .    they should be done away with this minute .     serve them right for not bubblin    said adam .   anathema nodded .  she was still trying to put her finger on what was so odd about adam  and then she realized what it was .   he had no aura .   she was quite an expert on auras .  she could see them  if she stared hard enough .  they were a little glow of light around people s heads  and according to a book she d read the color told you things about their health and general well being .  everyone had one .  in mean minded  closed in people they were a faint  trembling outline  whereas expansive and creative people might have one extending several inches from the body .   she d never heard of anyone without one  but she couldn t see one around adam at all .  yet he seemed cheerful  enthusiastic  and as wellbalanced as a gyroscope .   maybe i m just tired  she thought .   anyway  she was pleased and gratified to find such a rewarding student  and even loaned him some copies of new aquarian digest  a small magazine edited by a friend of hers .   it changed his life .  at least  it changed his life for that day .   to his parents  astonishment he went to bed early  and then lay under the blankets until after midnight with a torch  the magazines  and a bag of lemon drops .  the occasional  brilliant .   emerged from his ferocious chewing mouth .   when the batteries ran out he emerged into the darkened room and lay back with his head pillowed in his hands  apparently watching the squadron of x wing   fighters that hung from the ceiling .  they moved gently in the night breeze .   but adam wasn t really watching them .  he was staring instead into the brightly lit panorama of his own imagination  which was whirling like a fairground .   this wasn t wensleydale s aunt and a wineglass .  this sort of occulting was a lot more interesting .   besides  he liked anathema .  of course  she was very old  but when adam liked someone he wanted to make them happy .   he wondered how he could make anathema happy .   it used to be thought that the events that changed the world were things like big bombs  maniac politicians  huge earthquakes  or vast population movements  but it has now been realized that this is a very oldfashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought .  the things that really change the world  according to chaos theory  are the tiny things .  a butterfly flaps its wings in the amazonian jungle  and subsequently a storm ravages half of europe .   somewhere in adam s sleeping head  a butterfly had emerged .   it might  or might not  have helped anathema get a clear view of things if she d been allowed to spot the very obvious reason why she couldn t see adam s aura .   it was for the same reason that people in trafalgar square can t see england .          alarms went off .   of course  there s nothing special about alarms going off in the control room of a nuclear power station .  they do it all the time .  it s because there are many dials and meters and things that something important might not get noticed if it doesn t at least beep .   and the job of shift charge engineer calls for a solid  capable  unflappable kind of man  the kind you can depend upon not to make a beeline for the car park in an emergency .  the kind of man  in fact  who gives the impression of smoking a pipe even when he s not .   it was      a . m .  in the control room of turning point power station  normally a nice quiet time when there is nothing much to do but fill in the log and listen to the distant roar of the turbines .   until now .   horace gander looked at the flashing red lights .  then he looked at some dials .  then he looked at the faces of his fellow workers .  then he raised his eyes to the big dial at the far end of the room .  four hundred and twenty practically dependable and very nearly cheap megawatts were leaving the station .  according to the other dials  nothing was producing them .   he didn t say  that s weird .   he wouldn t have said  that s weird  if a flock of sheep had cycled past playing violins .  it wasn t the sort of thing a responsible engineer said .   what he did say was   alf  you d better ring the station manager .    three very crowded hours went past .  they involved quite a lot of phone calls  telexes  and faxes .  twenty seven people were got out of bed in quick succession and they got another fifty three out of bed  because if there is one thing a man wants to know when he s woken up in a panic at      a . m .   it s that he s not alone .   anyway  you need all sorts of permissions before they let you unscrew the lid of a nuclear reactor and look inside .   they got them .  they unscrewed it .  they had a look inside .   horace gander said   there s got to be a sensible reason for this .  five hundred tons of uranium don t just get up and walk away .    a meter in his hand should have been screaming .  instead  it let out the occasional halfhearted tick .   where the reactor should have been was an empty space .  you could have had quite a nice game of squash in it .   right at the bottom  all alone in the center of the bright cold floor  was a lemon drop .   outside in the cavernous turbine hall the machines roared on .   and  a hundred miles away  adam young turned over in his sleep .       friday   raven sable  slim and bearded and dressed all in black  sat in the back of his slimline black limousine  talking on his slimline black telephone to his west coast base .    how s it going .   he asked .    looking good  chief   said his marketing head .   i m doing breakfast with the buyers from all the leading supermarket chains tomorrow .  no problem .  we ll have meals in all the stores this time next month .     good work  nick .     no problem .  no problem .  it s knowing you re behind us  rave .  you give great leadership  guy .  works for me every time .     thank you   said sable  and he broke the connection .   he was particularly proud of meals   .   the newtrition corporation had started small  eleven years ago .  a small team of food scientists  a huge team of marketing and public relations personnel  and a neat logo .   two years of newtrition investment and research had produced chow .  chow   contained spun  plaited  and woven protein molecules  capped and coded  carefully designed to be ignored by even the most ravenous digestive tract enzymes  no cal sweeteners  mineral oils replacing vegetable oils  fibrous materials  colorings  and flavorings .  the end result was a foodstuff almost indistinguishable from any other except for two things .  firstly  the price  which was slightly higher  and secondly the nutritional content  which was roughly equivalent to that of a sony walkman .  it didn t matter how much you ate  you lost weight .   and hair .  and skin tone .  and  if you ate enough of it long enough  vital signs .    fat people had bought it .  thin people who didn t want to get fat had bought it .  chow   was the ultimate diet food   carefully spun  woven  textured  and pounded to imitate anything  from potatoes to venison  although the chicken sold best .   sable sat back and watched the money roll in .  he watched chow   gradually fill the ecological niche that used to be filled by the old  untrademarked food .   he followed chows with snacks   junk food made from real junk .   meals   was sable s latest brainwave .   mealsd was chown  with added sugar and fat .  the theory was that if you ate enough meals   you would a  get very fat  and b  die of malnutrition .   the paradox delighted sable .   meals   were currently being tested all over america .  pizza meals  fish meals  szechuan meals  macrobiotic rice meals .  even hamburger meals .   sable s limousine was parked in the lot of a des moines  iowa  burger lord   a fast food franchise wholly owned by his organization .  it was here they d been piloting hamburger meals for the last six months .  he wanted to see what kind of results they d been getting .   he leaned forward  tapped the chauffeur s glass partition .  the chauffeur pressed a switch  and the glass slid open .    sir .     i m going to take a look at our operation  marlon .  i ll be ten minutes .  then back to l . a .    sir .   sable sauntered in to the burger lord .  it was exactly like every other burger lord in america .   but not like every other burger lord across the world .  german burger lords  for example  sold lager instead of root beer  while english burger lords managed to take any american fast food virtues  the speed with which your food was delivered  for example  and carefully remove them  your food arrived after half an hour  at room temperature  and it was only because of the strip of warm lettuce between them that you could distinguish the burger from the bun .  the burger lord pathfinder salesmen had been shot twenty five minutes after setting foot in france .   mclordy the clown danced in the kiddie korner .  the serving staff had identical gleaming smiles that never reached their eyes .  and behind the counter a chubby  middle aged man in a burger lord uniform slapped burgers onto the griddle  whistling softly  happy in his work .   sable went up to the counter .    hello my name is marie   said the girl behind the counter .   how can i help you .     a double blaster thunder biggun  extra fries  hold the mustard   he said .    anything to drink .     a special thick whippy chocobanana shake .    she pressed the little pictogram squares on her till .   literacy was no longer a requirement for employment in these restaurants .  smiling was .   then she turned to the chubby man behind the counter .    dbtb  e f  hold mustard   she said .   choc shake .     uhnnhuhn   crooned the cook .  he sorted the food into little paper containers  pausing only to brush the graying cowlick from his eyes .    here y are   he said .   she took them without looking at him  and he returned cheerfully to his griddle  singing quietly   loooove me tender  looooove me long  neeever let me go      the man s humming  sable noted  clashed with the burger lord background music  a tinny tape loop of the burger lord commercial jingle  and he made a mental note to have him fired .   hello my name is marie gave sable his meals and told him to have a nice day .   he found a small plastic table  sat down in the plastic seat  and examined his food .   artificial bread roll .  artificial burger .  fries that had never even seen potatoes .  foodless sauces .  even  and sable was especially pleased with this  an artificial slice of dill pickle .  he didn t bother to examine his milkshake .  it had no actual food content  but then again  neither did those sold by any of his rivals .   all around him people were eating their unfood with  if not actual evidence of enjoyment  then with no more actual disgust than was to be found in burger chains all over the planet .   he stood up  took his tray over to the please dispose of your refuse with care receptacle  and dumped the whole thing .  if you had told him that there were children starving in africa he would have been flattered that you d noticed .   there was a tug at his sleeve .   party name of sable .   asked a small  bespectacled man in an international express cap  holding a brown paper parcel .   sable nodded .    thought it was you .  looked around  thought  tall gent with a beard  nice suit  can t be that many of them here .  package for you  sir .    sable signed for it  his real name   one word  six letters .  sounds like examine .    thank you kindly  sir   said the delivery man .  he paused .   here   he said .   that bloke behind the counter .  does he remind you of anyone .     no   said sable .  he gave the man a tip   five dollars   and opened the package .   in it was a small pair of brass scales .   sable smiled .  it was a slim smile  and was gone almost instantly .    about time   he said .  he thrust the scales into his pocket  unheeding of the damage being done to the sleek line of his black suit  and went back to the limo .    back to the office .   asked the chauffeur .    the airport   said sable .   and call ahead .  i want a ticket to england .     yessir .  return ticket to england .    sable fingered the scales in his pocket .   make that a single   he said .   i ll be making my own way back .  oh  and call the office for me  cancel all appointments .     how long for  sir .     the foreseeable future .    and in the burger lord  behind the counter  the stout man with the cowlick slid another half dozen burgers onto the grill .  he was the happiest man in the whole world and he was singing  very softly .       y ain t never caught a rabbit   he hummed to himself   and y ain t no friend of mine             the them listened with interest .  there was a light drizzle which was barely kept at bay by the old iron sheets and frayed bits of lino that roofed their den in the quarry  and they always looked to adam to think up things to do when it was raining .  they weren t disappointed .  adam s eyes were agleam with the joy of knowledge .   it had been      a . m .  before he d gone to sleep under a pile of new aquarians .    an  then there was this man called charles fort   he said .   he could make it rain fish and frogs and stuff .     huh   said pepper .   i bet .  alive frogs .     oh  yes   said adam  warming to his subject .   hopping around and croaking and everything .  people paid him money to go away in the end an   an      he racked his brains for something that would satisfy his audience  he d done  for adam  a lot of reading in one go .       and he sailed off in the mary celeste and founded the bermuda triangle .  it s in bermuda   he added helpfully .    no  he couldn t of done that   said wensleydale sternly   because i ve read about the mary celeste  and there was no one on it .  it s famous for having no one on it .  they found it floating around all by itself with no one on it .     i din t say he was on it when they found it  did i .   said adam scathingly .   course he wasn t on it .   cos of the ufos landin  and takin  him off .  i thought everyone knew about that .    the them relaxed a bit .  they were on firmer ground with ufos .  they weren t entirely certain about new age ufos  though  they d listened politely to adam on the subject  but somehow modern ufos lacked punch .    if i was an alien   said pepper  voicing the opinion of them all   i wouldn t go round telling people all about mystic cosmic harmony .  i d say   her voice became hoarse and nasal  like someone hampered by an evil black mask    thish ish a lasher blashter  sho you do what you re told  rebel swine .     they all nodded .  a favorite game in quarry had been based on a highly successful film series with lasers  robots  and a princess who wore her hair like a pair of stereo headphones .   it had been agreed without a word being said that if anyone was going to play the part of any stupid princesses  it wasn t going to be pepper .   but the game normally ended in a fight to be the one who was allowed to wear the coal scuttle   and blow up planets .  adam was best at it   when he was the villain  he really sounded as if he could blow up the world .  the them were  anyway  temperamentally on the side of planet destroyers  provided they could be allowed to rescue princesses at the same time .    i s pect that s what they used to do   said adam .   but now it s different .  they all have this bright blue light around  em and go around doing good .  sort of g lactic policemen  going round tellin  everyone to live in universal harmony and stuff .    there was a moment s silence while they pondered this waste of perfectly good ufos .    what i ve always wondered   said brian   is why they call  em ufos when they know they re flying saucers .  i mean  they re identified flying objects then .     it s  cos the goverment hushes it all up   said adam .   millions of flying saucers landin  all the time and the goverment keeps hushing it up .     why .   said wensleydale .   adam hesitated .  his reading hadn t provided a quick explanation for this  new aquarian just took it as the foundation of belief  both of itself and its readers  that the government hushed everything up .     cos they re the goverment   said adam simply .   that s what goverments do .  they ve got this great big building in london full of books of all the things they ve hushed up .  when the prime minister gets in to work in the morning  the first thing he does is go through the big list of everything that s happened in the night and put this big red stamp on them .     i bet he has a cup of tea first  and then reads the paper   said wensleydale  who had on one memorable occasion during the holidays gone unexpectedly into his father s office  where he had formed certain impressions .   and talks about what was on tv last night .     well  orlright  but after that he gets out the book and the big stamp .     which says  hush it up    said pepper .    it says top secret   said adam  resenting this attempt at bipartisan creativity .   it s like nucular power stations .  they keep blowin  up all the time but no one ever finds out  cos the goverment hushes it up .     they don t keep blowing all the time   said wensleydale severely .   my father says they re dead safe and mean we don t have to live in a greenhouse .  anyway  there s a big picture of one in my comic  and it doesn t say anything about it blowing up .     wensleydale s alleged comic was a    week part work called wonders of nature and science .  he had every single one so far  and had asked for a set of binders for his birthday .  brian s weekly reading was anything with a lot of exclamation marks in the title  like  whizz .  .   or  clang .  .   so was pepper s  although even under the most refined of tortures she still wouldn t admit to the fact that she also bought just seventeen under plain covers .  adam didn t read any comics at all .  they never lived up to the kind of things he could do in his head .     yes   said brian   but you lent me that comic afterwards and i know what type of picture it was .    wensleydale hesitated  and then said in a voice heavy with badly tried patience   brian  just because it says exploded diagram      there was the usual brief scuffle .    look   said adam severely .   do you want me to tell you about the aquarium age  or not .    the fight  never very serious amongst the siblinghood of the them  subsided .    right   said adam .  he scratched his head .   now you ve made me forget where i ve got to   he complained .    flyin  saucers   said brian .    right .  right .  well  if you do see a flying ufo  these government men come and tell you off   said adam  getting back into his stride .   in a big black car .  it happens all the time in america .    the them nodded sagely .  of this at least they had no doubt .  america was  to them  the place that good people went to when they died .  they were prepared to believe that just about anything could happen in america .    prob ly causes traffic jams   said adam   all these men in black cars  going about telling people off for seeing ufos .  they tell you that if you go on seeing  em  you ll have a nasty accident .     prob ly get run over by a big black car   said brian  picking at a scab on a dirty knee .  he brightened up .   do you know   he said   my cousin said that in america there s shops that sell thirty nine different flavors of ice cream .    this even silenced adam  briefly .    there aren t thirty nine flavors of ice cream   said pepper .   there aren t thirty nine flavors in the whole world .     there could be  if you mixed them up   said wensleydale  blinking owlishly .   you know .  strawberry and chocolate .  chocolate and vanilla .   he sought for more english flavors .   strawberry and vanilla and chocolate   he added  lamely .    and then there s atlantis   said adam loudly .   he had their interest there .  they enjoyed atlantis .  cities that sank under the sea were right up the them s street .  they listened intently to a jumbled account of pyramids  weird priesthoods  and ancient secrets .    did it just happen sudden  or slowly .   said brian .    sort of sudden an  slowly   said adam    cos a lot of  em got away in boats to all the other countries and taught  em how to do maths an  english an  history an  stuff .     don t see what s so great about that   said pepper .    could of been good fun  when it was sinking   said brian wistfully  recalled the one occasion when lower tadfield had been flooded .   people deliverin  the milk and newspapers by boat  no one having to go to school .     if i was an atlantisan  i d of stayed   said wensleydale .  this was greeted with disdainful laughter  but he pressed on .   you d just have to wear a diver s helmet  that s all .  and nail all the windows shut and fill the houses with air .  it would be great .    adam greeted this with the chilly stare he reserved for any of them who came up with an idea he really wished he d thought of first .    they could of done   he conceded  somewhat weakly .   after they d sent all the teachers off in the boats .  maybe everyone else stayed on when it went down .     you wouldn t have to wash   said brian  whose parents forced him to wash a great deal more than he thought could possibly be healthy .  not that it did any good .  there was something basically ground in about brian .   because everything would stay clean .  an   an  you could grow seaweed and stuff in the garden and shoot sharks .  and have pet octopuses and stuff .  and there wouldn t be any schools and stuff because they d of got rid of all the teachers .     they could still be down there now   said pepper .   they thought about the atlanteans  clad in flowing mystic robes and goldfish bowls  enjoying themselves deep under the choppy waters of the ocean .    huh   said pepper  summing up their feelings .    what shall we do now .   said brian .   it s brightened up a bit .    in the end they played charles fort discovering things .  this consisted of one of the them walking around with the ancient remains of an umbrella  while the others treated him to a rain of frogs or  rather  frog .  they could only find one in the pond .  it was an elderly frog  who knew the them of old  and tolerated their interest as the price it paid for a pond otherwise free of moorhens and pike .  it put up with things good naturedly for a while before hopping off to a secret and so far undiscovered hideout in an old drainpipe .   then they went home for lunch .   adam felt very pleased about the morning s work .  he d always known that the world was an interesting place  and his imagination had peopled it with pirates and bandits and spies and astronauts and similar .  but he d also had a nagging suspicion that  when you seriously got right down to it  they were all just things in books and didn t properly exist any more .   whereas this aquarium age stuff was really real .  grown up people wrote lots of books about it  new aquarian was full of adverts for them  and bigfoots and mothmen and yetis and sea monsters and surrey pumas really existed .  if cortez  on his peak in darien  had had slightly damp feet from efforts at catching frogs  he d have felt just like adam at that moment .   the world was bright and strange and he was in the middle of it .   he bolted his lunch and retired to his room .  there were still quite a few new aquarians he hadn t read yet .          the cocoa was a congealed brown sludge half filling the cup .   certain people had spent hundreds of years trying to make sense of the prophecies of agnes nutter .  they had been very intelligent  in the main .  anathema device  who was about as close to being agnes as genetic drift would allow  was the best of the bunch .  but none of them had been angels .   many people  meeting aziraphale for the first time  formed three impressions  that he was english  that he was intelligent  and that he was gayer than a tree full of monkeys on nitrous oxide .  two of these were wrong  heaven is not in england  whatever certain poets may have thought  and angels are sexless unless they really want to make an effort .  but he was intelligent .  and it was an angelic intelligence which  while not being particularly higher than human intelligence  is much broader and has the advantage of having thousands of years of practice .   aziraphale was the first angel ever to own a computer .  it was a cheap  slow  plasticky one  much touted as ideal for the small businessman .  aziraphale used it religiously for doing his accounts  which were so scrupulously accurate that the tax authorities had inspected him five times in the deep belief that he was getting away with murder somewhere .   but these other calculations were of a kind no computer could ever do .  sometimes he would scribble something on a sheet of paper by his side .  it was covered in symbols which only eight other people in the world would have been able to comprehend  two of them had won nobel prizes  and one of the other six dribbled a lot and wasn t allowed anything sharp because of what he might do with it .          anathema lunched on miso soup and pored over her maps .  there was no doubt the area around tadfield was rich in ley lines  even the famous rev .  watkins had identified some .  but unless she was totally wrong  they were beginning to shift position .   she d spent the week taking soundings with theodolite and pendulum  and the ordinance survey map of the tadfield area was now covered with little dots and arrows .   she stared at them for some time .  then she picked up a felt tip pen and  with occasional references to her notebook  began to join them up .   the radio was on .  she wasn t really listening .  so quite a lot of the main news item passed right by her unheeding ears  and it wasn t until a couple of key words filtered down into her consciousness that she began to take notice .   someone called a spokesman sounded close to hysteria .       danger to employees or the public   he was saying .    and precisely how much nuclear material has escaped .   said the interviewer .   there was a pause .   we wouldn t say escaped   said the spokesman .   not escaped .  temporarily mislaid .     you mean it is still on the premises .     we certainly cannot see how it could have been removed from them   said the spokesman .    surely you have considered terrorist activity .    there was another pause .  then the spokesman said  in the quiet tones of someone who has had enough and is going to quit after this and raise chickens somewhere   yes  i suppose we must .  all we need to do is find some terrorists who are capable of taking an entire nuclear reactor out of its can while it s running and without anyone noticing .  it weighs about a thousand tons and is forty feet high .  so they ll be quite strong terrorists .  perhaps you d like to ring them up  sir  and ask them questions in that supercilious  accusatory way of yours .     but you said the power station is still producing electricity   gasped the interviewer .    it is .     how can it still be doing that if it hasn t got any reactors .    you could see the spokesman s mad grin  even on the radio .  you could see his pen  poised over the  farms for sale  column in poultry world .   we don t know   he said .   we were hoping you clever buggers at the bbc would have an idea .    anathema looked down at her map .   what she had been drawing looked like a galaxy  or the type of carving seen on the better class of celtic monolith .   the ley lines were shifting .  they were forming a spiral .   it was centered   loosely  with some margin for error  but nevertheless centered   on lower tadfield .          several thousand miles away  at almost the same moment as anathema was staring at her spirals  the pleasure cruiser morbilli was aground in three hundred fathoms of water .   for captain vincent  this was just another problem .  for example  he knew he should contact the owners  but he never knew from day to day   or from hour to hour  in this computerized world   actually who the current owners were .   computers  that was the bloody trouble .  the ship s papers were computerized and it could switch to the most currently advantageous flag  good omens  of convenience in microseconds .  its navigation had been computerized as well  constantly updating its position by satellites .  captain vincent had explained patiently to the owners  whoever they were  that several hundred square meters of steel plating and a barrel of rivets would be a better investment  and had been informed that his recommendation did not accord with current cost benefit flow predictions .   captain vincent strongly suspected that despite all its electronics the ship was worth more sunk than afloat  and would probably go down as the most perfectly pinpointed wreck in nautical history .   by inference  this also meant that he was more valuable dead than alive .   he sat at his desk quietly leafing through international maritime codes  whose six hundred pages contained brief yet pregnant messages designed to transmit the news of every conceivable nautical eventuality across the world with the minimum of confusion and  above all  cost .   what he wanted to say was this  was sailing ssw at position     n         w .  first mate  who you may recall was appointed in new guinea against my wishes and is probably a head hunter  indicated by signs that something was amiss .  it appears that quite a vast expanse of seabed has risen up in the night .  it contains a large number of buildings  many of which appeared pyramid like in structure .  we are aground in the courtyard of one of these .  there are some rather unpleasant statues .  amiable old men in long robes and diving helmets have come aboard the ship and are mingling happily with the passengers  who think we organized this .  please advise .   his questing finger moved slowly down the page  and stopped .  good old international codes .  they d been devised eighty years before  but the men in those days had really thought hard about the kind of perils that might possibly be encountered on the deep .   he picked up his pen and wrote down   xxxv qvvx .    translated  it meant   have found lost continent of atlantis .  high priest has just won quoits contest .            it jolly well isn t .     it jolly well is .     it isn t  you know .     it jolly well is .     it isn t   all right  then  what about volcanoes .   wensleydale sat back  a look of triumph on his face .    what about  em .   said adam .    all that lather comes up from the center of the earth  where it s all hot   said wensleydale .   i saw a program .  it had david attenborough  so it s true .    the other them looked at adam .  it was like watching a tennis match .   the hollow earth theory was not going over well in the quarry .  a beguiling idea that had stood up to the probings of such remarkable thinkers as cyrus read teed  bulwer lytton  and adolf hitler was bending dangerously in the wind of wensleydale s searingly bespectacled logic .    i dint say it was hollow all the way through   said adam .   no one said it was hollow all the way through .  it prob ly goes down miles and miles to make room for all the lather and oil and coal and tibetan tunnels and suchlike .  but then it s hollow after that .  that s what people think .  and there s a hole at the north pole to let the air in .     never seen it on an atlas   sniffed wensleydale .    the goverment won t let them put it on a map in case people go and have a look in   said adam .   the reason being  the people livin  inside don t want people lookin  down on  em all the time .     what do you mean  tibetan tunnels .   said pepper .   you said tibetan tunnels .     ah .  dint i tell you about them .    three heads shook .    it s amazing .  you know tibet .    they nodded doubtfully .  a series of images had risen in their minds  yaks  mount everest  people called grasshopper  little old men sitting on mountains  other people learning kung fu in ancient temples  and snow .    well  you know all those teachers that left atlantis when it sunk .    they nodded again .    well  some of them went to tibet and now they run the world .  they re called the secret masters .  on account of being teachers  i suppose .  an  they ve got this secret underground city called shambala and tunnels that go all over the world so s they know everythin  that goes on and control everythin  .  some people reckon that they really live under the gobby desert   he added loftily   but mos  competent authorities reckon it s tibet all right .  better for the tunnelling  anyway .    the them instinctively looked down at the grubby  dirt covered chalk beneath their feet .    how come they know everything .   said pepper .    they just have to listen  right .   hazarded adam .   they just have to sit in their tunnels and listen .  you know what hearin  teachers have .  they can hear a whisper right across the room .     my granny used to put a glass against the wall   said brian .   she said it was disgustin   the way she could hear everything that went on next door .     and these tunnels go everywhere  do they .   said pepper  still staring at the ground .    all over the world   said adam firmly .    must of took a long time   said pepper doubtfully .   you remember when we tried digging that tunnel out in the field  we were at it all afternoon  and you had to scrunch up to get all in .     yes  but they ve been doin  it for millions of years .  you can do really good tunnels if you ve got millions of years .     i thought the tibetans were conquered by the chinese and the daily llama had to go to india   said wensleydale  but without much conviction .  wensleydale read his father s newspaper every evening  but the prosaic everydayness of the world always seemed to melt under the powerhouse of adam s explanations .    i bet they re down there now   said adam  ignoring this .   they d be all over the place by now .  sitting underground and listenin  .    they looked at one another .    if we dug down quickly     said brian .  pepper  who was a lot quicker on the uptake  groaned .    what d you have to go an  say that for .   said adam .   fat lot of good us trying to surprise them now  isn t it  with you shoutin  out something like that .  i was just thinkin  we could dig down  an  you jus  have to go an  warn  em .     i don t think they d dig all those tunnels   said wensleydale doggedly .   it doesn t make any sense .  tibet s hundreds of miles away .     oh  yes .  oh  yes .  an  i s pose you know more about it than madame blatvatatatsky .   sniffed adam .    now  if i was a tibetan   said wensleydale  in a reasonable tone of voice   i d just dig straight down to the hollow bit in the middle and then run around the inside and dig straight up where i wanted to be .    they gave this due consideration .    you ve got to admit that s more sensible than tunnels   said pepper .    yes  well  i expect that s what they do   said adam .   they d be bound to of thought of something as simple as that .    brian stared dreamily at the sky  while his finger probed the contents of one ear .    funny  reely   he said .   you spend your whole life goin  to school and learnin  stuff  and they never tell you about stuff like the bermuda triangle and ufos and all these old masters running around the inside of the earth .  why do we have to learn boring stuff when there s all this brilliant stuff we could be learnin   that s what i want to know .    there was a chorus of agreement .   then they went out and played charles fort and the atlantisans versus the ancient masters of tibet  but the tibetters claimed that using mystic ancient lasers was cheating .          there was a time when witchfinders were respected  although it didn t last very long .   matthew hopkins  for example  the witchfinder general  found witches all over the east of england in the middle of the seventeenth century  charging each town and village nine pence a witch for every one he discovered .   that was the trouble .  witchfinders didn t get paid by the hour .  any witchfinder who spent a week examining the local crones and then told the mayor   well done  not a pointy hat among the lot of them   would get fulsome thanks  a bowl of soup and a meaningful goodbye .   so in order to turn a profit hopkins had to find a remarkable number of witches .  this made him more than a little unpopular with the village councils  and he was himself hanged as a witch by an east anglian village who had sensibly realized that they could cut their overheads by eliminating the middleman .   it is thought by many that hopkins was the last witchfinder general .   in this they would  strictly speaking  be correct .  possibly not in the way they imagine  however .  the witchfinder army marched on  just slightly more quietly .   there is no longer a real witchfinder general .   nor is there a witchfinder colonel  a witchfinder major  a witchfinder captain  or even a witchfinder lieutenant  the last one was killed falling out of a very tall tree in caterham  in       while attempting to get a better view of something he believed was a satanic orgy of the most degenerate persuasion  but was  in fact  the caterham and whyteleafe market traders  association annual dinner and dance  .   there is  however  a witchfinder sergeant .   there is also  now  a witchfinder private .  his name is newton pulsifer .   it was the advertisement that got him  in the gazette  between a fridge for sale and a litter of not exactly dalmatians   join the professionals .  part time assis     tant required to combat the forces of  darkness .  uniform  basic training pro     vided .  field promotion certain .  be a  man .   in his lunch hour he phoned the number at the bottom of the ad .  a woman answered .    hello   he began  tentatively .   i saw your advert .     which one  love .     er  the one in the paper .     right  love .  well  madame tracy draws aside the veil every afternoon except thursdays .  parties welcome .  when would you be wanting to explore the mysteries  love .    newton hesitated .   the advert says  join the professionals    he said .   it didn t mention madame tracy .     that ll be mister shadwell you ll be wanting  then .  just a sec  i ll see if he s in .    later  when he was on nodding terms with madame tracy  newt learned that if he had mentioned the other ad  the one in the magazine  madame tracy would have been available for strict discipline and intimate massage every evening except thursdays .  there was yet another ad in a phone box somewhere .  when  much later  newt asked her what this one involved  she said  thursdays .   eventually there was the sound of feet in uncarpeted hallways  a deep coughing  and a voice the color of an old raincoat rumbled    aye .     i read your advert .   join the professionals .   i wanted to know a bit more about it .     aye .  there s many as would like to know more about it  an  there s many     the voice trailed off impressively  then crashed back to full volume       there s many as wouldn t .     oh   squeaked newton .    what s your name  lad .     newton .  newton pulsifer .     lucifer .  what s that you say .  are ye of the spawn of darkness  a tempting beguiling creature from the pit  wanton limbs steaming from the fleshpots of hades  in tortured and lubricious thrall to your stygian and hellish masters .     that s pulsifer   explained newton .   with a p .  i don t know about the other stuff  but we come from surrey .    the voice on the phone sounded vaguely disappointed .    oh .  aye .  well  then .  pulsifer .  pulsifer .  i ve seen that name afore  maybe .     i don t know   said newton .   my uncle runs a toy shop in hounslow   he added  in case this way any help .    is that sooo .   said shadwell .   mr .  shadwell s accent was unplaceable .  it careered around britain like a milk race .  here a mad welsh drill sergeant  there a high kirk elder who d just seen someone doing something on a sunday  somewhere between them a dour daleland shepherd  or bitter somerset miser .  it didn t matter where the accent went  it didn t get any nicer .    have ye all your own teeth .     oh yes .  except for fillings .     are ye fit .     i suppose so   newt stuttered .   i mean  that was why i wanted to join the territorials .  brian potter in accounting can bench press almost a hundred since he joined .  and he paraded in front of the queen mother .     how many nipples .     pardon .     nipples  laddie  nipples   said the voice testily .   how many nipples hae ye got .     er .  two .     good .  have ye got your ane scissors .     what .     scissors .  scissors .  are ye deaf .     no .  yes .  i mean  i ve got some scissors .  i m not deaf .           the cocoa had nearly all solidified .  green fur was growing on the inside of the mug .   there was a thin layer of dust on aziraphale  too .   the stack of notes was building up beside him .  the nice and accurate prophecies was a mass of improvised bookmarks made of torn strips of daily telegraph .   aziraphale stirred  and pinched his nose .   he was nearly there .   he d got the shape of it .   he d never met agnes .  she was too bright  obviously .  normally heaven or hell spotted the prophetic types and broadcast enough noises on the same mental channel to prevent any undue accuracy .  actually that was rarely necessary  they normally found ways of generating their own static in self defense against the images that echoed around their heads .          poor old st .  john had his mushrooms  for example .  mother shipton had her ale .  nostradamus had his collection of interesting oriental preparations .  st .  malachi had his still .   good old malachi .  he d been a nice old boy  sitting there  dreaming about future popes .  complete piss artist  of course .  could have been a real thinker  if it hadn t been for the poteen .   a sad end .  sometimes you really had to hope that the ineffable plan had been properly thought out .   thought .  there was something he had to do .  oh  yes .  phone his contact  get things sorted out .   he stood up  stretched his limbs  and made a phone call .   then he thought  why not .  worth a try .   he went back and shuffled through his sheaf of notes .  apes really had been good .  and clever .  no one was interested in accurate prophecies .   paper in hand  he phoned directory enquiries .    hallo .  good afternoon .  so kind .  yes .  this will be a tadfield number  i think .  or lower tadfield    ah .  or possibly norton  i m not sure of the precise code .  yes .  young .  name of young .  sorry  no initial .  oh .  well  can you give me all of them .  thank you .    back on the table  a pencil picked itself up and scribbled furiously .   at the third name it broke its point .    ah   said aziraphale  his mouth suddenly running on automatic while his mind exploded .   i think that s the one .  thank you .  so kind .  good day to you .    he hung up almost reverentially  took a few deep breaths  and dialed again .  the last three digits gave him some trouble  because his hand was shaking .   he listened to the ringing tone .  then a voice answered .  it was a middle aged voice  not unfriendly  but probably it had been having a nap and was not feeling at its best .   it said  tadfield six double six .    aziraphale s hand started to shake .    hallo .   said the receiver .   hallo .    aziraphale got a grip on himself .    sorry   he said   right number .    he replaced the receiver .          newt wasn t deaf .  and he did have his own scissors .   he also had a huge pile of newspapers .   if he had known that army life consisted chiefly of applying the one to the other  he used to muse  he would never have joined .   witchfinder sergeant shadwell had made him a list  which was taped to the wall in shadwell s tiny crowded flat situated over rajit s newsagents and video rental .  the list read   witches .   unexplainable phenomenons .  phenomenatrices .  phenomenice .  things  ye ken well what i mean .     newt was looking for either .  he signed and picked up another newspaper  scanned the front page  opened it  ignored page two  never anything on there  then blushed crimson as he performed the obligatory nipple count on page three .  shadwell had been insistent about this .   ye can t trust them  the cunning buggers   he said .   it d be just like them to come right out in the open  like  defyin  us .    a couple in black turtleneck sweaters glowered at the camera on page nine .  they claimed to lead the largest coven in saffron walden  and to restore sexual potency by the use of small and very phallic dolls .  the newspaper was offering ten of the dolls to readers who were prepared to write  my most embarrassing moment of impotency  stories .  newt cut the story out and stuck it into a scrapbook .   there was a muffled thumping on the door .   newt opened it  a pile of newspapers stood there .   shift yerself  private pulsifer   it barked  and it shufed into the room .  the newspapers fell to the floor  revealing witchfinder sergeant shadwell  who coughed  painfully  and relit his cigarette  which had gone out .    you want to watch him .  he s one o  them   he said .    who  sir .     tak yer ease  private .  him .  that little brown feller .  mister socalled rajit .  it s them terrible forn arts .  the ruby squinty eye of the little yellow god .  women wi  too many arms .  witches  the lot o  them .     he does give us the newspapers free  though  sergeant   said newt .   and they re not too old .     and voodoo .  i bet he does voodoo .  sacrificing chickens to that baron saturday .  ye know  tall darkie bugger in the top hat .  brings people back from the dead  aye  and makes them work on the sabbath day .  voodoo .   shadwell sniffed speculatively .   newt tried to picture shadwell s landlord as an exponent of voodoo .  certainly mr .  rajit worked on the sabbath .  in fact  with his plump quiet wife and plump cheerful children he worked around the clock  never mind the calendar  diligently filling the area s needs in the matter of soft drinks  white bread  tobacco  sweets  newspapers  magazines  and the type of top shelf pornography that made newt s eyes water just to think about .  the worst you could imagine mr .  rajit doing with a chicken was selling it after the  sell by  date .    but mister rajit s from bangladesh  or india  or somewhere   he said .   i thought voodoo came from the west indies .     ah   said witchfinder sergeant shadwell  and took another drag on his cigarette .  or appeared to .  newt had never actually quite seen one of his superior s cigarettes   it was something to do with the way he cupped his hands .  he even made the ends disappear when he d finished with them .   ah .     well  doesn t it .     hidden wisdom  lad .  inner mili try secrets of the witchfinder army .  when you re all initiated proper ye ll know the secret truth .  some voodoo may come from the west indies .  i ll grant ye that .  oh yes  i ll grant ye that .  but the worst kind .  the darkest kind  that comes from  um       bangladesh .     errrukh .  yes lad  that s it .  words right out of me mouth .  bangladesh .  exactly .    shadwell made the end of his cigarette vanish  and managed furtively to roll another  never letting papers or tobacco be seen .    so .  ye got anything  witchfinder private .     well  there s this .   newton held out the clipping .   shadwell squinted at it .   oh them   he said .   load o  rubbish .  call themselves bloody witches .  i checked them out last year .  went down with me armory of righteousness and a packet of firelighters  jemmied the place open  they were clean as a whistle .  mail order bee jelly business they re trying to pep up .  load o  rubbish .  wouldn t know a familiar spirit if it chewed out the bottoms o  their trousers .  rubbish .  it s not like it used to be  laddie .    he sat down and poured himself a cup of sweet tea from a filthy thermos .    did i ever tell you how i was recruited to the army .   he asked .   newt took this as his cue to sit down .  he shook his head .  shadwell lit his roll up with a battered ronson lighter  and coughed appreciatively .    my cellmate  he was .  witchfinder captain ffolkes .  ten years for arson .  burning a coven in wimbledon .  would have got them all too  if it wasn t the wrong day .  good fellow .  told me about the battle   the great war between heaven and hell    it was him that told me the inner secrets of the witchfinder army .  familiar spirits .  nipples .  all that       knew he was dying  you see .  got to have someone to carry on the tradition .  like you is  now     he shook his head .    that s what we m reduced to  lad   he said .   a few hundred years ago  see  we was powerful .  we stood between the world and the darkness .  we was the thin red line .  thin red line o  fire  ye see .     i thought the churches     newt began .    pah .   said shadwell .  newt had seen the word in print  but this was the first time he d ever heard anyone say it .   churches .  what good did they ever do .  they m just as bad .  same line o  business  nearly .  you can t trust them to stamp out the evil one   cos if they did  they d be out o  that line o  business .  if yer goin  up against a tiger  ye don t want fellow travellers whose idea of huntin  is tae throw meat at it .  nay  lad .  it s up to us .  against the darkness .    everything went quiet for a moment .   newt always tried to see the best in everyone  but it had occurred to him shortly after joining the wa that his superior and only fellow soldier was as well balanced as an upturned pyramid .   shortly   in this case  meant under five seconds .  the wa s headquarters was a fetid room with walls the color of nicotine  which was almost certainly what they were coated with  and a floor the color of cigarette ash  which was almost certainly what it was .  there was a small square of carpet .  newt avoided walking on it if possible  because it sucked at his shoes .   one of the walls had a yellowing map of the british isles tacked to it  with homemade flags sticking in it here and there  most of them were within a cheap day return fare of london .   but newt had stuck with it the past few weeks because  well  horrified fascination had turned into horrified pity and then a sort of horrified affection .  shadwell had turned out to be about five feet high and wore clothes which  no matter what they actually were  always turned up even in your short term memory as an old mackintosh .  the old man may have had all his own teeth  but only because no one else could possibly have wanted them  just one of them  placed under the pillow  would have made the tooth fairy hand in its wand .   he appeared to live entirely on sweet tea  condensed milk  handrolled cigarettes  and a sort of sullen internal energy .  shadwell had a cause  which he followed with the full resources of his soul and his pensioner s concessionary travel pass .  he believed in it .  it powered him like a turbine .   newton pulsifer had never had a cause in his life .  nor had he  as far as he knew  ever believed in anything .  it had been embarrassing  because he quite wanted to believe in something  since he recognized that belief was the lifebelt that got most people through the choppy waters of life .  he d have liked to believe in a supreme god  although he d have preferred a half hour s chat with him before committing himself  to clear up one or two points .  he d sat in all sorts of churches  waiting for that single flash of blue light  and it hadn t come .  and then he d tried to become an official atheist and hadn t got the rock hard  self satisfied strength of belief even for that .  and every single political party had seemed to him equally dishonest .  and he d given up on ecology when the ecology magazine he d been subscribing to had shown its readers a plan of a self sufficient garden  and had drawn the ecological goat tethered within three feet of the ecological beehive .  newt had spent a lot of time at his grandmother s house in the country and thought he knew something about the habits of both goats and bees  and concluded therefore that the magazine was run by a bunch of bib overalled maniacs .  besides  it used the word  community  too often  newt had always suspected that people who regularly used the word  community  were using it in a very specific sense that excluded him and everyone he knew .   then he d tried believing in the universe  which seemed sound enough until he d innocently started reading new books with words like chaos and time and quantum in the titles .  he d found that even the people whose job of work was  so to speak  the universe  didn t really believe in it and were actually quite proud of not knowing what it really was or even if it could theoretically exist .   to newt s straightforward mind this was intolerable .   newt had not believed in the cub scouts and then  when he was old enough  not in the scouts either .   he was prepared to believe  though  that the job of wages clerk at united holdings  holdings  plc  was possibly the most boring in the world .   this is how newton pulsifer looked as a man  if he went into a phone booth and changed  he might manage to come out looking like clark kent .   but he found he rather liked shadwell .  people often did  much to shadwell s annoyance .  the rajits liked him because he always eventually paid his rent and didn t cause any trouble  and was racist in such a glowering  undirected way that it was quite inoffensive  it was simply that shadwell hated everyone in the world  regardless of caste  color  or creed  and wasn t going to make any exceptions for anyone .   madame tracy liked him .  newt had been amazed to find that the tenant of the other flat was a middle aged  motherly soul  whose gentlemen callers called as much for a cup of tea and a nice chat as for what little discipline she was still able to exact .  sometimes  when he d nursed a half pint of guinness on a saturday night  shadwell would stand in the corridor between their rooms and shout things like  hoor of babylon .   but she told newt privately that she d always felt rather gratified about this even though the closest she d been to babylon was torremolinos .  it was like free advertising  she said .   she said she didn t mind him banging on the wall and swearing during her seance afternoons  either .  her knees had been giving her gyp and she wasn t always up to operating the table rapper  she said  so a bit of muffled thumping came in useful .   on sundays she d leave him a bit of dinner on his doorstep  with another plate over the top of it to keep it warm .   you couldn t help liking shadwell  she said .  for all the good it did  though  she might as well be flicking bread pellets into a black hole .   newt remembered the other cuttings .  he pushed them across the stained desk .    what are these .   said shadwell  suspiciously .    phenomena   said newt .   you said to look for phenomena .  there s more phenomena than witches these days  i m afraid .     anyone bin shootin  hares wi  a silver bullet and next day an old crone in the village is walkin  wi  a limp .   shadwell said hopefully .    i m afraid not .     any cows droppin  dead after some woman has looked at  em .     no .     what is it  then .   said shadwell .  he shuffled across to the sticky brown cupboard and pulled out a tin of condensed milk .    odd things happening   said newt .   he d spent weeks on this .  shadwell had really let the papers pile up .  some of them went back for years .  newt had quite a good memory  perhaps because in his twenty six years very little had happened to fill it up  and he had become quite expert on some very esoteric subjects .    seems to be something new every day   said newt  flicking through the rectangles of newsprint .   something weird has been happening to nuclear power stations  and no one seems to know what it is .  and some people are claiming that the lost continent of atlantis has risen .   he looked proud of his efforts .   shadwell s penknife punctured the condensed milk tin .  there was the distant sound of a telephone ringing .  both men instinctively ignored it .  all the calls were for madame tracy anyway and some of them were not intended for the ear of man  newt had conscientiously answered the phone on his first day  listened carefully to the question  said  marks and spencer s      cotton y fronts  actually   and had been left with a dead receiver .   shadwell sucked deeply .   ach  that s no  proper phenomena   he said .   can t see any witches doing that .  they re more for the sinking o  things  ye ken .    newt s mouth opened and shut a few times .    if we re strong in the fight against witchery we can t afford to be sidetracked by this style o  thing   shadwell went on .   haven t ye got anything more witchcrafty .     but american troops have landed on it to protect it from things   moaned newt .   a non existent continent       any witches on it .   said shadwell  showing a spark of interest for the first time .    it doesn t say   said newt .    ach  then it s just politics and geography   said shadwell dismissively .   madame tracy poked her head around the door .   coo ee  mr .  shadwell   she said  giving newt a friendly little wave .   a gentleman on the telephone for you .  hallo  mr .  newton .     awa  wi  ye  harlot   said shadwell  automatically .    he sounds ever so refined   said madame tracy  taking no notice .   and i ll be getting us a nice bit of liver for sunday .     i d sooner sup wi  the de el  wumman .     so if you d let me have the plates back from last week it d be a help  there s a love   said madame tracy  and tottered unsteadily back on three inch heels to her flat and whatever it was that had been interrupted .   newt looked despondently at his cuttings as shadwell went out  grumbling  to the phone .  there was one about the stones of stonehenge moving out of position  as though they were iron filings in a magnetic field .   he was vaguely aware of one side of a telephone conversation .    who .  ah .  aye .  aye .  ye say .  wha  class o  thing wud that be .  aye .  just as you say  sor .  and where is this place  then    .    but mysteriously moving stones wasn t shadwell s cup of tea or  rather  tin of milk .    fine  fine   shadwell reassured the caller .   we ll get onto it right awa  .  i ll put my best squad on it and report success to ye any minute  i ha  no doubt .  goodbye to you  sor .  and bless you too  sor .   there was the ting of a receiver going back on the hook  and then shadwell s voice  no longer metaphorically crouched in deference  said    dear boy  .  ye great southern pansy .    shadwell hated all southerners and  by inference  was standing at the north pole .    he shuffled back into the room  and then stared at newt as if he had forgotten why he was there .    what was it ye was goin  on about .   he said .    all these things that are happening     newt began .    aye .   shadwell continued to look through him while thoughtfully tapping the empty tin against his teeth .    well  there s this little town which has been having some amazing weather for the last few years   newt went on helplessly .    what .  rainin  frogs and similar .   said shadwell  brightening up a bit .    no .  it just has normal weather for the time of year .     call that a phenomena .   said shadwell .   i ve seen phenomenas that d make your hair curl  laddie .   he started tapping again .    when do you remember normal weather for the time of year .   said newt  slightly annoyed .   normal weather for the time of year isn t normal  sergeant .  it has snow at christmas .  when did you last see snow at christmas .  and long hot augusts .  every year .  and crisp autumns .  the kind of weather you used to dream of as a kid .  it never rained on november the fifth and always snowed on christmas eve .    shadwell s eyes looked unfocussed .  he paused with the condensed milk tin halfway to his lips .    i never used to dream when i was a kid   he said quietly .   newt was aware of skidding around the lip of some deep  unpleasant pit .  he mentally backed away .    it s just very odd   he said .   there s a weatherman here talking about averages and norms and microclimates and things like that .     what s that mean .   said shadwell .    means he doesn t know why   said newt  who hadn t spent years on the littoral of business without picking up a thing or two .  he looked sidelong at the witchfinder sergeant .    witches are well known for affecting the weather   he prompted .   i looked it up in the discouverie .    oh god  he thought  or other suitable entity  don t let me spend another evening cutting newspapers to bits in this ashtray of a room .  let me get out in the fresh air .  let me do whatever is the wa s equivalent of going waterskiing in germany .    it s only forty miles away   he said tentatively .   i thought i could just sort of nip over there tomorrow .  and have a look around  you know .  i ll pay my own petrol   he added .   shadwell wiped his upper lip thoughtfully .    this place   he said   it wouldna be called tadfield  would it .     that s right  mr .  shadwell   said newt .   how did you know that .     wonder what the southerners is playing at noo .   said shadwell under his breath .    weeell   he said  out loud .   and why not .     who ll be playing  sergeant .   said newt .   shadwell ignored him .   aye .  i suppose it can t do any harm .  yell pay yer ane petrol  ye say .    newt nodded .    then yell come here at nine o  the clock in the morning   he said   afore ye go .     what for .   said newt .    yer armor o  righteousness .           just after newt had left the phone rang again .  this time it was crowley  who gave approximately the same instructions as aziraphale .  shadwell took them down again for form s sake  while madame tracy hovered delightedly behind him .    two calls in one day  mr .  shadwell   she said   your little army must be marching away like anything .     ach  awa  wi  ye  ye murrain plashed berrizene   muttered shadwell  and slammed the door .  tadfield  he thought .  och  weel .  so long as they paid up on time     neither aziraphale nor crowley ran the witchfinder army  but they both approved of it  or at least knew that it would be approved of by their superiors .  so it appeared on the list of aziraphale s agencies because it was  well  a witchfinder army  and you had to support anyone calling themselves witchfinders in the same way that the u . s . a .  had to support anyone calling themselves anti communist .  and it appeared on crowley s list for the slightly more sophisticated reason that people like shadwell did the cause of hell no harm at all .  quite the reverse  it was felt .   strictly speaking  shadwell didn t run the wa either .  according to shadwell s pay ledgers it was run by witchfinder general smith .  under him were witchfinder colonels green and jones  and witchfinder majors jackson  robinson  and smith  no relation  .  then there were witchfinder majors saucepan  tin  milk  and cupboard  because shadwell s limited imagination had been beginning to struggle at this point .  and witchfinder captains smith  smith  smith  and smythe and ditto .  and five hundred witchfinder privates and corporals and sergeants .  many of them were called smith  but this didn t matter because neither crowley nor aziraphale had ever bothered to read that far .  they simply handed over the pay .   after all  both lots put together only came to around      a year .   shadwell didn t consider this in any way criminal .  the army was a sacred trust  and a man had to do something .  the old ninepences weren t coming in like they used to .       saturday   it was very early on saturday morning  on the last day of the world  and the sky was redder than blood .   the international express delivery man rounded the corner at a careful thirty five miles an hour  shifted down to second  and pulled up on the grass verge .   he got out of the van  and immediately threw himself into a ditch to avoid an oncoming lorry that had barrelled around the bend at something well in excess of eighty miles an hour .   he got up  picked up his glasses  put them back on  retrieved his parcel and clipboard  brushed the grass and mud from his uniform  and  as an afterthought  shook his fist at the rapidly diminishing lorry .    shouldn t be allowed  bloody lorries  no respect for other road users  what i always say  what i always say  is remember that without a car  son  you re just a pedestrian too      he climbed down the grassy verge  clambered over a low fence  and found himself beside the river uck .   the international express delivery man walked along the banks of the river  holding the parcel .   farther down the riverbank sat a young man dressed all in white .  he was the only person in sight .  his hair was white  his skin chalk pale  and he sat and stared up and down the river  as if he were admiring the view .  he looked like victorian romantic poets looked just before the consumption and drug abuse really started to cut it .   the international express man couldn t understand it .  i mean  in the old days  and it wasn t that long ago really  there had been an angler every dozen yards along the bank  children had played there  courting couples had come to listen to the splish and gurgle of the river  and to hold hands  and to get all lovey dovey in the sussex sunset .  he d done that with maud  his missus  before they were married .  they d come here to spoon and  on one memorable occasion  fork .   times changed  reflected the delivery man .   now white and brown sculptures of foam and sludge drifted serenely down the river  often covering it for yards at a stretch .  and where the surface of the water was visible it was covered with a molecules thin petrochemical sheen .   there was a loud whirring as a couple of geese  thankful to be back in england again after the long  exhausting flight across the northern atlantic  landed on the rainbow slicked water  and sank without trace .   funny old world  thought the delivery man .  here s the uck  used to be the prettiest river in this part of the world  and now it s just a glorified industrial sewer .  the swans sink to the bottom  and the fishes float on the top .   well  that s progress for you .  you can t stop progress .   he had reached the man in white .     scuse me  sir .  party name of chalky .    the man in white nodded  said nothing .  he continued to gaze out at the river  following an impressive sludge and foam sculpture with his eyes .    so beautiful   he whispered .   it s all so damn beautiful .    the delivery man found himself temporarily devoid of words .  then his automatic systems cut in .   funny old world isn t it and no mistake i mean you go all over the world delivering and then here you are practically in your own home so to speak  i mean i was born and bred  round here  sir  and i ve been to the mediterranean  and to des o  moines  and that s in america  sir  and now here i am  and here s your parcel  sir .    party name of chalky took the parcel  and took the clipboard  and signed for the parcel .  the pen developed a leak as he did so  and his signature obliterated itself as it was written .  it was a long word  and it began with a p  and then there was a splodge  and then it ended in something that might have been    ence and might have been    ution .    much obliged  sir   said the delivery man .   he walked back along the river  back toward the busy road where he had left his van  trying not to look at the river as he went .   behind him the man in white opened the parcel .  in it was a crown   a circlet of white metal  set with diamonds .  he gazed at it for some seconds  with satisfaction  then put it on .  it glinted in the light of the rising sun .  then the tarnish  which had begun to suffuse its silver surface when his fingers touched it  spread to cover it completely  and the crown went black .   white stood up .  there s one thing you can say for air pollution  you get utterly amazing sunrises .  it looked like someone had set fire to the sky .   and a careless match would have set fire to the river  but  alas  there was no time for that now .  in his mind he knew where the four of them would be meeting  and when  and he was going to have to hurry to be there by this afternoon .   perhaps we will set fire to the sky  he thought .  and he left that place  almost imperceptibly .   it was nearly time .   the delivery man had left his van on the grass verge by the dual carriageway .  he walked around to the driver s side  carefully  because other cars and lorries were still rocketing around the bend   reached in through the open window  and took the schedule from the dashboard .   only one more delivery to make  then .   he read the instructions on the delivery voucher carefully .   he read them again  paying particular attention to the address  and the message .  the address was one word  everywhere .   then  with his leaking pen  he wrote a brief note to maud  his wife .  it read simply  i love you .   then he put the schedule back on the dashboard  looked left  looked right  looked left again and began to walk purposefully across the road .  he was halfway across when a german juggernaut came around the corner  its driver crazed on caffeine  little white pills  and eec transport regulations .   he watched its receding bulk .   cor  he thought  that one nearly had me .   then he looked down at the gutter .   oh  he thought .   yes  agreed a voice from behind his left shoulder  or at least from behind the memory of his left shoulder .   the delivery man turned  and looked  and saw .  at first he couldn t find the words  couldn t find anything  and then the habits of a working lifetime took over and he said   message for you  sir .    for me .    yes  sir .   he wished he still had a throat .  he could have swallowed  if he still had a throat .   no package  i m afraid  mister    uh  sir .  it s a message .    deliver it  then .    it s this  sir .  ahem .  come and see .    finally .  there was a grin on its face  but then  given the face  there couldn t have been anything else .   thank you  it continued .  i must commend your devotion to duty .    sir .   the late delivery man was falling through a gray mist  and all he could see were two spots of blue  that might have been eyes  and might been distant stars .   don t think of it as dying  said death  just think of it as leaving early to avoid the rush .   the delivery man had a brief moment to wonder whether his new companion was making a joke  and to decide that he wasn t  and then there was nothing .          red sky in the morning .  it was going to rain .   yes .          witchfinder sergeant shadwell stood back with his head on one side .   right  then   he said .   ye re all ready .  hae ye  got it all .     yes  sir .     pendulum o  discovery .     pendulum of discovery  yes .     thumbscrew .    newt swallowed  and patted a pocket .   thumbscrew   he said .    firelighters .     i really think  sergeant  that       firelighters .     firelighters   said newt sadly .   and matches .     note for americans and other city dwelling life forms  the rural british  having eschewed central heating as being far too complicated and in any case weakening moral fiber  prefer a system of piling small pieces of wood and lumps of coal  topped by large  wet logs  possibly made of asbestos  into small  smoldering heaps  known as  there s nothing like a roaring open fire is there .   since none of these ingredients are naturally inclined to burn  underneath all this they apply a small  rectangular  waxy white lump  which burns cheerfully until the weight of the fire puts it out .  these little white blocks are called firelighters .  no one knows why .     bell  book  and candle .    newt patted another pocket .  it contained a paper bag inside which was a small bell  of the sort that maddens budgerigars  a pink candle of the birthday cake persuasion  and a tiny book called prayers for little hands .  shadwell had impressed upon him that  although witches were the primary target  a good witchfinder should never pass up the chance to do a quick exorcism  and should have his field kit with him at all times .    bell  book  and candle   said newt .    pin .     pin .     good lad .  never forget yer pin .  it s the bayonet in yer artillery o  light .    shadwell stood back .  newt noticed with amazement that the old man s eyes had misted over .    i wish i was goin  with ye   he said .   o  course  this won t be anything  but it d be good to get out and about again .  it s a tryin  life  ye ken  all this lyin  in the wet bracken spying on their devilish dancin  .  it gets into yer bones somethin  cruel .    he straightened up  and saluted .    off ye go  then  private pulsifer .  may the armies o  glorification march wi  ye .    after newt had driven off shadwell thought of something  something that he d never had the chance to do before .  what he needed now was a pin .  not a military issue pin  witches  for the use of .  just an ordinary pin  such as you might stick in a map .   the map was on the wall .  it was old .  it didn t show milton keynes .  it didn t show harlow .  it barely showed manchester and birmingham .  it had been the army s hq map for three hundred years .  there were a few pins in it still  mainly in yorkshire and lancashire and a few in essex  but they were almost rusted through .  elsewhere  mere brown stubs indicated the distant mission of a long ago witchfinder .   shadwell finally found a pin among the debris in an ashtray .  he breathed on it  polished it to a shine  squinted at the map until he located tadfield  and triumphantly rammed the pin home .   it gleamed .   shadwell took a step backward  and saluted again .  there were tears in his eyes .   then he did a smart about turn and saluted the display cabinet .  it was old and battered and the glass was broken but in a way it was the wa .  it contained the regimental silver  the interbattalion golf trophy  not competed for  alas  in seventy years   it contained the patent muzzle loading thundergun of witchfinder colonel ye shall not eat any living thing with the blood neither shall ye use enchantment nor observe times dalrymple  it contained a display of what were apparently walnuts but were in reality a collection of shrunken headhunter heads donated by witchfinder csm horace  get them afore they get you  narker  who d travelled widely in foreign parts  it contained memories .   shadwell blew his nose  noisily  on his sleeve .   then he opened a tin of condensed milk for breakfast .          if the armies of glorification had tried to march with newt  bits of them would have dropped off .  this is because  apart from newt and shadwell  they had been dead for quite a long time .   it was a mistake to think of shadwell  newt never found out if he had a first name  as a lone nut .   it was just that all the others were dead  in most cases for several hundred years .  once the army had been as big as it currently appeared in shadwell s creatively edited bookkeeping .  newt had been surprised to find that the witchfinder army had antecedents as long and almost as bloody as its more mundane counterpart .   the rates of pay for witchfinders had last been set by oliver cromwell and never reviewed .  officers got a crown  and the general got a sovereign .  it was just an honorarium  of course  because you got ninepence per witch found and first pick of their property .   you really got to rely on those ninepences .  and so times had been a bit hard before shadwell had gone on the payrolls of heaven and hell .   newt s pay was one old shilling per year .    note for young people and americans  one shilling   five pee .  it helps to understand the antique finances of the witchfinder army if you know the original british monetary system   two farthings   one ha penny .  two ha pennies   one penny .  three pennies   a thrupenny bit .  two thrupences   a sixpence .  two sixpences   one shilling  or bob .  two bob   a florin .  one florin and one sixpence   half a crown .  four half crowns   ten bob note .  two ten bob notes   one pound  or     pennies  .  one pound and one shilling   one guinea .   the british resisted decimalized currency for a long time because they thought it was too complicated .    in return for this  he was charged to keep  glimmer  firelock  firebox  tinderbox or igniferous matches  about his person at all times  although shadwell indicated that a ronson gas lighter would do very well .  shadwell had accepted the invention of the patent cigarette lighter in the same way that conventional soldiers welcomed the repeating rifle .   the way newt looked at it  it was like being in one of those organizations like the sealed knot or those people who kept on refighting the american civil war .  it got you out at weekends  and meant that you were keeping alive fine old traditions that had made western civilization what it was today .          an hour after leaving the headquarters  newt pulled into a layby and rummaged in the box on the passenger seat .   then he opened the car window  using a pair of pliers for the purpose since the handle had long since fallen off .   the packet of firelighters was sent winging over the hedge .  a moment later the thumbscrew followed it .   he debated about the rest of the stuff  and then put it back in the box .  the pin was witchfinder military issue  with a good ebony knob on the end like a ladies  hat pin .   he knew what it was for .  he d done quite a lot of reading .  shadwell had piled him up with pamphlets at their first meeting  but the army had also accumulated various books and documents which  newt suspected  would be worth a fortune if they ever hit the market .   the pin was to jab into suspects .  if there was a spot on their body where they didn t feel anything  they were a witch .  simple .  some of the fraudulent witchfinders had used special retracting pins  but this one was honest  solid steel .  he wouldn t be able to look old shadwell in the face if he threw away the pin .  besides  it was probably bad luck .   he started the engine and resumed his journey .   newt s car was a wasabi .  he called it dick turpin  in the hope that one day someone would ask him why .   it would be a very accurate historian who could pinpoint the precise day when the japanese changed from being fiendish automatons who copied everything from the west  to becoming skilled and cunning engineers who would leave the west standing .  but the wasabi had been designed on that one confused day  and combined the traditional bad points of most western cars with a host of innovative disasters the avoidance of which had made firms like honda and toyota what they were today .   newt had never actually seen another one on the road  despite his best efforts .  for years  and without much conviction  he d enthused to his friends about its economy and efficiency in the desperate hope that one of them might buy one  because misery loves company .   in vain did he point out its    cc engine  its three speed gearbox  its incredible safety devices like the balloons which inflated on dangerous occasions such as when you were doing    mph on a straight dry road but were about to crash because a huge safety balloon had just obscured the view .  he d also wax slightly lyrical about the korean made radio  which picked up radio pyongyang incredibly well  and the simulated electronic voice which warned you about not wearing a seatbelt even when you were  it had been programmed by someone who not only didn t understand english  but didn t understand japanese either .  it was state of the art  he said .   the art in this case was probably pottery .   his friends nodded and agreed and privately decided that if ever it came to buying a wasabi or walking  they d invest in a pair of shoes  it came to the same thing anyway  since one reason for the wasabi s incredible m . p . g .  was that fact that it spent a lot of time waiting in garages while crankshafts and things were in the post from the world s only surviving wasabi agent in nigirizushi  japan .   in that vague  zen like trance in which most people drive  newt found himself wondering exactly how you used the pin .  did you say   i ve got a pin  and i m not afraid to use it  .  have pin  will travel    the pinslinger    the man with the golden pin    the pins of navarone     it might have interested newt to know that  of the thirty nine thousand women tested with the pin during the centuries of witch hunting  twenty nine thousand said  ouch   nine thousand  nine hundred and ninety nine didn t feel anything because of the use of the aforesaid retractable pins  and one witch declared that it had miraculously cleared up the arthritis in her leg .   her name was agnes nutter .   she was the witchfinder army s great failure .          one of the early entries in the nice and accurate prophecies concerned agnes nutter s own death .   the english  by and large  being a crass and indolent race  were not as keen on burning women as other countries in europe .  in germany the bonfires were built and burned with regular teutonic thoroughness .  even the pious scots  locked throughout history in a long drawn out battle with their arch enemies the scots  managed a few burnings to while away the long winter evenings .  but the english never seemed to have the heart for it .   one reason for this may have to do with the manner of agnes nutter s death  which more or less marked the end of the serious witchhunting craze in england .  a howling mob  reduced to utter fury by her habit of going around being intelligent and curing people  arrived at her house one april evening to find her sitting with her coat on  waiting for them .    ye re tardie   she said to them .   i shoulde have beene aflame ten minutes since .    then she got up and hobbled slowly through the suddenly silent crowd  out of the cottage  and to the bonfire that had been hastily thrown together on the village green .  legend says that she climbed awkwardly onto the pyre and thrust her arms around the stake behind her .    tye yt well   she said to the astonished witchfinder .  and then  as the villagers sidled toward the pyre  she raised her handsome head in the firelight and said   gather ye ryte close  goode people .  come close untyl the fire near scorch ye  for i charge ye that alle must see how thee last true wytch in england dies .  for wytch i am  for soe i am judged  yette i knoe not what my true cryme may be .  and therefore let myne deathe be a messuage to the worlde .  gather ye ryte close  i saye  and marke well the fate of alle who meddle with suche as theye do none understande .    and  apparently  she smiled and looked up at the sky over the village and added   that goes for you as welle  yowe daft old foole .    and after that strange blasphemy she said no more .  she let them gag her  and stood imperiously as the torches were put to the dry wood .   the crowd grew nearer  one or two of its members a little uncertain as to whether they d done the right thing  now they came to think about it .   thirty seconds later an explosion took out the village green  scythed the valley clean of every living thing  and was seen as far away as halifax .   there was much subsequent debate as to whether this had been sent by god or by satan  but a note later found in agnes nutter s cottage indicated that any divine or devilish intervention had been materially helped by the contents of agnes s petticoats  wherein she had with some foresight concealed eighty pounds of gunpowder and forty pounds of roofing nails .   what agnes also left behind  on the kitchen table beside a note cancelling the milk  was a box and a book .  there were specific instructions as to what should be done with the box  and equally specific instructions about what should be done with the book  it was to be sent to agnes s son  john device .   the people who found it   who were from the next village  and had been woken up by the explosion   considered ignoring the instructions and just burning the cottage  and then looked around at the twinkling fires and nail studded wreckage and decided not to .  besides  agnes s note included painfully precise predictions about what would happen to people who did not carry out her orders .   the man who put the torch to agnes nutter was a witchfinder major .  they found his hat in a tree two miles away .   his name  stitched inside on a fairly large piece of tape  was thou shalt not commit adultery pulsifer  one of england s most assiduous witchfinders  and it might have afforded him some satisfaction to know that his last surviving descendant was now  even if unawares  heading toward agnes nutter s last surviving descendant .  he might have felt that some ancient revenge was at last going to be discharged .   if he d known what was actually going to happen when that descendant met her he would have turned in his grave  except that he had never got one .          firstly  however  newt had to do something about the flying saucer .   it landed in the road ahead of him just as he was trying to find the lower tadfield turning and had the map spread over the steering wheel .  he had to brake hard .   it looked like every cartoon of a flying saucer newt had ever seen .   as he stared over the top of his map  a door in the saucer slid aside with a satisfying whoosh  revealing a gleaming walkway which extended automatically down to the road .  brilliant blue light shone out  outlining three alien shapes .  they walked down the ramp .  at least  two of them walked .  the one that looked like a pepper pot just skidded down it  and fell over at the bottom .   the other two ignored its frantic beeping and walked over to the car quite slowly  in the worldwide approved manner of policemen already compiling the charge sheet in their heads .  the tallest one  a yellow toad dressed in kitchen foil  rapped on newt s window .  he wound it down .  the thing was wearing the kind of mirror finished sunglasses that newt always thought of as cool hand luke shades .    morning  sir or madam or neuter   the thing said .   this your planet  is it .    the other alien  which was stubby and green  had wandered off into the woods by the side of the road .  out of the corner of his eye newt saw it kick a tree  and then run a leaf through some complicated gadget on its belt .  it didn t look very pleased .    well  yes .  i suppose so   he said .   the toad stared thoughtfully at the skyline .    had it long  have we  sir .   it said .    er .  not personally .  i mean  as a species  about half a million years .  i think .    the alien exchanged glances with its colleague .   been letting the old acid rain build up  haven t we  sir .   it said .   been letting ourselves go a bit with the old hydrocarbons  perhaps .     i m sorry .     could you tell me your planet s albedo  sir .   said the toad  still staring levelly at the horizon as though it was doing something interesting .    er .  no .     well  i m sorry to have to tell you  sir  that your polar ice caps are below regulation size for a planet of this category  sir .     oh  dear   said newt .  he was wondering who he could tell about this  and realizing that there was absolutely no one who would believe him .   the toad bent closer .  it seemed to be worried about something  insofar as newt was any judge of the expressions of an alien race he d never encountered before .    we ll overlook it on this occasion  sir .    newt gabbled .   oh .  er .  i ll see to it   well  when i say i  i mean  i think antarctica or something belongs to every country  or something  and       the fact is  sir  that we have been asked to give you a message .     oh .     message runs  we give you a message of universal peace and cosmic harmony an  suchlike .   message ends   said the toad .    oh .   newt turned this over in his mind .   oh .  that s very kind .     have you got any idea why we have been asked to bring you this message  sir .   said the toad .   newt brightened .   well  er  i suppose   he flailed   what with mankind s  er  harnessing of the atom and       neither have we  sir .   the toad stood up .   one of them phenomena  i expect .  well  we d better be going .   it shook its head vaguely  turned around and waddled back to the saucer without another word .   newt stuck his head out of the window .    thank you .    the small alien walked past the car .    co  level up   .   percent   it rasped  giving him a meaningful look .   you do know you could find yourself charged with being a dominant species while under the influence of impulse driven consumerism  don t you .    the two of them righted the third alien  dragged it back up the ramp  and shut the door .   newt waited for a while  in case there were any spectacular light displays  but it just stood there .  eventually he drove up on the verge and around it .  when he looked in his rear view mirror it had gone .   i must be overdoing something  he thought guiltily .  but what .   and i can t even tell shadwell  because he d probably bawl me out for not counting their nipples .           anyway   said adam   you ve got it all wrong about witches .    the them were sitting on a field gate  watching dog rolling in cowpats .  the little mongrel seemed to be enjoying himself immensely .    i ve been reading about them   he said  in a slightly louder voice .   actually  they ve been right all along and it s wrong to persecute  em with british inquisitions and stuff .     my mother said they were just intelligent women protesting in the only way open to them against the stifling injustices of a male dominated social hierarchy   said pepper .   pepper s mother lectured at norton polytechnic .    yes  but your mother s always saying things like that   said adam  after a while .   pepper nodded amiably .   and she said  at worst they were just free thinking worshippers of the progenerative principle .     who s the progenratty principle .   said wensleydale .    dunno .  something to do with maypoles  i think   said pepper vaguely .    well  i thought they worshipped the devil   said brian  but without automatic condemnation .  the them had an open mind on the whole subject of devil worship .  the them had an open mind about everything .   anyway  the devil d be better than a stupid maypole .     that s where you re wrong   said adam .   it s not the devil .  it s another god  or something .  with horns .     the devil   said brian .    no   said adam patiently .   people just got  em mixed up .  he s just got horns similar .  he s called pan .  he s half a goat .      during the day .  in the evenings she gave power tarot readings to nervous executives  because old habits die hard .    which half .   said wensleydale .   adam thought about it .    the bottom half   he said at length .   fancy you not knowin  that .  i should of thought everyone knew that .     goats haven t got a bottom half   said wensleydale .   they ve got a front half and a back half .  just like cows .    they watched dog some more  drumming their heels on the gate .  it was too hot to think .   then pepper said   if he s got goat legs  he shouldn t have horns .  they belong to the front half .     i didn t make him up  did i .   said adam  aggrieved .   i was just telling you .  it s news to me i made him up .  no need to go on at me .     anyway   said pepper .   this stupid pot can t go around complaining if people think he s the devil .  not with having horns on .  people are bound to say  oh  here comes the devil .    dog started to dig up a rabbit hole .   adam  who seemed to have a weight on his mind  took a deep breath .    you don t have to be so lit ral about everything   he said .   that s the trouble these days .  grass materialism .   s people like you who go round choppin  down rain forests and makin  holes in the ozone layer .  there s a great big hole in the ozone layer  cos of grass materialism people like you .     i can t do anythin  about it   said brian automatically .   i m still paying off on a stupid cucumber frame .     it s in the magazine   said adam .   it takes millions of acres of rain forest to make one beefburger .  and all this ozone is leakin  away because of     he hesitated   people sprayin  the environment .     and there s whales   said wensleydale .   we ve got to save  em .    adam looked blank .  his plunder of new aquarian s back issues hadn t included anything about whales .  its editors had assumed that the readers were all for saving whales in the same way they assumed that those readers breathed and walked upright .    there was this program about them   explained wensleydale .    what ve we got to save  em for .   said adam .  he had confused visions of saving up whales until you had enough for a badge .   wensleydale paused and racked his memory .   because they can sing .  and they ve got big brains .  there s hardly any of them left .  and we don t need to kill them anyway  cos they only make pet food and stuff .     if they re so clever   said brian  slowly   what are they doin  in the sea .     oh  i dunno   said adam  looking thoughtful .   swimmin  around all day  just openin  their mouths and eating stuff    sounds pretty clever to me      a squeal of brakes and a long   drawn out crunch interrupted him .  they scrambled off the gate and ran up the lane to the crossroads  where a small car lay on its roof at the end of a long skidmark .   a little further down the road was a hole .  it looked as though the car had tried to avoid it .  as they looked at it  a small oriental looking head darted out of sight .   the them dragged the door open and pulled out the unconscious newt .  visions of medals for heroic rescue thronged adam s head .  practical considerations of first aid thronged around that of wensleydale .    we shouldn t move him   he said .   because of broken bones .  we ought to get someone .    adam cast around .  there was a rooftop just visible in the trees down the road .  it was jasmine cottage .   and in jasmine cottage anathema device was sitting in front of a table on which some bandages  aspirins  and assorted first aid items had been laid out for the past hour .          anathema had been looking at the clock .  he ll be coming around any moment now  she d thought .   and then  when he got there  he wasn t what she d been expecting .  more precisely  he wasn t what she d been hoping for .   she had been hoping  rather self consciously  for someone tall  dark  and handsome .   newt was tall  but with a rolled out  thin look .  and while his hair was undoubtedly dark  it wasn t any sort of fashion accessory  it was just a lot of thin  black strands all growing together out of the top of his head .  this was not newt s fault  in his younger days he would go every couple of months to the barber s shop on the corner  clutching a photograph he d carefully torn from a magazine which showed someone with an impressively cool haircut grinning at the camera  and he would show the picture to the barber  and ask to be made to look like that  please .  and the barber  who knew his job  would take one look and then give newt the basic  allpurpose  short back and sides .  after a year of this  newt realized that he obviously didn t have the face that went with haircuts .  the best newton pulsifer could hope for after a haircut was shorter hair .   it was the same with suits .  the clothing hadn t been invented that would make him look suave and sophisticated and comfortable .  these days he had learned to be satisfied with anything that would keep the rain off and give him somewhere to keep his change .   and he wasn t handsome .  not even when he took off his glasses .   actually  less so when he took of his glasses  because then he tripped over things and wore bandages a lot .   and  she discovered when she took off his shoes to lay him on her bed  he wore odd socks  one blue one  with a hole in the heel  and one gray one  with holes around the toes .   i suppose i m meant to feel a wave of warm  tender female something or other about this  she thought .  i just wish he d wash them .   so    tall  dark  but not handsome .  she shrugged .  okay .  two out of three isn t bad .   the figure on the bed began to stir .  and anathema  who in the very nature of things always looked to the future  suppressed her disappointment and said    how are we feeling now .    newt opened his eyes .   he was lying in a bedroom  and it wasn t his .  he knew this instantly because of the ceiling .  his bedroom ceiling still had the model aircraft hanging from bits of cotton .  he d never got around to taking them down .   this ceiling just had cracked plaster .  newt had never been in a woman s bedroom before  but he sensed that this was one largely by a combination of soft smells .  there was a hint of talcum and lily of the valley  and no rank suggestion of old t shirts that had forgotten what the inside of a tumble dryer looked like .   he tried to lift his head up  groaned  and let it sink back onto the pillow .  pink  he couldn t help noticing .    you banged your head on the steering wheel   said the voice that had roused him .   nothing broken  though .  what happened .    newt opened his eyes again .    car all right .   he said .    apparently .  a little voice inside it keeps repeating  prease to frasten sleat bert .      see .   said newt  to an invisible audience .   they knew how to build them in those days .  that plastic finish hardly takes a dent .    he blinked at anathema .    i swerved to avoid a tibetan in the road   he said .   at least  i think i did .  i think i ve probably gone mad .    the figure walked around into his line of sight .  it had dark hair  and red lips  and green eyes  and it was almost certainly female .  newt tried not to stare .  it said   if you have  no one s going to notice .   then she smiled .   do you know  i ve never met a witchfinder before .     er     newt began .  she held up his open wallet .    i had to look inside   she said .   newt felt extremely embarrassed  a not unusual state of affairs .  shadwell had given him an official witchfinder s warrant card  which among other things charged all beadles  magistrates  bishops  and bailiffs to give him free passage and as much dry kindling as he required .  it was incredibly impressive  a masterpiece of calligraphy  and probably quite old .  he d forgotten about it .    it s really just a hobby   he said wretchedly .   i m really a    a      he wasn t going to say wages clerk  not here  not now  not to a girl like this   a computer engineer   he lied .  want to be  want to be  in my heart i m a computer engineer  it s only the brain that s letting me down .   excuse me  could i know       anathema device   said anathema .   i m an occultist  but that s just a hobby .  i m really a witch .  well done .  you re half an hour late   she added  handing him a small sheet of cardboard   so you d better read this .  it ll save a lot of time .           newt did in fact own a small home computer  despite his boyhood experiences .  in fact  he d owned several .  you always knew which ones he owned .  they were desktop equivalents of the wasabi .  they were the ones which  for example  dropped to half price just after he d bought them .  or were launched in a blaze of publicity and disappeared into obscurity within a year .  or only worked at all if you stuck them in a fridge .  or  if by some fluke they were basically good machines  newt always got the few that were sold with the early  bug infested version of the operating system .  but he persevered  because he believed .   adam also had a small computer .  he used it for playing games  but never for very long .  he d load a game  watch it intently for a few minutes  and then proceed to play it until the high score counter ran out of zeroes .   when the other them wondered about this strange skill  adam professed mild amazement that everyone didn t play games like this .    all you have to do is learn how to play it  and then it s just easy   he said .          quite a lot of the front parlor in jasmine cottage was taken up  newt noticed with a sinking feeling  with piles of newspapers .  clippings were stuck around the walls .  some of them had bits circled in red ink .  he was mildly gratified to spot several he had cut out for shadwell .   anathema owned very little in the way of furniture .  the only thing she d bothered to bring with her had been her clock  one of the family heirlooms .  it wasn t a full cased grandfather clock  but a wall clock with a free swinging pendulum that e .  a .  poe would cheerfully have strapped someone under .   newt kept finding his eye drawn to it .    it was built by an ancestor of mine   said anathema  putting the coffee cups down on the table .   sir joshua device .  you may have heard of him .  he invented the little rocking thing that made it possible to build accurate clocks cheaply .  they named it after him .     the joshua .   said newt guardedly .    the device .    in the last half hour newt had heard some pretty unbelievable stuff and was close to believing it  but you have to draw the line somewhere .    the device is named after a real person .   he said .    oh  yes .  fine old lancashire name .  from the french  i believe .   be telling me next you ve never heard of sir humphrey gadget       oh  now come on          who devised a gadget that made it possible to pump out flooded mineshafts .  or pietr gizmo .  or cyrus t .  doodad  america s foremost black inventor .  thomas edison said that the only other contemporary practical scientists he admired were cyrus t .  doodad and ella reader widget .  and      she looked at newt s blank expression .    i did my ph . d .  on them   she said .   the people who invented things so simple and universally useful that everyone forgot that they d ever actually needed to be invented .  sugar .     er       you normally have two   said anathema sweetly .   newt stared back at the card she d handed him .   she d seemed to think it would explain everything .   it didn t .   it had a ruled line down the middle .  on the left hand side was a short piece of what seemed to be poetry  in black ink .  on the right hand side  in red ink this time  were comments and annotations .  the effect was as follows         when orient s japanese car .  upturned .   chariot inverted be  four car smash    not serious  wheles in the skye  a man injury .  .   with bruises be upon     take in     youre bedde  achinge his     willowfine   aspirin  hedd for willow fine  a  cf

  newt s hand went automatically to his pocket .  his cigarette lighter had gone .    what s this mean .   he said hoarsely .    have you ever heard of agnes nutter .   said anathema .    no   said newt  taking a desperate defense in sarcasm .   you re going to tell me she invented mad people  i suppose .     another fine old lancashire name   said anathema coldly .   if you don t believe  read up on the witch trials of the early seventeenth century .  she was an ancestress of mine .  as a matter of fact  one of your ancestors burned her alive .  or tried to .    newt listened in fascinated horror to the story of agnes nutter s death .    thou shalt not commit adultery pulsifer .   he said  when she d finished .    that sort of name was quite common in those days   said anathema .   apparently there were ten children and they were a very religious family .  there was covetousness pulsifer  false witness pulsifer       i think i understand   said newt .   gosh .  i thought shadwell said he d heard the name before .  it must be in the army records .  i suppose if i d gone around being called adultery pulsifer i d want to hurt as many people as possible .     i think he just didn t like women very much .     thanks for taking it so well   said newt .   i mean  he must have been an ancestor .  there aren t many pulsifers .  maybe    that s why i sort of met up with the witchfinder army .  could be fate   he said hopefully .   she shook her head .   no   she said .   no such thing .     anyway  witchfinding isn t like it was in those days .  i don t even think old shadwell s ever done more than kick over doris stokes s dustbins .     between you and me  agnes was a bit of a difficult character   said anathema  vaguely .   she had no middle gears .    newt waved the bit of paper .    but what s it got to do with this .   he said .    she wrote it .  well  the original .  it s no .       of the nice and accurate prophecies of agnes nutter  first published      .    newt stared at the prophecy again .  his mouth opened and shut .    she knew i d crash my car .   he said .    yes .  no .  probably not .  it s hard to say .  you see  agnes was the worst prophet that s ever existed .  because she was always right .  that s why the book never sold .           most psychic abilities are caused by a simple lack of temporal focus  and the mind of agnes nutter was so far adrift in time that she was considered pretty mad even by the standards of seventeenthcentury lancashire  where mad prophetesses were a growth industry .   but she was a treat to listen to  everyone agreed .   she used to go on about curing illnesses by using a sort of mold  and the importance of washing your hands so that the tiny little animals who caused diseases would be washed away  when every sensible person knew that a good stink was the only defense against the demons of ill health .  she advocated running at a sort of gentle bouncing trot as an aid to living longer  which was extremely suspicious and first put the witchfinders onto her  and stressed the importance of fiber in diet  although here she was clearly ahead of her time since most people were less bothered about the fiber in their diet than the gravel .  and she wouldn t cure warts .    itt is alle in youre minde   she d say   fogett about itte  ane it wine goe away .    it was obvious that agnes had a line to the future  but it was an unusually narrow and specific line .  in other words  almost totally useless .           how do you mean .   said newt .    she managed to come up with the kind of predictions that you can only understand after the thing has happened   said anathema .   like  do notte buye betamacks .   that was a prediction for      .     you mean she predicted videotape recorders .     no .  she just picked up one little fragment of information   said anathema .   that s the point .  most of the time she comes up with such an oblique reference that you can t work it out until it s gone past  and then it all slots into place .  and she didn t know what was going to be important or not  so it s all a bit hit and miss .  her prediction for november           was about a house falling down in king s lynn .     oh .   newt looked politely blank .    president kennedy was assassinated   said anathema helpfully .   but dallas didn t exist then  you see .  whereas king s lynn was quite important .     oh .     she was generally very good if her descendants were involved .     oh .     and she wouldn t know anything about the internal combustion engine .  to her they were just funny chariots .  even my mother thought it referred to an emperor s carriage overturning .  you see  it s not enough to know what the future i   you have to know what it means .  agnes was like someone looking at a huge picture down a tiny little tube .  she wrote down what seemed like good advice based on what she understood of the tiny little glimpses .    sometimes you can be lucky   anathema went on .   my greatgrandfather worked out about the stock market crash of       for example  two days before it actually happened .  made a fortune .  you could say we re professional descendants .    she looked sharply at newt .   you see  what no one ever realized until about two hundred years ago that the nice and accurate prophecies was agnes s idea of a family heirloom .  many of the prophecies relate to her descendants and their well being .  she was sort of trying to look after us after she d gone .  that s the reason for the king s lynn prophecy  we think .  my father was visiting there at the time  so from agnes s point of view  while he was unlikely to be struck by stray rounds from dallas  there was a good chance he might be hit by a brick .     what a nice person   said newt .   you could almost overlook her blowing up an entire village .    anathema ignored this .   anyway  that s about it   she said .   ever since then we ve made it our job to interpret them .  after all  it averages out at about one prophecy a month   more now  in fact  as we get closer to the end of the world .     and when is that going to be .   said newt .   anathema looked meaningfully at the clock .   he gave a horrible little laugh that he hoped sounded suave and worldly .  after the events so far today  he wasn t feeling very sane .  and he could smell anathema s perfume  which made him uncomfortable .    think yourself lucky i don t need a stopwatch   said anathema .   we ve got  oh  about five or six hours .    newt turned this over in his mind .  thus far in his life he d never had the urge to drink alcohol  but something told him there had to be a first time .    do witches keep drink in the house .   he ventured .    oh  yes .   she smiled the sort of smile agnes nutter probably smiled when unpacking the contents of her lingerie drawer .   green bubbly stuff with strange things squirming on the congealing surface .  you should know that .     fine .  got any ice .    it turned out to be gin .  there was ice .  anathema  who had picked up witchcraft as she went along  disapproved of liquor in general but approved of it in her specific case .    did i tell you about the tibetan coming out of a hole in the road .   newt said  relaxing a bit .    oh  i know about them   she said  shuffling the papers on the table .   the two of them came out of the front lawn yesterday .  the poor things were quite bewildered  so i gave them a cup of tea and then they borrowed a spade and went down again .  i don t think they quite know what they re supposed to be doing .    newt felt slightly aggrieved .   how did you know they were tibetan .   he said .    if it comes to that  how did you know .  did he go  ommm  when you hit him .     well  he   he looked tibetan   said newt .   saffron robes  bald head    you know    tibetan .     one of mine spoke quite good english .  it seems that one minute he was repairing radios in lhasa  next minute he was in a tunnel .  he doesn t know how he s going to get home .     if you d sent him up the road  he could probably have got a lift on a flying saucer   said newt gloomily .    three aliens .  one of them a little tin robot .     they landed on your lawn too  did they .     it s about the only place they didn t land  according to the radio .  they keep coming down all over the world delivering a short trite message of cosmic peace  and when people say  yes  well .   they give them a blank look and take off again .  signs and portents  just like agnes said .     you re going to tell me she predicted all this too  i suppose .    agnes leafed through a battered card index in front of her .    i kept meaning to put it all on computer   she said .   word searches and so forth .  you know .  it d make it a lot simpler .  the prophecies are arranged in any old order but there are clues  handwriting and so .     she did it all in a card index .   said newt .    no .  a book .  but i ve  er  mislaid it .  we ve always had copies  of course .     lost it  eh .   said newt  trying to inject some humor into the proceedings .   bet she didn t foresee that .    anathema glowered at him .  if looks could kill  newt would have been on a slab .   then she went on   we ve built up quite a concordance over the years  though  and my grandfather came up with a useful cross referencing system    ah .  here we are .    she pushed a sheet of paper in front of newt .        .  whene menne of     crocus saffron  cf .        crocus come frome the  earth and green manne     aliens    .  .   frome thee sky  yette ken     paratroops .   not why  and pluto s     nuclear power stations  barres quitte the light   see cuttings nos .           ning castels

green .   .   four arise  upon iron     .  railways .   horses ride  i tell you the   iron road   cf .        ende draweth nigh .    i didn t get all of this one in advance   anathema admitted .   i filled it in after listening to the news .     you must be incredibly good at crosswords in your family   said newt .    i think agnes is getting a bit out of her depth here  anyway .  the bits about leviathan and south america and threes and fours could mean anything .   she sighed .   the problem is newspapers .  you never know if agnes is referring to some tiny little incident that you might miss .  do you know how long it takes to go through every daily paper thoroughly every morning .     three hours and ten minutes   said newt automatically .           i expect we ll get a medal or something   said adam optimistically .   rescuing a man from a blazing wreck .     it wasn t blazing   said pepper .   it wasn t even very wrecked when we put it back rightside up .     it could of been   adam pointed out .   i don t see why we shouldn t have a medal just because some old car doesn t know when to catch fire .    they stood looking down at the hole .  anathema had called the police  who had put it down to subsidence and put some cones around it  it was dark  and went down a long way .    could be good fun  going to tibet   said brian .   we could learn marital arts and stuff .  i saw this old film where there s this valley in tibet and everyone there lives for hundreds of years .  it s called shangri la .     my aunt s bungalow s called shangri la   said wensleydale .   adam snorted .    not very clever  naming a valley after some ole bungalow   he said .   might as well call it dunroamin   or  or the laurels .      s lot better than shambles  anyway   said wensleydale mildly .    shambala   corrected adam .    i expect it s the same place .  prob ly got both names   said pepper  with unusual diplomacy .   like our house .  we changed the name from the lodge to norton view when we moved in  but we still get letters addressed to theo c .  cupier  the lodge .  perhaps they ve named it shambala now but people still call it the laurels .    adam flicked a pebble into the hole .  he was becoming bored with tibetans .    what shall we do now .   said pepper .   they re dipping sheep over at norton bottom farm .  we could go and help .    adam threw a larger stone into the hole  and waited for the thump .  it didn t come .    dunno   he said distantly .   i reckon we should do something about whales and forests and suchlike .     like what .   said brian  who enjoyed the diversions available at a good sheep dipping .  he began to empty his pockets of crisp packets and drop them  one by one  into the hole .    we could go into tadfield this afternoon and not have a hamburger   said pepper .   if all four of us don t have one  that s millions of acres of rainforest they won t have to cut down .     they ll be cutting  em down anyway   said wensleydale .    it s grass materialism again   said adam .   same with the whales .  it s amazin   the stuff that s goin  on .   he stared at dog .   he was feeling very odd .   the little mongrel  noticing the attention  balanced expectantly on its hind legs .    s people like you that s eating all the whales   said adam severely .   i bet you ve used up a nearly a whole whale already .    dog  one last tiny satanic spark of his soul hating himself for it  put his head on one side and whined .    s gonna be a fine ole world to grow up in   adam said .   no whales  no air  and everyone paddlin  around because of the seas risin  .     then the atlantisans d be the only ones well off   said pepper cheerfully .    huh   said adam  not really listening .   something was happening inside his head .  it was aching .  thoughts were arriving there without him having to think them .  something was saying  you can do something  adam young .  you can make it all better .  you can do anything you want .  and what was saying this to him was    him .  part of him  deep down .  part of him that had been attached to him all these years and not really noticed  like a shadow .  it was saying  yes  it s a rotten world .  it could have been great .  but now it s rotten  and it s time to do something about it .  that s what you re here for .  to make it all better .    because they d be able to go everywhere   pepper went on  giving him a worried look .   the atlantisans  i mean .  because       i m fed up with the ole atlantisans and tibetans   snapped adam .   they stared at him .  they d never seen him like this before .    it s all very well for them   said adam .   everyone s goin  around usin  up all the whales and coal and oil and ozone and rainforests and that  and there ll be none left for us .  we should be goin  to mars and stuff  instead of sittin  around in the dark and wet with the air spillin  away .    this wasn t the old adam the them knew .  the them avoided one another s faces .  with adam in this mood  the world seemed a chillier place .    seems to me   said brian  pragmatically   seems to me  the best thing you could do about it is stop readin  about it .     it s like you said the other day   said adam .   you grow up readin  about pirates and cowboys and spacemen and stuff  and jus  when you think the world s all full of amazin  things  they tell you it s really all dead whales and chopped down forests and nucular waste hangin  about for millions of years .   snot worth growin  up for  if you ask my opinion .    the them exchanged glances .   there was a shadow over the whole world .  storm clouds were building up in the north  the sunlight glowing yellow off them as though the sky had been painted by an enthusiastic amateur .    seems to me it ought to be rolled up and started all over again   said adam .   that hadn t sounded like adam s voice .   a bitter wind blew through the summer woods .   adam looked at dog  who tried to stand on his head .  there was a distant mutter of thunder .  he reached down and patted the dog absentmindedly .    serve everyone right if all the nucular bombs went off and it all started again  only prop ly organized   said adam .   sometimes i think that s what i d like to happen .  an  then we could sort everythin  out .    the thunder growled again .  pepper shivered .  this wasn t the normal them mobius bickering  which passed many a slow hour .  there was a look in adam s eye that his friend couldn t quite fathom   not devilment  because that was more or less there all the time  but a sort of blank grayness that was far worse .    well  i dunno about we   pepper tried .   dunno about the we  because  if there s all these bombs goin  off  we all get blown up .  speaking as a mother of unborn generations  i m against it .    they looked at her curiously .  she shrugged .    and then giant ants take over the world   said wensleydale nervously .   i saw this film .  or you go around with sawn off shotguns and everyone s got these cars with  you know  knives and guns stuck on       i wouldn t allow any giant ants or anything like that   said adam  brightening up horribly .   and you d all be all right .  i d see to that .  it d be wicked  eh  to have all the world to ourselves .  wouldn t it .  we could share it out .  we could have amazing games .  we could have war with real armies an  stuff .     but there wouldn t be any people   said pepper .    oh  i could make us some people   said adam airily .   good enough for armies  at any rate .  we could all have a quarter of the world each .  like  you  .     he pointed to pepper  who recoiled as though adam s finger were a whitehot poker    could have russia because it s red and you ve got red hair  right .  and wensley can have america  and brian can have  can have africa and europe  an   an       even in their state of mounting terror the them gave this the consideration it deserved .    h huh   stuttered pepper  as the rising wind whipped at her t shirt   i don t s see why wensley s got america an  all i ve g got is just russia .  russia s boring .     you can have china and japan and india   said adam .    that means i ve got jus  africa and a lot of jus  borin  little countries   said brian  negotiating even on the curl of the catastrophe curve .   i wouldn t mind australia   he added .   pepper nudged him and shook her head urgently .    dog s goin  to have australia   said adam  his eyes glowing with the fires of creation   on account of him needin  a lot of space to run about .  an  there s all those rabbits and kangaroos for him to chase  an       the clouds spread forwards and sideways like ink poured into a bowl of clear water  moving across the sky faster than the wind .    but there won t be any rab     wensleydale shrieked .   adam wasn t listening  at least to any voices outside his own head .   it s all too much of a mess   he said .   we should start again .  just save the ones we want and start again .  that s the best way .  it d be doing the earth a favor  when you come to think about it .  it makes me angry  seeing the way those old loonies are messing it up              it s memory  you see   said anathema .   it works backwards as well as forwards .  racial memory  i mean .    newt gave her a polite but blank look .    what i m trying to say   she said patiently   is that agnes didn t see the future .  that s just a metaphor .  she remembered it .  not very well  of course  and by the time it d been filtered through her own understanding it s often a bit confused .  we think she s best at remembering things that were going to happen to her descendants .     but if you re going to places and doing things because of what she wrote  and what she wrote is her recollection of the places you went to and the things you did   said newt   then       i know .  but there s  er  some evidence that that s how it works   said anathema .   they looked at the map spread out between them .  beside them the radio murmured .  newt was very aware that a woman was sitting next to him .  be professional  he told himself .  you re a soldier  aren t you .  well  practically .  then act like a soldier .  he thought hard for a fraction of a second .  well  act like a respectable soldier on his best behavior  then .  he forced his attention back to the matter at hand .    why lower tadfield .   said newt .   i just got interested because of the weather .  optimal microclimate  they call it .  that means it s a small place with its own personal nice weather .    he glanced at her notebooks .  there was definitely something odd about the place  even if you ignored tibetans and ufos  which seemed to be infesting the whole world these days .  the tadfield area didn t only have the kind of weather you could set your calendar by  it was also remarkably resistant to change .  no one seemed to build new houses there .  the population didn t seem to move much .  there seemed to be more woods and hedges than you d normally expect these days .  the only battery farm to open in the area had failed after a year or two  and been replaced by an old fashioned pig farmer who let his pigs run loose in his apple orchards and sold the pork at premium prices .  the two local schools seemed to soldier on in blissful immunity from the changing fashions of education .  a motorway which should have turned most of lower tadfield into little more than the junction    happy porker rest area changed course five miles away  detoured in a great semicircle  and continued on its way oblivious to the little island of rural changelessness it had avoided .  no one quite seemed to know why  one of the surveyors involved had a nervous breakdown  a second had become a monk  and a third had gone off to bali to paint nude women .   it was as if a large part of the twentieth century had marked a few square miles out of bounds .   anathema pulled another card out of her index and flicked it across the table .        .  sum say it cometh      years early  new  in london town  or new amsterdam till           yorke  butte they be     taddville  norfolk     wronge  for the plase is     tardesfield  devon     taddes fild  stronge inne     tadfield  oxon     hys powr  he cometh like     .    see revelation  c   v    a knight inne the fief  he  divideth the worlde into    partes  he bringeth the  storme .    i had to go and look through a lot of county records   said anathema   why s this one      .  it s earlier than the others .     agnes was a bit slapdash about timing .  i don t think she always knew what went where .  i told you  we ve spent ages devising a sort of system for chaining them together .    newt looked at a few cards .  for example        .  an the great  .  is this something to do with  hound sharl coom  bismark .   and the two powers sharl  a f device  june

obtuse for agnes   said anathema .        .  i see four riding  the apocalyptic horsemen .   bringing the ende  and the man   pan  the devil  the angells of hell ride the witch trials of lancashire   with them  and three brewster        .  .  .   sharl rise .  and four and  four together be four  i feel good agnes had drunk  an the dark angel sharl well this night   own defeat  yette the  quincy

precise   said anathema  in the weary tones of one who d explained this before .   that s what it used to mean .     but look   said newt .      he d nearly convinced himself about the non existence of the ufo  which was clearly a figment of his imagination  and the tibetan could have been a  well  he was working on it  but whatever it was it wasn t a tibetan  but what he was more and more convinced of was that he was in a room with a very attractive woman  who appeared actually to like him  or at least not to dislike him  which was a definite first for newt .  and admittedly there seemed to be a lot of strange stuff going on  but if he really tried  poling the boat of common sense upstream against the raging current of the evidence  he could pretend it was all  well  weather balloons  or venus  or mass hallucination .   in short  whatever newt was now thinking with  it wasn t his brain .    but look   he said   the world isn t really going to end now  is it .  i mean  just look around .  it s not like there s any international tension    well  any more than there normally is .  why don t we leave this stuff for a while and just go and  oh  i don t know  maybe we could just go for a walk or something  i mean       don t you understand .  there s something here .  something that affects the area .   she said .   it s twisted all the ley lines .  it s protecting the area against anything that might change it .  it s    it s     there it was again  the thought in her mind that she could not  was not allowed to grasp  like a dream upon waking .   the windows rattled .  outside  a sprig of jasmine  driven by the wind  started to bang insistently on the glass .    but i can t get a fix on it   said anathema  twisting her fingers together .   i ve tried everything .     fix .   said newt .    i ve tried the pendulum .  i ve tried the theodolite .  i m psychic  you see .  but it seems to move around .    newt was still in control of his own mind enough to do the proper translation .  when most people said  i m psychic  you see   they meant  i have an over active but unoriginal imagination wear black nail varnish talk to my budgie   when anathema said it  it sounded as though she was admitting to a hereditary disease which she d much prefer not to have .    armageddon moves around .   said newt .    various prophecies say the antichrist has to arise first   said anathema .   agnes says he .  i can t spot him       or her   said newt .    what .     could be a her   said newt .   this is the twentieth century  after all .  equal opportunities .     i don t think you re taking this entirely seriously   she said severely .   anyway  there isn t any evil here .  that s what i don t understand .  there s just love .     sorry .   said newt .   she gave him a helpless look .   it s hard to describe it   she said .   something or someone loves this place .  loves every inch of it so powerfully that it shields and protects it .  a deep down  huge  fierce love .  how can anything bad start here .  how can the end of the world start in a place like this .  this is the kind of town you d want to raise your kids in .  it s a kids  paradise .   she smiled weakly .   you should see the local kids .  they re unreal .  right out of the boys  own paper .  all scabby knees and  brilliant .   and bulls eyes      she nearly had it .  she could feel the shape of the thought  she was gaining on it .    what s this place .   said newt .    what .   anathema screamed  as her train of thought was derailed .   newt s finger tapped at the map .     disused aerodrome   it says .  just here  look  west of tadfield itself      anathema snorted .   disused .  don t you believe it .  used to be a wartime fighter base .  it s been upper tadfield air base for about ten years or so .  and before you say it  the answer s no .  i hate everything about the bloody place  but the colonel s saner than you are by a long way .  his wife does yoga  for god s sake .    now .  what was it she d said before .  the kids round here     she felt her mental feet slipping away from under her  and she fell back into the more personal thought waiting there to catch her .  newt was okay  really .  and the thing about spending the rest of your life with him was  he wouldn t be around long enough to get on your nerves .   the radio was talking about south american rainforests .   new ones .   it began to hail .          bullets of ice shredded the leaves around the them as adam led them down into the quarry .   dog slunk along with his tail between his legs  whining .   this wasn t right  he was thinking .  just when i was getting the hang of rats .  just when i d nearly sorted out that bloody german shepherd across the road .  now he s going to end it all and i ll be back with the ole glowin  eyes and chasin  lost souls .  what s the sense in that .  they don t fight back  and there s no taste to  em     wensleydale  brian  and pepper were not thinking quite so coherently .  all that they were aware of was that they could no more not follow adam than fly  to try to resist the force marching them forward would simply result in multiply broken legs  and they d still have to march .   adam wasn t thinking at all .  something had opened in his mind and was aflame .   he sat them down on the crate .    we ll all be all right down here   he said .    er   said wensleydale   don t you think our mothers and fathers       don t you worry about them   said adam loftily .   i can make some new ones .  there won t be any of this being in bed by half past nine  either .  you don t ever have to go to bed ever  if you don t want to .  or tidy your room or anything .  you just leave it all to me and it will be great .   he gave them a manic smile .   i ve got some new friends comin    he confided .   you ll like  em .     but     wensleydale began .    you jus  think of all the amazin  stuff afterwards   said adam enthusiastically .   you can fill up america with all new cowboys an  indians an  policemen an  gangsters an  cartoons an  spacemen and stuff .  won t that be fantastic .    wensleydale looked miserably at the other two .  they were sharing a thought that none of them would be able to articulate very satisfactorily even in normal times .  broadly  it was that there had once been real cowboys and gangsters  and that was great .  and there would always be pretend cowboys and gangsters  and that was also great .  but real pretend cowboys and gangsters  that were alive and not alive could be put back in their box when you were tired of them   this did not seem great at all .  the whole point about gangsters and cowboys and aliens and pirates was that you could stop being them and go home .    but before all that   said adam darkly   we re really goin  to show  em             there was a tree in the plaza .  it wasn t very big and the leaves were yellow and the light it got through the excitingly dramatic smoked glass was the wrong sort of light .  and it was on more drugs than an olympic athlete  and loudspeakers nested in the branches .  but it was a tree  and if you half closed your eyes and looked at it over the artificial waterfall  you could almost believe that you were looking at a sick tree through a fog of tears .   jaime hernez liked to have his lunch under it .  the maintenance supervisor would shout at him if he found out  but jaime had grown up on a farm and it had been quite a good farm and he had liked trees and he didn t want to have to come into the city  but what could you do .  it wasn t a bad job and the money was the kind of money his father hadn t dreamed of .  his grandfather hadn t dreamed of any money at all .  he hadn t even known what money was until he was fifteen .  but there were times when you needed trees  and the shame of it  jaime thought  was that his children were growing up thinking of trees as firewood and his grandchildren would think of trees as history .   but what could you do .  where there were trees now there were big farms  where there were small farms now there were plazas  and where there were plazas there were still plazas  and that s how it went .   he hid his trolley behind the newspaper stand  sat down furtively  and opened his lunchbox .   it was then that he became aware of the rustling  and a movement of shadows across the floor .  he looked around .   the tree was moving .  he watched it with interest .  jaime had never seen a tree growing before .   the soil  which was nothing more than a scree of some sort of artificial drippings  was actually crawling as the roots moved around under the surface .  jaime saw a thin white shoot creep down the side of the raised garden area and prod blindly at the concrete of the floor .   without knowing why  without ever knowing why  he nudged it gently with his foot until it was close to the crack between the slabs .  it found it  and bored down .   the branches were twisting into different shapes .   jaime heard the screech of traffic outside the building  but didn t pay it any attention .  someone was yelling something  but someone was always yelling in jaime s vicinity  often at him .   the questing root must have found the buried soil .  it changed color and thickened  like a fire hose when the water is turned on .  the artificial waterfall stopped running  jaime visualised fractured pipes blocked with sucking fibers .   now he could see what was happening outside .  the street surface was heaving like a sea .  saplings were pushing up between the cracks .   of course  he reasoned  they had sunlight .  his tree didn t .  all it had was the muted gray light that came through the dome four stories up .  dead light .   but what could you do .   you could do this   the elevators had stopped running because the power was off  but it was only four flights of stairs .  jaime carefully shut his lunchbox and padded back to his cart  where he selected his longest broom .   people were pouring out of the building  yelling .  jaime moved amiably against the flow like a salmon going upstream .   a white framework of girders  which the architect had presumably thought made a dynamic statement about something or other  held up the smoked glass dome .  in fact it was some sort of plastic  and it took jaime  perched on a convenient strip of girder  all his strength and the full leverage of the broom s length to crack it .  a couple more swings brought it down in lethal shards .   the light poured in  lighting up the dust in the plaza so that the air looked as though it was full of fireflies .   far below  the tree burst the walls of its brushed concrete prison and rose like an express train .  jaime had never realized that trees made a sound when they grew  and no one else had realized it either  because the sound is made over hundreds of years in waves twenty four hours from peak to peak .   speed it up  and the sound a tree makes is vroooom .   jaime watched it come toward him like a green mushroom cloud .  steam was billowing out from around its roots .   the girders never stood a chance .  the remnant of the dome went up like a ping pong ball on a water spray .   it was the same over all the city  except that you couldn t see the city any more .  all you could see was the canopy of green .  it stretched from horizon to horizon .   jaime sat on his branch  clung to a liana  and laughed and laughed and laughed .   presently  it began to rain .          the kappamaki  a whaling research ship  was currently researching the question  how many whales can you catch in one week .   except that  today  there weren t any whales .  the crew stared at the screens  which by the application of ingenious technology could spot anything larger than a sardine and calculate its net value on the international oil market  and found them blank .  the occasional fish that did show up was barreling through the water as if in a great hurry to get elsewhere .   the captain drummed his fingers on the console .  he was afraid that he might soon be conducting his own research project to find out what happened to a statistically small sample of whaler captains who came back without a factory ship full of research material .  he wondered what they did to you .  maybe they locked you in a room with a harpoon gun and expected you to do the honorable thing .   this was unreal .  there ought to be something .   the navigator punched up a chart and stared at it .    honorable sir .   he said .    what is it .   said the captain testily .    we seem to have a miserable instrument failure .  seabed in this area should be two hundred meters .     what of it .     i m reading        meters  honorable sir .  and still falling .     that is foolish .  there is no such depth .    the captain glared at several million yen worth of cutting edge technology  and thumped it .   the navigator gave a nervous smile .    ah  sir   he said   it is shallower already .    beneath the thunders of the upper deep  as aziraphale and tennyson both knew  far  far beneath in the abyssal sea the kraken sleepeth .   and now it was waking up .   millions of tons of deep ocean ooze cascade off its flanks as it rises .   see   said the navigator .    three thousand meters already .    the kraken doesn t have eyes .  there has never been anything for it to look at .  but as it billows up through the icy waters it picks up the microwave noise of the sea  the sorrowing beeps and whistles of the whalesong .    er   said the navigator   one thousand meters .    the kraken is not amused .    five hundred meters .    the factory ship rocks on the sudden swell .    a hundred meters .    there is a tiny metal thing above it .  the kraken stirs .   and ten billion sushi dinners cry out for vengeance .          the cottage windows burst inward .  this wasn t a storm  it was war .  fragments of jasmine whirled across the room  mingled with the rain of file cards .   newt and anathema clung to one another in the space between the overturned table and the wall .    go on   muttered newt .   tell me agnes predicted this .     she did say he bringeth the storm   said anathema .    this is a bloody hurricane .  did she say what s supposed to happen next .          is cross referenced to        said anathema .    you can remember details like that at a time like this .     since you mention it  yes   she said .  she held out a card .        .  lette the wheel of

device         newt read it again .  there was a sound outside like a sheet of corrugated iron pinwheeling across the garden  which was exactly what it was .    is this supposed to mean   he said slowly   that we re supposed to become an  an item .  that agnes  what a joker .    courting is always difficult when the one being courted has an elderly female relative in the house  they tend to mutter or cackle or bum cigarettes or  in the worst cases  get out the family photograph album  an act of aggression in the sex war which ought to be banned by a geneva convention .  it s much worse when the relative has been dead for three hundred years .  newt had indeed been harboring certain thoughts about anathema  not just harboring them  in fact  but dry docking them  refitting them  giving them a good coat of paint and scraping the barnacles off their bottom .  but the idea of agnes s second sight boring into the back of his neck sloshed over his libido like a bucketful of cold water .   he had even been entertaining the idea of inviting her out for a meal  but he hated the idea of some cromwellian witch sitting in her cottage three centuries earlier and watching him eat .   he was in the mood in which people burned witches .  his life was quite complicated enough without it being manipulated across the centuries by some crazed old woman .   a thump in the grate sounded like part of the chimney stack coming down .   and then he thought  my life isn t complicated at all .  i can see it as clearly as agnes might .  it stretches all the way to early retirement  a whipround from the people in the office  a bright little neat flat somewhere  a neat little empty death .  except now i m going to die under the ruins of a cottage during what might just possibly be the end of the world .   the recording angel won t have any trouble with me  my life must have been dittoes on every page for years .  i mean  what have i ever really done .  i ve never robbed a bank .  i ve never had a parking ticket .  i ve never eaten thai food     somewhere another window caved in  with a merry tinkle of breaking glass .  anathema put her arms around him  with a sigh which really didn t sound disappointed at all .   i ve never been to america .  or france  because calais doesn t really count .  i ve never learned to play a musical instrument .   the radio died as the power lines finally gave up .   he buried his face in her hair .   i ve never            there was a pinging sound .   shadwell  who had been bringing the army pay books up to date  looked up in the middle of signing for witchfinder lance corporal smith .   it took him a while to notice that the gleam of newt s pin was no longer on the map .   he got down from his stool  muttering under his breath  and searched around on the floor until he found it .  he gave it another polish and put it back in tadfield .   he was just signing for witchfinder private table  who got an extra tuppence a year hay allowance  when there was another ping .   he retrieved the pin  glared at it suspiciously  and pushed it so hard into the map that the plaster behind it gave way .  then he went back to the ledgers .   there was a ping .   this time the pin was several feet from the wall .  shadwell picked it up  examined its point  pushed it into the map  and watched it .   after about five seconds it shot past his ear .   he scrabbled for it on the floor  replaced it on the map  and held it there .   it moved under his hand .  he leaned his weight on it .   a tiny thread of smoke curled out of the map .  shadwell gave a whimper and sucked his fingers as the red hot pin ricocheted off the opposite wall and smashed a window .  it didn t want to be in tadfield .   ten seconds later shadwell was rummaging through the wa s cash box  which yielded a handful of copper  a ten shilling note  and a small counterfeit coin from the reign of james i .  regardless of personal safety  he rummaged in his own pockets .  the results of the trawl  even with his pensioners  concessionary travel pass taken into consideration  were barely enough to get him out of the house  let alone to tadfield .   the only other people he knew who had money were mr .  rajit and madame tracy .  as far as the rajits were concerned  the question of seven weeks  rent would probably crop up in any financial discussion he instigated at this point  and as for madame tracy  who d only be too willing to lend him a handful of used tenners      i ll be swaggit if i ll tak the wages o  sin frae the painted jezebel   he said .   which left no one else .   save one .   the southern pansy .   they d each been here  just once  spending as little time as possible in the room and  in aziraphale s case  trying not to touch any flat surface .  the other one  the flash southern bastard in the sunglasses  was   shadwell suspected   not someone he ought to offend .  in shadwell s simple world  anyone in sunglasses who wasn t actually on a beach was probably a criminal .  he suspected that crowley was from the mafia  or the underworld  although he would have been surprised how right he nearly was .  but the soft one in the camelhair coat was a different matter  and he d risked trailing him back to his base once  and he could remember the way .  he thought aziraphale was a russian spy .  he could ask him for money .  threaten him a bit .   it was terribly risky .   shadwell pulled himself together .  even now young newt might be suffering unimaginable tortures at the hands of the daughters o  night and he  shadwell  had sent him .    we canna leave our people in there   he said  and put on his thin overcoat and shapeless hat and went out into the street .   the weather seemed to be blowing up a bit .          aziraphale was dithering .  he d been dithering for some twelve hours .  his nerves  he would have said  were all over the place .  he walked around the shop  picking up bits of paper and dropping them again  fiddling with pens .   he ought to tell crowley .   no  he didn t .  he wanted to tell crowley .  he ought to tell heaven .  he was an angel  after all .  you had to do the right thing .  it was built in .  you see a wile  you thwart .  crowley had put his finger on it  right enough .  he ought to have told heaven right from the start .   but he d known him for thousands of years .  they got along .  they nearly understood one another .  he sometimes suspected they had far more in common with one another than with their respective superiors .  they both liked the world  for one thing  rather than viewing it simply as the board on which the cosmic game of chess was being played .   well  of course  that was it .  that was the answer  staring him in the face .  it d be true to the spirit of his pact with crowley if he tipped heaven the wink  and then they could quietly do something about the child  although nothing too bad of course because we were all god s creatures when you got down to it  even people like crowley and the antichrist  and the world would be saved and there wouldn t have to be all that armageddon business  which would do nobody any good anyway  because everyone knew heaven would win in the end  and crowley would be bound to understand .   yes .  and then everything would be all right .   there was a knock at the shop door  despite the closed sign .  he ignored it .   getting in touch with heaven for two way communications was far more difficult for aziraphale than it is for humans  who don t expect an answer and in nearly all cases would be rather surprised to get one .   he pushed aside the paper laden desk and rolled up the threadbare bookshop carpet .  there was a small circle chalked on the floorboards underneath  surrounded by suitable passages from the cabala .  the angel lit seven candles  which he placed ritually at certain points around the circle .  then he lit some incense  which was not necessary but did make the place smell nice .   and then he stood in the circle and said the words .   nothing happened .   he said the words again .   eventually a bright blue shaft of light shot down from the ceiling and filled the circle .   a well educated voice said   well .     it s me  aziraphale .     we know   said the voice .    i ve got great news .  i ve located the antichrist .  i can give you his address and everything .    there was a pause .  the blue light flickered .    well .   it said again .    but  d you see  you can ki   man stop it all happening .  in the nick of time .  you ve only got a few hours .  you can stop it all and there needn t be the war and everyone will be saved .    he beamed madly into the light .    yes .   said the voice .    yes  he s in a place called lower tadfield  and the address       well done   said the voice  in flat  dead tones .    there doesn t have to be any of that business with one third of the seas turning to blood or anything   said aziraphale happily .   when it came  the voice sounded slightly annoyed .    why not .   it said .   aziraphale felt an icy pit opening under his enthusiasm  and tried to pretend it wasn t happening .   he plunged on   well  you can simply make sure that       we will win  aziraphale .     yes  but       the forces of darkness must be beaten .  you seem to be under a misapprehension .  the point is not to avoid the war  it is to win it .  we have been waiting a long time  aziraphale .    aziraphale felt the coldness envelop his mind .  he opened his mouth to say   do you think perhaps it would be a good idea not to hold the war on earth .   and changed his mind .    i see   he said grimly .  there was a scraping near the door  and if aziraphale had been looking in that direction he would have seen a battered felt hat trying to peer over the fanlight .    this is not to say you have not performed well   said the voice .   you will receive a commendation .  well done .     thank you   said aziraphale .  the bitterness in his voice would have soured milk .   i d forgotten about ineffability  obviously .     we thought you had .     may i ask   said the angel   to whom have i been speaking .    the voice said   we are the metatron .    the voice of god .  but not the voice of god .  an entity in its own right .  rather like a presidential spokesman .     oh  yes .  of course .  oh .  well .  thank you very much .  thank you .    behind him the letterbox tilted open  revealing a pair of eyes .    one other thing   said the voice .   you will of course be joining us  won t you .     well  er  of course it has been simply ages since i ve held a flaming sword     aziraphale began .    yes  we recall   said the voice .   you will have a lot of opportunity to relearn .     ah .  hmm .  what sort of initiating event will precipitate the war .   said aziraphale .    we thought a multi nation nuclear exchange would be a nice start .     oh .  yes .  very imaginative .   aziraphale s voice was flat and hopeless .    good .  we will expect you directly  then   said the voice .    ah .  well .  i ll just clear up a few business matters  shall i .   said aziraphale desperately .    there hardly seems to be any necessity   said the metatron .   aziraphale drew himself up .   i really feel that probity  not to say morality  demands that as a reputable businessman i should       yes  yes   said the metatron  a shade testily .   point taken .  we shall await you  then .    the light faded  but did not quite vanish .  they re leaving the line open  aziraphale thought .  i m not getting out of this one .    hallo .   he said softly   anyone still there .    there was silence .   very carefully  he stepped over the circle and crept to the telephone .  he opened his notebook and dialed another number .   after four rings it gave a little cough  followed by a pause  and then a voice which sounded so laid back you could put a carpet on it said   hi .  this is anthony crowley .  uh .  i       crowley .   aziraphale tried to hiss and shout at the same time   listen .  i haven t got much time .  the          probably not in right now  or asleep  and busy  or something  but       shutup .  listen .  it was in tadfield .  it s all in that book .  you ve got to stop          after the tone and i ll get right back to you .  chow .     i want to talk to you now      beeeeeeeeeeeee   stop making noises .  it s in tadfield .  that was what i was sensing .  you must go there and      he took the phone away from his mouth .    bugger .   he said .  it was the first time he d sworn in more than four thousand years .   hold on .  the demon had another line  didn t he .  he was that kind of person .  aziraphale fumbled in the book  nearly dropping it on the floor .  they would be getting impatient soon .   he found the other number .  he dialed it .  it was answered almost immediately  at the same time as the shop s bell tingled gently .   crowley s voice  getting louder as it neared the mouthpiece  said      really mean it .  hallo .     crowley  it s me .     ngh .   the voice was horribly noncommittal .  even in his present state  aziraphale sensed trouble .    are you alone .   he said cautiously .    nuh .  got an old friend here .     listen       awa  we ye  ye spawn o  hell .    very slowly  aziraphale turned around .          shadwell was trembling with excitement .  he d seen it all .  he d heard it all .  he hadn t understood any of it  but he knew what people did with circles and candlesticks and incense .  he knew that all right .  he d seen the devil rides out fifteen times  sixteen times if you included the time he d been thrown out of the cinema for shouting his unflattering opinions of amateur witchfinder christopher lee .   the buggers were using him .  they d been making fools out o  the glorious traditions o  the army .    i ll have ye  ye evil bastard .   he shouted  advancing like a motheaten avenging angel .   i ken what ye be about  cumin  up here and seducin  wimmen to do yer evil will .     i think perhaps you ve got the wrong shop   said aziraphale .   i ll call back later   he told the receiver  and hung up .    i could see what yer were about   snarled shadwell .  there were flecks of foam around his mouth .  he was more angry than he could ever remember .    er  things are not what they seem     aziraphale began  aware even as he said it that as conversational gambits went it lacked a certain polish .    i bet they ain t .   said shadwell triumphantly .    no  i mean      without taking his eyes off the angel  shadwell shuffled backwards and grabbed the shop door  slamming it hard so that the bell jangled .    bell   he said .   he grabbed the nice and accurate prophecies and thumped it down heavily on the table .    book   he snarled .   he fumbled in his pocket and produced his trusty ronson .    practically candle .   he shouted  and began to advance .   in his path  the circle glowed with a faint blue light .    er   said aziraphale   i think it might not be a very good idea to      shadwell wasn t listening .   by the powers invested in me by virtue o  my office o  witchfinder   he intoned   i charge ye to quit from this place       you see  the circle          and return henceforth to the place from which ye came  pausin  not to          it would really be unwise for a human to set foot in it without          and deliver us frae evil       keep out of the circle  you stupid man .        never to come again to vex       yes  yes  but please keep out of      aziraphale ran toward shadwell  waving his hands urgently .       returning nae more .   shadwell finished .  he pointed a vengeful  black nailed finger .   aziraphale looked down at his feet  and swore for the second time in five minutes .  he d stepped into the circle .    oh  fuck   he said .   there was a melodious twang  and the blue glow vanished .  so did aziraphale .   thirty seconds went by .  shadwell didn t move .  then  with a trembling left hand  he reached up and carefully lowered his right hand .    hallo .   he said .   hallo .    no one answered .   shadwell shivered .  then  with his hand held out in front of him like a gun that he didn t dare fire and didn t know how to unload  he stepped out into the street  letting the door slam behind him .   it shook the floor .  one of aziraphale s candles fell over  spilling burning wax across the old  dry wood .          crowley s london flat was the epitome of style .  it was everything that a flat should be  spacious  white  elegantly furnished  and with that designer unlived in look that only comes from not being lived in .   this is because crowley did not live there .   it was simply the place he went back to  at the end of the day  when he was in london .  the beds were always made  the fridge was always stocked with gourmet food that never went off  that was why crowley had a fridge  after all   and for that matter the fridge never needed to be defrosted  or even plugged in .   the lounge contained a huge television  a white leather sofa  a video and a laserdisc player  an ansaphone  two telephones   the ansaphone line  and the private line  a number so far undiscovered by the legions of telephone salesmen who persisted in trying to sell crowley double glazing  which he already had  or life insurance  which he didn t need    and a square matte black sound system  the kind so exquisitely engineered that it just has the on off switch and the volume control .  the only sound equipment crowley had overlooked was speakers  he d forgotten about them .  not that it made any difference .  the sound reproduction was quite perfect anyway .   there was an unconnected fax machine with the intelligence of a computer and a computer with the intelligence of a retarded ant .  nevertheless  crowley upgraded it every few months  because a sleek computer was the sort of thing crowley felt that the sort of human he tried to be would have .  this one was like a porsche with a screen .  the manuals were still in their transparent wrapping .    along with the standard computer warranty agreement which said that if the machine    didn t work     didn t do what the expensive advertisements said     electrocuted the immediate neighborhood     and in fact failed entirely to be inside the expensive box when you opened it  this was expressly  absolutely  implicitly and in no event the fault or responsibility of the manufacturer  that the purchaser should consider himself lucky to be allowed to give his money to the manufacturer  and that any attempt to treat what had just been paid for as the purchaser s own property would result in the attentions of serious men with menacing briefcases and very thin watches .  crowley had been extremely impressed with the warranties offered by the computer industry  and had in fact sent a bundle below to the department that drew up the immortal soul agreements  with a yellow memo form attached just saying   learn  guys       in fact the only things in the flat crowley devoted any personal attention to were the houseplants .  they were huge and green and glorious  with shiny  healthy  lustrous leaves .   this was because  once a week  crowley went around the flat with a green plastic plant mister  spraying the leaves  and talking to the plants .   he had heard about talking to plants in the early seventies  on radio four  and thought it an excellent idea .  although talking is perhaps the wrong word for what crowley did .   what he did was put the fear of god into them .   more precisely  the fear of crowley .   in addition to which  every couple of months crowley would pick out a plant that was growing too slowly  or succumbing to leaf wilt or browning  or just didn t look quite as good as the others  and he would carry it around to all the other plants .   say goodbye to your friend   he d say to them .   he just couldn t cut it      then he would leave the flat with the offending plant  and return an hour or so later with a large  empty flower pot  which he would leave somewhere conspicuously around the flat .   the plants were the most luxurious  verdant  and beautiful in london .  also the most terrified .   the lounge was lit by spotlights and white neon tubes  of the kind one casually props against a chair or a corner .   the only wall decoration was a framed drawing   the cartoon for the mona lisa  leonardo da vinci s original sketch .  crowley had bought it from the artist one hot afternoon in florence  and felt it was superior to the final painting .    leonardo had felt so too .   i got her bloody smile right in the roughs   he told crowley  sipping cold wine in the lunchtime sun   but it went all over the place when i painted it .  her husband had a few things to say about it when i delivered it  but  like i tell him  signor del giocondo  apart from you  who s going to see it .  anyway    explain this helicopter thing again  will you .     crowley had a bedroom  and a kitchen  and an office  and a lounge  and a toilet  each room forever clean and perfect .   he had spent an uncomfortable time in each of these rooms  during the long wait for the end of the world .   he had phoned his operatives in the witchfinder army again  to try to get news  but his contact  sergeant shadwell  had just gone out  and the dimwitted receptionist seemed unable to grasp that he was willing to talk to any of the others .    mr .  pulsifer is out too  love   she told him .   he went down to tadfield this morning .  on a mission .     i ll speak to anyone   crowley had explained .    i ll tell mr .  shadwell that   she had said   when he gets back .  now if you don t mind  it s one of my mornings  and i can t leave my gentleman like that for long or he ll catch his death .  and at two i ve got mrs .  ormerod and mr .  scroggie and young julia coming over for a sitting  and there s the place to clean and all beforehand .  but i ll give mr .  shadwell your message .    crowley gave up .  he tried to read a novel  but couldn t concentrate .  he tried to sort his cds into alphabetical order  but gave up when he discovered they already were in alphabetical order  as was his bookcase  and his collection of soul music .    he was very proud of his collection .  it had taken him ages to put together .  this was real soul music .  james brown wasn t in it .    eventually he settled down on the white leather sofa and gestured on the television .    reports are coming in   said a worried newscaster   uh  reports are  well  nobody seems to know what s going on  but reports available to us would seem to  uh  indicate an increase in international tensions that would have undoubtedly been viewed as impossible this time last week when  er  everyone seemed to be getting on so nicely .  er .    this would seem at least partly due to the spate of unusual events which have occurred over the last few days .    off the coast of japan   crowley .    yes   admitted crowley .   what the hell is going on  crowley .  what exactly have you been doing .    how do you mean .   crowley asked  although he already knew .   the boy called warlock .  we have brought him to the fields of meggido .  the dog is not with him .  the child knows nothing of the great war .  he is not our master s son .    ah   said crowley .   is that all you can say  crowley .  our troops are assembled  the four beasts have begun to ride   but where are they riding to .  something has gone wrong  crowley and it is your responsibility .  and  in all probability  your fault .  we trust you hays a perfectly reasonable explanation for all this      oh yes   agreed crowley  readily .   perfectly reasonable .        because you are going to have your chance to explain it all to us you are going to have all the time  there is to explain .  and we will listen with great interest to everything you have to say .  and your conversation .  and the circumstances that will accompany it  will provide a source of entertainment and pleasure for all the damned of hell  crowley because no matter how racked with torment  no matter what agonies the lowest of the damned are suffering  crowley  you will have it worse     with a gesture  crowley turned the set off .   the dull gray green screen continued enunciating  the silence formed itself into words .   do not even think about trying to escape us  crowley there is no escape .  stay where you are .  you will be    collected     crowley went to the window and looked out .  something black and car shaped was moving slowly down the street toward him .  it was carshaped enough to fool the casual observer .  crowley  who was observing very carefully  noticed that not only were the wheels not going round  but they weren t even attached to the car .  it was slowing down as it passed each house  crowley assumed that the car s passengers  neither of them would be driving  neither of them knew how  were peering out at the house numbers .   he had a little time .  crowley went into the kitchen  and got a plastic bucket from under the sink .  then he went back into the lounge .   the infernal authorities had ceased communicating .  crowley turned the television to the wall  just in case .   he walked over to the mona lisa .   crowley lifted the picture down from the wall  revealing a safe .  it was not a wall safe  it had been bought from a company that specialized in servicing the nuclear industry .   he unlocked it  revealing an inner door with a dial tumble lock .  he spun the dial                was the code  easy to remember  the year he had slithered onto this stupid  marvelous planet  back when it was gleaming and new  .   inside the safe were a thermos flask  two heavy pvc gloves  of the kind that covered one s entire arms  and some tongs .   crowley paused .  he eyed the flask nervously .    there was a crash from downstairs .  that had been the front door      he pulled on the gloves and gingerly took the flask  and the tongs  and the bucket   and  as an afterthought  he grabbed the plant mister from beside a luxuriant rubber plant   and headed for his office  walking like a man carrying a thermos flask full of something that might cause  if he dropped it or even thought about dropping it  the sort of explosion that impels graybeards to make statements like  and where this crater is now  once stood the city of wah shing ton   in sf b movies .   he reached his office  nudged open the door with his shoulder .  then he bent his legs  and slowly put things down on the floor .  bucket    tongs    plant mister    and finally  deliberately  the flask .   a bead of sweat began to form on crowley s forehead  and trickled down into one eye .  he flicked it away .   then  with care and deliberation  he used the tongs to unscrew the top of the flask    carefully    carefully    that was it      a pounding on the stairs below him  and a muffled scream .  that would have been the little old lady on the floor below .    he could not afford to rush .   he gripped the flask with the tongs  and taking care not to spill the tiniest drop  he poured the contents into the plastic bucket .  one false move was all it would take .   there .   then he opened the office door about six inches  and placed the bucket on top .   he used the tongs to replace the top of the flask  then     a crash from his outer hallway     pulled off the pvc gloves  picked up the plant mister  and settled himself behind his desk .    crawlee    .   called a guttural voice .  hastur .    he s through there   hissed another voice .   i can feel the slimy little creep .   ligur .   hastur and ligur .   now  as crowley would be the first to protest  most demons weren t deep down evil .  in the great cosmic game they felt they occupied the same position as tax inspectors   doing an unpopular job  maybe  but essential to the overall operation of the whole thing .  if it came to that  some angels weren t paragons of virtue  crowley had met one or two who  when it came to righteously smiting the ungodly  smote a good deal harder than was strictly necessary .  on the whole  everyone had a job to do  and just did it .   and on the other hand  you got people like ligur and hastur  who took such a dark delight in unpleasantness you might even have mistaken them for human .   crowley leaned back in his executive chair .  he forced himself to relax and failed appallingly .    in here  people   he called .    we want a word with you   said ligur  in a tone of voice intended to imply that  word  was synonymous with  horrifically painful eternity    and the squat demon pushed open the office door .   the bucket teetered  then fell neatly on ligur s head .   drop a lump of sodium in water .  watch it flame and burn and spin around crazily  flaring and sputtering .  this was like that  just nastier .   the demon peeled and flared and flickered .  oily brown smoke oozed from it  and it screamed and it screamed and it screamed .  then it crumpled  folded in on itself  and what was left lay glistening on the burnt and blackened circle of carpet  looking like a handful of mashed slugs .    hi   said crowley to hastur  who had been walking behind ligur  and had unfortunately not been so much as splashed .   there are some things that are unthinkable  there are some depths that not even demons would believe other demons would stoop to .       holy water .  you bastard   said hastur .   you complete bastard .  he hadn t never done nothing to you .     yet   corrected crowley  who felt a little more comfortable  now the odds were closer to even .  closer  but not yet even  not by a long shot .  hastur was a duke of hell .  crowley wasn t even a local counsellor .    your fate will be whispered by mothers in dark places to frighten their young   said hastur  and then felt that the language of hell wasn t up to the job .   you re going to get taken to the bloody cleaners  pal   he added .   crowley raised the green plastic plant mister  and sloshed it around threateningly .   go away   he said .  he heard the phone downstairs ringing .  four times  and then the ansaphone caught it .  he wondered vaguely who it was .    you don t frighten me   said hastur .  he watched a drip of water leak from the nozzle and slide slowly down the side of the plastic container  toward crowley s hand .    do you know what this is .   asked crowley .   this is a sainsbury s plant mister  cheapest and most efficient plant mister in the world .  it can squirt a fine spray of water into the air .  do i need to tell you what s in it .  it can turn you into that   he pointed to the mess on the carpet .   now  go away .    then the drip on the side of the plant mister reached crowley s curled fingers  and stopped .   you re bluffing   said hastur .    maybe i am   said crowley  in a tone of voice which he hoped made it quite clear that bluffing was the last thing on his mind .   and maybe i m not .  do you feel lucky .    hastur gestured  and the plastic bulb dissolved like rice paper  spilling water all over crowley s desk  and all over crowley s suit .    yes   said hastur .  and then he smiled .  his teeth were too sharp  and his tongue flickered between them .   do you .    crowley said nothing .  plan a had worked .  plan b had failed .  everything depended on plan c  and there was one drawback to this  he had only ever planned as far as b .    so   hissed hastur   time to go  crowley .     i think there s something you ought to know   said crowley  stalling for time .    and that is .   smiled hastur .   then the phone on crowley s desk rang .   he picked it up  and warned hastur   don t move .  there s something very important you should know  and i really mean it .  hallo .    ngh   said crowley .  then he said   nuh .  got an old friend here .    aziraphale hung up on him .  crowley wondered what he had wanted .   and suddenly plan c was there  in his head .  he didn t replace the handset on the receiver .  instead he said   okay  hastur .  you ve passed the test .  you re ready to start playing with the big boys .     have you gone mad .     nope .  don t you understand .  this was a test .  the lords of hell had to know that you were trustworthy before we gave you command of the legions of the damned  in the war ahead .     crowley  you are lying  or you are insane  or possibly you are both   said hastur  but his certainty was shaken .   just for a moment he had entertained the possibility  that was where crowley had got him .  it was just possible that hell was testing him .  that crowley was more than he seemed .  hastur was paranoid  which was simply a sensible and well adjusted reaction to living in hell  where they really were all out to get you .   crowley began to dial a number .    s okay  duke hastur .  i wouldn t expect you to believe it from me   he admitted .   but why don t we talk to the dark council   i am sure that they can convince you .    the number he had dialed clicked and started to ring .    so long  sucker   he said .   and vanished .   in a tiny fraction of a second  hastur was gone as well .          over the years a huge number of theological man hours have been spent debating the famous question   how many angels can dance on the head of a pin .   in order to arrive at an answer  the following facts must be taken into consideration   firstly  angels simply don t dance .  it s one of the distinguishing characteristics that marks an angel .  they may listen appreciatively to the music of the spheres  but they don t feel the urge to get down and boogie to it .  so  none .   at least  nearly none .  aziraphale had learned to gavotte in a discreet gentlemen s club in portland place  in the late     s  and while he had initially taken to it like a duck to merchant banking  after a while he had become quite good at it  and was quite put out when  some decades later  the gavotte went out of style for good .   so providing the dance was a gavotte  and providing that he had a suitable partner  also able  for the sake of argument  both to gavotte  and to dance it on the head of a pin   the answer is a straightforward one .   then again  you might just as well ask how many demons can dance on the head of a pin .  they re of the same original stock  after all .  and at least they dance .   although it s not what you and i would call dancing .  not good dancing anyway .  a demon moves like a white band on  soul train .     and if you put it that way  the answer is  quite a lot actually  providing they abandon their physical bodies  which is a picnic for a demon .  demons aren t bound by physics .  if you take the long view  the universe is just something small and round  like those water filled balls which produce a miniature snowstorm when you shake them .   although  unless the ineffable plan is a lot more ineffable than it s given credit for  it does not have a giant plastic snowman at the bottom .   but if you look from really close up  the only problem about dancing on the head of a pin is all those big gaps between electrons .   for those of angel stock or demon breed  size  and shape  and composition  are simply options .   crowley is currently traveling incredibly fast down a telephone  ring .   crowley went through two telephone exchanges at a very respectable fraction of light speed .  hastur was a little way behind him  four or five inches  but at that size it gave crowley a very comfortable lead .  one that would vanish  of course  when he came out the other end .   they were too small for sound  but demons don t necessarily need sound to communicate .  he could hear hastur screaming behind him   you bastard .  i ll get you .  you can t escape me .    ring .    wherever you come out  i ll come out too .  you won t get away .    crowley had traveled through over twenty miles of cable in less than a second .   hastur was close behind him .  crowley was going to have to time this whole thing very  very carefully .   ring .   that was the third ring .  well  thought crowley  here goes nothing .  he stopped  suddenly  and watched hastur shoot past him .  hastur turned and     ring .   crowley shot out through the phone line  zapped through the plastic sheathing  and materialized  full size and out of breath  in his lounge .   click  the outgoing message tape began to turn on his ansaphone .  then there was a beep  and  as the incoming message tape turned  a voice from the speaker screamed  after the beep   right .  what .     you bloody snake .    the little red message light began to flash .   on and off and on and off  like a tiny  red  angry eye .   crowley really wished he had some more holy water and the time to hold the cassette in it until it dissolved .  but getting hold of ligur s terminal bath had been dangerous enough  he d had it for years just in case  and even its presence in the room made him uneasy .  or    or maybe    yes  what would happen if he put the cassette in the car .  he could play hastur over and over again  until he turned into freddie mercury .  no .  he might be a bastard  but you could only go so far .   there was a rumble of distant thunder .   he had no time to spare .   he had nowhere to go .   he went anyway .  he ran down to his bentley and drove toward the west end as if all the demons of hell were after him .  which was more or less the case .          madame tracy heard mr .  shadwell s slow tread come up the stairs .  it was slower than usual  and paused every few steps .  normally he came up the stairs as if he hated every one of them .   she opened her door .  he was leaning against the landing wall .    why  mr .  shadwell   she said   whatever have you done to your hand .     get away frae me  wumman   shadwell groaned .   i dinna know my ane powers .     why are you holding it out like that .    shadwell tried to back into the wall .    stand back  i tell ye .  i canna be responsible .     what on earth has happened to you  mr .  shadwell .   said madame tracy  trying to take his hand .    nothing on earth .  nothing on earth .    she managed to grab his arm .  he  shadwell  scourge of evil  was powerless to resist being drawn into her flat .   he d never been in it before  at least in his waking moments .  his dreams had furnished it in silks  rich hangings  and what he thought of as scented ungulants .  admittedly  it did have a bead curtain in the entrance to the kitchenette and a lamp made rather inexpertly from a chianti bottle  because madame tracy s apprehension of what was chic  like aziraphale s  had grounded around      .  and there was a table in the middle of the room with a velvet cloth on it and  on the cloth  the crystal ball which increasingly was madame tracy s means of earning a living .    i think you could do with a good lie down  mr .  shadwell   she said  in a voice that brooked no argument  and led him on into the bedroom .  he was too bewildered to protest .    but young newt is out there   shadwell muttered   in thrall to heathen passions and occult wiles .     then i m sure he ll know what to do about them   said madame tracy briskly  whose mental picture of what newt was going through was probably much closer to reality than was shadwell s .   and i m sure he wouldn t like to think of you getting yourself worked up into a state here .  just you lie down  and i ll make us both a nice cup of tea .    she disappeared in a clacking of bead curtains .   suddenly shadwell was alone on what he was just capable of recalling  through the wreckage of his shattered nerves  was a bed of sin  and right at this moment was incapable of deciding whether that was in fact better or worse than not being alone on a bed of sin .  he turned his head to take in his surroundings .   madame tracy s concepts of what was erotic stemmed from the days when young men grew up thinking that women had beach balls affixed firmly in front of their anatomy  brigitte bardot could be called a sex kitten without anyone bursting out laughing  and there really were magazines with names like girls  giggles and garters .  somewhere in this cauldron of permissiveness she had picked up the idea that soft toys in the bedroom created an intimate  coquettish air .   shadwell stared for some time at a large  threadbare teddy bear  which had one eye missing and a torn ear .  it probably had a name like mr .  buggins .   he turned his head the other way .  his gaze was blocked by a pajama case shaped like an animal that may have been a dog but  there again  might have been a skunk .  it had a cheery grin .    urg   he said .   but recollection kept storming back .  he really had done it .  no one else in the army had ever exorcised a demon  as far as he knew .  not hopkins  not siftings  not diceman .  probably not even witchfinder company sergeant major narker   who held the all time record for most witches found .   the wa enjoyed a renaissance during the great days of empire expansionism .  the british army s endless skirmishes frequently brought it up against witch doctors  bone pointers  shamans  and other occult adversaries .  this was the cue for the deployment of the likes of wa csm narker  whose striding  bellowing  six foot six  eighteen stone figure  clutching an armor plated book  eight pound bell  and specially reinforced candle  could clear the veldt of adversaries faster than a gatling gun .  cecil rhodes wrote of him   some remote tribes consider him to be a kind of god  and it is an extremely brave or foolhardy witch doctor who will stand his ground with csm narker bearing down on him .  i would rather have this man on my side than two battalions of gurkhas .    sooner or later every army runs across its ultimate weapon and now it existed  shadwell reflected  on the end of his arm .   well  screw no first use .  he d have a bit of a rest  seeing as he was here  and then the powers of darkness had met their match at last     when madame tracy brought the tea in he was snoring .  she tactfully closed the door  and rather thankfully as well  because she had a seance due in twenty minutes and it was no good turning down money these days .   although madame tracy was by many yardsticks quite stupid  she had an instinct in certain matters  and when it came to dabbling in the occult her reasoning was faultless .  dabbling  she d realized  was exactly what her customers wanted .  they didn t want to be shoved in it up to their necks .  they didn t want the multi planular mysteries of time and space  they just wanted to be reassured that mother was getting along fine now she was dead .  they wanted just enough occult to season the simple fare of their lives  and preferably in portions no longer than forty five minutes  followed by tea and biscuits .   they certainly didn t want odd candles  scents  chants  or mystic runes .  madame tracy had even removed most of the major arcana from her tarot card pack  because their appearance tended to upset people .   and she made sure that she had always put sprouts on to boil just before a seance .  nothing is more reassuring  nothing is more true to the comfortable spirit of english occultism  than the smell of brussels sprouts cooking in the next room .          it was early afternoon  and the heavy storm clouds had turned the sky the color of old lead .  it would rain soon  heavily  blindingly .  the firemen hoped the rain would come soon .  the sooner the better .   they had arrived fairly promptly  and the younger firemen were dashing around excitedly  unrolling their hosepipe and flexing their axes  the older firemen knew at a glance that the building was a dead loss  and weren t even sure that the rain would stop it spreading to neighboring buildings  when a black bentley skidded around the corner and drove up onto the pavement at a speed somewhere in excess of sixty miles per hour  and stopped with a screech of brakes half an inch away from the wall of the bookshop .  an extremely agitated young man in dark glasses got out and ran toward the door of the blazing bookshop .   he was intercepted by a fireman .    are you the owner of this establishment .   asked the fireman .    don t be stupid .  do i look like i run a bookshop .     i really wouldn t know about that  sir .  appearances can be very deceptive .  for example  i am a fireman .  however  upon meeting me socially  people unaware of my occupation often suppose that i am  in fact  a chartered accountant or company director .  imagine me out of uniform  sir  and what kind of man would you see before you .  honestly .     a prat   said crowley  and he ran into the bookshop .   this sounds easier than it actually was  since in order to manage it crowley needed to avoid half a dozen firemen  two policemen  and a number of interesting soho night people   in any other place than soho it is quite possible that spectators at a fire might have been interested .   out early  and arguing heatedly amongst themselves about which particular section of society had brightened up the afternoon  and why .   crowley pushed straight through them .  they scarcely spared him a glance .   then he pushed open the door  and stepped into an inferno .   the whole bookshop was ablaze .   aziraphale .   he called .    aziraphale  you   you stupid aziraphale .  are you here .    no answer .  just the crackle of burning paper  the splintering of glass as the fire reached the upstairs rooms  the crash of collapsing timbers .   he scanned the shop urgently  desperately  looking for the angel  looking for help .   in the far corner a bookshelf toppled over  cascading flaming books across the floor .  the fire was all around him  and crowley ignored it .  his left trouser leg began to smolder  he stopped it with a glance .    hello .  aziraphale .  for go     for sa     for somebody s sake .  aziraphale .    the shop window was smashed from outside .  crowley turned  startled  and an unexpected jet of water struck him full in the chest  knocking him to the ground .   his shades flew to a far corner of the room  and became a puddle of burning plastic .  yellow eyes with slitted vertical pupils were revealed .  wet and steaming  face ash blackened  as far from cool as it was possible for him to be  on all fours in the blazing bookshop  crowley cursed aziraphale  and the ineffable plan  and above  and below .   then he looked down  and saw it .  the book .  the book that the girl had left in the car in tadfield  on wednesday night .  it was slightly scorched around the cover  but miraculously unharmed .  he picked it up  stuffed it into his jacket pocket  stood up  unsteadily  and brushed himself off .   the floor above him collapsed .  with a roar and gargantuan shrug the building fell in on itself  in a rain of brick and timber and flaming debris .   outside  the passersby were being herded back by the police  and a fireman was explaining to anyone who would listen   i couldn t stop him .  he must have been mad .  or drunk .  just ran in .  i couldn t stop him .  mad .  ran straight in .  horrible way to die .  horrible  horrible .  just ran straight in     then crowley came out of the flames .   the police and the firemen looked at him  saw the expression on his face  and stayed exactly where they were .   he climbed into the bentley and reversed back into the road  swung around a fire truck  into wardour street  and into the darkened afternoon .   they stared at the car as it sped away .  finally one policeman spoke .   weather like this  he ought to of put his lights on   he said  numbly .    especially driving like that .  could be dangerous   agreed another  in flat  dead tones  and they all stood there in the light and the heat of the burning bookshop  wondering what was happening to a world they had thought they understood .   there was a flash of lightning  blue white  strobing across the cloud black sky  a crack of thunder so loud it hurt  and a hard rain began to fall .          she rode a red motorbike .  not a friendly honda red  a deep  bloody red  rich and dark and hateful .  the bike was apparently  in every other respect  ordinary except for the sword  resting in its scabbard  set onto the side of the bike .   her helmet was crimson  and her leather jacket was the color of old wine .  in ruby studs on the back were picked out the words hell s angels .   it was ten past one in the afternoon and it was dark and humid and wet .  the motorway was almost deserted  and the woman in red roared down the road on her red motorbike  smiling lazily .   it had been a good day so far .  there was something about the sight of a beautiful woman on a powerful motorbike with a sword stuck on the back that had a powerful effect on a certain type of man .  so far four traveling salesmen had tried to race her  and bits of ford sierra now decorated the crash barriers and bridge supports along forty miles of motorway .   she pulled up at a service area  and went into the happy porker cafe .  it was almost empty .  a bored waitress was darning a sock behind the counter  and a knot of black leathered bikers  hard  hairy  filthy  and huge  were clustered around an even taller individual in a black coat .  he was resolutely playing something that in bygone years would have been a fruit machine  but now had a video screen  and advertised itself as trivia scrabble .   the audience were saying things like    it s  d  .  press  d    the godfather must vegot more oscars than gone with the wind .     puppet on a string .  sandie shaw .  honest .  i m bleeding positive .          .     no  you great pillock .  that was the fire .  the plague was      .     it s  b    the great wall of china wasn t one of the seven wonders of the world .    there were four options  pop music  sport  current events  and general knowledge .  the tall biker  who had kept his helmet on  was pressing the buttons  to all intents and purposes oblivious of his supporters .  at any rate  he was consistently winning .   the red rider went over to the counter .    a cup of tea  please .  and a cheese sandwich   she said .    you on your own  then  dear .   asked the waitress  passing the tea  and something white and dry and hard  across the counter .    waiting for friends .     ah   she said  biting through some wool .   well  you re better off waiting in here .  it s hell out there .     no   she told her .   not yet .    she picked a window table  with a good view of the parking lot  and she waited .   she could hear the trivia scrabblers in the background .    thass a new one   how many times has england been officially at war with france since      .      twenty .  nah  s never twenty    oh .  it was .  well  i never .     american war with mexico .  i know that .  it s june      .   d    see .  i tol  you .    the second shortest biker  pigbog          whispered to the shortest  greaser            what happened to  sport   then .   he had love tattooed on one set of knuckles  hate on the other .    it s random wossit  selection  innit .  i mean they do it with microchips .  it s probably got  like  millions of different subjects in there  in its ram .   he had fish across his right hand knuckle  and chip on the left .    pop music  current events  general knowledge  and war .  it s just i ve never seen  war  before .  that s why i mentioned it .   pigbog cracked his knuckles  loudly  and pulled the ring tab on a can of beer .  he swigged back half a can  belched carelessly  then sighed .   i just wish they d do more bleeding bible questions .     why .   greaser had never thought of pigbog as being a bible trivia freak .     cos  well  you remember that bit of bother in brighton .     oh  yeah .  you was on crimewatch   said greaser  with a trace of envy .    well  i had to hang out in that hotel where me mam worked  dinni .  free months .  and nothin  to read  only this bugger gideon had left his bible behind .  it kind of sticks in your mind .    another motorbike  jet black and gleaming  drew up in the carpark outside .   the door to the cafe opened .  a blast of cold wind blew through the room  a man dressed all in black leather  with a short black beard  walked over to the table  sat next to the woman in red  and the bikers around the video scrabble machine suddenly noticed how hungry they all were  and deputed skuzz to go and get them something to eat .  all of them except the player  who said nothing  just pressed the buttons for the right answers and let his winnings accumulate in the tray at the bottom of the machine .    i haven t seen you since mafeking   said red .   how s it been going .     i ve been keeping pretty busy   said black .   spent a lot of time in america .  brief world tours .  just killing time  really .      what do you mean  you ve got no steak and kidney pies .   asked skuzz  affronted .    i thought we had some  but we don t   said the woman .     feels funny  all of us finally getting together like this   said red .    funny .     well  you know .  when you ve spent all these thousands of years waiting for the big day  and it finally comes .  like waiting for christmas .  or birthdays .     we don t have birthdays .     i didn t say we do .  i just said that was what it was like .      actually   admitted the woman   it doesn t look like we ve got anything left at all .  except that slice of pizza .     has it got anchovies on it .   asked skuzz gloomily .  none of the chapter liked anchovies .  or olives .    yes  dear .  it s anchovy and olives .  would you like it .    skuzz shook his head sadly .  stomach rumbling  he made his way back to the game .  big ted got irritable when he got hungry  and when big ted got irritable everyone got a slice .    a new category had come up on the video screen .  you could now answer questions about pop music  current events  famine  or war .  the bikers seemed marginally less informed about the irish potato famine of       the english everything famine of       and the      dope famine in san francisco than they had been about war  but the player was still racking up a perfect score  punctuated occasionally by a whir  ratchet  and chink as the machine disgorged pound coins into its tray .    weather looks a bit tricky down south   said red .   black squinted at the darkening clouds .   no .  looks fine to me .  we ll have a thunderstorm along any minute .    red looked at her nails .   that s good .  it wouldn t be the same if we didn t have a good thunderstorm .  any idea how far we ve got to ride .    black shrugged .   a few hundred miles .     i thought it d be longer  somehow .  all that waiting  just for a few hundred miles .     it s not the traveling   said black .   it s the arriving that matters .    there was a roar outside .  it was the roar of a motorbike with a defective exhaust  untuned engine  leaky carburetor .  you didn t have to see the bike to imagine the clouds of black smoke it traveled in  the oil slicks it left in its wake  the trail of small motorbike parts and fittings that littered the roads behind it .   black went up to the counter .    four teas  please   he said .   one black .    the cafe door opened .  a young man in dusty white leathers entered  and the wind blew empty crisp packets and newspapers and ice cream wrappers in with him .  they danced around his feet like excited children  then fell exhausted to the floor .    four of you  are there  dear .   asked the woman .  she was trying to find some clean cups and tea spoons   the entire rack seemed suddenly to have been coated in a light film of motor oil and dried egg .    there will be   said the man in black  and he took the teas and went back to the table  where his two comrades waited .    any sign of him .   said the boy in white .   they shook their heads .   an argument had broken out around the video screen  current categories showing on the screen were war  famine  pollution  and pop trivia              .    elvis presley .   sgotta be  c    it was      he snuffed it  wasn t it .     nah .   d .        .  i m positive .     yeah .  same year as bing crosby .     and marc bolan .  he was dead good .  press  d   then .  go on .    the tall figure made no motion to press any of the buttons .    woss the matter with you .   asked big ted  irritably .   go on .  press  d .   elvis presley died in      .    i don t care what it says  said the tall biker in the helmet  i never laid a finger on him .   the three people at the table turned as one .  red spoke .   when did you get here .   she asked .   the tall man walked over to the table  leaving the astonished bikers  and his winnings  behind him .  i never went away  he said  and his voice was a dark echo from the night places  a cold slab of sound  gray  and dead .  if that voice was a stone it would have had words chiseled on it a long time ago  a name  and two dates .    your tea s getting cold  lord   said famine .    it s been a long time   said war .   there was a flash of lightning  almost immediately followed by a low rumble of thunder .    lovely weather for it   said pollution .   yes .   the bikers around the game were getting progressively baffled by this exchange .  led by big ted  they shambled over to the table and stared at the four strangers .   it did not escape their notice that all four strangers had hell s angels on their jackets .  and they looked dead dodgy as far as the angels were concerned  too clean for a start  and none of the four looked like they d ever broken anyone s arm just because it was sunday afternoon and there wasn t anything good on the telly .  and one was a woman  too  only not ridin  around on the back of someone s bike but actually allowed one of her own  like she had any right to it .    you re hell s angels  then .   asked big ted  sarcastically .  if there s one thing real hell s angels can t abide  it s weekend bikers .   there are a number of other things real hell s angels can t abide .  these include the police  soap  ford cortinas  and  in big ted s case  anchovies and olives .    the four strangers nodded .    what chapter are you from  then .    the tall stranger looked at big ted .  then he stood up .  it was a complicated motion  if the shores of the seas of night had deckchairs  they d open up something like that .   he seemed to be unfolding himself forever .   he wore a dark helmet  completely hiding his features .  and it was made of that weird plastic  big ted noted .  like  you looked in it  and all you could see was your own face .   revelations  he said .  chapter six .    verses two to eight   added the boy in white  helpfully .   big ted glared at the four of them .  his lower jaw began to protrude  and a little blue vein in his temple started to throb .   wossat mean then .   he demanded .   there was a tug at his sleeve .  it was pigbog .  he had gone a peculiar shade of gray  under the dirt .    it means we re in trouble   said pigbog .   and then the tall stranger reached up a pale motorbike gauntlet  and raised the visor of his helmet  and big ted found himself wishing  for the first time in his existence  that he d lived a better life .    jesus christ .   he moaned .    i think he may be along in a minute   said pigbog urgently .   he s probably looking for somewhere to park his bike .  let s go and  and join a youf club or somethin       but big ted s invincible ignorance was his shield and armor .  he didn t move .    cor   he said .   hell s angels .    war flipped him a lazy salute .    that s us  big ted   she said .   the real mccoy .    famine nodded .   the old firm   he said .   pollution removed his helmet and shook out his long white hair .  he had taken over when pestilence  muttering about penicillin  had retired in      .  if only the old boy had known what opportunities the future had held      others promise   he said   we deliver .    big ted looked at the fourth horseman .    ere  i seen you before   he said .   you was on the cover of that blue oyster cult album .  an  i got a ring wif your    your    your head on it .    i get everywhere .    cor .   big ted s big face screwed up with the effort of thought .    wot kind of bike you ridin  .   he said .          the storm raged around the quarry .  the rope with the old car tire on it danced in the gale .  sometimes a sheet of iron  relic of an attempt at a tree house  would shake loose from its insubstantial moorings and sail away .   the them huddled together  staring at adam .  he seemed bigger  somehow .  dog sat and growled .  he was thinking of all the smells he would lose .  there were no smells in hell  apart from the sulphur .  while some of them here  were  were    well  the fact was  there were no bitches in hell either .   adam was marching about excitedly  waving his hands in the air .   there ll be no end to the fun we can have   he said .   there ll be exploring and everything .  i  spect i can soon get the ole jungles to grow again .     but   but who   who ll do the  you know  all the cooking and washing and suchlike .   quavered brian .    no one ll have to do any of that stuff   said adam .   you can have all the food you like  loads of chips  fried onion rings  anything you like .  an  never have to wear any new clothes or have a bath if you don t want to or anything .  or go to school or anything .  or do anything you don t want to do  ever again .  it ll be wicked .           the moon came up over the kookamundi hills .  it was very bright tonight .   johnny two bones sat in the red basin of the desert .  it was a sacred place  where two ancestral rocks  formed in the dream time  lay as they had since the beginning .  johnny two bones  walkabout was coming to an end .  his cheeks and chest were smeared with red ochre  and he was singing an old song  a sort of singing map of the hills  and he was drawing patterns in the dust with his spear .   he had not eaten for two days  he had not slept .  he was approaching a trance state  making him one with the bush  putting him into communion with his ancestors .   he was nearly there .   nearly     he blinked .  looked around wonderingly .    excuse me  dear boy   he said to himself  out loud  in precise  enunciated tones .   but have you any idea where i am .     who said that .   said johnny two bones .   his mouth opened .   i did .    johnny scratched  thoughtfully .   i take it you re one of me ancestors  then  mate .     oh .  indubitably  dear boy .  quite indubitably .  in a manner of speaking .  now  to get back to my original question .  where am i .     only if you re one of my ancestors   continued johnny two bones   why are you talking like a poofter .     ah .  australia   said johnny two bones  mouth  pronouncing the word as though it would have to be properly disinfected before he said it again .   oh dear .  well  thank you anyway .     hello .  hello .   said johnny two bones .   he sat in the sand  and he waited  and he waited  but he didn t reply .   aziraphale had moved on .          citron deux chevaux was tonton macoute  a travelling houngan   magician  or priest .  voodoun is a very interesting religion for the whole family  even those members of it who are dead .   he had a satchel over his shoulder  containing magical plants  medicinal plants  bits of wild cat  black candles  a powder derived chiefly from the skin of a certain dried fish  a dead centipede  a half bottle of chivas regal  ten rothmans  and a copy of what s on in haiti .   he hefted the knife  and  with an experienced slicing motion  cut the head from a black cockerel .  blood washed over his right hand .    loa ride me   he intoned .   gros bon ange come to me .     where am i .   he said .    is that my gros bon ange .   he asked himself .    i think that s a rather personal question   he replied .   i mean  as these things go .  but one tries as it were .  one does one s best .    citron found one of his hands reaching for the cockerel .   rather unsanitary place to do your cooking  don t you think .  out here in the jungle .  having a barbecue  are we .  what kind of place is this .     haitian   he answered .    damn .  nowhere near .  still  could be worse .  ah  i must be on my way .  be good .    and citron deux chevaux was alone in his head .    loas be buggered   he muttered to himself he stared into nothing for a while  and then reached for the satchel and its bottle of chivas regal .  there are at least two ways to turn someone into a zombie .  he was going to take the easiest .   the surf was loud on the beaches .  the palms shook .   a storm was coming .          the lights went up .  the power cable  nebraska  evangelical choir launched into  jesus is the telephone repairman on the switchboard of my life   and almost drowned out the sound of the rising wind .   marvin o .  bagman adjusted his tie  checked his grin in the mirror  patted the bottom of his personal assistant  miss cindi kellerhals  penthouse pet of the month three years ago last july  but she had put that all behind her when she got career   and he walked out onto the studio floor .       jesus won t cut you off before you re through  with him you won t never get a crossed line   and when your bill comes it ll all be properly itemized  he s the telephone repairman on the switchboard of my life      the choir sang .  marvin was fond of that song .  he had written it himself .  other songs he had written included   happy mister jesus    jesus  can i come and stay at your place .    that oi  fiery cross    jesus is the sticker on the bumper of my soul   and  when i m swept up by the rapture grab the wheel of my pick up .   they were available on jesus is my buddy  lp  cassette  and cd   and were advertised every four minutes on bagman s evangelical network .       .    per lp or cassette      .    per cd  although you got a free copy of the lp with every      you donated to marvin bagman s mission .    despite the fact that the lyrics didn t rhyme  or  as a rule  make any sense  and that marvin  who was not particularly musical  had stolen all the tunes from old country songs  jesus is my buddy had sold over four million copies .   marvin had started off as a country singer  singing old conway twitty and johnny cash songs .   he had done regular live concerts from san quentin jail until the civil rights people got him under the cruel and unusual punishment clause .   it was then that marvin got religion .  not the quiet  personal kind  that involves doing good deeds and living a better life  not even the kind that involves putting on a suit and ringing people s doorbells  but the kind that involves having your own tv network and getting people to send you money .   he had found the perfect tv mix  on marvin s hour of power   the show that put the fun back into fundamentalist .    .  four threeminute songs from the lp  twenty minutes of hellfire  and five minutes of healing people .   the remaining twenty three minutes were spent alternately cajoling  pleading  threatening  begging  and occasionally simply asking for money .   in the early days he had actually brought people into the studio to heal  but had found that too complicated  so these days he simply proclaimed visions vouchsafed to him of viewers all across america getting magically cured as they watched .  this was much simpler   he no longer needed to hire actors  and there was no way anyone could check on his success rate .   it might have surprised marvin to know there actually was a success rate .  some people would get better from anything .    the world is a lot more complicated than most people believe .  many people believed  for example  that marvin was not a true believer because he made so much money out of it .  they were wrong .  he believed with all his heart .  he believed utterly  and spent a lot of the money that flooded in on what he really thought was the lord s work .   the phone line to the saviour s always free of interference  he s in at any hour  day or night  and when you call j e s u s you always call toll free  he s the telephone repairman on the switchboard of my life .   the first song concluded  and marvin walked in front of the cameras and raised his arms modestly for silence .  in the control booth  the engineer turned down the applause track .    brothers and sisters  thank you  thank you  wasn t that beautiful .  and remember  you can hear that song and others just as edifyin  on jesus is my buddy  just phone       cash and pledge your donation now .    he became more serious .    brothers and sisters  i ve got a message for you all  an urgent message from our lord  for you all  man and woman and little babes  friends  let me tell you about the apocalypse .  it s all there in your bible  in the revelation our lord gave saint john on patmos  and in the book of daniel .  the lord always gives it to you straight  friends   your future .  so what s goin  to happen .    war .  plague .  famine .  death .  rivers urv blurd .  great earthquakes .  nukyeler missiles .  horrible times are cumin   brothers and sisters .  and there s only one way to avoid  em .    before the destruction comes   before the four horsemen of the apocalypse ride out   before the nukerler missiles rain down on the unbelievers   there will come the rapture .    what s the rapture .  i hear you cry .    when the rapture comes  brothers and sisters  all the true believers will be swept up in the air   it don t mind what you re doin   you could be in the bath  you could be at work  you could be drivin  your car  or just sittin  at home readin  your bible .  suddenly you ll be up there in the air  in perfect and incorruptible bodies .  and you ll be up in the air  lookin  down at the world as the years of destruction arrive .  only the faithful will be saved  only those of you who have been born again will avoid the pain and the death and the horror and the burnin  .  then will come the great war between heaven and hell  and heaven will destroy the forces of hell  and god shall wipe away the tears of the sufferin   and there shall be no more death  or sorrow  or cryin   or pain  and he shall rayon in glory for ever and ever      he stopped  suddenly .    well  nice try   he said  in a completely different voice   only it won t be like that at all .  not really .    i mean  you re right about the fire and war  all that .  but that rapture stuff well  if you could see them all in heaven serried ranks of them as far as the mind can follow and beyond  league after league of us  flaming swords  all that  well  what i m trying to say is who has time to go round picking people out and popping them up in the air to sneer at the people dying of radiation sickness on the parched and burning earth below them .  if that s your idea of a morally acceptable time  i might add .    and as for that stuff about heaven inevitably winning    well  to be honest  if it were that cut and dried  there wouldn t be a celestial war in the first place  would there .  it s propaganda .  pure and simple .  we ve got no more than a fifty percent chance of coming out on top .  you might just as well send money to a satanist hotline to cover your bets  although to be frank when the fire falls and the seas of blood rise you lot are all going to be civilian casualties either way .  between our war and your war  they re going to kill everyone and let god sort it out   right .    anyway  sorry to stand here wittering  i ve just a quick questionwhere am i .    marvin o .  bagman was gradually going purple .    it s the devil .  lord protect me .  the devil is speakin  through me .   he erupted  and interrupted himself   oh no  quite the opposite in fact .  i m an angel .  ah .  this has to be america  doesn t it .  so sorry  can t stay      there was a pause .  marvin tried to open his mouth  but nothing happened .  whatever was in his head looked around .  he looked at the studio crew  those who weren t phoning the police  or sobbing in corners .  he looked at the gray faced cameramen .    gosh   he said   am i on television .           crowley was doing a hundred and twenty miles an hour down oxford street .   he reached into the glove compartment for his spare pair of sunglasses  and found only cassettes .  irritably he grabbed one at random and pushed it into the slot .   he wanted bach  but he would settle for the travelling wilburys .   all we need is  radio gaga  sang freddie mercury .   all i need is out  thought crowley .   he swung around the marble arch roundabout the wrong way  doing ninety .  lightning made the london skies flicker like a malfunctioning fluorescent tube .   a livid sky on london  crowley thought  and i knew the end was near .  who had written that .  chesterton  wasn t it .  the only poet in the twentieth century to even come close to the truth .   the bentley headed out of london while crowley sat back in the driver s seat and thumbed through the singed copy of the nice and accurate prophecies of agnes nutter .   near the end of the book he found a folded sheet of paper covered in aziraphale s neat copperplate handwriting .  he unfolded it  while the bentley s gearstick shifted itself down to third and the car accelerated around a fruit lorry  which had unexpectedly backed out of aside street   and then he read it again .   then he read it one more time  with a slow sinking feeling at the base of his stomach .   the car changed direction suddenly .  it was now heading for the village of tadfield  in oxfordshire .  he could be there in an hour if he hurried .   anyway  there wasn t really anywhere else to go .   the cassette finished  activating the car radio .       gardeners  question time coming to you from tadfield gardening club .  we were last here in       a very nice summer  and as the team will remember it s a rich oxfordshire loam in the east of the parish  rising to chalk in the west  the kind of place of say  don t matter what you plant here  it ll come up beautiful isn t that right  fred .     yep   said professor fred windbright  royal botanical gardens   couldn t of put it better meself .     right   first question for the team  and this comes from mr .  r .  p .  tyler  chairman of the local residents association  i do believe .     ahem .  that s right .  well  i m a keen rose grower  but my prizewinning molly mcguire lost a couple of blossoms yesterday in a rain of what were apparently fish .  what does the team recommend for this other than place netting over the garden .  i mean  i ve written to the council       not a common problem  i d say .  harry .     mr .  tyler  let me ask you a question   were these fresh fish  or preserved .     fresh  i believe .     well  you ve got no problems  my friend .  i hear you ve also been having rains of blood in these parts   and i wish we had these up in the dales  where my garden is .  save me a fortune in fertilizers .  now  what you do is  you dig them in to your     crowley .   crowley said nothing .   crowley the war has begun  crowley we note with interest that you avoided the forces we empowered to collect you .    mm   crowley agreed .   crowley    we will win this war .  but even if we lose  at least as far as you are concerned  it will make no difference at all .  for as long as there is one demon left in hell  crowley  you will wish you had been created mortal .   crowley was silent .   mortals can hope for death  or for redemption .  you can hope for nothing .   all you can hope for is the mercy of hell .    yeah .    just our little joke .    ngk   said crowley .       now as keen gardeners know  it goes without sayin  that he s a cunnin  little devil  your tibetan .  tunnelin  straight through your begonias like it was nobody s business .  a cup of tea ll shift him  with rancid yak butter for preference you should be able to get some at any good bard      wheee .  whizz .  pop .  static drowned out the rest of the program .   crowley turned off the radio and bit his lower lip .  beneath the ash and soot that flaked his face  he looked very tired  and very pale  and very scared .   and  suddenly  very angry .  it was the way they talked to you .  as if you were a houseplant who had started shedding leaves on the carpet .   and then he turned a corner  which was meant to take him onto the slip road to the m    from which he d swing off onto the m   up to oxfordshire .   but something had happened to the m   .  something that hurt your eyes  if you looked directly at it .   from what had been the m   london orbital motorway came a low chanting  a noise formed of many strands  car horns  and engines  and sirens  and the bleep of cellular telephones  and the screaming of small children trapped by back seat seat belts for ever .   hail the great beast  devourer of worlds   came the chanting  over and over again  in the secret tongue of the black priesthood of ancient mu .   the dreaded sigil odegra  thought crowley  as he swung the car around  heading for the north circular .  i did that   that s my fault .  it could have been just another motorway .  a good job  i ll grant you  but was it really worthwhile .  it s all out of control .  heaven and hell aren t running things any more  it s like the whole planet is a third world country that s finally got the bomb     then he began to smile .  he snapped his fingers .  a pair of dark glasses materialized out of his eyes .  the ash vanished from his suit and his skin .   what the hell .  if you had to go  why not go with style .   whistling softly  he drove .          they came down the outside lane of the motorway like destroying angels  which was fair enough .   they weren t going that fast  all things considered .  the four of them were holding a steady     mph  as if they were confident that the show could not start before they got there .  it couldn t .  they had all the time in the world  such as it was .   just behind them came four other riders  big ted  greaser  pigbog  and skuzz .   they were elated .  they were real hell s angels now  and they rode the silence .   around them  they knew  was the roar of the thunderstorm  the thunder of traffic  the whipping of the wind and the rain .  but in the wake of the horsemen there was silence  pure and dead .  almost pure  anyway .  certainly dead .   it was broken by pigbog  shouting to big ted .    what you going to be  then .   he asked  hoarsely .    what .     i said  what you       i heard what you said .  it s not what you said .  everyone heard what you said .  what did you mean  tha s what i wanter know .    pigbog wished he d paid more attention to the book of revelation .   if he d known he was going to be in it  he d have read it more carefully .   what i mean is  they re the four horsemen of the apocalypse  right .     bikers   said greaser .    right .  four bikers of the apocalypse .  war  famine  death  and  and the other one .  p lution .     yeah .  so .     so they said it was all right if we came with them  right .     so .     so we re the other four horse     um  bikers of the apocalypse .  so which ones are we .    there was a pause .  the lights of passing cars shot past them in the opposite lane  lightning after imaged the clouds  and the silence was close to absolute .    can i be war as well .   asked big ted .    course you can t be war .  how can you be war .  she s war .  you ve got to be something else .    big ted screwed up his face with the effort of thought .   g . b . h .    he said  eventually .   i m grievous bodily harm .  that s me .  there .  wott re you going to be .     can i be rubbish .   asked skuzz .   or embarrassing personal problems .     can t be rubbish   said grievous bodily harm .   he s got that one sewn up  pollution .  you can be the other  though .    they rode on in the silence and the dark  the rear red lights of the four a few hundred yards in front of them .   grievous bodily harm  embarrassing personal problems  pigbog and greaser .    i wonter be cruelty to animals   said greaser .  pigbog wondered if he was for or against it .  not that it really mattered .   and then it was pigbog s turn .    i  uh    i think i ll be them answer phones .  they re pretty bad   he said .    you can t be ansaphones .  what kind of a biker of the repocalypse is ansaphones .  that s stupid  that is .     s not .   said pigbog  nettled .   it s like war  and famine  and that .  it s a problem of life  isn t it .  answer phones .  i hate bloody answer phones .     i hate ansaphones  too   said cruelty to animals .    you can shut up   said g . b . h .    can i change mine .   asked embarrassing personal problems  who had been thinking intently since he last spoke .   i want to be things not working properly even after you ve thumped them .     all right  you can change .  but you can t be ansaphones  pigbog .  pick something else .    pigbog pondered .  he wished he d never broached the subject .  it was like the careers interviews he had had as a schoolboy .  he deliberated .    really cool people   he said at last .   i hate them .     really cool people .   said things not working properly even after you ve given them a good thumping .    yeah .  you know .  the kind you see on telly  with stupid haircuts  only on them it dun t look stupid  cos it s them .  they wear baggy suits  an  you re not allowed to say they re a bunch of wankers .  i mean  speaking for me  what i always want to do when i see one of them is push their faces very slowly through a barbed wire fence .  an  what i think is this .   he took a deep breath .  he was sure this was the longest speech he had ever made in his life .   except for one about ten years earlier  throwing himself on the mercy of the court .    what i think is this .  if they get up my nose like that  they pro lly get up everyone else s .     yeah   said cruelty to animals .   an  they all wear sunglasses even when they dunt need  em .     eatin  runny cheese  and that stupid bloody no alcohol lager   said things not working properly even after you ve given them a good thumping .   i hate that stuff .  what s the point of drinking the stuff if it dun t leave you puking .  here  i just thought .  can i change again  so i m no alcohol lager .     no you bloody can t   said grievous bodily harm .   you ve changed once already .     anyway   said pigbog .   that s why i wonter be really cool people .     all right   said his leader .    don t see why i can t be no bloody alcohol lager if i want .     shut your face .    death and famine and war and pollution continued biking toward tadfield .   and grievous bodily harm  cruelty to animals  things not working properly even after you ve given them a good thumping but secretly no alcohol lager  and really cool people traveled with them .          it was a wet and blustery saturday afternoon  and madame tracy was feeling very occult .   she had her flowing dress on  and a saucepan full of sprouts on the stove .  the room was lit by candlelight  each candle carefully placed in a wax encrusted wine bottle at the four corners of her sitting room .   there were three other people at her sitting .  mrs .  ormerod from belsize park  in a dark green hat that might have been a flowerpot in a previous life  mr .  scroggie  thin and pallid  with bulging colorless eyes  and julia petley from hair today   formerly a cut above the rest  formerly mane attraction  formerly cur .  up and dye  formerly a snip at the price  formerly mister brian s art de coiffeur  formerly robinson the barber s  formerly fone a car taxis .   the hairdressers  on the high street  fresh out of school and convinced that she herself had unplumbed occult depths .  in order to enhance the occult aspects of herself  julia had begun to wear far too much handbeaten silver jewelry and green eyeshadow .  she felt she looked haunted and gaunt and romantic  and she would have  if she had lost another thirty pounds .  she was convinced that she was anorexic  because every time she looked in the mirror she did indeed see a fat person .    can you link hands .   asked madame tracy .   and we must have complete silence .  the spirit world is very sensitive to vibration .     ask if my ron is there   said mrs .  ormerod .  she had a jaw like a brick .    i will  love  but you ve got to be quiet while i make contact .    there was silence  broken only by mr .  scroggie s stomach rumbling .   pardon  ladies   he mumbled .   madame tracy had found  through years of drawing aside the veil and exploring the mysteries  that two minutes was the right length of time to sit in silence  waiting for the spirit world to make contact .  more than that and they got restive  less than that and they felt they weren t getting their money s worth .   she did her shopping list in her head .   eggs .  lettuce .  ounce of cooking cheese .  four tomatoes .  butter .  roll of toilet paper .  mustn t forget that  we re nearly out .  and a really nice piece of liver for mr .  shadwell  poor old soul  it s a shame     time .   madame tracy threw back her head  let it loll on one shoulder  then slowly lifted it again .  her eyes were almost shut .    she s going under now  dear   she heard mrs .  ormerod whisper to julia petley .   nothing to be alarmed about .  she s just making herself a bridge to the other side .  her spirit guide will be along soon .    madame tracy found herself rather irritated at being upstaged  and she let out a low moan .   oooooooooh .    then  in a high pitched  quavery voice   are you there  my spirit guide .    she waited a little  to build up the suspense .  washing up liquid .  two cans of baked beans .  oh  and potatoes .    how .   she said  in a dark brown voice .    is that you  geronimo .   she asked herself .    is um me  how   she replied .    we have a new member of the circle with us this afternoon   she said .    how  miss petley .   she said  as geronimo .  she had always understood that red indian spirit guides were an essential prop  and she rather liked the name .  she had explained this to newt .  she didn t know anything about geronimo  he realized  and he didn t have the heart to tell her .    oh   squeaked julia .   charmed to make your acquaintance .     is my ron there  geronimo .   asked mrs .  ormerod .    how  squaw beryl   said madame tracy .   oh there are so many um of the poor lost souls um lined up against um door to my teepee .  perhaps your ron is amongst them .  how .    madame tracy had learned her lesson years earlier  and now never brought ron through until near the end .  if she didn t  beryl ormerod would occupy the rest of the seance telling the late ron ormerod everything that had happened to her since their last little chat .       now ron  you remember  our eric s littlest  sybilla  well you wouldn t recognize her now  she s taken up macrame  and our letitia  you know  our karen s oldest  she s become a lesbian but that s all right these days and is doing a dissertation on the films of sergio leone as seen from a feminist perspective  and our stan  you know  our sandra s twin  i told you about him last time  well  he won the darts tournament  which is nice because we all thought he was a bit of a mother s boy  while the guttering over the shed s come loose  but i spoke to our cindi s latest  who s a jobbing builder  and he ll be over to see to it on sunday  and ohh  that reminds me       no  beryl ormerod could wait .  there was a flash of lightning  followed almost immediately by a rumble of distant thunder .  madame tracy felt rather proud  as if she had done it herself .  it was even better than the candles at creating ambulance .  ambulance was what mediuming was all about .    now   said madame tracy in her own voice .   mr .  geronimo would like to know  is there anyone named mr .  scroggie here .    scroggie s watery eyes gleamed .   erm  actually that s my name   he said  hopefully .    right  well there s somebody here for you .   mr .  scroggie had been coming for a month now  and she hadn t been able to think of a message for him .  his time had come .   do you know anyone named  um  john .     no   said mr .  scroggie .    well  there s some celestial interference here .  the name could be tom .  or jim .  or  um  dave .     i knew a dave when i was in hemel hempstead   said mr .  scroggie  a trifle doubtfully .    yes  he s saying  hemel hempstead  that s what he s saying   said madame tracy .    but i ran into him last week  walking his dog  and he looked perfectly healthy   said mr .  scroggie  slightly puzzled .    he says not to worry  and he s happier beyond the veil   soldiered on madame tracy  who felt it was always better to give her clients good news .    tell my ron i ve got to tell him about our krystal s wedding   said mrs .  ormerod .    i will  love .  now  hold on a mo   there s something coming through      and then something came through .  it sat in madame tracy s head and peered out .    sprechen sie deutsch .   it said  using madame tracy s mouth .   parlez vous franrais .  wo bu hui jiang zhongwen .     is that you  ron .   asked mrs .  ormerod .  the reply  when it came  was rather testy .    no .  definitely not .  however  a question so manifestly dim can only have been put in one country on this benighted planet   most of which  incidentally  i have seen during the last few hours .  dear lady  this is not ron .     well  i want to speak to ron ormerod   said mrs .  ormerod  a little testily .   he s rather short  balding on top .  can you put him on  please .    there was a pause .   actually there does appear to be a spirit of that description hovering over here .  very well .  i ll hand you over  but you must make it quick .  i am attempting to avert the apocalypse .    mrs .  ormerod and mr .  scroggie gave each other looks .  nothing like this had happened at madame tracy s previous sittings .  julia petley was rapt .  this was more like it .  she hoped madame tracy was going to start manifesting ectoplasm next .    h hello .   said madame tracy in another voice .  mrs .  ormerod started .  it sounded exactly like ron .  on previous occasions ron had sounded like madame tracy .    ron  is that you .     yes  buh beryl .     right .  now i ve quite a bit to tell you .  for a start i went to our krystal s wedding  last saturday  our marilyn s eldest       buh beryl .  you you nuh never let me guh get a wuh word in edgewise wuh while i was alive .  nuh now i m duh dead  there s juh just one thing to suh say      beryl ormerod was a little disgruntled by all this .  previously when ron had manifested  he had told her that he was happier beyond the veil  and living somewhere that sounded more than a little like a celestial bungalow .  now he sounded like ron  and she wasn t sure that was what she wanted .  and she said what she had always said to her husband when he began to speak to her in that tone of voice .    ron  remember your heart condition .     i duh don t have a huh heart any longer .  remuhmember .  anyway  buh beryl    .     yes  ron .     shut up   and the spirit was gone .   wasn t that touching .  right  now  thank you very much  ladies and gentleman  i m afraid i shall have to be getting on .    madame tracy stood up  went over to the door  and turned on the lights .        out .   she said .   her sitters stood up  more than a little puzzled  and  in mrs .  ormerod s case  outraged  and they walked out into the hall .    you haven t heard the last of this  marjorie potts   hissed mrs .  ormerod  clutching her handbag to her breast  and she slammed the door .   then her muffled voice echoed from the hallway   and you can tell our ron that he hasn t heard the last of this either .    madame tracy  and the name on her scooters   only driving license was indeed marjorie potts  went into the kitchen and turned off the sprouts .   she put on the kettle .  she made herself a pot of tea .  she sat down at the kitchen table  got out two cups  filled both of them .  she added two sugars to one of them .  then she paused .    no sugar for me  please   said madame tracy .   she lined up the cups on the table in front of her  and took a long sip from the tea with sugar .    now   she said  in a voice that anyone who knew her would have recognized as her own  although they might not have recognized her tone of voice  which was cold with rage .   suppose you tell me what this is about .  and it had better be good .           a lorry had shed its load all over the m  .  according to its manifest the lorry had been filled with sheets of corrugated iron  although the two police patrolmen were having difficulty in accepting this .    so what i want to know is  where did all the fish come from .   asked the sergeant .    i told you .  they fell from the sky .  one minute i m driving along at sixty  next second  whap .  a twelve pound salmon smashes through the windscreen .  so i pulls the wheel over  and i skidded on that   he pointed to the remains of a hammerhead shark under the lorry   and ran into that .   that was a thirty foot high heap of fish  of different shapes and sizes .    have you been drinking  sir .   asked the sergeant  less than hopefully .    course i haven t been drinking  you great wazzock .  you can see the fish  can t you .    on the top of the pile a rather large octopus waved a languid tentacle at them .  the sergeant resisted the temptation to wave back .   the police constable was leaning into the police car  talking on the radio .       corrugated iron and fish  blocking off the southbound m  about half a mile north of junction ten .  we re going to have to close off the whole southbound carriageway .  yeah .    the rain redoubled .  a small trout  which had miraculously survived the fall  gamely began to swim toward birmingham .           that was wonderful   said newt .    good   said anathema .   the earth moved for everybody .   she got up off the floor  leaving her clothes scattered across the carpet  and went into the bathroom .   newt raised his voice .   i mean  it was really wonderful .  really really wonderful .  i always hoped it was going to be  and it was .    there was the sound of running water .    what are you doing .   he asked .    taking a shower .     ah .   he wondered vaguely if everyone had to shower afterwards  or if it was just women .  and he had a suspicion that bidets came into it somewhere .    tell you what   said newt  as anathema came out of the bathroom swathed in a fluffy pink towel .   we could do it again .     nope   she said   not now .   she finished drying herself  and started picking up clothes from the floor  and  unselfconsciously  pulling them on .  newt  a man who was prepared to wait half an hour for a free changing cubicle at the swimming baths  rather than face the possibility of having to disrobe in front of another human being  found himself vaguely shocked  and deeply thrilled .   bits of her kept appearing and disappearing  like a conjurer s hands  newt kept trying to count her nipples and failing  although he didn t mind .    why not .   said newt .  he was about to point out that it might not take long  but an inner voice counseled him against it .  he was growing up quite quickly in a short time .   anathema shrugged  not an easy move when you re pulling on a sensible black skirt .   she said we only did it this once .    newt opened his mouth two or three times  then said   she didn t .  she bloody didn t .  she couldn t predict that . i don t believe it .    anathema  fully dressed  walked over to her card index  pulled one out  and passed it to him .   newt read it and blushed and gave it back  tight tipped .   it wasn t simply the fact that agnes had known  and had expressed herself in the most transparent of codes .  it was that  down the ages  various devices had scrawled encouraging little comments in the margin .   she passed him the damp towel .   here   she said .   hurry up .  i ve got to make the sandwiches  and we ve got to get ready .    he looked at the towel .   what s this for .     your shower .    ah .  so it was something men and women both did .  he was pleased he d got that sorted out .    but you ll have to make it quick   she said .    why .  have we got to get out of here in the next ten minutes before the building explodes .     oh no .  we ve got a couple of hours .  it s just that i ve used up most of the hot water .  you ve got a lot of plaster in your hair .    the storm blew a dying gust around jasmine cottage  and holding the damp pink towel  no longer fluffy  in front of him  strategically  newt edged off to take a cold shower .          in shadwell s dream  he is floating high above a village green .  in the center of the green is a huge pile of kindling wood and dry branches .  in the center of the pile is a wooden stake .  men and women and children stand around on the grass  eyes bright  cheeks pink  expectant  excited .   a sudden commotion  ten men walk across the green  leading a handsome  middle aged woman  she must have been quite striking in her youth  and the word  vivacious  creeps into shadwell s dreaming mind .  in front of her walks witchfinder private newton pulsifer .  no  it isn t newt  the man is older  and dressed in black leather .  shadwell recognizes approvingly the ancient uniform of a witchfinder major .   the woman climbs onto the pyre  thrusts her hands behind her  and is tied to the stake .  the pyre is lit .  she speaks to the crowd  says something  but shadwell is too high to hear what it is .  the crowd gathers around her .   a witch  thinks shadwell .  they re burning a witch .  it gives him a warm feeling .  that was the right and proper way of things .  that s how things were meant to be .   only     she looks directly up at him now  and says  that goes for yowe as welle  yowe daft old foole .    only she is going to die .  she is going to burn to death .  and  shadwell realizes in his dream  it is a horrible way to die .   the flames lick higher .   and the woman looks up .  she is staring straight at him  invisible though he is .  and she is smiling .   and then it all goes boom .       a crash of thunder .   that was thunder  thought shadwell  as he woke up  with the unshakable feeling that someone was still staring at him .   he opened his eyes  and thirteen glass eyes watched from the various shelves of madame tracy s boudoir  staring out from a variety of fuzzy faces .   he looked away  and into the eyes of someone staring intently at him .  it was him .   och  he thought in terror  i m havin  one o  them out o  yer body experiences  i can see mah ane self  i m a goner this time right enough     he made frantic swimming motions in an effort to reach his own body and then  as these things do  the perspectives clicked into place .   shadwell relaxed  and wondered why anyone would want to put a mirror on his bedroom ceiling .  he shook his head  baffled .   he climbed out of the bed  pulled on his boots  and stood up  warily .  something was missing .  a cigarette .  he thrust his hands deep into his pockets  pulled out a tin  and began to roll a cigarette .   he d been dreaming  he knew .  shadwell didn t remember the dream  but it made him feel uncomfortable  whatever it was .   he lit the cigarette .  and he saw his right hand  the ultimate weapon .  the doomsday device .  he pointed one finger at the one eyed teddy bear on the mantelpiece .    bang   he said  and chuckled  dustily .  he wasn t used to chuckling  and he began to cough  which meant he was back on familiar territory .  he wanted something to drink .  a sweet can of condensed milk .   madame tracy would have some .   he stomped out of her boudoir  heading toward the kitchen .   outside the little kitchen he paused .  she was talking to someone .  a man .    so what exactly do you want me to do about this .   she was ask ing .    ach  ye beldame   muttered shadwell .  she had one of her gentlemen callers in there  obviously .    to be frank  dear lady  my plans at this point are perforce somewhat fluid .    shadwell s blood ran cold .  he marched through the bead curtain  shouting   the sins of sodom an  gomorrah .  takin  advantage of a defenseless hour .  over my dead body .    madame tracy looked up  and smiled at him .  there wasn t anyone else in the room .    whurrizee .   asked shadwell .    whom .   asked madame tracy .    some southern pansy   he said   i heard him .  he was in here  suggestin  things to yer .  i heard him .    madame tracy s mouth opened  and a voice said   not just a southern pansy  sergeant shadwell .  the southern pansy .    shadwell dropped his cigarette .  he stretched out his arm  shaking slightly  and pointed his hand at madame tracy .    demon   he croaked .    no   said madame tracy  in the voice of the demon .   now  i know what you re thinking  sergeant shadwell .  you re thinking that any second now this head is going to go round and round  and i m going to start vomiting pea soup .  well  i m not .  i m not a demon .  and i d like you to listen to what i have to say .     daemonspawn  be silent   ordered shadwell .   i ll no listen to yer wicked lies .  do yer know what this is .  it s a hand .  four fingers .  one thumb .  it s already exorcised one of yer number this morning .  now get ye out of this gud wimmin s head  or i ll blast ye to kingdom come .     that s the problem  mr .  shadwell   said madame tracy in her own voice .   kingdom come .  it s going to .  that s the problem .  mr .  aziraphale has been telling me all about it .  now stop being an old silly  mr .  shadwell  sit down  and have some tea  and he ll explain it to you as well .     i ll ne r listen tae his hellish blandishments  woman   said shadwell .   madame tracy smiled at him .   you old silly   she said .   he could have handled anything else .   he sat down .   but he didn t lower his hand .          the swinging overhead signs proclaimed that the southbound carriageway was closed  and a small forest of orange cones had sprung up  redirecting motorists onto a co opted lane of the northbound carriageway .  other signs directed motorists to slow down to thirty miles per hour .  police cars herded the drivers around like red striped sheepdogs .   the four bikers ignored all the signs  and cones  and police cars  and continued down the empty southbound carriageway of the m  .  the other four bikers  just behind them  slowed a little .    shouldn t we  uh  stop or something .   asked really cool people .    yeah .  could be a pile up   said treading in dogshit  formerly all foreigners especially the french  formerly things not working properly even when you ve given them a good thumping  never actually no alcohol lager  briefly embarrassing personal problems  formerly known as skuzz  .    we re the other four horsemen of the apocalypse   said g . b . h .   we do what they do .  we follow them .    they rode south .           it ll be a world just for us   said adam .   everything s always been messed up by other people but we can get rid of it all an  start again .  won t that be great .            you are  i trust  familiar with the book of revelation .   said madame tracy with aziraphale s voice .    aye   said shadwell  who wasn t .  his biblical expertise began and ended with exodus  chapter twenty two  verse eighteen  which concerned witches  the suffering to live of  and why you shouldn t .  he had once glanced at verse nineteen  which was about putting to death people who lay down with beasts  but he had felt that this was rather outside his jurisdiction .    then you have heard of the antichrist .     aye   said shadwell  who had seen a film once which explained it all .  something about sheets of glass falling off lorries and slicing people s heads off  as he recalled .  no proper witches to speak of .  he d gone to sleep halfway through .    the antichrist is alive on earth at this moment  sergeant .  he is bringing about armageddon  the day of judgement  even if he himself does not know it .  heaven and hell are both preparing for war  and it s all going to be very messy .    shadwell merely grunted .    i am not actually permitted to act directly in this matter  sergeant .  but i am sure that you can see that the imminent destruction of the world is not something any reasonable man would permit .  am i correct .     aye .  s pose   said shadwell  sipping condensed milk from a rusting can madame tracy had discovered under the sink .    then there is only one thing to be done .  and you are the only man i can rely on .  the antichrist must be killed  sergeant shadwell .  and you must do it .    shadwell frowned .   i wouldna know about that   he said .   the witchfinder army only kills witches .   tis one of the rules .  and demons and imps  o course .     but  but the antichrist is more than just a witch .  he   he s the witch .  he s just about as witchy as you can get .     wud he be harder to get rid of than  say  a demon .   asked shadwell  who had begun to brighten .    not much more   said aziraphale  who had never done other to get rid of demons than to hint to them very strongly that he  aziraphale  had some work to be getting on with  and wasn t it getting late .  and crowley had always got the hint .   shadwell looked down at his right hand  and smiled .  then he hesitated .    this antichrist   how many nipples has he .    the end justifies the means  thought aziraphale .  and the road to hell is paved with good intentions .   this is not actually true .  the road to hell is paved with frozen door to door salesmen .  on weekends many of the younger demons go ice skating down it .   and he lied cheerfully and convincingly   oodles .  pots of them .  his chest is covered with them   he makes diana of the ephesians look positively nippleless .     i wouldna know about this diana of yours   said shadwell   but if he s a witch  and it sounds tae me like he is  then  speaking as a sergeant in the wa  i m yer man .     good   said aziraphale through madame tracy .    i m not sure about this killing business   said madame tracy herself .   but if it s this man  this antichrist  or everybody else  then i suppose we don t really have any choice .     exactly  dear lady   she replied .   now  sergeant shadwell .  have you a weapon .    shadwell rubbed his right hand with his left  clenching and unclenching the fist .   aye   he said .   i have that .   and he raised two fingers to his lips and blew on them gently .   there was a pause .   your hand .   asked aziraphale .    aye .   tis a turrible weapon .  it did for ye  daemonspawn  did it not .     have you anything more  uh  substantial .  how about the golden dagger of meggido .  or the shiv of kali .    shadwell shook his head .   i ve got some pins   he suggested .   and the thundergun of witchfinder colonel ye shall not eat any living thing with the blood neither shall ye use enchantment nor observe times dalrymple    i could load it with silver bullets .     that s werewolves  i believe   said aziraphale .    garlic .     vampires .    shadwell shrugged .   aye  week i dinna have any fancy bullets anyway .  but the thundergun will fire anything .  i ll go and fetch it .    he shuffled out  thinking  why do i need another weapon .  i m a man with a hand .    now  dear lady   said aziraphale .   itrust you have a reliable mode of transportation at your disposal .     oh yes   said madame tracy .  she went over to the corner of the kitchen and picked up a pink motorbike helmet  with a yellow sunflower painted on it  and put it on  strapping it under her chin .  then she rummaged in a cupboard  pulled out three or four hundred plastic shopping bags and a heap of yellowing local newspapers  then a dusty day glo green helmet with easy rider written across the top  a present from her niece petula twenty years before .   shadwell  returning with the thundergun over his shoulder  stared at her unbelieving .    i don t know what you re staring at  mr .  shadwell   she told him .   it s parked in the road downstairs .   she passed him the helmet .   you ve got to put it on .  it s the law .  i don t think you re really allowed to have three people on a scooter  even if two of them are  er  sharing .  but it s an emergency .  and i m sure you ll be quite safe  if you hold on to me nice and tight .   and she smiled .   won t that be fun .    shadwell paled  muttered something inaudible  and put on the green helmet .    what was that  mr .  shadwell .   madame tracy looked at him sharply .    i said  de il ding a divot aff yer wame wi  a flaughter spade   said shadwell .    that ll be quite enough of that kind of language  mr .  shadwell   said madame tracy  and she marched him out of the hall and down the stairs to crouch end high street  where an elderly scooter waited to take the two  well  call it three of them away .          the lorry blocked the road .  and the corrugated iron blocked the road .  and a thirty foot high pile of fish blocked the road .  it was one of the most effectively blocked roads the sergeant had ever seen .   the rain wasn t helping .    any idea when the bulldozers are likely to get here .   he shouted into his radio .    we re crrrrk doing the best we crrrrk   came the reply .   he felt something tugging at his trouser cuff  and looked down .    lobsters .   he gave a little skip  and a jump  and wound up on the top of the police car .   lobsters   he repeated .  there were about thirty of them   some over two feet long .  most of them were on their way up the motorway  half a dozen had stopped to check out the police car .    something wrong  sarge .   asked the police constable  who was taking down the lorry driver s details on the hard shoulder .    i just don t like lobsters   said the sergeant  grimly  shutting his eyes .   bring me out in a rash .  too many legs .  i ll just sit up here a bit  and you can tell me when they ve all gone .    he sat on the top of the car  in the rain  and felt the water seeping into the bottom of his trousers .   there was a low roar .  thunder .  no .  it was continuous  and getting closer .  motorbikes .  the sergeant opened one eye .   jesus christ .   there were four of them  and they had to be doing over a hundred .  he was about to climb down  to wave at them  to shout  but they were past him  heading straight for the upturned lorry .   there was nothing the sergeant could do .  he closed his eyes again  and listened for the collision .  he could hear them coming closer .  then   whoosh .   whoosh .   whoosh .   and a voice in his head that said  i ll catch up with the rest of you .     did you see that .   asked really cool people .   they flew right over it .     kin ell .   said g . b . h .   if they can do it  we can too .     the sergeant opened his eyes .  he turned to the police constable and opened his mouth .   the police constable said   they .  they actually .  they flew righ      thud .  thud .  thud .   splat .   there was another rain of fish  although of shorter duration  and more easily explicable .  a leather jacketed arm waved feebly from the large pile of fish .  a motorbike wheel spun hopelessly .   that was skuzz  semi conscious  deciding that if there was one thing he hated even more than the french it was being up to his neck in fish with what felt like a broken leg .  he truly hated that .   he wanted to tell g . b . h .  about his new role  but he couldn t move .  something wet and slippery slithered up one sleeve .   later  when they d dragged him out of the fish pile  and he d seen the other three bikers  with the blankets over their heads  he realized it was too late to tell them anything .   that was why they hadn t been in that book of revelations pigbog had been going on about .  they d never made it that far down the motorway .   skuzz muttered something .  the police sergeant leaned over .   don t try to speak  son   he said .   the ambulance ll be here soon .     listen   croaked skuzz .   got something important to tell you .  the four horsemen of the apocalypse    they re right bastards  all four of them .     he s delirious   announced the sergeant .    i m sodding not .  i m people covered in fish   croaked skuzz  and passed out .          the london traffic system is many hundreds of times more complex than anyone imagines .   this has nothing to do with influences  demonic or angelic .  it s more to do with geography  and history  and architecture .   mostly this works to people s advantage  although they d never believe it .   london was not designed for cars .  come to that  it wasn t designed for people .  it just sort of happened .  this created problems  and the solutions that were implemented became the next problems  five or ten or a hundred years down the line .   the latest solution had been the m    a motorway that formed a rough circle around the city .  up until now the problems had been fairly basic   things like it being obsolete before they had finished building it  einsteinian tailbacks that eventually became tailforwards  that kind of thing .   the current problem was that it didn t exist  not in normal human spatial terms  anyway .  the tailback of cars unaware of this  or trying to find alternate routes out of london  stretched into the city center  from every direction .  for the first time ever  london was completely gridlocked .  the city was one huge traffic jam .   cars  in theory  give you a terrifically fast method of traveling from place to place .  traffic jams  on the other hand  give you a terrific opportunity to stay still .  in the rain  and the gloom  while around you the cacophonous symphony of horns grew ever louder and more exasperated .   crowley was getting sick of it .   he d taken the opportunity to reread aziraphale s notes  and to thumb through agnes nutter s prophecies  and to do some serious thinking .   his conclusions could be summarized as follows   armageddon was under way .   there was nothing crowley could do about this .   it was going to happen in tadfield .  or to begin there  at any rate .  after that it was going to happen everywhere .   crowley was in hell s bad books .   not that hell has any other kind .    aziraphale was   as far as could be estimated   out of the equation .   all was black  gloomy and awful .  there was no light at the end of the tunnel   or if there was  it was an oncoming train .   he might just as well find a nice little restaurant and get completely and utterly pissed out of his mind while he waited for the world to end .   and yet       and that was where it all fell apart .   because  underneath it all  crowley was an optimist .  if there was one rock hard certainty that had sustained him through the bad times   he thought briefly of the fourteenth century   then it was utter surety that he would come out on top  that the universe would look after him .   okay  so hell was down on him .  so the world was ending .  so the cold war was over and the great war was starting for real .  so the odds against him were higher than a vanload of hippies on a blotterful of owlsley s old original .  there was still a chance .   it was all a matter of being in the right place at the right time .   the right place was tadfield .  he was certain of that  partly from the book  partly from some other sense  in crowley s mental map of the world  tadfield was throbbing like a migraine .   the right time was getting there before the end of the world .  he checked his watch .  he had two hours to get to tadfield  although probably even the normal passage of time was pretty shaky by now .   crowley tossed the book into the passenger seat .  desperate times  desperate measures  he had maintained the bentley without a scratch for sixty years .   what the hell .   he reversed suddenly  causing severe damage to the front of the red renault   behind him  and drove up onto the pavement .   he turned on his lights  and sounded his horn .   that should give any pedestrians sufficient warning that he was coming .  and if they couldn t get out of the way    well  it d all be the same in a couple of hours .  maybe .  probably .    heigh ho   said anthony crowley  and just drove anyway .          there were six women and four men  and each of them had a telephone and a thick wodge of computer printout  covered with names and telephone numbers .  by each of the numbers was a penned notation saying whether the person dialed was in or out  whether the number was currently connected  and  most importantly  whether or not anybody who answered the phone was avid for cavity wall insulation to enter their lives .   most of them weren t .   the ten people sat there  hour after hour  cajoling  pleading  promising through plastic smiles .  between calls they made notations  sipped coffee  and marvelled at the rain flooding down the windows .  they were staying at their posts like the band on the titanic .  if you couldn t sell double glazing in weather like this  you couldn t sell it at all .   lisa morrow was saying       now  if you ll only let me finish  sir  and yes  i understand that  sir  but if you ll only     and then  seeing that he d just hung up on her  she said   well  up yours  snot face .    she put down the phone .    i got another bath   she announced to her fellow telephone salespersons .  she was well in the lead in the office daily getting people out of the bath stakes  and only needed two more points to win the weekly coitus interruptus award .   she dialed the next number on the list .   lisa had never intended to be a telephone salesperson .  what she really wanted to be was an internationally glamorous jet setter  but she didn t have the o levels .   had she been studious enough to be accepted as an internationally glamorous jet setter  or a dental assistant  her second choice of profession   or indeed  anything other than a telephone salesperson in that particular office  she would have had a longer  and probably more fulfilled  life .   perhaps not a very much longer life  all things considered  it being the day of armageddon  but several hours anyway .   for that matter  all she really needed to do for a longer life was not ring the number she had just dialed  listed on her sheet as the mayfair home of  in the best traditions of tenth hand mail order lists  mr .  a .  j .  cowlley .   but she had dialed .  and she had waited while it rang four times .  and she had said   oh  pout  another ansaphone   and started to put down the handset .   but then something climbed out of the earpiece .  something very big  and very angry .   it looked a little like a maggot .  a huge  angry maggot made out of thousands and thousands of tiny little maggots  all writhing and screaming  millions of little maggot mouths opening and shutting in fury  and every one of them was screaming  crowley .    it stopped screaming .  swayed blindly  seemed to be taking stock of where it was .   then it went to pieces .   the thing split into thousands of thousands of writhing gray maggots .  they flowed over the carpet  up over the desks  over lisa morrow and her nine colleagues  they flowed into their mouths  up their nostrils  into their lungs  they burrowed into flesh and eyes and brains and lights  reproducing wildly as they went  filling the room with a towering mess of writhing flesh and gunk .  the whole began to flow together  to coagulate into one huge entity that filled the room from floor to ceiling  pulsing gently .   a mouth opened in the mass of flesh  strands of something wet and sticky adhering to each of the not exactly lips  and hastur said    i needed that .    spending half an hour trapped on an ansaphone with only aziraphale s message for company had not improved his temper .   neither did the prospect of having to report back to hell  and having to explain why he hadn t returned half an hour earlier  and  more importantly  why he was not accompanied by crowley .   hell did not go a bundle on failures .   on the plus side  however  he at least knew what aziraphale s message was .  the knowledge could probably buy him his continued existence .   and anyway  he reflected  if he were going to have to face the possible wrath of the dark council  at least it wouldn t be on an empty stomach .   the room filled with thick  sulphurous smoke .  when it cleared  hastur was gone .  there was nothing left in the room but ten skeletons  picked quite clean of meat  and some puddles of melted plastic with  here and there  a gleaming fragment of metal that might once have been part of a telephone .  much better to have been a dental assistant .   but  to look on the bright side  all this only went to prove that evil contains the seeds of its own destruction .  right now  across the country  people who would otherwise have been made just that little bit more tense and angry by being summoned from a nice bath  or having their names mispronounced at them  were instead feeling quite untroubled and at peace with the world .  as a result of hastur s action a wave of low grade goodness started to spread exponentially through the population  and millions of people who ultimately would have suffered minor bruises of the soul did not in fact do so .  so that was all right .          you wouldn t have known it as the same car .  there was scarcely an inch of it undented .  both front lights were smashed .  the hubcaps were long gone .  it looked like the veteran of a hundred demolition derbies .   the pavements had been bad .  the pedestrian underpass had been worse .  the worst bit had been crossing the river thames .  at least he d had the foresight to roll up all the windows .   still  he was here  now .   in a few hundred yards he d be on the m    a fairly clear run up to oxfordshire .  there was only one snag  once more between crowley and the open road was the m   .  a screaming  glowing ribbon of pain and dark light .   not actually an oxymoron .  it s the color past ultra violet .  the technical term for it is infrablack .  it can be seen quite easily under experimental conditions .  to perform the experiment simply select a healthy brick wall with a good run up  and  lowering your head  charge .  the color that flashes in bursts behind your eyes  behind the pain  just before you die  is infra black .    odegra .  nothing could cross it and survive .   nothing mortal  anyway .  and he wasn t sure what it would do to a demon .  it couldn t kill him  but it wouldn t be pleasant .   there was a police roadblock in front of the flyover before him .  burnt out wrecks    some still burning   testified to the fate of previous cars that had to drive across the flyover above the dark road .   the police did not look happy .   crowley shifted down into second gear  and gunned the accelerator .   he went through the roadblock at sixty .  that was the easy bit .   cases of spontaneous human combustion are on record all over the world .  one minute someone s quite happily chugging along with their life  the next there s a sad photograph of a pile of ashes and a lonely and mysteriously uncharred foot or hand .  cases of spontaneous vehicular combustion are less well documented .   whatever the statistics were  they had just gone up by one .   the leather seatcovers began to smoke .  staring ahead of him  crowley fumbled left handedly on the passenger seat for agnes nutter s nice and accurate prophecies   moved it to the safety of his lap .  he wished she d prophecied this .    she had .  it read   a street of light will screem  the black chariot of the serpente will flayme  and a queene wille sing quickfilveres songes no moar .   most of the family had gone along with gelatly device  who wrote a brief monograph in the     s explaining it as a metaphor for the banishment of weishaupt s illuminati from bavaria in      .    then the flames engulfed the car .   he had to keep driving .   on the other side of the flyover was a further police roadblock  to prevent the passage of cars trying to come into london .  they were laughing about a story that had just come over the radio  that a motorbike cop on the m  had flagged down a stolen police car  only to discover the driver to be a large octopus .   some police forces would believe anything .  not the metropolitan police  though .  the met was the hardest  most cynically pragmatic  most stubbornly down to earth police force in britain .   it would take a lot to faze a copper from the met .   it would take  for example  a huge  battered car that was nothing more nor less than a fireball  a blazing  roaring  twisted metal lemon from hell  driven by a grinning lunatic in sunglasses  sitting amid the flames  trailing thick black smoke  coming straight at them through the lashing rain and the wind at eighty miles per hour .   that would do it every time .          the quarry was the calm center of a stormy world .   thunder didn t just rumble overhead  it tore the air in half .    i ve got some more friends coming   adam repeated .   they ll be here soon  and then we can really get started .    dog started to howl .  it was no longer the siren howl of alone wolf  but the weird oscillations of a small dog in deep trouble .   pepper had been sitting staring at her knees .   there seemed to be something on her mind .   finally she looked up and stared adam in the blank gray eyes .    what bit re you going to have  adam .   she said .   the storm was replaced by a sudden  ringing silence .    what .   said adam .    well  you divided up the world  right  and we ve all of us got to have a bit   what bit re you going to have .    the silence sang like a harp  high and thin .    yeah   said brian .   you never told us what bit you re having .     pepper s right   said wensleydale .   don t seem to me there s much left  if we ve got to have all these countries .    adam s mouth opened and shut .    what .   he said .    what bit s yours  adam .   said pepper .   adam stared at her .  dog had stopped howling and had fixed his master with an intent  thoughtful mongrel stare .    m me .   he said .   the silence went on and on  one note that could drown out the noises of the world .    but i ll have tadfield   said adam .   they stared at him .    an   an  lower tadfield  and norton  and norton woods      they still stared .   adam s gaze dragged itself across their faces .    they re all i ve ever wanted   he said .   they shook their heads .    i can have  em if i want   said adam  his voice tinged with sullen defiance and his defiance edged with sudden doubt .   i can make them better  too .  better trees to climb  better ponds  better      his voice trailed off .    you can t   said wensleydale flatly .   they re not like america and those places .  they re really real .  anyway  they belong to all of us .  they re ours .     and you couldn t make  em better   said brian .    anyway  even if you did we d all know   said pepper .    oh  if that s all that s worryin  you  don t you worry   said adam airily    cos i could make you all just do whatever i wanted      he stopped  his ears listening in horror to the words his mouth was speaking .  the them were backing away .   dog put his paws over his head .   adam s face looked like an impersonation of the collapse of empire .    no   he said hoarsely .   no .  come back .  i command you .    they froze in mid dash .   adam stared .    no  i dint mean it     he began .   you re my friends      his body jerked .  his head was thrown back .  he raised his arms and pounded the sky with his fists .   his face twisted .  the chalk floor cracked under his sneakers .   adam opened his mouth and screamed .  it was a sound that a merely mortal throat should not have been able to utter  it wound out of the quarry  mingled with the storm  caused the clouds to curdle into new and unpleasant shapes .   it went on and on .   it resounded around the universe  which is a good deal smaller than physicists would believe .  it rattled the celestial spheres .   it spoke of loss  and it did not stop for a very long time .   and then it did .   something drained away .   adam s head tilted down again .  his eyes opened .   whatever had been standing in the old quarry before  adam young was standing there now .  a more knowledgeable adam young  but adam young nevertheless .  possibly more of adam young than there had ever been before .   the ghastly silence in the quarry was replaced by a more familiar  comfortable silence  the mere and simple absence of noise .   the freed them cowered against the chalk cliff  their eyes fixed on him .    it s all right   said adam quietly .   pepper .  wensley .  brian .  come back here .  it s all right .  it s all right .  i know everything now .  and you ve got to help me .  otherwise it s all goin  to happen .  it s really all goin  to happen .  it s all goin  to happen  if we don t do somethin  .           the plumbing in jasmine cottage heaved and rattled and showered newt with water that was slightly khaki in color .  but it was cold .  it was probably the coldest cold shower newt had ever had in his life .   it didn t do any good .    there s a red sky   he said  when he came back .  he was feeling slightly manic .   at half past four in the afternoon .  in august .  what does that mean .  in terms of delighted nautical operatives  would you say .  i mean  if it takes a red sky at night to delight a sailor  what does it take to amuse the man who operates the computers on a supertanker .  or is it shepherds who are delighted at night .  i can never remember .    anathema eyed the plaster in his hair .  the shower hadn t got rid of it  it had merely dampened it down and spread it out  so that newt looked as though he was wearing a white hat with hair in it .    you must have got quite a bump   she said .    no  that was when i hit my head on the wall .  you know  when you       yes .   anathema looked quizzically out of the broken window .   would you say it s blood colored .   she said .   it s very important .     i wouldn t say that   said newt  his train of thought temporarily derailed .   not actual blood .  more pinkish .  probably the storm put a lot of dust in the air .    anathema was rummaging through the nice and accurate prophecies   what are you doing .   he said .    trying to cross reference .  i still can t be       i don t think you need to bother   said newt .   i know what the rest of      means .  it came to me when i       what do you mean  you know what it means .     i saw it on my way down here .  and don t snap like that .  my head aches .  i mean i saw it .  they ve got it written down outside that air base of yours .  it s got nothing to do with peas .  it s  peace is our profession .   it s the kind of thing they put up on boards outside air bases .  you know  sac        th wing  the screaming blue demons  peace is our profession .  that sort of thing .   newt clutched his head .  the euphoria was definitely fading .   if agnes is right  then there s probably some madman in there right now winding up all the missiles and cranking open the launch windows .  or whatever they are .     no  there isn t   said anathema firmly .    oh  yes .  i ve seen films .  name me one good reason why you can be so sure .     there aren t any bombs there .  or missiles .  everyone round here knows that .     but it s an air base .  it s got runways .     that s just for transport planes and things .  all they ve got up there is communications gear .  radios and stuff .  nothing explosive at all .    newt stared at her .          look at crowley  doing     mph on the m   heading toward oxfordshire .  even the most resolutely casual observer would notice a number of strange things about him .  the clenched teeth  for example  or the dull red glow coming from behind his sunglasses .  and the car .  the car was a definite hint .   crowley had started the journey in his bentley  and he was damned if he wasn t going to finish it in the bentley as well .  not that even the kind of car buff who owns his own pair of motoring goggles would have been able to tell it was a vintage bentley .  not any more .  they wouldn t have been able to tell that it was a bentley .  they would only offer fifty fifty that it had ever even been a car .   there was no paint left on it  for a start .  it might still have been black  where it wasn t a rusty  smudged reddish brown  but this was a dull charcoal black .  it traveled in its own ball of flame  like a space capsule making a particularly difficult re entry .   there was a thin skin of crusted  melted rubber left around the metal wheel rims  but seeing that the wheel rims were still somehow riding an inch above the road surface this didn t seem to make an awful lot of difference to the suspension .   it should have fallen apart miles back .   it was the effort of holding it together that was causing crowley to grit his teeth  and the biospatial feedback that was causing the bright red eyes .  that and the effort of having to remember not to start breathing .   he hadn t felt like this since the fourteenth century .          the atmosphere in the quarry was friendlier now  but still intense .    you ve got to help me sort it out   said adam .   people ve been tryin  to sort it out for thousands of years  but we ve got to sort it out now .    they nodded helpfully .    you see  the thing is   said adam   this thing is  it s like   well  you know greasy johnson .    the them nodded .  they all knew greasy johnson and the members of the other gang in lower tadfield .  they were older and not very pleasant .  hardly a week went by without a skirmish .    well   said adam   we always win  right .     nearly always   said wensleydale .    nearly always   said adam   an        more than half  anyway   said pepper .    cos  you remember  when there was all that fuss over the ole folks  party in the village hall when we       that doesn t count   said adam .   they got told off just as much as us .  anyway  old folks are s pposed to like listenin  to the sound of children playin   i read that somewhere  i don t see why we should get told off  cos we ve got the wrong kind of old folks     he paused .   anyway    we re better n them .     oh  we re better n them   said pepper .   you re right about that .  we re better n them all right .  we jus  don t always win .     just suppose   said adam  slowly   that we could beat  em properly .  get   get them sent away or somethin  .  jus  make sure there s no more ole gangs in lower tadfield apart from us .  what do you think about that .     what  you mean he d be    dead .   said brian .    no .  jus    jus  gone away .    the them thought about this .  greasy johnson had been a fact of life ever since they d been old enough to hit one another with a toy railway engine .  they tried to get their minds around the concept of a world with a johnson shaped hole in it .   brian scratched his nose .   i reckon it d be brilliant without greasy johnson   he said .   remember what he did at my birthday party .  and i got into trouble about it .     i dunno   said pepper .   i mean  it wouldn t be so interesting without ole greasy johnson and his gang .  when you think about it .  we ve had a lot of fun with ole greasy johnson and the johnsonites .  we d probably have to find some other gang or something .     seems to me   said wensleydale   that if you asked people in lower tadfield  they d say they d be better off without the johnsonites or the them .    even adam looked shocked at this .  wensleydale went on stoically   the old folks  club would .  an  picky .  an        but we re the good ones     brian began .  he hesitated .   well  all right   he said   but i bet they d think it d be a jolly sight less interestin  if we all weren t here .     yes   said wensleydale .   that s what i mean .     people round here don t want us or the johnsonites   he went on morosely   the way they re always goin  on about us just riding our bikes or skateboarding on their pavements and making too much noise and stuff .  it s like the man said in the history books .  a plaque on both your houses .    this met with silence .    one of those blue ones   said brian  eventually   saying  adam young lived here   or somethin  .    normally an opening like this could lead to five minutes  rambling discussion when the them were in the mood  but adam felt that this was not the time .    what you re all sayin    he summed up  in his best chairman tones   is that it wouldn t be any good at all if the greasy johnsonites beat the them or the other way round .     that s right   said pepper .   because   she added   if we beat them  we d have to be our own deadly enemies .  it d be me an  adam against brian an  wensley   she sat back .   everyone needs a greasy johnson   she said .    yeah   said adam .   that s what i thought .  it s no good anyone winning .  that s what i thought .   he stared at dog  or through dog .    seems simple enough to me   said wensleydale  sitting back .   i don t see why it s taken thousands of years to sort out .     that s because the people trying to sort it out were men   said pepper  meaningfully .    don t see why you have to take sides   said wensleydale .    of course i have to take sides   said pepper .   everyone has to take sides in something .    adam appeared to reach a decision .    yes .  but i reckon you can make your own side .  i think you d better go and get your bikes   he said quietly .   i think we d better sort of go and talk to some people .           putputputputputput  went madame tracy s motor scooter down crouch end high street .  it was the only vehicle moving on a suburban london street jammed with immobile cars and taxis and red london buses .    i ve never seen a traffic jam like it   said madame tracy .   i wonder if there s been an accident .     quite possibly   said aziraphale .  and then   mr .  shadwell  unless you put your arms round me you re going to fall off .  this thing wasn t built for two people  you know .     three   muttered shadwell  gripping the seat with one whiteknuckled hand  and his thundergun with the other .    mr .  shadwell  i won t tell you again .     ye ll have ter stop  then  so as i can adjust me weapon   sighed shadwell .   madame tracy giggled dutifully  but she pulled over to the curb  and stopped the motor scooter .   shadwell sorted himself out  and put two grudging arms around madame tracy  while the thundergun stuck up between them like a chaperon .   they rode through the rain without talking for another ten minutes  putputputputput  as madame tracy carefully negotiated her way around the cars and the buses .   madame tracy found her eyes being moved down to the speedometer   rather foolishly  she thought  since it hadn t worked since       and it hadn t worked very well before that .    dear lady  how fast would you say we were going .   asked aziraphale .    why .     because it seems to me that we would go slightly faster walking .     well  with just me on  the top speed is about fifteen miles an hour  but with mr .  shadwell as well  it must be  ooh  about   four or five miles per hour   she interrupted .    i suppose so   she agreed .   there was a cough from behind her .   can ye no slow down this hellish machine  wumman .   asked an ashen voice .  in the infernal pantheon  which it goes without saying shadwell hated uniformly and correctly  shadwell reserved a special loathing for speed demons .    in which case   said aziraphale   we will get to tadfield in something less than ten hours      there was a pause from madame tracy  then   how far away is this tadfield  anyway .     about forty miles .     um   said madame tracy  who had once driven the scooter the few miles to nearby finchley to visit her niece  but had taken the bus since  because of the funny noises the scooter had started making on the way back .       we should really be going at about seventy  if we re going to get there in time   said aziraphale .   hmm .  sergeant shadwell .  hold on very tightly now .    putputputputput and a blue nimbus began to outline the scooter and its occupants with a gentle sort of a glow  like an afterimage  all around them .   putputputputputput and the scooter lifted awkwardly off the ground with no visible means of support  jerking slightly  until it reached a height of five feet  more or less .    don t look down  sergeant shadwell   advised aziraphale .         said shadwell  eyes screwed tightly shut  gray forehead beaded with sweat  not looking down  not looking anywhere .    and off we go  then .    in every big budget science fiction movie there s the moment when a spaceship as large as new york suddenly goes to light speed .  a twanging noise like a wooden ruler being plucked over the edge of a desk  a dazzling refraction of light  and suddenly the stars have all been stretched out thin and it s gone .  this was exactly like that  except that instead of a gleaming twelve mile long spaceship  it was an off white twenty year old motor scooter .  and you didn t have the special rainbow effects .  and it probably wasn t going at more than two hundred miles an hour .  and instead of a pulsing whine sliding up the octaves  it just went putputputputput     vroooosh .   but it was exactly like that anyway .          where the m    now a screaming frozen circle  intersects with the m   to oxfordshire  police were clustered around in ever increasing quantities .  since crowley crossed the divide  half an hour earlier  their number had doubled .  on the m   side  anyway .  no one in london was getting out .   in addition to the police there were also approximately two hundred others standing around  and inspecting the m   through binoculars .  they included representatives from her majesty s army  the bomb disposal squad  m    m    the special branch  and the cia .  there was also a man selling hot dogs .   everybody was cold and wet  and puzzled  and irritable  with the exception of one police officer  who was cold  wet  puzzled  irritable  and exasperated .    look .  i don t care if you believe me or not   he sighed   all i m telling you is what i saw .  it was an old car  a rolls  or a bentley  one of those flash vintage jobs  and it made it over the bridge .    one of the senior army technicians interrupted .   it can t have done .  according to our instruments the temperature above the m   is somewhere in excess of seven hundred degrees centigrade .     or a hundred and forty degrees below   added his assistant .       or a hundred and forty degrees below zero   agreed the senior technician .   there does appear to be some confusion on that score  although i think we can safely attribute it to mechanical error of some kind   this was true .  there wasn t a thermometer on earth that could have been persuaded to register both       c and        c at the same time  which was the correct temperature .   but the fact remains that we can t even get a helicopter directly over the m   without winding up with helicopter mcnuggets .  how on earth can you tell me that a vintage car drove over it unharmed .     i didn t say it drove over it unharmed   corrected the policeman  who was thinking seriously about leaving the metropolitan police and going into business with his brother  who was resigning his job with the electricity board  and was going to start breeding chickens .   it burst into flames .  it just kept on going .     do you seriously expect any of us to believe     began somebody .   a high pitched keening noise  haunting and strange .  like a thousand glass harmonicas being played in unison  all slightly off key  like the sound of the molecules of the air itself wailing in pain .   and vrooosh .   over their heads it sailed  forty feet in the air  engulfed in a deep blue nimbus which faded to red at the edges  a little white motor scooter  and riding it  a middle aged woman in a pink helmet  and holding tightly to her  a short man in a mackintosh and a day glo green crash helmet  the motor scooter was too far up for anyone to see that his eyes were tightly shut  but they were  .  the woman was screaming .  what she was screaming was this   gerrrronnnimooooo .           one of the advantages of the wasabi  as newt was always keen to point out  was that when it was badly damaged it was very hard to tell .  newt had to keep driving dick turpin onto the shoulder to avoid fallen branches .    you ve made me drop all the cards on the floor .    the car thumped back onto the road  a small voice from somewhere under the glove compartment said   oil plessure arert .     i ll never be able to sort them out now   she moaned .    you don t have to   said newt manically   just pick one .  any one .  it won t matter .     what do you mean .     well  if agnes is right  and we re doing all this because she s predicted it  then any card picked right now has got to be relevant .  that s logic .     it s nonsense .     yeah .  look  you re even here because she predicted it .  and have you thought what we re going to say to the colonel .  if we get to see him  which of course we won t .     if we re reasonable       listen  i know these kinds of places .  they have huge guards made out of teak guarding the gates  anathema  and they have white helmets and real guns  you understand  which fire real bullets made of real lead which can go right into you and bounce around and come out of the same hole before you can even say  excuse me  we have reason to believe that world war three is due any moment and they re going to do the show right here   and then they have serious men in suits with bulging jackets who take you into a little room without windows and ask you questions like are you now  or have you ever been  a member of a pinko subversive organization such as any british political party .  and       we re nearly there .     look  it s got gates and wire fences and everything .  and probably the kind of dogs that eat people .     i think you re getting rather overexcited   said anathema quietly  picking the last of the file cards up from the floor of the car .    overexcited .  no .  i m getting very calmly worried that someone might shoot me .     i m sure agnes would have mentioned it if we were going to be shot .  she s very good at that sort of thing .   she began absentmindedly to shuffle the file cards .    you know   she said  carefully cutting the cards and riffling the two piles together   i read somewhere that there s a sect that believes that computers are the tools of the devil .  they say that armageddon will come about because of the antichrist being good with computers .  apparently it s mentioned somewhere in revelations .  i think i must have read about it in a newspaper recently       daily mail .  letter from america .   um  august the third   said newt .   just after the story about the woman in worms  nebraska  who taught her duck to play the accordion .     mm   said anathema  spreading the cards face down on her lap .   so computers are tools of the devil .  thought newt .  he had no problem believing it .  computers had to be the tools of somebody  and all he knew for certain was that it definitely wasn t him .   the car jerked to a halt .   the air base looked battered .  several large trees had fallen down near the entrance  and some men with a digger were trying to shift them .  the guard on duty was watching them disinterestedly  but he half turned and looked coldly at the car .    all right   said newt .   pick a card .             .  behinde the eagle s  neste a grate ash hath fallen .        is that all .     yes .  we always thought it was something to do with the russian revolution .  keep going along this road and turn left .    the turning led to a narrow lane  with the base s perimeter fence on the left hand side .    and now pull in here .  there s often cars here  and no one takes any notice   said anathema .    what is this place .     it s the local lovers  lane .     is that why it appears to be paved with rubber .    they walked along the hedge   shaded lane for a hundred yards until they reached the ash tree .  agnes had been right .  it was quite grate .  it had fallen right across the fence .   a guard was sitting on it  smoking a cigarette .  he was black .  newt always felt guilty in the presence of black americans  in case they blamed him for two hundred years of slave trading .   the man stood up when they approached  and then sagged into an easier stance .    oh  hi  anathema   he said .    hi  george .  terrible storm  wasn t it .     sure was .    they walked on .  he watched them out of sight .    you know him .   said newt  with forced nonchalance .    oh  sure .  sometimes a few of them come down to the pub .  pleasant enough in a well scrubbed way .     would he shoot us if we just walked in .   said newt .    he might well point a gun at us in a menacing way   anathema   that s good enough for me .  what do you suggest we do  then .     well  agnes must have known something .  so i suppose we just wait .  it s not too bad now the wind s gone down .     oh .   newt looked at the clouds piling up on the horizon .   good old agnes   he said .          adam pedalled steadily along the road  dog running along behind and occasionally trying to bite his back tire out of sheer excitement .   there was a clacking noise and pepper swung out of her drive .  you could always tell pepper s bike .  she thought it was improved by a piece of cardboard cunningly held against the wheel by a clothes peg .  cats had learned to take evasive action when she was two streets away .    i reckon we can cut along drovers lane and then up through roundhead woods   said pepper .     s all muddy   said adam .    that s right   said pepper nervously .   it gets all muddy up there .  we ort to go along by the chalk pit .   s always dry because of the chalk .  an  then up by the sewage farm .    brian and wensleydale pulled in behind them .  wensleydale s bicycle was black  and shiny  and sensible .  brian s might have been white  once  but its color was lost beneath a thick layer of mud .    it s stupid calling it a milit ry base   said pepper .   i went up there when they had that open day and they had no guns or missiles or anythin  .  just knobs and dials and brass bands playin  .     yes   said adam .    not much milit ry about knobs and dials   said pepper .    i dunno  reely   said adam .   it s amazin  what you can do with knobs and dials .     i got a kit for christmas   wensleydale volunteered .   all electric bits .  there were a few knobs and dials in it .  you could make a radio or a thing that goes beep .     i dunno   said adam thoughtfully   i m thinkin  more of certain people patching into the worldwide milit ry communications network and telling all the computers and stuff to start fightin  .     cor   said brian .   that s be wicked .     sort of   said adam .          it is a high and lonely destiny to be chairman of the lower tadfield residents  association .   r .  p .  tyler  short  well fed  satisfied  stomped down a country lane  accompanied by his wife s miniature poodle  shutzi .  r .  p .  tyler knew the difference between right and wrong  there were no moral grays of any kind in his life .  he was not  however  satisfied simply with being vouchsafed the difference between right and wrong .  he felt it his bounden duty to tell the world .   not for r .  p .  tyler the soapbox  the polemic . verse  the broadsheet .  r .  p .  tyler s chosen forum was the letter column of the tadfield advertiser .  if a neighbor s tree was inconsiderate enough to shed leaves into r .  p .  tyler s garden  r .  p .  tyler would first carefully sweep them all up  place them in boxes  and leave the boxes outside his neighbor s front door  with a stern note .  then he would write a letter to the tadfield advertiser .  if he sighted teenagers sitting on the village green  their portable cassette players playing  and they were enjoying themselves  he would take it upon himself to point out to them the error of their ways .  and after he had fled their jeering  he would write to the tadfield advertiser on the decline of morality and the youth of today .   since his retirement last year the letters had increased to the point where not even the tadfield advertiser was able to print all of them .  indeed  the letter r .  p .  tyler had completed before setting out on his evening walk had begun       sirs   i note with distress that the newspapers of today no longer feel obligated to their public  we  the people who pay your wages         he surveyed the fallen branches that littered the narrow country road .  i don t suppose  he pondered  they think of the cleaning up bill when they send us these storms .  parish council has to foot the bill to clean it all up .  and we  the taxpayers  pay their wages     the they in this thought were the weather forecasters on radio four  whom r .  p .  tyler blamed for the weather .   he did not have a television .  or as his wife put it   ronald wouldn t have one of those things in the house  would you ronald .   and he always agreed  although secretly he would have liked to have seen some of the smut and filth and violence that the national viewers and listeners association complained of .  not because he wanted to see it  of course .  just because he wanted to know what other people should be protected from .    shutzi stopped by a roadside beech tree to cock its leg .   r .  p .  tyler looked away  embarrassed .  it might be that the sole purpose of his evening constitutional was to allow the dog to relieve itself  but he was dashed if he d admit that to himself .  he stared up at the storm clouds .  they were banked up high  in towering piles of smudged gray and black .  it wasn t just the flickering tongues of lightning that forked through them like the opening sequence of a frankenstein movie  it was the way they stopped when they reached the borders of lower tadfield .  and in their center was a circular patch of daylight  but the light had a stretched  yellow quality to it  like a forced smile .   it was so quiet .   there was a low roaring .   down the narrow lane came four motorbikes .  they shot past him  and turned the corner  disturbing a cock pheasant who whirred across the lane in a nervous arc of russet and green .    vandals .   called r .  p .  tyler after them .   the countryside wasn t made for people like them .  it was made for people like him .   he jerked shutzi s lead  and they marched along the road .   five minutes later he turned the corner  to find three of the motorcyclists standing around a fallen signpost  a victim of the storm .  the fourth  a tall man with a mirrored visor  remained on his bike .   r .  p .  tyler observed the situation  and leaped effortlessly to a conclusion .  these vandals   he had  of course been right   had come to the countryside in order to desecrate the war memorial and to overturn signposts .   he was about to advance on them sternly  when it came to him that he was outnumbered  four to one  and that they were taller than he was  and that they were undoubtedly violent psychopaths .  no one but a violent psychopath rode motorbikes in r .  p .  tyler s world .   so he raised his chin and began to strut past them  without apparently noticing they were there   although as a member  read  founder  of his local neighborhood watch scheme he did attempt to memorize the motorbikes  number plates .   all the while composing in his head a letter  sirs  this evening i noted with distress a large number of hooligans on motorbicycles infesting our fair village .  why  oh why  does the government do nothing about this plague of       hi   said one of the motorcyclists  raising his visor to reveal a thin face and a trim black beard .   we re kinda lost .     ah   said r .  p .  taylor disapprovingly .    the signpost musta blew down   said the motorcyclist .    yes  i suppose it must   agreed r .  p .  taylor .  he noticed with surprise that he was getting hungry .    yeah .  well  we re heading for lower tadfield .    an officious eyebrow raised .   you re americans .  with the air force base  i suppose .    sirs  when i did national service i was a credit to my country .  i notice with horror and dismay that airmen from the tadfield air base are driving around our noble countryside dressed no better than common thugs .  while i appreciate their importance in defending the freedom of the western world     .   then his love of giving instructions took over .   you go back down that road for half a mile  then first left  it s in a deplorable state of disrepair i m afraid  i ve written numerous letters to the council about it  are you civil servants or civil master .  that s what i asked them  after all  who pays your wages .  then second right  only it s not exactly right  it s on the left but you ll find it bends round toward the right eventually  it s signposted porrit s lane  but of course it isn t pornt s lane  you look at the ordinance survey map  you ll see  it s simply the eastern end of forest hill lane  you ll come out in the village  now you go past the bull and fiddle   that s a public house   then when you get to the church  i have pointed out to the people who compile the ordinance survey map that it s a church with a spire  not a church with a tower  indeed i have written to the tadfield advertiser  suggesting they mount a local campaign to get the map corrected  and i have every hope that once these people realize with whom they are dealing you ll see a hasty u turn from them  then you ll get to a crossroads  now  you go straight across that crossroads and you ll immediately come to a second crossroads  now  you can take either the left hand fork or go straight on  either way you ll arrive at the air base  although the left hand fork is almost a tenth of a mile shorter  and you can t miss it .    famine stared at him blankly .   i  uh  i m not sure i got that     he began .   i did .  let us go .   shutzi gave a little yelp and darted behind r .  p .  tyler  where it remained  shivering .   the strangers climbed back onto their bikes .  the one in white  a hippie  by the look of him  thought r .  p .  tyler  dropped an empty crisp packet onto the grass shoulder .    excuse me   barked tyler .   is that your crisp packet .     oh  it s not just mine   said the boy .   it s everybody s .    r .  p .  tyler drew himself up to his full height .   five foot six   young man   he said   how would you feel if i came over to your house and dropped litter everywhere .    pollution smiled  wistfully .   very  very pleased   he breathed .   oh  that would be wonderful .    beneath his bike an oil slick puddled a rainbow on the wet road .   engines revved .    i missed something   said war .   now  why are we meant to make a u turn by the church .    just follow me  said the tall one in front  and the four rode off together .   r .  p .  tyler stared after them  until his attention was distracted by the sound of something going clackclackclack he turned .  four figures on bicycles shot past him  closely followed by the scampering figure of a small dog .    you .  stop .   shouted r .  p .  tyler .   the them braked to a halt and looked at him .    i knew it was you  adam young  and your little  hmph  cabal .  what  might i enquire  are you children doing out at this time of night .  do your fathers know you re out .    the leader of the cyclist turned .   i can t see how you can say it s late   he said   seems to me  seems to me  that if the sun s still out then it s not late .     it s past your bedtime  anyway   r .  p .  tyler informed them   and don t stick out your tongue at me  young lady   this was to pepper   or i will be writing a letter to your mother informing her of the lamentable and unladylike state of her offspring s manners .     well  scuse us   said adam  aggrieved .   pepper was just looking at you .  i didn t know there was any for against looking .    there was a commotion on the grass .  shutzi  who was a particularly refined toy french poodle  of the kind only possessed by people who were never able to fit children into their household budgets  was being menaced by dog .    master young   ordered r .  p .  tyler   please get your   your mutt away from my shutzi .   tyler did not trust dog .  when he had first met the dog  three days ago  it had snarled at him  and glowed its eyes red .  this had impelled tyler to begin a letter pointing out that dog was undoubtedly rabid  certainly a danger to the community  and should be put down for the general good  until his wife had reminded him that glowing red eyes weren t a symptom of rabies  or  for that matter  anything seen outside of the kind of film that neither of the tylers would be caught dead at but knew all they needed to know about  thank you very much .   adam looked astounded .   dog s not a mutt .  dog s a remarkable dog .  he s clever .  dog  you get off mr .  tyler s horrible of poodle .    dog ignored him .  he d got a lot of dog catching up still to do .    dog   said adam  ominously .  his dog slunk back to his master s bicycle .    i don t believe you have answered my question .  where are you four off to .     to the air base   said brian .    if that s all right with you   said adam  with what he hoped was bitter and scathing sarcasm .   i mean  we won t want to go there if it wasn t all right with you .     you cheeky little monkey   said r .  p .  tyler .   when i see your father  adam young  i will inform him in no uncertain terms that      but the them were already pedalling off down the road  in the direction of lower tadfield air base   travelling by the them s route  which was shorter and simpler and more scenic than the route suggested by mr .  tyler .          r .  p .  tyler had composed a lengthy mental letter on the failings of the youth of today .  it covered falling educational standards  the lack of respect given to their elders and betters  the way they always seemed to slouch these days instead of walking with a proper upright bearing  juvenile delinquency  the return of compulsory national service  birching  flogging  and dog licenses .   he was very satisfied with it .  he had a sneaking suspicion that it would be too good for the tadfield advertiser  and had decided to send it to the times .   putputput putputput   excuse me  love   said a warm female voice .   i think we re lost .    it was an aging motor scooter  and it was being ridden by a middleaged woman .  clutching her tightly  his eyes screwed shut  was a raincoated little man with a bright green crash helmet on .  sticking up between them was what appeared to be an antique gun with a funnelshaped muzzle .    oh .  where are you going .     lower tadfield .  i m not sure of the exact address  but we re looking for someone   said the woman  then  in a totally different voice she said   his name is adam young .    r .  p .  tyler boggled .   you want that boy .   he asked .   what s he done now   no  no  don t tell me .  i don t want to know .     boy .   said the woman .   you didn t tell me he was a boy .  how old is he .   then she said   he s eleven .  well  i do wish you d mentioned this before .  it puts a completely different complexion on things .    r .  p .  tyler just stared .  then he realized what was going on .  the woman was a ventriloquist .  what he had taken for a man in a green crash helmet  he now saw was a ventriloquist s dummy .  he wondered how he could ever have assumed it was human .  he felt the whole thing was in vaguely bad taste .    i saw adam young not five minutes ago   he told the woman .   he and his little cronies were on their way to the american air base .     oh dear   said the woman  paling slightly .   i ve never really liked the yanks .  they re really very nice people  you know .  yes  but you can t trust people who pick up the ball all the time when they play football .     ahh  excuse me   said r .  p .  tyler   i think it s very good .  very impressive .  i m deputy chairman of the local rotary club  and i was wondering  do you do private functions .     only on thursdays   said madame tracy  disapprovingly .   and i charge extra .  and i wonder if you could direct us to      mr .  tyler had been here before .  he wordlessly extended a finger .   and the little scooter went putputputputputput down the narrow country lane .   as it did so  the gray dummy in the green helmet turned around and opened one eye .   ye great southern pillock   it croaked .   r .  p .  tyler was offended  but also disappointed .  he d hoped it would be more lifelike .          r .  p .  tyler  only ten minutes away from the village  paused  while shutzi attempted another of its wide range of eliminatory functions .  he gazed over the fence .   his knowledge of country lore was a little hazy  but he felt fairly sure that if the cows lay down  it meant rain .  if they were standing it would probably be fine .  these cows were taking it in turns to execute slow and solemn somersaults  and tyler wondered what it presaged for the weather .   he sniffed .  something was burning   there was an unpleasant smell of scorched metal and rubber and leather .    excuse me   said a voice from behind him .  r .  p .  tyler turned around .   there was a large once black car on fire in the lane and a man in sunglasses was leaning out of one window  saying through the smoke   i m sorry  i ve managed to get a little lost .  can you direct me to lower tadfield air base .  i know it s around here somewhere .    your car is on fire .   no .  tyler just couldn t bring himself to say it .  i mean  the man had to know that  didn t he .  he was sitting in the middle of it .  possibly it was some kind of practical joke .   so instead he said   i think you must have taken a wrong turn about a mile back .  a signpost has blown down .    the stranger smiled   that must be it   he said .  the orange flames flickering below him gave him an almost infernal appearance .   the wind blew towards tyler  across the car  and he felt his eyebrows frizzle .   excuse me  young man  but your car is on fire and you re sitting in it without burning and incidentally it s red hot in place  no .   should he ask the man if he wanted him to phone the a . a .  .   instead he explained the route carefully  trying not to stare .    that s terrific .  much obliged   said crowley  as he began to wind up the window .   r .  p .  tyler had to say something .    excuse me  young man   he said .    yes .     i mean  it s not the kind of thing you don t notice  your car being on fire .   a tongue of flame licked across the charred dashboard .    funny weather we re having  isn t it .   he said  lamely .    is it .   said crowley .   i honestly hadn t noticed .   and he reversed back down the country lane in his burning car .    that s probably because your car is on fire   said r .  p .  tyler sharply .  he jerked shutzi s lead  dragged the little dog to heel .       to the editor  sir   i would like to draw your attention to a recent tendency i have noticed for today s young people to ignore perfectly sensible safety precautions while driving .  this evening i was asked for directions by a gentleman whose car was         no .   driving a car that     no .   it was on fire     his temper getting worse  r .  p .  tyler stomped the final stretch back into the village .           hoy .   shouted r .  p .  tyler .   young .    mr .  young was in his front garden  sitting on his deck chair  smoking his pipe .   this had more to do with deirdre s recent discovery of the menace of passive smoking and banning of smoking in the house than he would care to admit to his neighbors .  it did not improve his temper .  neither did being addressed as young by mr .  tyler .    yes .     your son  adam .    mr .  young sighed .   what s he done now .     do you know where he is .    mr .  young checked his watch .   getting ready for bed  i would assume .    tyler grinned  tightly  triumphantly .   i doubt it .  i saw him and his little fiends  and that appalling mongrel  not half an hour ago  cycling towards the air base .    mr .  young puffed on his pipe .    you know how strict they are up there   said mr .  tyler  in case mr .  young hadn t got the message .    you know what a one your son is for pressing buttons and things   he added .   mr .  young took his pipe out of his mouth and examined the stem thoughtfully .    hmp   he said .   i see   he said .    right   he said .   and he went inside .          at exactly that same moment  four motorbikes swished to a halt a few hundred yards from the main gate .  the riders switched off their engines and raised their helmet visors .  well  three of them did .    i was rather hoping we could crash through the barriers   said war wistfully .    that d only cause trouble   said famine .    good .     trouble for us  i mean .  the power and phone lines must be down  but they re bound to have generators and they ll certainly have radio .  if someone starts reporting that terrorists have invaded the base then people ll start acting logically and the whole plan collapses .     huh .    we go in  we do the job  we go out  we let human nature take its course  said death .    this isn t how i imagined it  chaps   said war .   i haven t been waiting for thousands of years just to fiddle around with bits of wire .  it s not what you d call dramatic .  albrecht durer didn t waste his time doing woodcuts of the four button pressers of the apocalypse  i do know that .     i thought there d be trumpets   said pollution .    look at it like this   said famine .   it s just groundwork .  we get to do the riding forth afterwards .  the proper riding forth .  wings of the storm and so on .  you ve got to be flexible .     weren t we supposed to meet    someone .   said war .   there was no sound but the metallic noises of cooling motorbike engines .   then pollution said  slowly   you know  i can t say i imagined it d be somewhere like this  either .  i thought it d be  well  a big city .  or a big country .  new york  perhaps .  or moscow .  or armageddon itself .    there was another pause .   then war said   where is armageddon  anyway .     funny you should ask   said famine .   i ve always meant to look it up .     there s an armageddon  pennsylvania   said pollution .   or maybe it s massachusetts  or one of them places .  lots of guys in heavy beards and seriously black hats .     nah   said famine .   it s somewhere in israel  i think .    mount carmel .    i thought that was where they grow avocados .    and the end of the world .    is that right .  that s one big avocado .     i think i went there once   said pollution .   the old city of megiddo .  just before it fell down .  nice place .  interesting royal gateway .    war looked at the greenness around them .    boy   she said   did we take a wrong turning .    the geography is immaterial .    sorry  lord .    if armageddon is anywhere  it is everywhere .    that s right   said famine   we re not talking about a few square miles of scrub and goats anymore .    there was another pause .   let us go .   war coughed .   it s just that i thought that    he d be coming with us    .    death adjusted his gauntlets .   this  he said firmly  is a job for the professionals .          afterwards  sgt .  thomas a .  deisenburger recalled events at the gate as having happened like this   a large staff car drew up by the gate .  it was sleek and officiallooking although  afterwards  he wasn t entirely sure why he had thought this  or why it sounded momentarily as though it were powered by motorbike engines .   four generals got out .  again  the sergeant was a little uncertain of why he had thought this .  they had proper identification .  what kind of identification  admittedly  he couldn t quite recall  but it was proper .  he saluted .   and one of them said   surprise inspection  soldier .    to which sgt .  thomas a .  deisenburger replied   sir  i have not been informated as to the incidence of a surprise inspection at this time  sir .     of course not   said one of the generals .   that s because it s a surprise .    the sergeant saluted again .    sir  permission to confirmate this intelligence with base command  sir   he said  uneasily .   the tallest and thinnest of the generals strolled a little way from the group  turned his back  and folded his arms .   one of the others put a friendly arm around the sergeant s shoulders and leaned forward in a conspiratorial way .    now see here     he squinted at the sergeant s name tag     deisenburger  maybe i ll give you a break .  it s a surprise inspection  got that .  surprise .  that means no getting on the horn the moment we ve gone through  understand .  and no leaving your post .  career soldier like you ll understand  am i right .   he added .  he winked .   otherwise you ll find yourself busted so low you ll have to say  sir  to an imp .    sgt .  thomas a .  deisenburger stared at him .    private   hissed one of the other generals .  according to her tag  her name was waugh .  sgt .  deisenburger had never seen a female general like her before  but she was certainly an improvement .    what .     private .  not imp .     yeah .  that s what i meant .  yeah .  private .  okay  soldier .    the sergeant considered the very limited number of options at his disposal .    sir  surprise inspection  sir .   he said .    provisionatedly classificisioned at this time   said famine  who had spent years learning how to sell to the federal government and could feel the language coming back to him .    sir  affirmative  sir   said the sergeant .    good man   said famine  as the barrier was raised .   you ll go a long way .   he glanced at his watch .   very shortly .           sometimes human beings are very much like bees .  bees are fiercely protective of their hive  provided you are outside it .  once you re in  the workers sort of assume that it must have been cleared by management and take no notice  various freeloading insects have evolved a mellifluous existence because of this very fact .  humans act the same way .   no one stopped the four as they purposefully made their way into one of the long  low buildings under the forest of radio masts .  no one paid any attention to them .  perhaps they saw nothing at all .  perhaps they saw what their minds were instructed to see  because the human brain is not equipped to see war  famine  pollution  and death when they don t want to be seen  and has got so good at not seeing that it often manages not to see them even when they abound on every side .   the alarms were totally brainless and thought they saw four people where people shouldn t be  and went off like anything .          newt did not smoke  because he did not allow nicotine to gain entry to the temple of his body or  more accurately  the small welsh methodist tin tabernacle of his body .  if he had been a smoker  he would have choked on the cigarette that he would have been smoking at this time in order to steady his nerves .   anathema stood up purposefully and smoothed the creases in her skirt .    don t worry   she said .   they don t apply to us .  something s probably happening inside .    she smiled at his pale face .   come on   she said   it s not the o . k .  corral .     no .  they ve got better guns  for one thing   said newt .   she helped him up .   never mind   she said .   i m sure you ll think of a way .           it was inevitable that all four of them couldn t contribute equally  war thought .  she d been surprised at her natural affinity for modern weapons systems  which were so much more efficient than bits of sharp metal  and of course pollution laughed at absolutely foolproof  fail safe devices .  even famine at least knew what computers were .  whereas    well  he didn t do anything much except hang around  although he did it with a certain style .  it had occurred to war that there might one day be an end to war  an end to famine  possibly even an end to pollution  and perhaps this was why the fourth and greatest horseman was never exactly what you might call one of the lads .  it was like having a tax inspector in your football team .  great to have him on your side  of course  but not the kind of person you wanted to have a drink and a chat with in the bar afterwards .  you couldn t be one hundred percent at your ease .   a couple of soldiers ran through him as he looked over pollution s skinny shoulder .   what are those glittery things .  he said  in the tones of one who knows he won t be able to understand the answer but wants to be seen to be taking an interest .    seven segment led displays   said the boy .  he laid loving hands on a bank of relays  which fused under his touch  and then introduced a swathe of self replicating viruses that whirred away on the electronic ether .    i could really do without those bloody alarms   muttered famine .   death absentmindedly snapped his fingers .  a dozen klaxons gurgled and died .    i don t know  i rather liked them   said pollution .   war reached inside another metal cabinet .  this wasn t the way she d expected things to be  she had to admit  but when she ran her fingers over and sometimes through the electronics there was a familiar feel .  it was an echo of what you got when you held a sword  and she felt a thrill of anticipation at the thought that this sword enclosed the whole world and a certain amount of the sky above it  as well .  it loved her .   a flaming sword .   mankind had not been very good at learning that swords are dangerous if left lying around  although it had done its limited best to make sure that the chances of one this size being wielded accidentally were high .  a cheering thought  that .  it was nice to think that mankind made a distinction between blowing their planet to bits by accident and doing it by design .   pollution plunged his hands into another rack of expensive electronics .          the guard on the hole in the fence looked puzzled .  he was aware of excitement back in the base  and his radio seemed to be picking up nothing but static  and his eyes were being drawn again and again to the card in front of him .   he d seen many identity cards in his time   military  cia  fbi  kgb even   and  being a young soldier  had yet to grasp that the more insignificant an organization is  the more impressive are its identity cards .   this one was hellishly impressive .  his lips moved as he read it again  all the way from  the lord protector of the common wealth of britain charges and demands   through the bit about commandeering all kindling  rope  and igniferous oils  right down to the signature of the wa s first lord adjutant  praise him all ye works of the lord and flye fornication smith .  newt kept his thumb over the bit about nine pence per witch and tried to look like james bond .   finally the guard s probing intellect found a word he thought he recognized .    what s this here   he said suspiciously   about us got to give you faggots .     oh  we have to have them   said newt .   we burn them .     say what .     we burn them .    the guard s face broadened into a grin .  and they d told him england was soft .   right on .   he said .   something pressed into the small of his back .    drop your gun   said anathema  behind him   or i shall regret what i shall have to do next .    well  it s true  she thought as she saw the man stiffen in terror .  if he doesn t drop the gun he ll find out this is a stick  and i shall really regret having to be shot .          at the main gate  sgt .  thomas a .  deisenburger was also having problems .  a little man in a dirty mack kept pointing a finger at him and muttering  while a lady who looked slightly like his mother talked to him in urgent tones and kept interrupting herself in a different voice .    it really is vitally important that we are allowed to speak to whoever is in charge   said aziraphale .   i really must ask that he s right  you know  i d be able to tell if he was lying yes  thank you  i think we d really achieve something if you kindly allowed me to carry on all right thank you i was only trying to put in a good word yes .  er .  you were asking him to yes all right    now       d yer see my finger .   shouted shadwell  whose sanity was still attached to him but only on the end of along and rather frayed string .   d yer see it .  this finger  laddie  could send ye to meet yer maker .    sgt .  deisenburger stared at the black and purple nail a few inches from his face .  as an offensive weapon it rated quite highly  especially if it was ever used in the preparation of food .   the telephone gave him nothing but static .  he d been told not to leave his post .  his wound from nam was starting to play up .   he d slipped and fallen in a hotel shower when he took a holiday there in      .  now the mere sight of a bar of yellow soap could send him into near fatal flashbacks .   he wondered how much trouble he could get into for shooting non american civilians .          the four bicycles pulled up a little way from the base .  tire marks in the dust  and a patch of oil  indicated that other travelers had briefly rested there .    what re we stopping for .   said pepper .    i m thinking   said adam .   it was hard .  the bit of his mind that he knew as himself was still there  but it was trying to stay afloat on a fountain of tumultuous darkness .  what he was aware of  though  was that his three companions were onehundred percent human .  he d got them into trouble before  in the way of torn clothes  docked pocket money  and so on  but this one was almost certainly going to involve a lot more than being confined to the house and made to tidy up your room .   on the other hand  there wasn t anyone else .    all right   he said .   we need some stuff  i think .  we need a sword  a crown  and some scales .    they stared at him .    what  just here .   said brian .   there s nothin  like that here .     i dunno   said adam .   when you think about the games and that  you know  we ve played             just to make sgt .  deisenburger s day  a car pulled up and it was floating several inches off the ground because it had no tires .  or paintwork .  what it did have was a trail of blue smoke  and when it stopped it made the pinging noises made by metal cooling down from a very high temperature .   it looked as if it had smoked glass windows  although this was just an effect caused by it having ordinary glass windows but a smoke filled interior .   the driver s door opened  and a cloud of choking fumes got out .  then crowley followed it .   he waved the smoke away from his face  blinked  and then turned the gesture into a friendly wave .    hi   he said .   how s it going .  has the world ended yet .     he won t let us in  crowley   said madame tracy .    aziraphale .  is that you .  nice dress   said crowley vaguely .  he wasn t feeling very well .  for the last thirty miles he had been imagining that a ton of burning metal  rubber  and leather was a fully functioning automobile  and the bentley had been resisting him fiercely .  the hard part had been to keep the whole thing rolling after the all weather radials had burned away .  beside him the remains of the bentley dropped suddenly onto its distorted wheel rims as he stopped imagining that it had tires .   he patted a metal surface hot enough to fry eggs on .    you wouldn t get that sort of performance out of one of these modern cars   he said lovingly .   they stared at him .   there was a little electronic click .   the gate was rising .  the housing that contained the electric motor gave a mechanical groan  and then gave up in the face of the unstoppable force acting on the barrier .    hey .   said sgt .  deisenburger   which one of you yo yos did that .    zip .  zip .  zip .  zip .  and a small dog  its legs a blur .   they stared at the four ferociously pedaling figures that ducked under the barrier and disappeared into the camp .   the sergeant pulled himself together .    hey   he said  but much more weakly this time   did any of them kids have some space alien with a face like a friendly turd in a bike basket .     don t think so   said crowley .    then   said sgt .  deisenburger   they re in real trouble .   he raised his gun .  enough of this pussyfooting around  he kept thinking of soap .   and so   he said   are you .     i warns ye     shadwell began .    this has gone on too long   said aziraphale .   sort it out  crowley  there s a dear chap .     hmm .   said crowley .    i m the nice one   said aziraphale .   you can t expect me to   oh  blast it .  you try to do the decent thing  and where does it get you .   he snapped his fingers .   there was a pop like an old fashioned flashbulb  and sgt .  thomas a .  deisenburger disappeared .    er   said aziraphale .    see .   said shadwell  who hadn t quite got the hang of madame tracy s split personality   nothing to it .  ye stick by me  yell be all right .     well done   said crowley .   never thought you had it in you .     no   said aziraphale .   nor did i  in fact .  i do hope i haven t sent him somewhere dreadful .     you d better get used to it right now   said crowley .   you just send  em .  best not to worry about where they go .   he looked fascinated .   aren t you going to introduce me to your new body .     oh .  yes .  yes  of course .  madame tracy  this is crowley .  crowley  madame tracy .  charmed  i m sure .     let s get on in   said crowley .  he looked sadly at the wreckage of the bentley  and then brightened .  a jeep was heading purposefully towards the gate  and it looked as though it was crowded with people who were about to shout questions and fire guns and not worry about which order they did this in .   he brightened up .  this was more what you might call his area of competence .   he took his hands out of his pockets and he raised them like bruce lee and then he smiled like lee van cleef .   ah   he said   here comes transport .           they parked their bikes outside one of the low buildings .  wensleydale carefully locked his .  he was that kind of boy .    so what will these people look like .   said pepper .    they could look like all sorts   said adam doubtfully .    they re grownups  are they .   said pepper .    yes   said adam .   more grown up than you ve ever seen before  i reckon .     fightin  grownups is never any use   said wensleydale gloomily .   you always get into trouble .     you don t have to fight  em   said adam .   you just do what i told you .   the them looked at the things they were carrying .  as far as tools to mend the world were concerned  they did not look incredibly efficient .    how ll we find  em  then .   said brian  doubtfully .   i remember when we came to the open day  it s all rooms and stuff .  lots of rooms and flashing lights .    adam stared thoughtfully at the buildings .  the alarms were still yodelling .    well   he said   it seems to me       hey  what are you kids doing here .    it wasn t a one hundred percent threatening voice  but it was near the end of its tether and it belonged to an officer who d spent ten minutes trying to make sense of a senseless world where alarms went off and doors didn t open .  two equally harassed soldiers stood behind him  slightly at a loss as to how to deal with four short and clearly caucasian juveniles  one of them marginally female .    don t you worry about us   said adam airily .   we re jus  lookin  around .     now you just     the lieutenant began .    go to sleep   said adam .   you just go to sleep .  all you soldiers here go to sleep .  then you won t get hurt .  you all just go to sleep now .    the lieutenant stared at him  his eyes trying to focus .  then he pitched forward .    coo   said pepper  as the others collapsed   how did you do that .     well   said adam cautiously   you know that bit about hypnotism in the boy s own book of     things to dothat we could never make work .     yes .     well  it s sort of like that  only now i ve found how to do it .   he turned back to the communications building .   he pulled himself together  his body unfolding from its habitual comfortable slouch into an upright bearing mr .  tyler would have been proud of .    right   he said .   he thought for a while .   then he said   come and see .           if you took the world away and just left the electricity  it would look like the most exquisite filigree ever made   a ball of twinkling silver lines with the occasional coruscating spike of a satellite beam .  even the dark areas would glow with radar and commercial radio waves .  it could be the nervous system of a great beast .   here and there cities make knots in the web but most of the electricity is  as it were  mere musculature  concerned only with crude work .  but for fifty years or so people had been giving electricity brains .   and now it was alive  in the same way that fire is alive .  switches were welding shut .  relays fused .  in the heart of silicon chips whose microscopic architecture looked like a street plan of los angeles fresh pathways opened up  and hundreds of miles away bells rang in underground rooms and men stared in horror at what certain screens were telling them .  heavy steel doors shut firmly in secret hollow mountains  leaving people on the other side to pound on them and wrestle with fuse boxes which had melted .  bits of desert and tundra slid aside  letting fresh air into air conditioned tombs  and blunt shapes ground ponderously into position .   and while it flowed where it should not  it ebbed from its normal beds .  in cities the traffic lights went  then the street lights  then all the lights .  cooling fans slowed  flickered  and stopped .  heaters faded into darkness .  lifts stuck .  radio stations choked off  their soothing music silenced .   it has been said that civilization is twenty four hours and two meals away from barbarism .   night was spreading slowly around the spinning earth .  it should have been full of pinpricks of light .  it was not .   there were five billion people down there .  what was going to happen soon would make barbarism look like a picnic   hot  nasty  and eventually given over to the ants .          death straightened up .  he appeared to be listening intently .  it was anyone s guess what he listened with .   he is here  he said .   the other three looked up .  there was a barely perceptible change in the way they stood there .  a moment before death had spoken they  the part of them that did not walk and talk like human beings  had been wrapped around the world .  now they were back .   more or less .   there was a strangeness about them .  it was as if  instead of illfitting suits  they now had ill fitting bodies .  famine looked as though he had been tuned slightly off station  so that the hitherto dominant signal of a pleasant  thrusting  successful businessman   was beginning to be drowned out by the ancient  horrible static of his basic personality .  war s skin glistened with sweat .  pollution s skin just glistened .    it s all    taken care of   said war  speaking with some effort .   it ll     take its course .     it s not just the nuclear   pollution said .   it s the chemical .  thousands of gallons of stuff in     little tanks all over the world .  beautiful liquids    with eighteen syllables in their names .  and the    old standbys .  say what you like .  plutonium may give you grief for thousands of years  but arsenic is forever .     and then    winter   said famine .   i like winter .  there s something    clean about winter .     chickens coming    home to roost   said war .    no more chickens   said famine  flatly .   only death hadn t changed .  some things don t .          the four left the building .  it was noticeable that pollution  while still walking  nevertheless gave the impression of oozing .   and this was noticed by anathema and newton pulsifer .   it had been the first building they d come to .  it had seemed much safer inside than out  where there seemed to be a lot of excitement .  anathema had pushed open a door covered in signs that suggested that this would be a terminally dangerous thing to do .  it had swung open at her touch .  when they d gone inside  it had shut and locked itself .   there hadn t been a lot of time to discuss this after the four had walked in .    what were they .   said newt .   some kind of terrorists .     in a very nice and accurate sense   said anathema   i think you re right .     what was all that weird talk about .     i think possibly the end of the world   said anathema .   did you see their auras .     i don t think so   said newt .    not nice at all .     oh .     negative auras  in fact .     oh .     like black holes .     that s bad  is it .     yes .    anathema glared at the rows of metal cabinets .  for once  just now  because it wasn t just for play but was for real  the machinery that was going to bring about the end of the world  or at least that part of it that occupied the layers between about two meters down and all the way to the ozone layer  wasn t operating according to the usual script .  there were no big red canisters with flashing lights .  there were no coiled wires with a  cut me  look about them .  no suspiciously large numeric displays were counting down toward a zero that could be averted with seconds to spare .  instead  the metal cabinets looked solid and heavy and very resistant to last minute heroism .    what takes its course .   said anathema .   they ve done something  haven t they .     perhaps there s an off switch .   said newt helplessly .   i m sure if we looked around       these sort of things are wired in .  don t be silly .  i thought you knew about this sort of thing .    newt nodded desperately .  this was a long way from the pages of easy electronics .  for the look of the thing  he peered into the back of one of the cabinets .    worldwide communications   he said indistinctly .   you could do practically anything .  modulate the mains power  tap into satellites .  absolutely anything .  you could  zhip    argh  you could    zhap    ouch  make things do    zipt    uh  just about    zzap    ooh .     how are you getting on in there .    newt sucked his fingers .  so far he hadn t found anything that resembled a transistor .  he wrapped his hand in his handkerchief and pulled a couple of boards out of their sockets .   once  one of the electronics magazines to which he subscribed had published a joke circuit which was guaranteed not to work .  at last  they d said in an amusing way  here s something all you ham fisted hams out there can build in the certain knowledge that if it does nothing  it s working .  it had diodes the wrong way round  transistors upside down  and a flat battery .  newt had built it  and it picked up radio moscow .  he d written them a letter of complaint  but they never replied .    i really don t know if i m doing any good   he said .    james bond just unscrews things   said anathema .    not just unscrews   said newt  his temper fraying .   and i m not    zhip    james bond .  if i was    whizzle    the bad guys would have shown me all the megadeath levers and told me how they bloody well worked  wouldn t they .     fwizzpt    only it doesn t happen like that in real life .  i don t know what s happening and i can t stop it .           clouds churned around the horizon .  overhead the sky was still clear  the air torn by nothing more than a light breeze .  but it wasn t normal air .  it had a crystallized look to it  so that you might feel that if you turned your head you might see new facets .  it sparkled .  if you had to find a word to describe it  the word thronged might slip insidiously into your mind .  thronged with insubstantial beings awaiting only the right moment to become very substantial .   adam glanced up .  in one sense there was just clear air overhead .  in another  stretching off to infinity  were the hosts of heaven and hell  wingtip to wingtip .  if you looked really closely  and had been specially trained  you could tell the difference .   silence held the bubble of the world in its grip .   the door of the building swung open and the four stepped out .  there was no more than a hint of human about three of them now   they seemed to be humanoid shapes made up of all the things they were or represented .  they made death seem positively homely .  his leather greatcoat and dark visored helmet had become a cowled robe  but these were mere details .  a skeleton  even a walking one  is at least human  death of a sort lurks inside every living creature .    the thing is   said adam urgently   they re not really real .  they re just like nightmares  really .     b but we re not asleep   said pepper .   dog whined and tried to hide behind adam .    that one looks as if he s meltin    said brian  pointing at the advancing figure  if such it could still be called  of pollution .    there you are  then   said adam  encouragingly .   it can t be real  can it .  it s common sense .  something like that can t be reelly real .    the four halted a few meters away .   it has been done  said death .  he leaned forward a little and stared eyelessly at adam .  it was hard to tell if he was surprised .    yes  well   said adam .   the thing is  i don t want it done .  i never asked for it to be done .    death looked at the other three  and then back to adam .   behind them a jeep skewed to a halt .  they ignored it .   i do not understand  he said .  surely your very existence requires the ending of the world .  it is written .    i dunt see why anyone has to go an  write things like that   said adam calmly .   the world is full of all sorts of brilliant stuff and i haven t found out all about it yet  so i don t want anyone messing it about or endin  it before i ve had a chance to find out about it .  so you can all just go away .      that s the one  mr .  shadwell   said aziraphale  his words trailing into uncertainty even as he uttered them   the one with t shirt       death stared at adam .    you    are part    of us   said war  between teeth like beautiful bullets .    it is done .  we make    the    world    anew   said pollution  his voice as insidious as something leaking out of a corroded drum into a water table .    you    lead    us   said famine .   and adam hesitated .  voices inside him still cried out that this was true  and that the world was his as well  and all he had to do was turn and lead them out across a bewildered planet .  they were his kind of people .   in tiers above  the hosts of the sky waited for the word .     ye canna want me to shoot him .  he s but a bairn .     er   said aziraphale .   er .  yes .  perhaps we d just better wait a bit  what do you think .     until he grows up  do you mean .   said crowley .    dog began to growl .   adam looked at the them .  they were his kind of people  too .   you just had to decide who your friends really were .   he turned back to the four .    get them   said adam  quietly .   the slouch and slur was gone from his voice .  it had strange harmonics .  no one human could disobey a voice like that .   war laughed  and looked expectantly at the them .    little boys   she said   playing with your toys .  think of all the toys i can offer you    think of all the games .  i can make you fall in love with me  little boys .  little boys with your little guns .    she laughed again  but the machine gun stutter died away as pepper stepped forward and raised a trembling arm .   it wasn t much of a sword  but it was about the best you could do with two bits of wood and a piece of string .  war stared at it .    i see   she said .   mano a mano  eh .   she drew her own blade and brought it up so that it made a noise like a finger being dragged around a wineglass .   there was a flash as they connected .   death stared into adam s eyes .   there was a pathetic jingling noise .    don t touch it .   snapped adam  without moving his head .   the them stared at the sword rocking to a standstill on the concrete path .     little boys    muttered pepper  disgustedly .  sooner or later everyone has to decide which gang they belong to .    but  but   said brian   she sort of got sucked up the sword      the air between adam and death began to vibrate  as in a heatwave .   wensleydale raised his head and looked famine in the sunken eye .  he held up something that  with a bit of imagination  could be considered to be a pair of scales made of more string and twigs .  then he whirled it around his head .   famine stuck out a protective arm .   there was another flash  and then the jingle of a pair of silver scales bouncing on the ground .    don t    touch    them   said adam .   pollution had already started to run  or at least to flow quickly  but brian snatched the circle of grass stalks from his own head and flung it .  it shouldn t have handled like one  but a force took it out of his hands and it whirred like a discus .   this time the explosion was a red flame inside a billow of black smoke  and it smelled of oil .   with a rolling  tinny little sound a blackened silver crown bowled out of the smoke and then spun round with a noise like a settling penny .   at least they needed no warning about touching it .  it glistened in a way that metal should not .    where d they go .   said wensley .   where they belong  said death  still holding adam s gaze .  where they have always been .  back in the minds of man .   he grinned at adam .   there was a tearing sound .  death s robe split and his wings unfolded .  angel s wings .  but not of feathers .  they were wings of night  wings that were shapes cut through the matter of creation into the darkness underneath  in which a few distant lights glimmered  lights that may have been stars or may have been something entirely else .   but i  he said  am not like them .  i am azrael  created to be creation s shadow .  you cannot destroy me .  that would destroy the world .   the heat of their stare faded .  adam scratched his nose .    oh  i don t know   he said .   there might be a way .   he grinned back .    anyway  it s going to stop now   he said .   all this stuff with the machines .  you ve got to do what i say just for now  and i say it s got to stop .    death shrugged .  it is stopping already  he said .  without them  he indicated the pathetic remnants of the other three horsepersons  it cannot proceed .  normal entropy triumphs .  death raised a bony hand in what might have been a salute .   they ll be back  he said .  they re never far away .   the wings flapped  just once  like a thunderclap  and the angel of death vanished .    right  then   said adam  to the empty air .   all right .  it s not going to happen .  all the stuff they started   it must stop now .           newt stared desperately at the equipment racks .    you d think there d be a manual or something   he said .    we could see if agnes has anything to say   volunteered anathema .    oh  yes   said newt bitterly .   that makes sense  does it .  sabotaging twentieth century electronics with the aid of a seventeenth century workshop manual .  what did agnes nutter know of the transistor .     well  my grandfather interpreted prediction      rather neatly in      and made some very shrewd investments   said anathema .   she didn t know what it was going to be called  of course  and she wasn t very sound about electricity in general  but       i was speaking rhetorically .     you don t have to make it work  anyway .  you have to stop it working .  you don t need knowledge for that  you need ignorance .    newt groaned .    all right   he said wearily .   let s try it .  give me a prediction .    anathema pulled out a card at random .     he is not that which he says he is    she read .   it s number      .  very simple .  any ideas .     well  look   said newt  wretchedly   this isn t really the time to say it but     he swallowed    actually i m not very good with electronics .  not very good at all .     you said you were a computer engineer  i seem to remember .     that was an exaggeration .  i mean  just about as much of an exaggeration as you can possibly get  in fact  really  i suppose it was more what you might call an an overstatement .  i might go so far as to say that what it really was   newt closed his eyes   was a prevarication .     a lie  you mean .   said anathema sweetly .    oh  i wouldn t go that far   said newt .   although   he added   i m not actually a computer engineer .  at all .  quite the opposite .     what s the opposite .     if you must know  every time i try and make anything electronic work  it stops .    anathema gave him a bright little smile  and posed theatrically  like that moment in every conjurer s stage act when the lady in the sequins steps back to reveal the trick .    tra la   she said .    repair it   she said .    what .     make it work better   she said .    i don t know   said newt .   i m not sure i can .   he laid a hand on top of the nearest cabinet .   there was the noise of something he hadn t realized he d been hearing suddenly stopping  and the descending whine of a distant generator .  the lights on the panels flickered  and most of them went out .   all over the world  people who had been wrestling with switches found that they switched .  circuit breakers opened .  computers stopped planning world war iii and went back to idly scanning the stratosphere .  in bunkers under novya zemla men found that the fuses they were frantically trying to pull out came away in their hands at last  in bunkers under wyoming and nebraska  men in fatigues stopped screaming and waving guns at one another  and would have had a beer if alcohol had been allowed in missile bases .  it wasn t  but they had one anyway .   the lights came on .  civilization stopped its slide into chaos  and started writing letters to the newspapers about how people got overexcited about the least little thing these days .   in tadfield  the machines ceased radiating menace .  something that had been in them was gone  quite apart from the electricity .    gosh   said newt .    there you are   said anathema .   you fixed it good .  you can trust old agnes  take it from me .  now let s get out of here .            he didn t want to do it .   said aziraphale .   haven t i always told you  crowley .  if you take the trouble to look  deep down inside anyone  you ll find that at bottom they re really quite       it s not over   said crowley flatly .   adam turned and appeared to notice them for the first time .  crowley was not used to people identifying him so readily  but adam stared at him as though crowley s entire life history was pasted inside the back of his skull and he  adam  was reading it .  for an instant he knew real terror .  he d always thought the sort he d felt before was the genuine article  but that was mere abject fear beside this new sensation .  those below could make you cease to exist by  well  hurting you in unbearable amounts  but this boy could not only make you cease to exist merely by thinking about it  but probably could arrange matters so that you never had existed at all .   adam s gaze swept to aziraphale .     scuse me  why re you two people .   said adam .    well   said aziraphale   it s a long       it s not right  being two people   said adam .   i reckon you d better go back to being two sep rate people .    there were no showy special effects .  there was just aziraphale  sitting next to madame tracy .    ooh  that felt tingly   she said .  she looked aziraphale up and down .   oh   she said  in a slightly disappointed voice .   somehow  i thought you d be younger .    shadwell glowered jealously at the angel and thumbed the thundergun s hammer in a pointed sort of way .   aziraphale looked down at his new body which was  unfortunately  very much like his old body  although the overcoat was cleaner .    well  that s over   he said .    no   said crowley .   no .  it isn t  you see .  not at all .    now there were clouds overhead  curling like a pot of tagliatelli on full boil .    you see   said crowley  his voice leaden with fatalistic gloom   it doesn t really work that simply .  you think wars get started because some old duke gets shot  or someone cuts off someone s ear  or someone s sited their missiles in the wrong place .  it s not like that .  that s just  well  just reasons  which haven t got anything to do with it .  what really causes wars is two sides that can t stand the sight of one another and the pressure builds up and up and then anything will cause it .  anything at all .  what s your name    er    boy .     that s adam young   said anathema  as she strode up with newt trailing after her .    that s right .  adam young   said adam .    good effort .  you ve saved the world .  have a half holiday   said crowley .   but it won t really make any difference .     i think you re right   said aziraphale .   i m sure my people want armageddon .  it s very sad .     would anyone mind telling us what s going on .   said anathema sternly  folding her arms .   aziraphale shrugged .   it s a very long story   he began .   anathema stuck out her chin .   go on  then   she said .    well .  in the beginning      the lightning flashed  struck the ground a few meters from adam  and stayed there  a sizzling column that broadened at the base  as though the wild electricity was filling an invisible mold .  the humans pressed back against the jeep .   the lightning vanished  and a young man made out of golden fire stood there .    oh dear   said aziraphale .   it s him .     him who .   said crowley .    the voice of god   said the angel .   the metatron .    the them stared .   then pepper said   no  it isn t .  the metatron s made of plastic and it s got laser cannon and it can turn into a helicopter .     that s the cosmic megatron   said wensleydale weakly .   i had one  but the head fell off .  i think this one is different .    the beautiful blank gaze fell on adam young  and then turned sharply to look at the concrete beside it  which was boiling .   a figure rose from the churning ground in the manner of the demon king in a pantomime  but if this one was ever in a pantomime  it was one where no one walked out alive and they had to get a priest to burn the place down afterwards .  it was not greatly different to the other figure  except that its flames were blood red .    er   said crowley  trying to shrink into his seat .   hi    er .    the red thing gave him the briefest of glances  as though marking him for future consumption  and then stared at adam .  when it spoke  its voice was like a million flies taking off in a hurry .   it buzzed a word that felt  to those humans who heard it  like a file dragged down the spine .   it was talking to adam  who said   huh .  no .  i said already .  my name s adam young .   he looked the figure up and down .   what s yours .     beelzebub   crowley supplied .   he s the lord of       thank you  crowzley   said beelzebub .   later we muzzed have a seriouzz talk .  i am sure thou hazzt muzzch to tell me .     er   said crowley   well  you see  what happened was       silenzz .     right .  right   said crowley hurriedly .    now then  adam young   said the metatron   while we can of course appreciate your assistance at this point  we must add that armageddon should take place now .  there may be some temporary inconvenience  but that should hardly stand in the way of the ultimate good .     ah   whispered crowley to aziraphale   what he means is  we have to destroy the world in order to save it .     azz to what it standz in the way of  that hazz yet to be decided   buzzed beelzebub .   but it muzzt be decided now  boy .  that izz thy deztiny .  it is written .    adam took a deep breath .  the human watchers held theirs .  crowley and aziraphale had forgotten to breathe some time ago .    i just don t see why everyone and everything has to be burned up and everything   adam said .   millions of fish an  whales an  trees an   an  sheep and stuff .  an  not even for anything important .  jus  to see who s got the best gang .  it s like us an  the johnsonites .  but even if you win  you can t really beat the other side  because you don t really want to .  i mean  not for good .  you ll just start all over again .  you ll just keep on sending people like these two   he pointed to crowley and aziraphale   to mess people around .  it s hard enough bein  people as it is  without other people coming and messin  you around .    crowley turned to aziraphale .    johnsonites .   he whispered .   the angel shrugged .   early breakaway sect  i think   he said .   sort of gnostics .  like the ophites .   his forehead wrinkled .   or were they the sethites .  no  i m thinking of the collyridians .  oh dear .  i m sorry  there were hundreds of them  it s so hard to keep track .     people bein  messed around   murmured crowley .    it doesn t matter .   snapped the metatron .   the whole point of the creation of the earth and good and evil       i don t see what s so triflic about creating people as people and then gettin  upset  cos they act like people   said adam severely .   anyway  if you stopped tellin  people it s all sorted out after they re dead  they might try sorting it all out while they re alive .  if i was in charge  i d try makin  people live a lot longer  like ole methuselah .  it d be a lot more interestin  and they might start thinkin  about the sort of things they re doing to all the enviroment and ecology  because they ll still be around in a hundred years  time .     ah   said beelzebub  and he actually began to smile .   you wizzsh to rule the world .  that z more like thy fath       i thought about all that an  i don t want to   said adam  half turning and nodding encouragingly at the them .   i mean  there s some stuff could do with alt rin   but then i expect peopled keep comin  up to me and gettin  me to sort out everythin  the whole time and get rid of all the rubbish and make more trees for  em  and where s the good in all that .  it s like havin  to tidy up people s bedrooms for them .     you never tidy up even your bedroom   said pepper  behind him .    i never said anythin  about my bedroom   said adam  referring to a room whose carpet had been lost to view for several years .   it s general bedrooms i mean .  i dint mean my personal bedroom .  it s an analoggy .  that s jus  what i m sayin  .    beelzebub and the metatron looked at one another .    anyway   said adam   it s bad enough having to think of things for pepper and wensley and brian to do all the time so they don t get bored  so i don t want any more world than i ve got .  thank you all the same .    the metatron s face began to take on the look familiar to all those subjected to adam s idiosyncratic line of reasoning .    you can t refuse to be who you are   it said eventually .   listen .  your birth and destiny are part of the great plan .  things have to happen like this .  all the choices have been made .     rebellion izz a fine thing   said beelzebub   but some thingz are beyond rebellion .  you muzzt understand .     i m not rebelling against anything   said adam in a reasonable tone of voice .   i m pointin  out things .  seems to me you can t blame people for pointin  out things .  seems to me it d be a lot better not to start fightin  and jus  see what people do .  if you stop messin  them about they might start thinkin  properly an  they might stop messin  the world around .  i m not sayin  they would   he added conscientiously   but they might .     this makes no sense   said the metatron .   you can t run counter to the great plan .  you must think .  it s in your genes .  think .    adam hesitated .   the dark undercurrent was always ready to flow back  its reedy whisper saying yes  that was it  that was what it was all about  you have to follow the plan because you were part of it     it had been a long day .  he was tired .  saving the world took it out of an eleven year old body .   crowley stuck his head in his hands .   for a moment there  just for a moment  i thought we had a chance   he said .   he had them worried .  oh  well  it was nice while      he was aware that aziraphale had stood up .    excuse me   said the angel .   the trio looked at him .    this great plan   he said   this would be the ineffable plan  would it .    there was a moment s silence .    it s the great plan   said the metatron flatly .   you are well aware .  there shall be a world lasting six thousand years and it will conclude with       yes  yes  that s the great plan all right   said aziraphale .  he spoke politely and respectfully  but with the air of one who has just asked an unwelcome question at a political meeting and won t go away until he gets an answer .   i was just asking if it s ineffable as well .  i just want to be clear on this point .     it doesn t matter .   snapped the metatron .   it s the same thing  surely .    surely .  thought crowley .  they don t actually know .  he started to grin like an idiot .    so you re not one hundred percent clear on this .   said aziraphale .    it s not given to us to understand the ineffable plan   said the metatron   but of course the great plan       but the great plan can only be a tiny part of the overall ineffability   said crowley .   you can t be certain that what s happening right now isn t exactly right  from an ineffable point of view .     it izz written .   bellowed beelzebub .    but it might be written differently somewhere else   said crowley .    where you can t read it .     in bigger letters   said aziraphale .    underlined   crowley added .    twice   suggested aziraphale .    perhaps this isn t just a test of the world   said crowley .   it might be a test of you people  too .  hmm .     god does not play games with his loyal servants   said the metatron  but in a worried tone of voice .    whoop eee   said crowley .   where have you been .    everyone found their eyes turning toward adam .  he seemed to be thinking very carefully .   then he said   i don t see why it matters what is written .  not when it s about people .  it can always be crossed out .    a breeze swept across the airfield .  overhead  the assembled hosts rippled  like a mirage .   there was the kind of silence there might have been on the day before creation .   adam stood smiling at the two of them  a small figure perfectly poised exactly between heaven and hell .   crowley grabbed aziraphale s arm .   you know what happened .   he hissed excitedly .   he was left alone .  he grew up human .  he s not evil incarnate or good incarnate  he s just    a human incarnate      then    i think   said the metatron   that i shall need to seek further instructions .     i alzzo   said beelzebub .  his raging face turned to crowley .   and i shall report of your part in thizz  thou hast better believe it .   he glared at adam .   and i do not know what thy father will say      there was a thundering explosion .  shadwell  who had been fidgeting with horrified excitement for some minutes  had finally got enough control of his trembling fingers to pull the trigger .   the pellets passed through the space where beelzebub had been .  shadwell never knew how lucky he had been that he d missed .   the sky wavered  and then became just sky .  around the horizon  the clouds began to unravel .          madame tracy broke the silence .    weren t they odd   she said .   she didn t mean  weren t they odd   what she did mean she probably could never hope to express  except by screaming  but the human brain has amazing recuperative powers and saying  weren t they odd  was part of the rapid healing process .  within half an hour  she d be thinking she d just had too much to drink .    is it over  do you think .   said aziraphale .   crowley shrugged .   not for us  i m afraid .     i don t think you need to go worryin    said adam gnomically .   i know all about you two .  don t you worry .    he looked at the rest of the them  who tried not to back away .  he seemed to think for a while  and then he said   there s been too much messin  around anyway .  but it seems to me everyone s goin  to be a lot happier if they forget about this .  not actually forget  just not remember exactly .  an  then we can go home .     but you can t just leave it at that .   said anathema  pushing forward .   think of all things you could do .  good things .     like what .   said adam suspiciously .    well    you could bring all the whales back  to start with .    he put his head on one side .   an  that d stop people killing them .    she hesitated .  it would have been nice to say yes .    an  if people do start killing  em  what would you ask me to do about  em .   said adam .   no .  i reckon i m getting the hang of this now .  once i start messing around like that  there d be no stoppin  it .  seems to me  the only sensible thing is for people to know if they kill a whale  they ve got a dead whale .     that shows a very responsible attitude   said newt .   adam raised an eyebrow .    it s just sense   he said .   aziraphale patted crowley on the back .   we seem to have survived   he said .   just imagine how terrible it might have been if we d been at all competent .     um   said crowley .    is your car operational .     i think it might need a bit of work   crowley admitted .    i was thinking that we might take these good people into town   said aziraphale .   i owe madame tracy a meal  i m sure .  and her young man  of course .    shadwell looked over his shoulder  and then up at madame tracy .    who s he talking about .   he asked her triumphant expression .   adam rejoined the them .    i reckon we ll just be gettin  home   he said .    but what actually happened .   said pepper .   i mean  there was all this       it doesn t matter any more   said adam .    but you could help so much     anathema began  as they wandered back to their bikes .  newt took her gently by the arm .    that s not a good idea   he said .   tomorrow is the first day of the rest of our lives .     do you know   she said   of all the trite sayings i ve ever really hated  that comes top .     amazing  isn t it   said newt happily .    why ve you got  dick turpin  painted on the door of your car .     it s a joke  really   said newt .    hmm .     because everywhere i go  i hold up traffic   he mumbled wretchedly .   crowley looked glumly at the controls of the jeep .    i m sorry about the car   aziraphale was saying .   i know how much you liked it .  perhaps if you concentrated really hard       it wouldn t be the same   said crowley .    i suppose not .     i had it from new  you know .  it wasn t a car  it was more a sort of whole body glove .    he sniffed .    what s burning .   he said .   a breeze swept up the dust and dropped it again .  the air became hot and heavy  imprisoning those within it like flies in syrup .   he turned his head  and looked into aziraphale s horrified expression .    but it s over   he said .   it can t happen now .  the   the thing  the correct moment or whatever   it s gone past .  it s over .    the ground began to shake .  the noise was like a subway train  but not one passing under .  it was more like the sound of one coming up .   crowley fumbled madly with the gear shift .    that s not beelzebub .   he shouted  above the noise of the wind .   that s him .  his father .  this isn t armageddon  this is personal .  start  you bloody thing .    the ground moved under anathema and newt  flinging them onto the dancing concrete .  yellow smoke gushed from between the cracks .    it feels like a volcano .   shouted newt .   what is it .     whatever it is  it s pretty angry   said anathema .   in the jeep  crowley was cursing .  aziraphale laid a hand on his shoulder .    there are humans here   he said .    yes   said crowley .   and me .     i mean we shouldn t let this happen to them .     well  what     crowley began  and stopped .    i mean  when you think about it  we ve got them into enough trouble as it is .  you and me .  over the years .  what with one thing and another .     we were only doing our jobs   muttered crowley .    yes .  so what .  lots of people in history have only done their jobs and look at the trouble they caused .     you don t mean we should actually try to stop him .     what have you got to lose .    crowley started to argue  and realized that he hadn t anything .  there was nothing he could lose that he hadn t lost already .  they couldn t do anything worse to him than he had coming to him already .  he felt free at last .   he also felt under the seat and found a tire iron .  it wouldn t be any good  but then  nothing would .  in fact it d be much more terrible facing the adversary with anything like a decent weapon .  that way you might have a bit of hope  which would make it worse .   aziraphale picked up the sword lately dropped by war  and hefted its weight thoughtfully .    gosh  it s been years since i used this   he murmured .    about six thousand   said crowley .    my word  yes   said the angel .   what a day that was  and no mistake .  good old days .     not really   said crowley .  the noise was growing .    people knew the difference between right and wrong in those days   said aziraphale dreamily .    well  yes .  think about it .     ah .  yes .  too much messin  about .     yes .    aziraphale held up the sword .  there was a whoomph as it suddenly flamed like a bar of magnesium .    once you ve learned how to do it  you never forget   he said .   he smiled at crowley .    i d just like to say   he said   if we don t get out of this  that    i ll have known  deep down inside  that there was a spark of goodness in you .     that s right   said crowley bitterly .   make my day .    aziraphale held out his hand .    nice knowing you   he said .   crowley took it .    here s to the next time   he said .   and    aziraphale .     yes .     just remember i ll have known that  deep down inside  you were just enough of a bastard to be worth liking .    there was a scuffing noise  and they were pushed aside by the small but dynamic shape of shadwell  waving the thundergun purposefully .    i wouldna  trust you two southern nancy boys to kill a lame rat in a barrel   he said .   who re we fightin  noo .     the devil   said aziraphale  simply .   shadwell nodded  as if this hadn t come as a surprise  threw the gun down  and took off his hat to expose a forehead known and feared wherever street fighting men were gathered together .    ah reckoned so   he said .   in that case  i m gonna use mah haid .    newt and anathema watched the three of them walk unsteadily away from the jeep .  with shadwell in the middle  they looked like a stylized w .    what on earth are they going to do .   said newt .   and what s happening   what s happening to them .    the coats of aziraphale and crowley split along the seams .  if you were going to go  you might as well go in your own true shape .  feathers unfolded towards the sky .   contrary to popular belief  the wings of demons are the same as the wings of angels  although they re often better groomed .    shadwell shouldn t be going with them .   said newt  staggering to his feet .    what s a shadwell .     he s my serg   he s this amazing old man  you d never believe it    i ve got to help him .     help him .   said anathema .    i took an oath and everything .   newt hesitated .   well  sort of an oath .  and he gave me a month s wages in advance .     who re those other two  then .  friends of yours     anathema began  and stopped .  aziraphale had half turned  and the profile had finally clicked into place .    i know where i ve seen him before .   she shouted  pulling herself upright against newt as the ground bounced up and down .   come on .     but something dreadful s going to happen .     if he s damaged the book  you re bloody well right .    newt fumbled in his lapel and found his official pin .  he didn t know what they were going up against this time  but a pin was all he had .   they ran         adam looked around .  he looked down .  his face took on an expression of calculated innocence .   there was a moment of conflict .  but adam was on his own ground .  always  and ultimately  on his own ground .   he moved one hand around in a blurred half circle .          aziraphale and crowley felt the world change .   there was no noise .  there were no cracks .  there was just that where there had been the beginnings of a volcano of satanic power  there was just clearing smoke  and a car drawing slowly to a halt  its engine loud in the evening hush .   it was an elderly car  but well preserved .  not using crowley s method  though  where dents were simply wished away  this car looked like it did  you knew instinctively  because its owner had spent every weekend for two decades doing all the things the manual said should be done every weekend .  before every journey he walked around it and checked the lights and counted the wheels .  serious minded men who smoked pipes and wore mustaches had written serious instructions saying that this should be done  and so he did it  because he was a serious minded man who smoked a pipe and wore a mustache and did not take such injunctions lightly  because if you did  where would you be .  he had exactly the right amount of insurance .  he drove three miles below the speed limit  or forty miles per hour  whichever was the lower .  he wore a tie  even on saturdays .   archimedes said that with a long enough lever and a solid enough place to stand  he could move the world .   he could have stood on mr .  young .   the car door opened and mr .  young emerged .    what s going on here .   he said .   adam .  adam .    but the them were streaking towards the gate .   mr .  young looked at the shocked assembly .  at least crowley and aziraphale had had enough self control left to winch in their wings .    what s he been getting up to now .   he sighed  not really expecting an answer .    where s that boy got to .  adam .  come back here this instant .    adam seldom did what his father wanted .          sgt .  thomas a .  deisenburger opened his eyes .  the only thing strange about his surroundings was how familiar they were .  there was his high school photograph on the wall  and his little stars and stripes flag in the toothmug  next to his toothbrush  and even his little teddy bear  still in its little uniform .  the early afternoon sun flooded through his bedroom window .   he could smell apple pie .  that was one of the things he d missed most about spending his saturday nights a long way from home .   he walked downstairs .   his mother was at the stove  taking a huge apple pie out of the oven to cool .    hi  tommy   she said .   i thought you was in england .     yes  mom  i am normatively in england  mom  protecting democratism  mom  sir   said sgt .  thomas a .  deisenburger .    that s nice  hon   said his mother .   your poppa s down in the big field  with chester and ted .  they ll be pleased to see you .    sgt .  thomas a .  deisenburger nodded .   he took off his military issue helmet and his military issue jacket  and he rolled up his military issue shirtsleeves .  for a moment he looked more thoughtful than he had ever done in his life .  part of his thoughts were occupied with apple pie .    mom  if any throughput eventuates premising to interface with sgt .  thomas a .  deisenburger telephonically  mom  sir  this individual will       sorry  tommy .    tom deisenburger hung his gun on the wall  above his father s battered old rifle .    i said  if anyone calls  mom  i ll be down in the big field  with pop and chester and ted .           the van drove slowly up to the gates of the air base .  it pulled over .  the guard on the midnight shift looked in the window  checked the credentials of the driver  and waved him in .   the van meandered across the concrete .   it parked on the tarmac of the empty airstrip  near where two men sat  sharing a bottle of wine .  one of the men wore dark glasses .  surprisingly  no one else seemed to be paying them the slightest attention .    are you saying   said crowley   that he planned it this way all along .  from the very beginning .    aziraphale conscientiously wiped the top of the bottle and passed it back .    could have   he said .   could have .  one could always ask him  i suppose .     from what i remember   replied crowley  thoughtfully      and we were never actually on what you might call speaking terms   he wasn t exactly one for a straight answer .  in fact  in fact  he d never answer at all .  he d just smile  as if he knew something that you didn t .     and of course that s true   said the angel .   otherwise  what d be the point .    there was a pause  and both beings stared reflectively off into the distance  as if they were remembering things that neither of them had thought of for a long time .   the van driver got out of the van  carrying a cardboard box and a pair of tongs .   lying on the tarmac were a tarnished metal crown and a pair of scales .  the man picked them up with the tongs and placed them in the box .   then he approached the couple with the bottle .    excuse me  gents   he said   but there s meant to be a sword around here somewhere as well  at least  that s what it says here at any rate  and i was wondering      aziraphale seemed embarrassed .  he looked around himself  vaguely puzzled  then stood up  to discover that he had been sitting on the sword for the last hour or so .  he reached down and picked it up .   sorry   he said  and put the sword into the box .   the van driver  who wore an international express cap  said not to mention it  and really it was a godsend them both being there like this  since someone was going to have to sign to say that he d duly collected what he d been sent for  and this had certainly been a day to remember  eh .   aziraphale and crowley both agreed with him that it had  and aziraphale signed the clipboard that the van driver gave him  witnessing that a crown  a pair of balances  and a sword had been received in good order and were to be delivered to a smudged address and charged to a blurred account number .   the man began to walk back to his van .  then he stopped  and turned .    if i was to tell my wife what happened to me today   he told them  a little sadly   she d never believe me .  and i wouldn t blame her  because i don t either .   and he climbed into his van  and he drove away .   crowley stood up  a little unsteadily .  he reached a hand down to aziraphale .    come on   he said .   i ll drive us back to london .    he took a jeep .  no one stopped them .   it had a cassette player .  this isn t general issue  even for american military vehicles  but crowley automatically assumed that all vehicles he drove would have cassette players and therefore this one did  within seconds of his getting in .   the cassette that he put on as he drove was marked handel s water music  and it stayed handel s water music all the way home .       sunday    the first day of the rest of their lives    at around half past ten the paper boy brought the sunday papers to the front door of jasmine cottage .  he had to make three trips .   the series of thumps as they hit the mat woke up newton pulsifer .   he left anathema asleep .  she was pretty shattered  poor thing .  she d been almost incoherent when he d put her to bed .  she d run her life according to the prophecies and now there were no more prophecies .  she must be feeling like a train which had reached the end of the line but still had to keep going  somehow .   from now on she d be able to go through life with everything coming as a surprise  just like everyone else .  what luck .   the telephone rang .   newt dashed for the kitchen and picked up the receiver on the second ring .    hello .   he said .   a voice of forced friendliness tinted with desperation gabbled at him .    no   he said   i m not .  and it s not devissey  it s device .  as in nice .  and she s asleep .     well   he said   i m pretty sure she doesn t want any cavities insulated .  or double glazing .  i mean  she doesn t own the cottage  you know .  she s only renting it .     no  i m not going to wake her up and ask her   he said .   and tell me  miss  uh    right  miss morrow  why don t you lot take sundays off  like everybody else does .     sunday   he said .   of course it s not saturday .  why would it be saturday .  saturday was yesterday .  it s honestly sunday today  really .  what do you mean  you ve lost a day .  i haven t got it .  seems to me you ve got a bit carried away with selling    hello .    he growled  and replaced the receiver .   telephone salespeople .  something dreadful ought to happen to them .   he was assailed by a moment of sudden doubt .  today was sunday  wasn t it .  a glance at the sunday papers reassured him .  if the sunday times said it was sunday  you could be sure that they d investigated the matter .  and yesterday was saturday .  of course .  yesterday was saturday  and he d never forget saturday for as long as he lived  if only he could remember what it was he wasn t meant to forget .   seeing that he was in the kitchen  newt decided to make breakfast .   he moved around the kitchen as quietly as possible  to avoid waking the rest of the household  and found every sound magnified .  the antique fridge had a door that shut like the crack of doom .  the kitchen tap dribbled like a diuretic gerbil but made a noise like old faithful .  and he couldn t find where anything was .  in the end  as every human being who has ever breakfasted on their own in someone else s kitchen has done since nearly the dawn of time  he made do with unsweetened instant black coffee .    except for giovanni jacopo casanova                famed amoutist and litterateur  who revealed in volume    of his memoirs that  as a matter of course  he carried around with him at all times a small valise containing  a loaf of bread  a pot of choice seville marmalade  a knife  fork  and small spoon for stirring    fresh eggs packed with care in unspun wool  a tomato or love apple  a small frying pan  a small sauce pan  a spirit burner  a chafing dish  a tin box of salted butter of the italian type    bone china plates .  also a portion of honey comb  as a sweetener  for my breath and for my coffee .  let my readers understand me when i say to them all  a true gentleman should always be able to break his fast in the manner of a gentleman  wheresoever he may find himself    on the kitchen table was a roughly rectangular  leather bound cinder .  he could just make out the words  ni a and ace  on the charred cover .  what a difference a day made  he thought .  it turns you from the ultimate reference book to a mere barbecue briquette .   now  then .  how  exactly  had they got it .  he recalled a man who smelled of smoke and wore sunglasses even in darkness .  and there was other stuff  all running together    boys on bikes    an unpleasant buzzing    a small  grubby  staring face    it all hung around in his mind  not exactly forgotten but forever hanging on the cusp of recollection  a memory of things that hadn t happened .  how could you have that .    and there was the matter of dick turpin .  it looked like the same car  except that forever afterwards it seemed able to do     miles on a gallon of petrol  ran so quietly that you practically had to put your mouth over the exhaust pipe to see if the engine was firing  and issued its voice synthesized warnings in a series of exquisite and perfectly phrased haikus  each one original and apt         late frost burns the bloom  would a fool not let the belt  restrain the body .          it would say .  and       the cherry blossom  tumbles from the highest tree .   one needs more petrol       he sat staring at the wall until a knock at the door brought him back to earth .   there was a small dapper man in a black raincoat standing on the doorstep .  he was holding a cardboard box and he gave newt a bright smile .    mr .     he consulted a piece of paper in one hand    pulzifer .     pulsifer   said newt .   it s a hard ess .     i m ever so sorry   said the man .   i ve only ever seen it written down .  er .  well  then .  it would appear that this is for you and mrs .  pulsifer .    newt gave him a blank look .    there is no mrs .  pulsifer   he said coldly .   the man removed his bowler hat .    oh  i m terribly sorry   he said .    i mean that    well  there s my mother   said newt .   but she s not dead  she s just in dorking .  i m not married .     how odd .  the letter is quite  er  specific .     who are you .   said newt .  he was wearing only his trousers  and it was chilly on the doorstep .   the man balanced the box awkwardly and fished out a card from an inner pocket .  he handed it to newt .   it read       giles baddicombe  robey  robey  redfearn and bychance  solicitors     demdyke chambers   preston       yes .   he said politely .   and what can i do for you  mr .  baddicombe .     you could let me in   said mr .  baddicombe .    you re not serving a writ or anything  are you .   said newt .  the events of last night hung in his memory like a cloud  constantly changing whenever he thought he could make out a picture  but he was vaguely aware of damaging things and had been expecting retribution in some form .    no   said mr .  baddicombe  looking slightly hurt .   we have people for that sort of thing .    he wandered past newt and put the box down on the table .    to be honest   he said   we re all very interested in this .  mr .  bychance nearly came down himself  but he doesn t travel well these days .     look   said newt   i really haven t the faintest idea what you re talking about .     this   said mr .  baddicombe  proffering the box and beaming like aziraphale about to attempt a conjuring trick   is yours .  someone wanted you to have it .  they were very specific .     a present .   said newt .  he eyed the taped cardboard cautiously  and then rummaged in the kitchen drawer for a sharp knife .    i think more a bequest   said mr .  baddicombe .   you see  we ve had it for three hundred years .  sorry .  was it something i said .  hold it under the tap  i should .     what the hell is this all about .   said newt  but a certain icy suspicion was creeping over him .  he sucked at the cut .    it s a funny story   do you mind if i sit down .    and of course i don t know the full details because i joined the firm only fifteen years ago  but         it had been a very small legal firm when the box had been cautiously delivered  redfearn  bychance and both the robeys  let alone mr .  baddicombe  were a long way in the future .  the struggling legal clerk who had accepted delivery had been surprised to find  tied to the top of the box with twine  a letter addressed to himself .   it had contained certain instructions and five interesting facts about the history of the next ten years which  if put to good use by a keen young man  would ensure enough finance to pursue a very successful legal career .   all he had to do was see that the box was carefully looked after for rather more than three hundred years  and then delivered to a certain address         although of course the firm had changed hands many times over the centuries   said mr .  baddicombe .   but the box has always been part of the chattels  as it were .     i didn t even know they made heinz baby foods in the seventeenth century   said newt .    that was just to keep it undamaged in the car   said mr .  baddicombe .    and no one s opened it all these years .   said newt .    twice  i believe   said mr .  baddicombe .   in       by mr .  george cranby  and in      by mr .  arthur bychance  father of the present mr .  bychance .   he coughed .   apparently mr .  cranby found a letter          addressed to himself   said newt .   mr .  baddicombe sat back hurriedly .   my word .  how did you guess that .     i think i recognize the style   said newt grimly .   what happened to them .     have you heard this before .   said mr .  baddicombe suspiciously .    not in so many words .  they weren t blown up  were they .     well    mr .  cranby had a heart attack  it is believed .  and mr .  bychance went very pale and put his letter back in its envelope  i understand  and gave very strict instructions that the box wasn t to be opened again in his lifetime .  he said anyone who opened the box would be sacked without references .     a dire threat   said newt  sarcastically .    it was  in      .  anyway  their letters are in the box .    new pulled the cardboard aside .   there was a small ironbound chest inside .  it had no lock .    go on  lift it out   said mr .  baddicombe excitedly .   i must say i d very much like to know what s in there .  we ve had bets on it  in the office       i ll tell you what   said newt  generously   i ll make us some coffee  and you can open the box .     me .  would that be proper .     i don t see why not .   newt eyed the saucepans hanging over the stove .  one of them was big enough for what he had in mind .    go on   he said .   be a devil .  i don t mind .  you   you could have power of attorney  or something .    mr .  baddicombe took off his overcoat .   well   he said  rubbing his hands together   since you put it like that it d be something to tell my grandchildren .    newt picked up the saucepan and laid his hand gently on the door handle .   i hope so   he said .    here goes .    newt heard a faint creak .    what can you see .   he said .    there s the two opened letters    oh  and a third one    addressed to      newt heard the snap of a wax seal and the clink of something on the table .  then there was a gasp  the clatter of a chair  the sound of running feet in the hallway  the slam of a door  and the sound of a car engine being jerked into life and then redlined down the lane .   newt took the saucepan off his head and came out from behind the door .   he picked up the letter and was not one hundred percent surprised to see that it was addressed to mr .  g .  baddicombe .  he unfolded it .   it read   here is a florin  lawyer  nowe  runne faste  lest thee worlde knoe the truth about yowe and mistrefs spiddon the type writinge machine slavey .    newt looked at the other letters .  the crackling paper of the one addressed to george cranby said   remove thy thievinge hande  master cranby .  i minde well how yowe swindled the widdowe plashkin this michelmas past  yowe skinnie owlde snatch pastry .    newt wondered what a snatch pastry was .  he would be prepared to bet that it didn t involve cookery .   the one that had awaited the inquisitive mr .  bychance said   yowe left them  yowe cowarde .  returne this letter to the hocks  lest the worlde knoe the true events of june  th  nineteen hundred and sixteene .    under the letters was a manuscript .  newt stared at it .    what s that .   said anathema .   he spun around .  she was leaning against the doorframe  like an attractive yawn on legs .   newt backed against the table .   oh  nothing .  wrong address .  nothing .  just some old box .  junk mail .  you know how       on a sunday .   she said  pushing him aside .   he shrugged as she put her hands around the yellowed manuscript and lifted it out .    further nife and accurate prophecies of agnes nutter   she read slowly   concerning the worlde that is to com  ye saga continuef l oh  my      she laid it reverentially on the table and prepared to turn the first page .   newt s hand landed gently on hers .    think of it like this   he said quietly .   do you want to be a descendant for the rest of your life .    she looked up .  their eyes met .          it was sunday  the first day of the rest of the world  around eleven thirty .   st .  james  park was comparatively quiet .  the ducks  who were experts in realpolitik as seen from the bread end  put it down to a decrease in world tension .  there really had been a decrease in world tension  in fact  but a lot of people were in offices trying to find out why  trying to find where atlantis had disappeared to with three international fact finding delegations on it  and trying to work out what had happened to all their computers yesterday .   the park was deserted except for a member of mi  trying to recruit someone who  to their later mutual embarrassment  would turn out to be also a member of mi   and a tall man feeding the ducks .   and there were also crowley and aziraphale .   they strolled side by side across the grass .    same here   said aziraphale .   the shop s all there .  not so much as a soot mark .     i mean  you can t just make an old bentley   said crowley .   you can t get the patina .  but there it was  large as life .  right there in the street .  you can t tell the difference .     well  i can tell the difference   said aziraphale .   i m sure i didn t stock books with titles like biggles goes to mars and jack cade  frontier hero and     things a boy can do and blood dogs of the skull sea .     gosh  i m sorry   said crowley  who knew how much the angel had treasured his book collection .    don t be   said aziraphale happily .   they re all mint first editions and i looked them up in skindle s price guide .  i think the phrase you use is whop eee .     i thought he was putting the world back just as it was   said crowley .    yes   said aziraphale .   more or less .  as best he can .  but he s got a sense of humor  too .    crowley gave him a sideways look .    your people been in touch .   he said .    no .  yours .     no .     i think they re pretending it didn t happen .     mine too  i suppose .  that s bureaucracy for you .     and i think mine are waiting to see what happens next   said aziraphale .   crowley nodded .   a breathing space   he said .   a chance to morally re arm .  get the defenses up .  ready for the big one .    they stood by the pond  watching the ducks scrabble for the bread .    sorry .   said aziraphale .   i thought that was the big one .     i m not sure   said crowley .   think about it .  for my money  the really big one will be all of us against all of them .     what .  you mean heaven and hell against humanity .    crowley shrugged .   of course  if he did change everything  then maybe he changed himself  too .  got rid of his powers  perhaps .  decided to stay human .     oh  i do hope so   said aziraphale .   anyway  i m sure the alter native wouldn t be allowed .  er .  would it .     i don t know .  you can never be certain about what s really intended .  plans within plans .     sorry  said aziraphale .    well   said crowley  who d been thinking about this until his head ached   haven t you ever wondered about it all .  you know   your people and my people .  heaven and hell  good and evil  all that sort of thing .  i mean  why .     as i recall   said the angel  stiffly   there was the rebellion and       ah  yes .  and why did it happen  eh .  i mean  it didn t have to  did it .   said crowley  a manic look in his eye .   anyone who could build a universe in six days isn t going to let a little thing like that happen .  unless they want it to  of course .     oh  come on .  be sensible   said aziraphale  doubtfully .    that s not good advice   said crowley .   that s not good advice at all .  if you sit down and think about it sensibly you come up with some very funny ideas .  like  why make people inquisitive  and then put some forbidden fruit where they can see it with a big neon finger flashing on and off saying  this is it .   .     i don t remember any neon .     metaphorically  i mean .  i mean  why do that if you really don t want them to eat it  eh .  i mean  maybe you just want to see how it all turns out .  maybe it s all part of a great big ineffable plan .  all of it .  you  me  him  everything .  some great big test to see if what you ve built all works properly  eh .  you start thinking  it can t be a great cosmic game of chess  it has to be just very complicated solitaire .  and don t bother to answer .  if we could understand  we wouldn t be us .  because it s all   all      ineffable  said the figure feeding the ducks .    yeah .  right .  thanks .    they watched the tall stranger carefully dispose of the empty bag in a litter bin  and stalk away across the grass .  then crowley shook his head .    what was i saying .   he said .    don t know   said aziraphale .   nothing very important  i think .    crowley nodded gloomily .   let me tempt you to some lunch   he hissed .   they went to the ritz again  where a table was mysteriously vacant .  and perhaps the recent exertions had had some fallout in the nature of reality because  while they were eating  for the first time ever  a nightingale sang in berkeley square .   no one heard it over the noise of the traffic  but it was there  right enough .          it was one o clock on sunday .   for the last decade sunday lunch in witchfinder sergeant shadwell s world had followed an invariable routine .  he would sit at the rickety  cigarette burned table in his room  thumbing through an elderly copy of one of the witchfinder army library s  witchfinder corporal carpet  librarian  il pence per annum bonus .   books on magic and demonology   the necrotelecomnicon or the liber fulvarum paginarum  or his old favorite  the malleus malleficarum .    a relentlefs blockbufter of a boke  heartily recommended    pope innocent viii .    then there would be a knock on the door  and madame tracy would call out   lunch  mr .  shadwell   and shadwell would mutter   shameless hussy   and wait sixty seconds  to allow the shameless hussy time to get back into her room  then he d open the door  and pick up the plate of liver  which was usually carefully covered by another plate to keep it warm .  and he d take it in  and he d eat it  taking moderate care not to spill any gravy on the pages he was reading .    to the right collector  the witchfinder army s library would have been worth millions .  the right collector would have to have been very rich  and not have minded gravy stains  cigarette burns  marginal notations  or the late witchfinder lance corporal wotling s passion for drawing mustaches and spectacles on all woodcut illustrations of witches and demons .    that was what always happened .   except on that sunday  it didn t .   for a start  he wasn t reading .  he was just sitting .   and when the knock came on the door he got up immediately  and opened it .  he needn t have hurried .   there was no plate .  there was just madame tracy  wearing a cameo brooch  and an unfamiliar shade of lipstick .  she was also standing in the center of a perfume zone .    aye  jezebel .    madame tracy s voice was bright and fast and brittle with uncertainty .   hullo  mister s  i was just thinking  after all we ve been through in the last two days  seems silly for me to leave a plate out for you  so i ve set a place for you .  come on      mister s .  shadwell followed  warily .   he d had another dream  last night .  he didn t remember it properly  just one phrase  that still echoed in his head and disturbed him .  the dream had vanished into a haze  like the events of the previous night .   it was this .   nothin  wrong with witchfinding .  i d like to be a witchfinder .  it s just  weld you ve got to take it in turns .  today we ll go out witchfinding  an  tomorrow we could hide  an it d be the witches  turn to find us      for the second time in twenty four hours   for the second time in his life   he entered madame tracy s rooms .    sit down there   she told him  pointing to an armchair .  it had an antimacassar on the headrest  a plumped up pillow on the seat  and a small footstool .   he sat down .   she placed a tray on his lap  and watched him eat  and removed his plate when he had finished .  then she opened a bottle of guinness  poured it into a glass and gave it to him  then sipped her tea while he slurped his stout .  when she put her cup down  it tinkled nervously in the saucer .    i ve got a tidy bit put away   she said  apropos of nothing .   and you know  i sometimes think it would be a nice thing to get a little bungalow  in the country somewhere .  move out of london .  i d call it the laurels  or dunroamin  or  or       shangri la   suggested shadwell  and for the life of him could not think why .    exactly  mister s .  exactly .  shangri la .   she smiled at him .   are you comfy  love .    shadwell realized with dawning horror that he was comfortable .  horribly  terrifyingly comfortable .   aye   he said  warily .  he had never been so comfortable .   madame tracy opened another bottle of guinness and placed it in front of him .    only trouble with having a little bungalow  called   what was your clever idea  mister s .     uh .  shangri la .     shangri la  exactly  is that it s not right for one  is it .  i mean  two people  they say two can live as cheaply as one .     or five hundred and eighteen  thought shadwell  remembering the massed ranks of the witchfinder army .    she giggled .   i just wonder wherei could find someone to settle down with      shadwell realized that she was talking about him .   he wasn t sure about this .  he had a distinct feeling that leaving witchfinder private pulsifer with the young lady in tadfield had been a bad move  as far as the witchfinder army booke of rules and reggulations was concerned .  and this seemed even more dangerous .   still  at his age  when you re getting too old to go crawling about in the long grass  when the chill morning dew gets into your bones      an  tomorrow we could hide  an it d be the witches  turn to find us .    madame tracy opened another bottle of guinness  and giggled .   oh mister s   she said   you ll be thinking i m trying to get you tiddly .    he grunted .  there was a formality that had to be observed in all this .   witchfinder sergeant shadwell took a long  deep drink of guinness  and he popped the question .   madame tracy giggled .   honestly  you old silly   she said  and she blushed a deep red .   how many do you think .    he popped it again .    two   said madame tracy .    ah  weel .  that s all reet then   said witchfinder sergeant shadwell  retired  .          it was sunday afternoon .   high over england a     droned westwards .  in the first class cabin a boy called warlock put down his comic and stared out of the window .   it had been a very strange couple of days .  he still wasn t certain why his father had been called to the middle east .  he was pretty sure that his father didn t know  either .  it was probably something cultural .  all that had happened was a lot of funny looking guys with towels on their heads and very bad teeth had shown them around some old ruins .  as ruins went  warlock had seen better .  and then one of the old guys had said to him  wasn t there anything he wanted to do .  and warlock had said he d like to leave .   they d looked very unhappy about that .   and now he was going back to the states .  there had been some sort of problem with tickets or flights or airport destination boards or something .  it was weird  he was pretty sure his father had meant to go back to england .  warlock liked england .  it was a nice country to be an american in .   the plane was at that point passing right above the lower tadfield bedroom of greasy johnson  who was aimlessly leafing through a photography magazine that he d bought merely because it had a rather good picture of a tropical fish on the cover .   a few pages below greasy s listless finger was a spread on american football  and how it was really catching on in europe .  which was odd    because when the magazine had been printed  those pages had been about photography in desert conditions .   it was about to change his life .   and warlock flew on to america .  he deserved something  after all  you never forget the first friends you ever had  even if you were all a few hours old at the time  and the power that was controlling the fate of all mankind at that precise time was thinking  well  he s going to america  isn t he .  don t see how you could have anythin  better than going to america  they ve got thirty nine flavors of ice cream there .  maybe even more .          there were a million exciting things a boy and his dog could be doing on a sunday afternoon .  adam could think of four or five hundred of them without even trying .  thrilling things  stirring things  planets to be conquered  lions to be tamed  lost south american worlds teeming with dinosaurs to be discovered and befriended .   he sat in the garden  and scratched in the dirt with a pebble  looking despondent .   his father had found adam asleep on his return from the air base   sleeping  to all intents and purposes  as if he had been in bed all evening .  even snoring once in a while  for verisimilitude .   at breakfast the next morning  however  it was made clear that this had not been enough .  mr .  young disliked gallivanting about of a saturday evening on a wild goose chase .  and if  by some unimaginable fluke  adam was not responsible for the night s disturbances   whatever they had been  since nobody had seemed very clear on the details  only that there had been disturbances of some sort   then he was undoubtedly guilty of something .  this was mr .  young s attitude  and it had served him well for the last eleven years .   adam sat dispiritedly in the garden .  the august sun hung high in an august blue and cloudless sky  and behind the hedge a thrush sang  but it seemed to adam that this was simply making it all much worse .   dog sat at adam s feet .  he had tried to help  chiefly by exhuming a bone he had buried four days earlier and dragging it to adam s feet  but all adam had done was stare at it gloomily  and eventually dog had taken it away and inhumed it once more .  he had done all he could .    adam .    adam turned .  three faces stared over the garden fence .    hi   said adam  disconsolately .    there s a circus come to norton   said pepper .   wensley was down there  and he saw them .  they re just setting up .     they ve got tents  and elephants and jugglers and pratic ly wild animals and stuff and   and everything .   said wensleydale .    we thought maybe we d all go down there an  watch them setting up   said brian .   for an instant adam s mind swam with visions of circuses .  circuses were boring  once they were set up .  you could see better stuff on television any day .  but the setting up    of course they d all go down there  and they d help them put up the tents  and wash the elephants  and the circus people would be so impressed with adam s natural rapport with animals such that  that night  adam  and dog  the world s most famous performing mongrel  would lead the elephants into the circus ring and     it was no good .   he shook his head sadly .   can t go anywhere   he said .   they said so .    there was a pause .    adam   said pepper  a trifle uneasily   what did happen last night .    adam shrugged .   just stuff .  doesn t matter   he said .    salways the same .  all you do is try to help  and people would think you d murdered someone or something .    there was another pause  while the them stared at their fallen leader .    when d you think they ll let you out  then .   asked pepper .    not for years an  years .  years an  years an  years .  i ll be an old man by the time they let me out   said adam .    how about tomorrow .   asked wensleydale .   adam brightened .   oh  tomorrow ll be all right   he pronounced .   they ll have forgotten about it by then .  you ll see .  they always do .   he looked up at them  a scruffy napoleon with his laces trailing  exiled to a rose trellissed elba .   you all go   he told them  with a brief  hollow laugh .   don t you worry about me .  i ll be all right .  i ll see you all tomorrow .    the them hesitated .  loyalty was a great thing  but no lieutenants should be forced to choose between their leader and a circus with elephants .  they left .   the sun continued to shine .  the thrush continued to sing .  dog gave up on his master  and began to stalk a butterfly in the grass by the garden hedge .  this was a serious  solid  impassable hedge  of thick and well trimmed privet  and adam knew it of old .  beyond it stretched open fields  and wonderful muddy ditches  and unripe fruit  and irate but slow of foot owners of fruit trees  and circuses  and streams to dam  and walls and trees just made for climbing     but there was no way through the hedge .   adam looked thoughtful .    dog   said adam  sternly   get away from that hedge  because if you went through it  then i d have to chase you to catch you  and i d have to go out of the garden  and i m not allowed to do that .  but i d have to    if you went an  ran away .    dog jumped up and down excitedly  and stayed where he was .   adam looked around  carefully .  then  even more carefully  he looked up  and down .  and then inside .   then     and now there was a large hole in the hedge   large enough for a dog to run through  and for a boy to squeeze through after him .  and it was a hole that had always been there .   adam winked at dog .   dog ran through the hole in the hedge .  and  shouting clearly  loudly and distinctly   dog  you bad dog .  stop .  come back here .   adam squeezed through after him .   something told him that something was coming to an end .  not the world  exactly .  just the summer .  there would be other summers  but there would never be one like this .  ever again .   better make the most of it  then .   he stopped halfway across the field .  someone was burning something .  he looked at the plume of white smoke above the chimney of jasmine cottage  and he paused .  and he listened .   adam could hear things that other people might miss .   he could hear laughter .   it wasn t a witch s cackle  it was the low and earthy guffaw of someone who knew a great deal more than could possibly be good for them .   the white smoke writhed and curled above the cottage chimney .   for a fraction of an instant adam saw  outlined in the smoke  a handsome  female face .  a face that hadn t been seen on earth for over three hundred years .   agnes nutter winked at him .   the light summer breeze dispersed the smoke  and the face and the laughter were gone .   adam grinned  and began to run once more .   in a meadow a short distance away  across a stream  the boy caught up with the wet and muddy dog .   bad dog   said adam  scratching dog behind the ears .  dog yapped ecstatically .   adam looked up .  above him hung an old apple tree  gnarled and heavy .  it might have been there since the dawn of time .  its boughs were bent with the weight of apples  small and green and unripe .   with the speed of a striking cobra the boy was up the tree .  he returned to the ground seconds later with his pockets bulging  munching noisily on a tart and perfect apple .    hey .  you .  boy .   came a gruff voice from behind him .   you re that adam young .  i can see you .  i ll tell your father about you  you see if i don t .    parental retribution was now a certainty  thought adam  as he bolted  his dog by his side  his pockets stuffed with stolen fruit .   it always was .  but it wouldn t be till this evening .   and this evening was a long way off .   he threw the apple core back in the general direction of his pursuer  and he reached into a pocket for another .   he couldn t see why people made such a fuss about people eating their silly old fruit anyway  but life would be a lot less fun if they didn t .  and there never was an apple  in adam s opinion  that wasn t worth the trouble you got into for eating it .          if you want to imagine the future  imagine a boy and his dog and his friends .  and a summer that never ends .   and if you want to imagine the future  imagine a boot    no  imagine a sneaker  laces trailing  kicking a pebble  imagine a stick  to poke at interesting things  and throw for a dog that may or may not decide to retrieve it  imagine a tuneless whistle  pounding some luckless popular song into insensibility  imagine a figure  half angel  half devil  all human     slouching hopefully towards tadfield        forever .
