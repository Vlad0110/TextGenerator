terry pratchett      witches abroad   a novel of discworld        dedicated to all those people   and why  not .    who  after the publication of  wyrd sisters  deluged the author with  their version of the words of     the hedgehog song .      deary deary me         contents   begin reading    about the author    praise    other books by terry pratchett    copyright    about the publisher      begin reading     this is the discworld  which travels through space on the back of four elephants which themselves stand on the shell of great a   tuin  the sky turtle .   once upon a time such a universe was considered unusual and  possibly  impossible .   but then   it used to be so simple  once upon a time .   because the universe was full of ignorance all around and the scientist panned through it like a prospector crouched over a mountain stream  looking for the gold of knowledge among the gravel of unreason  the sand of uncertainty and the little whiskery eight legged swimming things of superstition .   occasionally he would straighten up and say things like    hurrah  i   ve discovered boyle   s third law .     and everyone knew where they stood .  but the trouble was that ignorance became more interesting  especially big fascinating ignorance about huge and important things like matter and creation  and people stopped patiently building their little houses of rational sticks in the chaos of the universe and started getting interested in the chaos itself   partly because it was a lot easier to be an expert on chaos  but mostly because it made really good patterns that you could put on a t shirt .   and instead of getting on with proper science  scientists suddenly went around saying how impossible it was to know anything  and that there wasn   t really anything you could call reality to know anything about  and how all this was tremendously exciting  and incidentally did you know there were possibly all these little universes all over the place but no one can see them because they are all curved in on themselves .  incidentally  don   t you think this is a rather good t shirt .   compared to all this  a large turtle with a world on its back is practically mundane .  at least it doesn   t pretend it doesn   t exist  and no one on the discworld ever tried to prove it didn   t exist in case they turned out to be right and found themselves suddenly floating in empty space .  this is because the discworld exists right on the edge of reality .  the least little things can break through to the other side .  so  on the discworld  people take things seriously .   like stories .   because stories are important .   people think that stories are shaped by people .  in fact  it   s the other way around .   stories exist independently of their players .  if you know that  the knowledge is power .   stories  great flapping ribbons of shaped space time  have been blowing and uncoiling around the universe since the beginning of time .  and they have evolved .  the weakest have died and the strongest have survived and they have grown fat on the retelling   stories  twisting and blowing through the darkness .   and their very existence overlays a faint but insistent pattern on the chaos that is history .  stories etch grooves deep enough for people to follow in the same way that water follows certain paths down a mountainside .  and every time fresh actors tread the path of the story  the groove runs deeper .   this is called the theory of narrative causality and it means that a story  once started  takes a shape .  it picks up all the vibrations of all the other workings of that story that have ever been .   this is why history keeps on repeating all the time .   so a thousand heroes have stolen fire from the gods .  a thousand wolves have eaten grandmother  a thousand princesses have been kissed .  a million unknowing actors have moved  unknowing  through the pathways of story .   it is now impossible for the third and youngest son of any king  if he should embark on a quest which has so far claimed his older brothers  not to succeed .   stories don   t care who takes part in them .  all that matters is that the story gets told  that the story repeats .  or  if you prefer to think of it like this  stories are a parasitical life form  warping lives in the service only of the story itself .    it takes a special kind of person to fight back  and become the bicarbonate of history .   once upon a time       gray hands gripped the hammer and swung it  striking the post so hard that it sank a foot into the soft earth .   two more blows and it was fixed immovably .   from the trees around the clearing the snakes and birds watched silently .  in the swamp the alligators drifted like patches of bad assed water .   gray hands took up the crosspiece and fixed it in place  tying it with creepers  pulling them so tight that they creaked .   she watched him .  and then she took up a fragment of mirror and tied it to the top of the post .      the coat     she said .   he took up the coat and fitted it over the crosspiece .  the pole wasn   t long enough  so that the last few inches of sleeve draped emptily .      and the hat     she said .   it was tall  and round  and black .  it glistened .   the piece of mirror gleamed between the darkness of the hat and the coat .      will it work .     he said .       yes     she said .     even mirrors have their reflection .  we got to fight mirrors with mirrors .     she glared up through the trees to a slim white tower in the distance .     we   ve got to find her reflection .         it   ll have to reach out a long way  then .         yes .  we need all the help we can get .      she looked around the clearing .   she had called upon mister safe way  lady bon anna  hotaloga andrews and stride wide man .  they probably weren   t very good gods .   but they were the best she   d been able to make .     this is a story about stories .   or what it really means to be a fairy godmother .   but it   s also  particularly  about reflections and mirrors .   all across the multiverse there are backward tribes  who distrust mirrors and images because  they say  they steal a bit of a person   s soul and there   s only so much of a person to go around .  and the people who wear more clothes say this is just superstition  despite the fact that other people who spend their lives appearing in images of one sort or another seem to develop a thin quality .  it   s put down to over work and  tellingly  over exposure instead .   just superstition .  but a superstition doesn   t have to be wrong .   a mirror can suck up a piece of soul .  a mirror can contain the reflection of the whole universe  a whole skyful of stars in a piece of silvered glass no thicker than a breath .   know about mirrors and you nearly know everything .   look into the mirror        further        to an orange light on a cold mountaintop  thousands of miles from the vegetable warmth of that swamp       local people called it the bear mountain .  this was because it was a bare mountain  not because it had a lot of bears on it .  this caused a certain amount of profitable confusion  though  people often strode into the nearest village with heavy duty crossbows  traps and nets and called haughtily for native guides to lead them to the bears .  since everyone locally was making quite a good living out of this  what with the sale of guide books  maps of bear caves  ornamental cuckoo clocks with bears on them  bear walking sticks and cakes baked in the shape of a bear  somehow no one had time to go and correct the spelling .    it was about as bare as a mountain could be .   most of the trees gave out about halfway to the top  only a few pines hanging on to give an effect very similar to the couple of pathetic strands teased across his scalp by a baldie who won   t own up .   it was a place where witches met .   tonight a fire gleamed on the very crest of the hill .  dark figures moved in the flickering light .   the moon coasted across a lacework of clouds .   finally  a tall  pointy hatted figure said     you mean everyone brought potato salad .        there was one ramtop witch who was not attending the sabbat .  witches like a night out as much as anyone else but  in this case  she had a more pressing appointment .  and it wasn   t the kind of appointment you can put off easily .   desiderata hollow was making her will .   when desiderata hollow was a girl  her grandmother had given her four important pieces of advice to guide her young footsteps on the unexpectedly twisting pathway of life .   they were   never trust a dog with orange eyebrows   always get the young man   s name and address   never get between two mirrors   and always wear completely clean underwear every day because you never knew when you were going to be knocked down and killed by a runaway horse and if people found you had unsatisfactory underwear on  you   d die of shame .   and then desiderata grew up to become a witch .  and one of the minor benefits of being a witch is that you know exactly when you   re going to die and can wear what underwear you like .    that had been eighty years earlier  when the idea of knowing exactly when you were going to die had seemed quite attractive because secretly  of course  you knew you were going to live forever .   that was then .   and this was now .   forever didn   t seem to last as long these days as once it did .   another log crumbled to ash in the fireplace .  desiderata hadn   t bothered to order any fuel for the winter .  not much point  really .   and then  of course  there was this other thing     she   d wrapped it up carefully into a long  slim package .  now she folded up the letter  addressed it  and pushed it under the string .  job done .   she looked up .  desiderata had been blind for thirty years  but this hadn   t been a problem .  she   d always been blessed  if that was the word  with second sight .  so when the ordinary eyes gave out you just trained yourself to see into the present  which anyway was easier than the future .  and since the eyeball of the occult didn   t depend on light  you saved on candles .  there was always a silver lining  if you knew where to look .  in a manner of speaking .   there was a mirror on the wall in front of her .   the face in it was not her own  which was round and pink .   it was the face of a woman who was used to giving orders .  desiderata wasn   t the sort to give orders .  quite the reverse  in fact .   the woman said     you are dying  desiderata .         i am that  too .         you   ve grown old .  your sort always do .  your power is nearly gone .         that   s a fact  lilith     said desiderata mildly .      so your protection is withdrawing from her .            fraid so     said desiderata .      so now it   s just me and the evil swamp woman .  and i will win .         that   s how it seems  i   m afraid .         you should have found a successor .         never had the time .  i   m not the planning sort  you know .      the face in the mirror got closer  as if the figure had moved a little nearer to its side of the mirror .      you   ve lost  desiderata hollow .         so it goes .     desiderata got to her feet  a little unsteadily  and picked up a cloth .   the figure seemed to be getting angry .  it clearly felt that people who had lost ought to look downcast  and not as if they were enjoying a joke at your expense .      don   t you understand what losing means .         some people are very clear about that     said desiderata .     goodbye  m   lady .     she hung the cloth over the mirror .   there was an angry intake of breath  and then silence .   desiderata stood as if lost in thought .   then she raised her head  and said     kettle boiled just now .  would you like a cup of tea .      no  thank you  said a voice right behind her .      how long have you been waiting .      forever .      not keeping you  am i .      it   s a quiet night .      i   m making a cup of tea .  i think there   s one biscuit left .      no  thank you .      if you feel peckish  it   s in the jar on the mantelpiece .  that   s genuine klatchian pottery  you know .  made by a genuine klatchian craftsman .  from klatch     she added .   indeed .      i used to get about a lot in my younger days .      yes .      great times .     desiderata poked the fire .     it was the job  you see .  of course  i expect it   s very much the same for you .      yes .      i never knew when i was going to be called out .  well  of course you   d know about that  wouldn   t you .  kitchens  mainly .  it always seemed to be kitchens .  balls sometimes  but generally it was kitchens .     she picked up the kettle and poured the boiling water into the teapot on the hearth .   indeed .      i used to grant their wishes .      death looked puzzled .   what .  you mean like   fitted cupboards .  new sinks .  that kind of thing .      no  no .  the people .     desiderata sighed .     it   s a big responsibility  fairy godmothering .  knowing when to stop  i mean .  people whose wishes get granted often don   t turn out to be very nice people .  so should you give them what they want   or what they need .      death nodded politely .  from his point of view  people got what they were given .      like this genua thing       desiderata began .   death looked up sharply .   genua .      you know it .  well  of course you would .      i   know everywhere  of course .   desiderata   s expression softened .  her inner eyes were looking elsewhere .      there were two of us .  godmothers go in twos  you know .  me and lady lilith .  there   s a lot of power in godmothering .  it   s like being part of history .  anyway  the girl was born  out of wedlock but none the worse for that  it wasn   t as if they couldn   t have married  they just never got around to it   and lilith wished for her to have beauty and power and marry a prince .  hah .  and she   s been working on that ever since .  what could i do .  you can   t argue with wishes like that .  lilith knows the power of a story .  i   ve done the best i could  but lilith   s got the power .  i hear she runs the city now .  changing a whole country just to make a story work .  and now it   s too late anyway .  for me .  so i   m handing on the responsibility .  that   s how it goes  with fairy godmothering .  no one ever wants to be a fairy godmother .  except lilith  of course .  got a bee in her bonnet about it .  so i   m sending someone else .  i may have left things too late .      desiderata was a kindly soul .  fairy godmothers develop a very deep understanding about human nature  which makes the good ones kind and the bad ones powerful .  she was not someone to use extreme language  but it was possible to be sure that when she deployed a mild term like    a bee in her bonnet    she was using it to define someone whom she believed to be several miles over the madness horizon and accelerating .   she poured out the tea .      that   s the trouble with second sight     she said .      you can see what   s happenin     but you don   t know what it means .  i   ve seen the future .  there   s a coach made out of a pumpkin .  and that   s impossible .  and there   s coachmen made out of mice  which is unlikely .  and there   s a clock striking midnight  and something about a glass slipper .  and it   s all going to happen .  because that   s how stories have to work .  and then i thought  i know some people who make stories work their way .      she sighed again .     wish i was going to genua     she said .     i could do with the warmth .  and it   s fat tuesday coming up .  always went to genua for fat tuesday in the old days .      there was an expectant silence .   then death said  you surely are not asking me to grant a wish .      hah .  no one grants a fairy godmother   s wishes .     desiderata had that inward look again  her voice talking to herself .     see .  i got to get the three of them to genua .  got to get    em there because i   ve seen    em there .  got to be all three .  and that ain   t easy  with people like them .  got to use headology .  got to make    em send    emselves .  tell esme weatherwax she   s got to go somewhere and she won   t go out of contrariness  so tell her she   s not to go and she   ll run there over broken glass . that   s the thing about the weatherwaxes  see .  they don   t know how to be beaten .      something seemed to strike her as funny .      but one of    em   s going to have to learn .      death said nothing .  from where he sat  desiderata reflected  losing was something that everyone learned .   she drained her tea .  then she stood up  put on her pointy hat with a certain amount of ceremony  and hobbled out of the back door .   there was a deep trench dug under the trees a little way from the house  down into which someone had thoughtfully put a short ladder .  she climbed in and  with some difficulty  heaved the ladder onto the leaves .  then she lay down .  she sat up .      mr .  chert the troll down at the sawmill does a very good deal on coffins  if you don   t mind pine .      i shall definitely bear it in mind .      i got hurker the poacher to dig the hole out for me     she said  conversationally     and he   s goin    to come along and fill it in on his way home .  i believe in being neat .  take it away  maestro .      what .  oh .  a figure of speech .   he raised his scythe .   desiderata hollow went to her rest .      well     she said     that was easy .  what happens now .        and this is genua .  the magical kingdom .  the diamond city .  the fortunate country .   in the center of the city a woman stood between two mirrors  watching herself reflected all the way to infinity .   the mirrors were themselves in the center of an octagon of mirrors  open to the sky on the highest tower of the palace .  there were so many reflections  in fact  that it was only with extreme difficulty that you could tell where the mirrors ended and the real person began .   her name was lady lilith de tempscire  although she had answered to many others in the course of a long and eventful life .  and that was something you learned to do early on  she   d found .  if you wanted to get anywhere in this world   and she   d decided  right at the start  that she wanted to get as far as it was possible to go   you wore names lightly  and you took power anywhere you found it .  she had buried three husbands  and at least two of them had been already dead .   and you moved around a lot .  because most people didn   t move around much .  change countries and your name and  if you had the right manner  the world was your mollusc .  for example  she   d had to go a mere hundred miles to become a lady .   she   d go to any lengths now     the two main mirrors were set almost  but not quite  facing one another  so that lilith could see over her shoulder and watch her images curve away around the universe inside the mirror .   she could feel herself pouring into herself  multiplying itself via the endless reflections .   when lilith sighed and strode out from the space between the mirrors the effect was startling .  images of lilith hung in the air behind her for a moment  like three dimensional shadows  before fading .   so   desiderata was dying .  interfering old baggage .  she deserved death .  she   d never understood the kind of power she   d had .  she was one of those people afraid to do good for fear of doing harm  who took it all so seriously that they   d constipate themselves with moral anguish before granting the wish of a single ant .   lilith looked down and out over the city .  well  there were no barriers now .  the stupid voodoo woman in the swamp was a mere distraction  with no understanding .   nothing stood in the way of what lilith liked more than anything else .   a happy ending .     up on the mountain  the sabbat had settled down a bit .   artists and writers have always had a rather exaggerated idea about what goes on at a witches    sabbat .  this comes from spending too much time in small rooms with the curtains drawn  instead of getting out in the healthy fresh air .   for example  there   s the dancing around naked .  in the average temperate climate there are very few nights when anyone would dance around at midnight with no clothes on  quite apart from the question of stones  thistles  and sudden hedgehogs .   then there   s all that business with goat headed gods .  most witches don   t believe in gods .  they know that the gods exist  of course .  they even deal with them occasionally .  but they don   t believe in them .  they know them too well .  it would be like believing in the postman .   and there   s the food and drink   the bits of reptile and so on .  in fact  witches don   t go for that sort of thing .  the worst you can say about the eating habits of the older type of witch is that they tend to like ginger biscuits dipped in tea with so much sugar in it that the spoon won   t move and will drink it out of the saucer if they think it   s too hot .  and do so with appreciative noises more generally associated with the cheaper type of plumbing system .  legs of toad and so on might be better than this .   then there   s the mystic ointments .  by sheer luck  the artists and writers are on firmer ground here .  most witches are elderly  which is when ointments start to have an attraction  and at least two of those present tonight were wearing granny weatherwax   s famous goose grease and sage chest liniment .  this didn   t make you fly and see visions  but it did prevent colds  if only because the distressing smell that developed around about the second week kept everyone else so far away you couldn   t catch anything from them .   and finally there   s sabbats themselves .  your average witch is not  by nature  a social animal as far as other witches are concerned .  there   s a conflict of dominant personalities .  there   s a group of ringleaders without a ring .  there   s the basic unwritten rule of witchcraft  which is    don   t do what you will  do what i say .     the natural size of a coven is one .  witches only get together when they can   t avoid it .   like now .   the conversation  given desiderata   s absence  had naturally turned to the increasing shortage of witches .       what  no one .     said granny weatherwax .      no one     said gammer brevis .      i call that terrible     said granny .     that   s disgustin    .         eh .     said old mother dismass .      she calls it disgusting .     shouted gammer brevis .      eh .         there   s no girl to put forward .  to take desiderata   s place .         oh .      the implications of this sank in .      if anyone doesn   t want their crusts i   ll    ave    em     said nanny ogg .      we never had this sort of thing in my young days     said granny .     there was a dozen witches this side of the mountain alone .  of course  that was before all this      she made a face      making your own entertainment .  there   s far too much of this making your own entertainment these days .  we never made our own entertainment when i was a girl .  we never had time .         tempers fuggit     said nanny ogg .      what .         tempers fuggit .  means that was then and this is now     said nanny .      i don   t need no one to tell me that  gytha ogg .  i know when now is .         you got to move with the times .         i don   t see why .  don   t see why we           so i reckon we got to shift the boundaries again     said gammer brevis .      can   t do that     said granny weatherwax promptly .     i   m doing four villages already .  the broomstick hardly has time to cool down .         well  with mother hollow passing on  we   re definitely short handed     said gammer brevis .     i know she didn   t do a lot  what with her other work  but she was there .  that   s what it   s all about .  being there .  there   s got to be a local witch .      the four witches stared gloomily at the fire .  well  three of them did .  nanny ogg  who tended to look on the cheerful side  made toast .      they   ve got a wizard in  down in creel springs     said gammer brevis .     there wasn   t anyone to take over when old granny hopliss passed on  so they sent off to ankh morpork for a wizard .  an actual wizard .  with a staff .  he   s got a shop there and everything  with a brass sign on the door .  it says    wizard .         the witches sighed .      mrs .  singe passed on     said gammer brevis .     and gammer peavey passed on .         did she .  old mabel peavey .     said nanny ogg  through a shower of crumbs .     how old was she .         one hundred and nineteen     said gammer brevis .     i said to her     you don   t want to go climbing mountains at your age    but she wouldn   t listen .         some people are like that     said granny .     stubborn as mules .  tell them they mustn   t do something and they won   t stop till they   ve tried it .         i actually heard her very last words     said gammer .      what did she say .     said granny .      as i recall     oh bugger        said gammer .      it   s the way she would have wanted to go     said nanny ogg .  the other witches nodded .      you know   we could be looking at the end of witchcraft in these parts     said gammer brevis .   they stared at the fire again .      i don   t    spect anyone   s brought any marshmallows .     said nanny ogg  hopefully .   granny weatherwax looked at her sister witches .  gammer brevis she couldn   t stand  the old woman taught school on the other side of the mountain  and had a nasty habit of being reasonable when provoked .  and old mother dismass was possibly the most useless sibyl in the history of oracular revelation .  and granny really couldn   t be having at all with nanny ogg  who was her best friend .      what about young magrat .     said old mother dismass innocently .     her patch runs right alongside desiderata   s .  maybe she could take on a bit extra .      granny weatherwax and nanny ogg exchanged glances .      she   s gone funny in the head     said granny .      now  come on  esme     said nanny ogg .      well  i call it funny     said granny .     you can   t tell me that saying all that stuff about relatives isn   t going funny in the head .         she didn   t say that     said nanny .     she said she wanted to relate to herself .         that   s what i said     said granny weatherwax .     i told her  simplicity garlick was your mother  araminta garlick was your granny .  yolande garlick is your aunt and you   re your   you   re your me .      she sat back with the satisfied look of someone who has solved everything anyone could ever want to know about a personal identity crisis .      she wouldn   t listen     she added .   gammer brevis wrinkled her forehead .      magrat .     she said .  she tried to get a mental picture of the ramtops    youngest witch and recalled   well  not a face  just a slightly watery eyed expression of hopeless goodwill wedged between a body like a maypole and hair like a haystack after a gale .  a relentless doer of good works .  a worrier .  the kind of person who rescued small lost baby birds and cried when they died  which is the function kind old mother nature usually reserves for small lost baby birds .      doesn   t sound like her     she said .      and she said she wanted to be more self assertive     said granny .      nothing wrong with being self assertive     said nanny .     self asserting   s what witching   s all about .         i never said there was anything wrong with it     said granny .     i told her there was nothing wrong with it .  you can be as self assertive as you like  i said  just so long as you do what you   re told .         rub this on and it   ll clear up in a week or two     said old mother dismass .   the other three witches watched her expectantly  in case there was going to be anything else .  it became clear that there wasn   t .      and she   s running   what   s that she   s running  gytha .     said granny .      self defense classes     said nanny .      but she   s a witch     gammer brevis pointed out .      i told her that     said granny weatherwax  who had walked nightly without fear in the bandit haunted forests of the mountains all her life in the certain knowledge that the darkness held nothing more terrible than she was .     she said that wasn   t the point .  wasn   t the point .  that   s what she said .         no one goes to them  anyway     said nanny ogg .      i thought she was going to get married to the king     said gammer brevis .      everyone did     said nanny .     but you know magrat .  she tends to be open to ideas .  now she says she refuses to be a sex object .      they all thought about this .  finally gammer brevis said  slowly  in the manner of one surfacing from the depths of fascinated cogitation     but she   s never been a sex object .         i   m pleased to say i don   t even know what a sex object is     said granny weatherwax firmly .      i do     said nanny ogg .   they looked at her .      our shane brought one home from foreign parts once .      they carried on looking at her .      it was brown and fat and had beads on and a face and two holes for the string .      this didn   t seem to avert their gaze .      well  that   s what he said it was     said nanny .      i think you   re talking about a fertility idol     said gammer brevis helpfully .   granny shook her head .      doesn   t sound much like magrat to me       she began .      you can   t tell me that   s worth tuppence     said old mother dismass  from whatever moment of time she was currently occupying .   no one was ever quite sure which it was .   it was an occupational hazard for those gifted with second sight .  the human mind isn   t really designed to be sent rocketing backward and forward along the great freeway of time and can become  as it were  detached from its anchorage  seeing randomly into the past and the future and only occasionally into the present .  old mother dismass was temporally unfocused .  this meant that if you spoke to her in august she was probably listening to you in march .  it was best just to say something now and hope she   d pick it up next time her mind was passing through .   granny waved her hands experimentally in front of old mother dismass   s unseeing eyes .      she   s gone again     she said .      well  if magrat can   t take it on there   s millie hopgood from over slice way     said gammer brevis .     she   s a hard working girl .  mind you  she   s got a worse squint than magrat .         nothing wrong with that .  a squint looks good on a witch     said granny weatherwax .      but you have to know how to use it     said nanny ogg .     old gertie simmons used to have a squint and she was always putting the evil influence on the end of her own nose .  we can   t have people thinkin    that if you upset a witch she curses and mutters and then her own nose drops off .      they all stared at the fire again .      i suppose desiderata wouldn   t have chosen her own successor .     said gammer brevis .      can   t go doin    that     said granny weatherwax .     that   s not how we do things in these parts .         yes  but desiderata didn   t spend much time in these parts .  it was the job .  she was always going off to foreign parts .         i can   t be having with foreign parts     said granny weatherwax .      you   ve been to ankh morpork     said nanny mildly .     that   s foreign .         no it   s not .  it   s just a long way off .  that   s not the same as foreign .  foreign   s where they gabble at you in heathen lingo and eat foreign muck and worship  you know  objects     said granny weatherwax  goodwill diplomat .     foreign can be quite close too  if you   re not careful .  huh     she added witheringly .     yes  she could bring back just about anything from foreign parts .         she brought me back a nice blue and white plate once     said nanny ogg .      that   s a point     said gammer brevis .     someone   d better go and see to her cottage .  she had quite a lot of good stuff there .  it   d be dreadful to think of some thief getting in there and having a rummage .         can   t imagine any thief   d want to break into a witch   s       granny began  and then stopped abruptly .      yes     she said meekly .     good idea .  i   ll see to it directly .         no  i   ll see to it     said nanny ogg  who   d also had time to work something out .     it   s right on my way home .  no problem .         no  you   ll be wanting to get home early     said granny .     don   t you bother yourself .  it   d be no trouble .         oh  it won   t be any trouble at all     said nanny .      you don   t want to go tiring yourself out at your age     said granny weatherwax .   they glared at one another .      i really don   t see that it matters     said gammer brevis .     you might as well go together rather than fight about it .         i   m a bit busy tomorrow     said granny .     how about after lunch .         right     said nanny ogg .     we   ll meet at her cottage .  right after lunch .         we had one once but the bit you unscrew fell off and got lost     said old mother dismass .     hurker the poacher shovelled the last of the earth into the hole .  he felt he ought to say a few words .      well  that   s about it  then     he said .   she   d definitely been one of the better witches  he thought  as he wandered back to the cottage in the pre dawn gloom .  some of the other ones   while of course being wonderful human beings  he added to himself hurriedly  as fine a bunch of women as you could ever hope to avoid   were just a bit overpowering .  mistress hollow had been a listening kind of person .   on the kitchen table was a long package  a small pile of coins  and an envelope .   he opened the envelope  although it was not addressed to him .   inside was a smaller envelope  and a note .   the note said  i   m watching you  albert hurker .  deliver the packige and the envlope and if you dare take a peek inside something dretful will happen to you .  as a profesional good farey godmother i aint allowed to curse anyone but i predict it would probly involve bein bittern by an enraged wolf and your leg going green and runny and dropping off  dont arsk me how i know anyway you carnt because  i am dead .  all the best  desiderata .   he picked up the package with his eyes shut .     light travels slowly in the discworld   s vast magical field  which means that time does too .  as nanny ogg would put it  when it   s teatime in genua it   s tuesday over here     in fact it was dawn in genua .  lilith sat in her tower  using a mirror  sending her own image out to scan the world .  she was searching .   wherever there was a sparkle on a wave crest  wherever there was a sheet of ice  wherever there was a mirror or a reflection then lilith knew she could see out .  you didn   t need a magic mirror .  any mirror would do  if you knew how to use it .  and lilith  crackling with the power of a million images  knew that very well .   there was just a nagging doubt .  presumably desiderata would have got rid of it .  her sort were like that .  conscientious .  and presumably it would be to that stupid girl with the watery eyes who sometimes visited the cottage  the one with all the cheap jewelry and the bad taste in clothes .  she looked just the type .   but lilith wanted to be sure .  she hadn   t got where she was today without being sure .   in puddles and windows all over lancre  the face of lilith appeared momentarily and then moved on       and now it was dawn in lancre .  autumn mists rolled through the forest .   granny weatherwax pushed open the cottage door .  it wasn   t locked .  the only visitor desiderata had been expecting wasn   t the sort to be put off by locks .      she   s had herself buried around the back     said a voice behind her .  it was nanny ogg .   granny considered her next move .  to point out that nanny had deliberately come early  so as to search the cottage by herself  then raised questions about granny   s own presence .  she could undoubtedly answer them  given enough time .  on the whole  it was probably best just to get on with things .      ah     she said  nodding .     always very neat in her ways  was desiderata .         well  it was the job     said nanny ogg  pushing past her and eyeing the room   s contents speculatively .     you got to be able to keep track of things  in a job like hers .  by gor     that   s a bloody enormous cat .         it   s a lion     said granny weatherwax  looking at the stuffed head over the fireplace .      must   ve hit the wall at a hell of a speed  whatever it was     said nanny ogg .      someone killed it     said granny weatherwax  surveying the room .      should think so     said nanny .     if i   d seen something like that eatin    its way through the wall i   d of hit it myself with the poker .      there was of course no such thing as a typical witch   s cottage  but if there was such a thing as a nontypical witch   s cottage  then this was certainly it .  apart from various glassy eyed animal heads  the walls were covered in bookshelves and watercolor pictures .  there was a spear in the umbrella stand .  instead of the more usual earthenware and china on the dresser there were foreign looking brass pots and fine blue porcelain .  there wasn   t a dried herb anywhere in the place but there were a great many books  most of them filled with desiderata   s small  neat handwriting .  a whole table was covered with what were probably maps  meticulously drawn .   granny weatherwax didn   t like maps .  she felt instinctively that they sold the landscape short .      she certainly got about a bit     said nanny ogg  picking up a carved ivory fan and flirting coquettishly .       well  it was easy for her     said granny  opening a few drawers .  she ran her fingers along the top of the mantelpiece and looked at them critically .      she could have found time to go over the place with a duster     she said vaguely .     i wouldn   t go and die and leave my place in this state .         i wonder where she left   you know   it .     said nanny  opening the door of the grandfather clock and peering inside .      shame on you  gytha ogg     said granny .     we   re not here to look for that .         of course not .  i was just wondering       nanny ogg tried to stand on tiptoe surreptitiously  in order to see on top of the dresser .      gytha .  for shame .  go and make us a cup of tea .         oh  all right .      nanny ogg disappeared  muttering  into the scullery .  after a few seconds there came the creaking of a pump handle .   granny weatherwax sidled toward a chair and felt quickly under the cushion .   there was a clatter from the next room .  she straightened up hurriedly .      i shouldn   t think it   d be under the sink  neither     she shouted .   nanny ogg   s reply was inaudible .   granny waited a moment  and then crept rapidly over to the big chimney .  she reached up and felt cautiously around .      looking for something  esme .     said nanny ogg behind her .      the soot up here is terrible     said granny  standing up quickly .     terrible soot there is .         it   s not up there  then .     said nanny ogg sweetly .      don   t know what you   re talking about .         you don   t have to pretend .  everyone knows she must have had one     said nanny ogg .     it goes with the job .  it practic   ly is the job .         well   maybe i just wanted a look at it     granny admitted .     just hold it a while .  not use it .  you wouldn   t catch me using one of those things .  i only ever saw it once or twice .  there ain   t many of    em around these days .      nanny ogg nodded .     you can   t get the wood     she said .      you don   t think she   s been buried with it  do you .         shouldn   t think so .  i wouldn   t want to be buried with it .  thing like that  it   s a bit of a responsibility .  anyway  it wouldn   t stay buried .  a thing like that wants to be used .  it   d be rattling around your coffin the whole time .  you know the trouble they are .      she relaxed a bit .     i   ll sort out the tea things     she said .     you light the fire .      she wandered back into the scullery .   granny weatherwax reached along the mantelpiece for the matches  and then realized that there wouldn   t be any .  desiderata had always said she was much too busy not to use magic around the house .  even her laundry did itself .   granny disapproved of magic for domestic purposes  but she was annoyed .  she also wanted her tea .   she threw a couple of logs into the fireplace and glared at them until they burst into flame out of sheer embarrassment .   it was then that her eye was caught by the shrouded mirror .      coverin    it over .     she murmured .     i didn   t know old desiderata was frightened of thunderstorms .      she twitched aside the cloth .   she stared .   very few people in the world had more self control than granny weatherwax .  it was as rigid as a bar of cast iron .  and about as flexible .   she smashed the mirror .     lilith sat bolt upright in her tower of mirrors .   her .   the face was different  of course .  older .  it had been a long time .  but eyes don   t change  and witches always look at the eyes .   her .     magrat garlick  witch  was also standing in front of a mirror .  in her case it was totally unmagical .  it was also still in one piece  but there had been one or two close calls .   she frowned at her reflection  and then consulted the small  cheaply woodcut leaflet that had arrived the previous day .   she mouthed a few words under her breath  straightened up  extended her hands in front of her  punched the air vigorously and said     haaaaiiiii eeeeeeehgh .  um .      magrat would be the first to admit that she had an open mind .  it was as open as a field  as open as the sky .  no mind could be more open without special surgical implements .  and she was always waiting for something to fill it up .   what it was currently filling up with was the search for inner peace and cosmic harmony and the true essence of being .   when people say    an idea came to me    it isn   t just a metaphor .  raw inspirations  tiny particles of self contained thought  are sleeting through the cosmos all the time .  they get drawn to heads like magrat   s in the same way that water runs into a hole in the desert .   it was all due to her mother   s lack of attention to spelling  she speculated .  a caring parent would have spelled margaret correctly .  and then she could have been a peggy  or a maggie   big  robust names  full of reliability .  there wasn   t much you could do with a magrat .  it sounded like something that lived in a hole in a river bank and was always getting flooded out .   she considered changing it  but knew in her secret heart that this would not work .  even if she became a chloe or an isobel on top she   d still be a magrat underneath .  but it would be nice to try .  it   d be nice not to be a magrat  even for a few hours .   it   s thoughts like this that start people on the road to finding themselves .  and one of the earliest things magrat had learned was that anyone finding themselves would be unwise to tell granny weatherwax  who thought that female emancipation was a women   s complaint that shouldn   t be discussed in front of men .   nanny ogg was more sympathetic but had a tendency to come out with what magrat thought of as double intenders  although in nanny ogg   s case they were generally single entendres and proud of it .   in short  magrat had despaired of learning anything at all from her senior witches  and was casting her net further afield .  much further afield .  about as far afield as a field could be .   it   s a strange thing about determined seekers after wisdom that  no matter where they happen to be  they   ll always seek that wisdom which is a long way off .  wisdom is one of the few things that looks bigger the further away it is .    currently magrat was finding herself through the path of the scorpion  which offered cosmic harmony  inner one ness and the possibility of knocking an attacker   s kidneys out through his ears .  she   d sent off for it .   there were problems .  the author  grand master lobsang dibbler  had an address in ankh morpork .  this did not seem like a likely seat of cosmic wisdom .  also  although he   d put in lots of stuff about the way not being used for aggression and only to be used for cosmic wisdom  this was in quite small print between enthusiastic drawings of people hitting one another with rice flails and going    hai .     later on you learned how to cut bricks in half with your hand and walk over red hot coals and other cosmic things .   magrat thought that ninja was a nice name for a girl .   she squared up to herself in the mirror again .   there was a knock at the door .  magrat went and opened it .      hai .     she said .   hurker the poacher took a step backward .  he was already rather shaken .  an angry wolf had trailed him part of the way through the forest .      um     he said .  he leaned forward  his shock changing to concern .     have you hurt your head  miss .      she looked at him in incomprehension .  then realization dawned .  she reached up and took off the headband with the chrysanthemum pattern on it  without which it is almost impossible to properly seek cosmic wisdom by twisting an opponent   s elbows through     degrees .      no     she said .     what do you want .         got a package for you     said hurker  presenting it .   it was about two feet long  and very thin .      there   s a note     said hurker helpfully .  he shuffled around as she unfolded it  and tried to read it over her shoulder .      it   s private     said magrat .      is it .     said hurker  agreeably .      yes .         i was tole you   d give me a penny for delivering it     said the poacher .  magrat found one in her purse .      money forges the chains which bind the laboring classes     she warned  handing it over .  hurker  who had never thought of himself as a laboring class in his life  but who was prepared to listen to almost any amount of gibberish in exchange for a penny  nodded innocently .      and i hope your head gets better  miss     he said .   when magrat was left alone in her kitchen cum dojo she unwrapped the parcel .  it contained one slim white rod .   she looked at the note again .  it said     i niver had time to trane a replaysment so youll have to do .  you must goe to the city of genua .  i would of done thys myself only cannot by reason of bein dead .  ella saturday muste notte marry the prins .  ps this is importent .      she looked at her reflection in the mirror .   she looked down at the note again .      psps tell those   olde biddys they are notte to come with youe  they will onlie ruine everythin .      there was more .      pspsps it has tendincy to resett to pumpkins but you will gett the hange of it in noe time .      magrat looked at the mirror again .  and then down at the wand .   one minute life is simple  and then suddenly it stretches away full of complications .      oh  my     she said .     i   m a fairy godmother .        granny weatherwax was still standing staring at the crazily webbed fragments when nanny ogg ran in .      esme weatherwax  what have you done .  that   s bad luck  that is   esme .         her .  her .         are you all right .      granny weatherwax screwed up her eyes for a moment  and then shook her head as if trying to dislodge an unthinkable thought .      what .         you   ve gone all pale .  never seen you go all pale like that before .      granny slowly removed a fragment of glass from her hat .      well   bit of a turn  the glass breaking like that       she mumbled .   nanny looked at granny weatherwax   s hand .  it was bleeding .  then she looked at granny weatherwax   s face  and decided that she   d never admit that she   d looked at granny weatherwax   s hand .      could be a sign     she said  randomly selecting a safe topic .     once someone dies  you get that sort of thing .  pictures fallin    off walls  clocks stopping   great big wardrobes falling down the stairs   that sort of thing .         i   ve never believed in that stuff  it   s   what do you mean  wardrobes falling down the stairs .     said granny .  she was breathing deeply .  if it wasn   t well known that granny weatherwax was tough  anyone might have thought she had just had the shock of her life and was practically desperate to take part in a bit of ordinary everyday bickering .      that   s what happened after my great aunt sophie died     said nanny ogg .     three days and four hours and six minutes to the very minute after she died  her wardrobe fell down the stairs .  our darren and our jason were trying to get it around the bend and it sort of slipped  just like that .  uncanny .  weeell  i wasn   t going to leave it there for her agatha  was i  only ever visited her mum on hogswatchday  and it was me that nursed sophie all the way through to the end        granny let the familiar  soothing litany of nanny ogg   s family feud wash over her as she groped for the teacups .   the oggs were what is known as an extended family   in fact not only extended but elongated  protracted and persistent .  no normal sheet of paper could possibly trace their family tree  which in any case was more like a mangrove thicket .  and every single branch had a low key  chronic vendetta against every other branch  based on such well established causes c  l  bres as what their kevin said about our stan at cousin di   s wedding and who got the silver cutlery that auntie em promised our doreen was to have after she died  i   d like to know  thank you very much  if you don   t mind .   nanny ogg  as undisputed matriarch  encouraged all sides indiscriminately .  it was the nearest thing she had to a hobby .   the oggs contained  in just one family  enough feuds to keep an entire ozark of normal hillbillies going for a century .   and sometimes this encouraged a foolish outsider to join in and perhaps make an uncomplimentary remark about one ogg to another ogg .  whereupon every single ogg would turn on him  every part of the family closing up together like the parts of a well oiled  blue steeled engine to deal instant merciless destruction to the interloper .   ramtop people believed that the ogg feud was a blessing .  the thought of them turning their immense energy on the world in general was a terrible one .  fortunately  there was no one an ogg would rather fight than another ogg .  it was family .   odd things  families  when you came to think of it        esme .  you all right .         what .         you   ve got them cups rattling like nobody   s business .  and tea all over the tray .      granny looked down blankly at the mess  and rallied as best she could .      not my damn fault if the damn cups are too small     she muttered .   the door opened .      morning  magrat     she added  without looking around .     what   re you doing here .      it was something about the way the hinges creaked .  magrat could even open a door apologetically .   the younger witch sidled speechlessly into the room  face beetroot red  arms held behind her back .      we   d just popped in to sort out desiderata   s things  as our duty to a sister witch     said granny loudly .      and not to look for her magic wand     said nanny .      gytha ogg .      nanny ogg looked momentarily guilty  and then hung her head .      sorry  esme .      magrat brought her arms around in front of her .      er     she said  and blushed further .      you found it .     said nanny .      uh  no     said magrat  not daring to look granny in the eyes .     desiderata gave it to   me .      the silence crackled and hummed .      she gave it to you .     said granny weatherwax .      uh .  yes .      nanny and granny looked at one another .      well .     said nanny .      she does know you  doesn   t she .     demanded granny  turning back to magrat .      i used to come over here quite often to look at her books     magrat confessed .     and   and she liked to cook foreign food and no one else around here would eat it  so i   d come up to keep her company .         ah ha .  curryin    favor .     snapped granny .      but i never thought she   d leave me the wand     said magrat .     really i didn   t .         there   s probably some mistake     said nanny ogg kindly .     she probably wanted you to give it to one of us .         that   ll be it  right enough     said granny .     she knew you were good at running errands and so on .  let   s have a look at it .      she held out her hand .   magrat   s knuckles tightened on the wand .         she gave it me       she said  in a tiny voice .      her mind was definitely wandering toward the end     said granny .         she gave it me           fairy godmotherin   s a terrible responsibility     said nanny .     you got to be resourceful and flexible and tactful and able to deal with complicated affairs of the heart and stuff .  desiderata would have known that .            yes  but she gave it me           magrat garlick  as senior witch i command you to give me the wand     said granny .     they cause nothing but trouble .         hold on  hold on     said nanny .     that   s going a bit far              no       said magrat .      anyway  you ain   t senior witch     said nanny .     old mother dismass is older   n you .         shut up .  anyway  she   s non compost mental     said granny .         you can   t order me .  witches are non hierarchical       said magrat .      that is wanton behavior  magrat garlick .         no it   s not     said nanny ogg  trying to keep the peace .     wanton behavior is where you go around without wearing any        she stopped .  both of the older witches watched a small piece of paper fall out of magrat   s sleeve and zigzag down to the floor .  granny darted forward and snatched it up .      aha .     she said triumphantly .     let   s see what desiderata really said        her lips moved as she read the note .  magrat tried to wind herself up tighter .   a couple of muscles flickered on granny   s face .  then  calmly  she screwed up the note .      just as i thought     she said     desiderata says we are to give magrat all the help we can  what with her being young and everything .  didn   t she  magrat .      magrat looked up into granny   s face .   you could call her out  she thought .  the note was very clear   well  the bit about the older witches was  anyway   and you could make her read it aloud .  it   s as plain as day .  do you want to be third witch forever .  and then the flame of rebellion  burning in a very unfamiliar hearth  died .      yes     she muttered hopelessly     something like that .         it says it   s very important we go to some place somewhere to help someone marry a prince     said granny .      it   s genua     said magrat .     i looked it up in desiderata   s books .  and we   ve got to make sure she doesn   t marry a prince .         a fairy godmother stopping a girl from marryin    a prince .     said nanny .     sounds a bit   contrary .         should be an easy enough wish to grant  anyway     said granny .     millions of girls don   t marry a prince .      magrat made an effort .      genua really is a long way away     she said .      i should    ope so     said granny weatherwax .     the last thing we want is foreign parts up close .         i mean  there   ll be a lot of traveling     said magrat wretchedly .     and you   re   not as young as you were .      there was a long  crowded silence .      we start tomorrow     said granny weatherwax firmly .      look     said magrat desperately     why don   t i go by myself .            cos you ain   t experienced at fairy godmothering     said granny weatherwax .   this was too much even for magrat   s generous soul .      well  nor are you     she said .      that   s true     granny conceded .     but the point is   the point is   the point is we   ve not been experienced for a lot longer than you .         we   ve got a lot of experience of not having any experience     said nanny ogg happily .      that   s what counts every time     said granny .   there was only one small  speckled mirror in granny   s house .  when she got home  she buried it at the bottom of the garden .      there     she said .     now trying spyin    on me .        it never seemed possible to people that jason ogg  master blacksmith and farrier  was nanny ogg   s son .  he didn   t look as if he could possibly have been born  but as if he must have been constructed .  in a shipyard .  to his essentially slow and gentle nature genetics had seen fit to add muscles that should have gone to a couple of bullocks  arms like treetrunks  and legs like four beer barrels stacked in twos .   to his glowing forge were brought the stud stallions  the red eyed and foam flecked kings of the horse nation  the soup plate hoofed beasts that had kicked lesser men through walls .  but jason ogg knew the secret of the mystic horseman   s word  and he would go alone into the forge  politely shut the door  and lead the creature out again after half an hour  newly shod and strangely docile .    behind his huge brooding shape clustered the rest of nanny ogg   s endless family and a lot of other townsfolk who  seeing some interesting activity involving witches  couldn   t resist the opportunity for what was known in the ramtops as a good oggle .      we   m off then  our jason     said nanny ogg .     they do say the streets in foreign parts are paved with gold .  i could prob   ly make my fortune  eh .      jason   s hairy brow creased in intense thought .      us could do with a new anvil down forge     he volunteered .      if i come back rich  you won   t never have to go down the forge ever again     said nanny .   jason frowned .      but i likes t   forge     he said  slowly .   nanny looked momentarily taken aback .     well  then   then you shall have an anvil made of solid silver .         wunt be no good  ma .  it   d be too soft     said jason .      if i brings you back an anvil made of solid silver you shall have an anvil made of solid silver  my lad  whether you likes it or not .      jason hung his huge head .     yes  mum     he said .      you see to it that someone comes in to keep the house aired every day reg   lar     said nanny .     i want a fire lit in that grate every morning .         yes  mum .         and everyone   s to go in through the back door  you hear .  i   ve put a curse on the front porch .  where   s those girls got to with my luggage .     she scurried off  a small gray bantam scolding a flock of hens .   magrat listened to all this with interest .  her own preparations had consisted of a large sack containing several changes of clothes to accommodate whatever weather foreign parts might suffer from  and a rather smaller one containing a number of useful looking books from desiderata hollow   s cottage .  desiderata had been a great note taker  and had filled dozens of little books with neat writing and chapter headings like    with wand and broomstick across the great nef desert .      what she had never bothered to do  it seemed  was write down any instructions for the wand .  as far as magrat knew  you waved it and wished .   along the track to her cottage  several unanticipated pumpkins bore witness to this as an unreliable strategy .  one of them still thought it was a stoat .   now magrat was left alone with jason  who shuffled his feet .   he touched his forelock .  he   d been brought up to be respectful to women  and magrat fell broadly into this category .      you will look after our mum  won   t you  mistress garlick .     he said  a hint of worry in his voice .     she   m acting awful strange .      magrat patted him gently on the shoulder .      this sort of thing happens all the time     she said .     you know  after a woman   s raised a family and so on  she wants to start living her own life .         whose life she bin living  then .      magrat gave him a puzzled look .  she hadn   t questioned the wisdom of the thought when it had first arrived in her head .      you see  what it is     she said  making an explanation up as she went along     there comes a time in a woman   s life when she wants to find herself .         why dint she start looking here .     said jason plaintively .     i mean  i ain   t wanting to talk out of turn  miss garlick  but we was looking to you to persuade her and mistress weatherwax not to go .         i tried     said magrat .     i really did .  i said  you don   t want to go  i said .  anno domini  i said .  not as young as you used to be  i said .  silly to go hundreds of miles just for something like this  especially at your age .      jason put his head on one side .  jason ogg wouldn   t end up in the finals of the all discworld uptake speed trials  but he knew his own mother .      you said all that to our mum .     he said .      look  don   t worry     said magrat     i   m sure no harm can        there was a crash somewhere over their heads .  a few autumn leaves spiraled gently toward the ground .      bloody tree   who put that bloody tree there .     came a voice from on high .      that   ll be granny     said magrat .   it was one of the weak spots of granny weatherwax   s otherwise well developed character that she   d never bothered to get the hang of steering things .  it was alien to her nature .  she took the view that it was her job to move and the rest of the world to arrange itself so that she arrived at her destination .  this meant that she occasionally had to climb down trees she   d never climbed up .  this she did now  dropping the last few feet and daring anyone to comment .      well  now we   re all here     said magrat brightly .   it didn   t work .  granny weatherwax   s eyes focused immediately somewhere around magrat   s knees .      and what do you think you   re wearing .     she said .      ah .  um .  i thought   i mean it gets cold up there   what with the wind and everything     magrat began .  she had been dreading this  and hating herself for being so weak .  after all  they were practical .  the idea had come to her one night .  apart from anything else  it was almost impossible to do mr .  lobsang dibbler   s cosmic harmony death kicks when your legs kept getting tangled in a skirt .      trousers .         they   re not exactly the same as ordinary           and there   s men    ere lookin        said granny .     i think it   s shameful .         what is .     said nanny ogg  coming up behind her .      magrat garlick  standin    there bifurcated     said granny  sticking her nose in the air .      just so long as she got the young man   s name and address     said nanny ogg amiably .      nanny .     said magrat .      i think they look quite comfy     nanny went on .     a bit baggy  though .         i don   t    old with it     said granny .     everyone can see her legs .         no they can   t     said nanny .     the reason being  the material is in the way .         yes  but they can see where her legs are     said granny weatherwax .      that   s silly .  that   s like saying everyone   s naked under their clothes     said magrat .      magrat garlick  may you be forgiven     said granny weatherwax .      well  it   s true .         i   m not     said granny flatly     i got three vests on .      she looked nanny up and down .  gytha ogg  too  had made sartorial preparations for foreign parts .  granny weatherwax could find little to disapprove of  although she made an effort .      and will you look at your hat     she mumbled . nanny  who had known esme weatherwax for seventy years  merely grinned .      all the go  ain   t it .     she said .     made by mr .  vernissage over in slice .  it   s got willow reinforcing all the way up to the point and eighteen pockets inside .  can stop a blow with a hammer  this hat .  and how about these .      nanny raised the hem of her skirt .  she was wearing new boots .  as boots  granny weatherwax could find nothing to complain of in them .  they were of proper witch construction  which is to say that a loaded cart could have run over them without causing a dent in the dense leather .  as boots  the only thing wrong with them was the color .      red .     said granny .     that   s no color for a witch   s boots .         i likes    em     said nanny .   granny sniffed .     you can please yourself  i   m sure     she said .     i   m sure in foreign parts they goes in for all sorts of outlandish things .  but you know what they say about women who wear red boots .         just so long as they also say they   ve got dry feet     said nanny cheerfully .  she put her door key into jason   s hand .      i   ll write you letters if you promise to find someone to read them to you     she said .      yes  mum .  what about the cat  mum .     said jason .      oh  greebo   s coming with us     said nanny ogg .      what .  but he   s a cat .     snapped granny weatherwax .     you can   t take cats with you .  i   m not going travelin    with no cat .  it   s bad enough travelin    with trousers and provocative boots .         he   ll miss his mummy if he   s left behind  won   t he     crooned nanny ogg  picking up greebo .  he hung limply  like a bag of water gripped around the middle .   to nanny ogg greebo was still the cute little kitten that chased balls of wool around the floor .   to the rest of the world he was an enormous tomcat  a parcel of incredibly indestructible life forces in a skin that looked less like a fur than a piece of bread that had been left in a damp place for a fortnight .  strangers often took pity on him because his ears were nonexistent and his face looked as though a bear had camped on it .  they could not know that this was because greebo  as a matter of feline pride  would attempt to fight or rape absolutely anything  up to and including a four horse logging wagon .  ferocious dogs would whine and hide under the stairs when greebo sauntered down the street .  foxes kept away from the village .  wolves made a detour .      he   s an old softy really     said nanny .   greebo turned upon granny weatherwax a yellow eyed stare of self satisfied malevolence  such as cats always reserve for people who don   t like them  and purred .  greebo was possibly the only cat who could snigger in purr .      anyway     said nanny     witches are supposed to like cats .         not cats like him  they   re not .         you   re just not a cat person  esme     said nanny  cuddling greebo tightly .   jason ogg pulled magrat aside .      our sean read to me in the almanac where there   s all these fearsome wild beasts in foreign parts     he whispered .     huge hairy things that leap out on travelers  it said .  i   d hate to think what   d happen if they leapt out on mum and granny .      magrat looked up into his big red face .      you will see no harm comes to them  won   t you     said jason .      don   t you worry     she said  hoping that he needn   t .     i   ll do my best .      jason nodded .     only it said in the almanac that some of them were nearly extinct anyway     he said .     the sun was well up when the three witches spiraled into the sky .  they had been delayed for a while because of the intractability of granny weatherwax   s broomstick  the starting of which always required a great deal of galloping up and down .  it never seemed to get the message until it was being shoved through the air at a frantic running speed .  dwarf engineers everywhere had confessed themselves totally mystified by it .  they had replaced the stick and the bristles dozens of times .   when it rose  eventually  it was to a chorus of cheers .   the tiny kingdom of lancre occupied little more than a wide ledge cut into the side of the ramtop mountains .  behind it  knife edge peaks and dark winding valleys climbed into the massive backbone of the central ranges .   in front  the land dropped abruptly to the sto plains  a blue haze of woodlands  a broader expanse of ocean and  somewhere in the middle of it all  a brown smudge known as ankh morpork .   a skylark sang  or at least started to sing .  the rising point of granny weatherwax   s hat right underneath it completely put it off the rhythm .      i ain   t going any higher     she said .      if we go high enough we might be able to see where we   re going     said magrat .      you said you looked at desiderata   s maps     said granny .      it looks different from up here  though     said magrat .     more   sticking up .  but i think we go   that way .         you sure .      which was the wrong question to ask a witch .  especially if the person doing the asking was granny weatherwax .      positive     said magrat .   nanny ogg looked up at the high peaks .      there   s a lot of big mountains that way     she said .   they rose tier on tier  speckled with snow  trailing endless pennants of ice crystals high overhead .  no one ski   d in the high ramtops  at least for more than a few feet and a disappearing scream .  no one ran up them wearing dirndls and singing .  they were not nice mountains .  they were the kind of mountains where winters went for their summer holidays .      there   s passes and things through them     said magrat uncertainly .      bound to be     said nanny .     you can use two mirrors like this  if you know the way of it  you set them so that they reflect each other .  for if images can steal a bit of you  then images of images can amplify you  feeding you back on yourself  giving you power     and your image extends forever  in reflections of reflections of reflections  and every image is the same  all the way around the curve of light .   except that it isn   t .   mirrors contain infinity .   infinity contains more things than you think .   everything  for a start .   including hunger .   because there   s a million billion images and only one soul to go around .   mirrors give plenty  but they take away lots .     mountains unfolded to reveal more mountains .  clouds gathered  heavy and gray .      i   m sure we   re going the right way     said magrat .  freezing rock stretched away .  the witches flew along a maze of twisty little canyons  all alike .      yeah     said granny .      well  you won   t let me fly high enough     said magrat .      it   s going to snow like blazes in a minute     said nanny ogg .   it was early evening .  light was draining out of the high valleys like custard .      i thought   there   d be villages and things     said magrat     where we could buy interesting native produce and seek shelter in rude huts .         you wouldn   t even get trolls up here     said granny .   the three broomsticks glided down into a bare valley  a mere notch in the mountain side .      and it   s bloody cold     said nanny ogg .  she grinned .     why   re they called rude huts  anyway .      granny weatherwax climbed off her broomstick and looked at the rocks around her .  she picked up a stone and sniffed it .  she wandered over to a heap of scree that looked like any other heap of scree to magrat  and prodded it .      hmm     she said .   a few snow crystals landed on her hat .      well  well     she said .      what   re you doing  granny .     said magrat .      cogitatin    .      granny walked to the valley   s steep side and strolled along it  peering at the rock .  nanny ogg joined her .      up here .     said nanny .      i reckon .            s a bit high for    em  ain   t it .         little devils get everywhere .  had one come up in my kitchen once     said granny .     following a seam     he said .         they   re buggers for that     said nanny .      would you mind telling me     said magrat     what you   re doing .  what   s so interesting about heaps of stones .      the snow was falling faster now .      they ain   t stones  they   re spoil     said granny .  she reached a flat wall of ice covered rock  no different in magrat   s eyes from the rock available in a range of easy to die on sizes everywhere in the mountains  and paused as if listening .   then she stood back  hit the rock sharply with her broomstick  and spake thusly      open up  you little sods .      nanny ogg kicked the rock .  it made a hollow boom .      there   s people catching their death of cold out here .     she added .   nothing happened for a while .  then a section of rock swung in a few inches .  magrat saw the glint of a suspicious eye .      yes .         dwarfs .     said magrat .   granny weatherwax leaned down until her nose was level with the eye .      my name     she said     is granny weatherwax .      she straightened up again  her face glowing with self satisfaction .      who   s that  then .     said a voice from somewhere below the eye .  granny   s expression froze .   nanny ogg nudged her partner .      we must be more   n fifty miles away from home     she said .     they might not have heard of you in these parts .      granny leaned down again .  accumulated snowflakes cascaded off her hat .      i ain   t blaming you     she said     but i know you   ll have a king in there  so just you go and tell him granny weatherwax is here  will you .         he   s very busy     said the voice .     we   ve just had a bit of trouble .         then i   m sure he don   t want anymore     said granny .   the invisible speaker appeared to give this some consideration .      we put writing on the door     it said sulkily .     in invisible runes .  it   s really expensive  getting proper invisible runes done .         i don   t go around readin    doors     said granny .   the speaker hesitated .      weatherwax  did you say .         yes .  with a w .  as in    witch .         the door slammed .  when it was shut  there was barely a visible crack in the rock .   the snow was falling fast now .  granny weatherwax jiggled up and down a bit to keep warm .      that   s foreigners for you     she said  to the frozen world in general .      i don   t think you can call dwarfs foreigners     said nanny ogg .      don   t see why not     said granny .     a dwarf who lives a long way off has got to be foreign .  that   s what foreign means .         yeah .  funny to think of it like that     said nanny .   they watched the door  their breath forming three little clouds in the darkening air .  magrat peered at the stone door .      i didn   t see any invisible runes     she said .         corse not     said nanny .     that   s    cos they   re invisible .         yeah     said granny weatherwax .     don   t be daft .      the door swung open again .      i spoke to the king     said the voice .      and what did he say .     said granny expectantly .      he said     oh  no .  not on top of everything else .         granny beamed .     i knew    e would have heard of me     she said .     in the same way that there are a thousand kings of the gypsies  so there are a thousand kings of the dwarfs .  the term means something like    senior engineer .     there aren   t any queens of the dwarfs .  dwarfs are very reticent about revealing their sex  which most of them don   t consider to be very important compared to things like metallurgy and hydraulics .   this king was standing in the middle of a crowd of shouting miners .  he  looked up at the witches with the expression of a drowning man looking at a drink of water .      are you really any good .     he said .   nanny ogg and granny weatherwax looked at one another .      i think    e   s talking to you  magrat     said granny .      only we   ve had a big fall in gallery nine     said the king .     it looks bad .  a very promising vein of gold bearing quartz is irretrievably trapped .      one of the dwarfs beside him muttered something .      oh  yeah .  and some of the lads     said the king vaguely .     and then you turn up .  so the way i look at it  it   s probably fate .      granny weatherwax shook the snow off her hat and looked around .   she was impressed  despite herself .  you didn   t often see proper dwarf halls these days .  most dwarfs were off earning big money in the cities down in the lowlands  where it was much easier to be a dwarf   for one thing  you didn   t have to spend most of your time underground hitting your thumb with a hammer and worrying about fluctuations in the international metal markets .  lack of respect for tradition  that was the trouble these days .  and take trolls .  there were more trolls in ankh morpork now than in the whole mountain range .  granny weatherwax had nothing against trolls but she felt instinctively that if more trolls stopped wearing suits and walking upright  and went back to living under bridges and jumping out and eating people as nature intended  then the world would be a happier place .      you   d better show us where the problem is     she said .     lots of rocks fallen down  have they .         pardon .     said the king .   it   s often said that eskimos have fifty words for snow .    this is not true .   it   s also said that dwarfs have two hundred words for rock .   they don   t .  they have no words for rock  in the same way that fish have no words for water .  they do have words for igneous rock  sedimentary rock  metamorphic rock  rock underfoot  rock dropping on your helmet from above  and rock which looked interesting and which they could have sworn they left here yesterday .  but what they don   t have is a word meaning    rock .     show a dwarf a rock and he sees  for example  an inferior piece of crystalline sulphite of barytes .   or  in this case  about two hundred tons of lowgrade shale .  when the witches arrived at the disaster site dozens of dwarfs were working feverishly to prop the cracked roof and cart away the debris .  some of them were in tears .      it   s terrible   terrible     muttered one of them .     a terrible thing .      magrat lent him her handkerchief .  he blew his nose noisily .      could mean a big slippage on the fault line and then we   ve lost the whole seam     he said  shaking his head .  another dwarf patted him on the back .      look on the bright side     he said .     we can always drive a horizontal shaft off gallery fifteen .  we   re bound to pick it up again  don   t you worry .         excuse me     said magrat     there are dwarfs behind all that stuff  are there .         oh  yes     said the king .  his tone suggested that this was merely a regrettable side effect of the disaster  because getting fresh dwarfs was only a matter of time whereas decent gold bearing rock was a finite resource .   granny weatherwax inspected the rockfall critically .      we shall have to have everyone out of here     she said .     this is goin    to have to be private .         i know how it is     said the king .     craft secrets  i expect .         something like that     said granny .   the king shooed the other dwarfs out of the tunnel  leaving the witches alone in the lantern light .  a few bits of rock fell out of the ceiling .      hmm     said granny .      you   ve gone and done it now     said nanny ogg .      anything   s possible if you set your mind to it     said granny vaguely .      then you   d better set yours good and hard  esme .  if the creator had meant us to shift rocks by witchcraft  he wouldn   t have invented shovels .  knowing when to use a shovel is what being a witch is all about .  and put down that wheelbarrow  magrat .  you don   t know nothing about machinery .         all right  then     said magrat .     why don   t we try the wand .      granny weatherwax snorted .     hah .  here .  whoever heard of a fairy godmother in a mine .         if i was stuck behind a load of rocks under a mountain i   d want to hear of one     said magrat hotly .   nanny ogg nodded .     she   s got a point there  esme .  there   s no rule about where you fairy godmother .         i don   t trust that wand     said granny .     it looks wizardly to me .         oh  come on     said magrat     generations of fairy godmothers have used it .      granny flung her hands in the air .      all right  all right  all right     she snapped .     go ahead .  make yourself look daft .      magrat took the wand out of her bag .  she   d been dreading this moment .   it was made of some sort of bone or ivory  magrat hoped it wasn   t ivory .  there had been markings on it once  but generations of plump fairy godmotherly hands had worn them almost smooth .  various gold and silver rings were set into the wand .  nowhere were there any instructions .  not so much as a rune or a sigil anywhere on its length indicated what you were supposed to do with it .      i think you   re supposed to wave it     said nanny ogg .     i   m pretty sure it   s something like that .      granny weatherwax folded her arms .     that   s not proper witching     she said .   magrat gave the wand an experimental wave .  nothing happened .      perhaps you have to say something .     said nanny .   magrat looked panicky .      what do fairy godmothers say .     she wailed .      er     said nanny     dunno .         huh .     said granny .   nanny ogg sighed .     didn   t desiderata tell you anything .         nothing .      nanny shrugged .      just do your best  then     she said .   magrat stared at the pile of rocks .  she shut her eyes .  she took a deep breath .  she tried to make her mind a serene picture of cosmic harmony .  it was all very well for monks to go on about cosmic harmony  she reflected  when they were nicely tucked away on snowy mountains with only yetis to worry about .  they never tried seeking inner peace with granny weatherwax glaring at them .   she waved the wand in a vague way and tried to put pumpkins out of her mind .   she felt the air move .  she heard nanny gasp .   she said     has anything happened .      after a while nanny ogg said     yeah .  sort of .  i hope they   re hungry  that   s all .      and granny weatherwax said     that   s fairy godmothering  is it .      magrat opened her eyes .   there was still a heap  but it wasn   t rock anymore .      there   s a  wait for it  there   s a bit of a squash in here     said nanny .   magrat opened her eyes wider .      still pumpkins .         bit of a squash .  squash     said nanny  in case anyone hadn   t got it .   the top of the heap moved .  a couple of small pumpkins rolled down almost to magrat   s feet  and a small dwarfish face appeared in the hole .   it stared down at the witches .   eventually nanny ogg said     everything all right .      the dwarf nodded .  its attention kept turning to the pile of pumpkins that filled the tunnel from floor to ceiling .      er  yes     it said .     is dad there .         dad .         the king .         oh .     nanny ogg cupped her hands around her mouth and turned to face up the tunnel .     hey  king .      the dwarfs appeared .  they looked at the pumpkins  too .  the king stepped forward and stared up into the face of his son .      everything all right  son .         it   s all right  dad .  no faulting or anything .      the king sagged with relief .  then  as an afterthought  he added     everyone all right .         fine  dad .         i was quite worried for a time there .  thought we might have hit a section of conglomerate or something .         just a patch of loose shale  dad .         good .     the king looked at the heap again .  he scratched his beard .     can   t help noticing you seem to have struck pumpkin .         i thought it was an odd kind of sandstone  dad .      the king walked back to the witches .      can you turn anything into anything .     he said hopefully .   nanny ogg looked sideways at magrat  who was still staring at the wand in a sort of shock .      i think we only do pumpkins at the moment     she said cautiously .   the king looked a little disappointed .      well  then     he said     if there   s anything i can do for you ladies   a cup of tea or something        granny weatherwax stepped forward .     i was just thinking something like that myself     she said .   the king beamed .      only more expensive     said granny .   the king stopped beaming .   nanny ogg sidled up to magrat  who was shaking the wand and staring at it .      very clever     she whispered .     why   d you think of pumpkins .         i didn   t .         don   t you know how to work it .         no .  i thought you just had to  you know  want something to happen .         there   s probably more to it than just wishing     said nanny  as sympathetically as possible .     there generally is .        some time around dawn  in so far as dawn happened in the mines  the witches were led to a river somewhere deep in the mountains  where a couple of barges were moored .  a small boat was pulled up to a stone jetty .      this   ll take you right through the mountains     said the king .     i think it goes all the way to genua  to tell the truth .     he took a large basket off an attendant dwarf .     and we   ve packed you some lovely food     he said .      are we going to go all the way in a boat .     said magrat .  she gave the wand a few surreptitious flourishes .     i   m not good at boats .         listen     said granny  climbing aboard     the river knows its way out of the mountains  which is more than we do .  we can use the brooms later on  where the landscape   s acting a bit more sensible .         and we can have a bit of a rest     said nanny  sitting back .   magrat looked at the two older witches  who were making themselves comfortable in the stern like a couple of hens settling down on a nest .      do you know how to row a boat .     she said .      we don   t have to     said granny .   magrat nodded gloomily .  then a tiny bit of self assertion flashed a fin .      i don   t think i do  too     she ventured .      that   s all right     said nanny .     if we sees you doing anything wrong  we   ll be sure to tell you .  cheerio  your kingship .      magrat sighed  and picked up the oars .      the flat bits go in the water     said granny helpfully .   the dwarfs waved .  the boat drifted out into midstream  moving slowly in a circle of lantern light .  magrat found that all she really had to do was keep it pointing the right way in the current .   she heard nanny say     beats me why they   re always putting invisible runes on their doors .  i mean  you pays some wizard to put invisible runes on your door  and how do you know you   ve got value for money .      she heard granny say     no problem there .  if you can   t see    em  you know you   ve got proper invisible runes .      she heard nanny say     ah  that   d be it .  right  let   s see what we   ve got for lunch .     there was a rustling noise .      well  well  well .         what is it  gytha .         pumpkin .         pumpkin what .         pumpkin nothing .  just pumpkin pumpkin .         well  i suppose they   ve got a lot of pumpkin     said magrat .     you know how it is at the end of the summer  there   s always so much in the garden .  i   m always at my wits    end to think of new types of chutney and pickles to use it all up        in the dim light she could see granny   s face which seemed to be suggesting that if magrat was at her wits    end  it was a short stroll .      i     said granny     have never made a pickle in my life .         but you like pickles     said magrat .  witches and pickles went together like   she hesitated before the stomach curdling addition of peaches and cream  and mentally substituted    things that went together very well .     the sight of nanny ogg   s single remaining tooth at work on a pickled onion could bring tears to the eyes .      i likes    em fine     said granny .     i gets    em given to me .         you know     said nanny  investigating the recesses of the basket     whenever i deals with dwarfs  the phrase    duck   s arse    swims across my mind .         mean little devils .  you should see the prices they tries to charge me when i takes my broom to be repaired     said granny .      yes  but you never pay     said magrat .      that   s not the point     said granny weatherwax .     they shouldn   t be allowed to charge that sort of money .  that   s thievin     that is .         i don   t see how it can be thieving if you don   t pay anyway     magrat persisted .      i never pay for anything     said granny .     people never let me pay .  i can   t help it if people gives me things the whole time  can i .  when i walks down the street people are always running out with cakes they   ve just baked  and fresh beer  and old clothes that   ve hardly been worn at all .     oh  mistress weatherwax  pray take this basket of eggs     they say .  people are always very kind .  treat people right an    they   ll treat you right .  that   s respect .  not having to pay     she finished  sternly     is what bein    a witch is all about .         here  what   s this .     said nanny  pulling out a small packet .  she unwrapped the paper and revealed several hard brown discs .      my word     said granny weatherwax     i take it all back .  that   s the famous dwarf bread  that is .  they don   t give that to just anyone .      nanny tapped it on the edge of the boat .  it made a noise very similar to the kind of noise you get when a wooden ruler is held over the edge of a desk and plucked  a sort of hollow boioioing sound .      they say it never goes stale even if you stores it for years     said granny .      it   d keep you going for days and days     said nanny ogg .   magrat reached across  took one of the flat loaves  tried to break it  and gave up .      you   re supposed to eat it .     she said .      oh  i don   t think it   s for eating     said nanny .     it   s more for sort of              keeping you going     said granny .     they say that        she stopped .   above the noise of the river and the occasional drip of water from the ceiling they could all hear  now  the steady slosh slosh of another craft heading toward them .      someone   s following us .     hissed magrat .   two pale glows appeared at the edge of the lamplight .  eventually they turned out to be the eyes of a small gray creature  vaguely froglike  paddling toward them on a log .   it reached the boat .  long clammy fingers grabbed the side  and a lugubrious face rose level with nanny ogg   s .         ullo     it said .     it   sss my birthday .      all three of them stared at it for a while .  then granny weatherwax picked up an oar and hit it firmly over the head .  there was a splash  and a distant cursing .      horrible little bugger     said granny  as they rowed on .     looked like a troublemaker to me .         yeah     said nanny ogg .     it   s the slimy ones you have to watch out for .         i wonder what he wanted .     said magrat .     after half an hour the boat drifted out through a cave mouth and into a narrow gorge between cliffs .  ice glistened on the walls  and there were drifts of snow on some of the outcrops .   nanny ogg looked around guilelessly  and then fumbled somewhere in the depths of her many skirts and produced a small bottle .  there was a glugging noise .      i bet there   s a fine echo here     she said  after a while .      oh no you don   t     said granny firmly .      don   t what .         don   t sing that song .         pardon  esme .         i ain   t going     said granny     if you insists on singing that song .         what song would that be .     said nanny innocently .      you know the song to whom i am referring     said granny icily .     you always get drunk and let me down and sing it .         can   t recall any song like that  esme     said nanny ogg meekly .      the one     said granny     about the rodent that can   t   that can   t ever be persuaded to care about anything .         oh     said nanny  beaming as light dawned     you mean the hedgehog can never be bugg           that   s the one .         but it   s traditional     said nanny .     anyway  in foreign parts people won   t know what the words mean .         they will the way you sings them     said granny .     the way you sings them  creatures what lives on the bottoms of ponds   d know what they mean .      magrat looked over the side of the boat .  here and there the ripples were edged with white .  the current was running a bit faster  and there were lumps of ice in it .      it   s only a folk song  esme     said nanny ogg .      hah .     said granny weatherwax .     i should just say it is a folk song .  i knows all about folk songs .  hah .  you think you   re listenin    to a nice song about   about cuckoos and fiddlers and nightingales and whatnot  and then it turns out to be about   about something else entirely     she added darkly .     you can   t trust folk songs .  they always sneak up on you .      magrat fended them off a rock .  an eddy spun them around slowly .      i know one about two little bluebirds     said nanny ogg .      um     said magrat .      they may start out by being bluebirds  but i bet they ends up some kind of mettyfor     said granny .      er  granny     said magrat .      it was bad enough magrat telling me about maypoles and what   s behind    em     said granny .  she added  wistfully     i used to enjoy looking at a maypole of a spring morning .         i think the river   s getting a bit sort of rough     said magrat .      i don   t see why people can   t just let things be     said granny .      i mean really quite rough  really       said magrat  pushing them away from a jagged rock .      she   s right  you know     said nanny ogg .     it   s a bit on the choppy side .      granny looked over magrat   s shoulder at the river ahead .  it had a cut off look  such as might be associated with  for example  an imminent waterfall .  the boat was now surging along .  there was a muted roar .      they never said anything about a waterfall     she said .      i    spect they thought we   d find out for ourselves     said nanny ogg  gathering up her possessions and hauling greebo out of the bottom of the boat by the scruff of his neck .     very sparin    with information  your average dwarf .  thank goodness witches float .  anyway  they knew we   d got the brooms .         you   ve got brooms     said granny weatherwax .     how   m i supposed to get mine started in a boat .  can   t run up and down  can i .  and stop movin    about like that  you   ll have us all over           get your foot out of the way  esme        the boat rocked violently .   magrat rose to the occasion .  she pulled out the wand  just as a wavelet washed over the boat .      don   t worry     she said     i   ll use the wand .  i think i   ve got the hang of it now           no .     screamed granny weatherwax and nanny ogg together .   there was a large  damp noise .  the boat changed shape .  it also changed color .  it became a cheery sort of orange .      pumpkins .     screamed nanny ogg  as she was gently tipped into the water .     more bloody pumpkins .        lilith sat back .  the ice around the river hadn   t been that good as a mirror  but it had been good enough .   well .  a wishy washy overgrown girl more suitable to the attentions of a fairy godmother than to being one  and a little old washerwoman type who got drunk and sang songs .  and a wand the stupid girl didn   t know how to use .   it was annoying .  more than that  it was demeaning .  surely desiderata and mrs .  gogol could have achieved something better than this .  you derived status by the strength of your enemies .   of course  there was her .  after all this time     of course .  she approved of that .  because there would have to be three of them .  three was an important number for stories .  three wishes  three princes  three billy goats  three guesses   three witches .  the maiden  the mother and the   other one .  that was one of the oldest stories of all .   esme weatherwax had never understood stories .  she   d never understood how real reflections were .  if she had  she   d probably have been ruling the world by now .      you   re always looking in mirrors .     said a petulant voice .     i hate it when you   re always looking in mirrors .      the duc sprawled in a chair in one corner  all black silk and well turned legs .  lilith would not normally allow anyone inside the nest of mirrors but it was  technically  his castle .  besides  he was too vain and stupid to know what was going on .  she   d seen to that .  at least  she   d thought she had .  lately  he seemed to be picking things up        i don   t know why you have to do that     he whined .     i thought magic was just a matter of pointing and going whoosh .      lilith picked up her hat  and glanced at a mirror as she adjusted it .      this way   s safer     she said .     it   s self contained .  when you use mirror magic  you don   t have to rely on anyone except yourself .  that   s why no one   s ever conquered the world with magic   yet .  they try to take it from   other places .  and there   s always a price .  but with mirrors  you   re beholden to no one but your own soul .      she lowered the veil from the hat brim .  she preferred the privacy of a veil  outside the security of the mirrors .      i hate mirrors     muttered the duc .      that   s because they tell you the truth  my lad .         it   s cruel magic  then .      lilith tweaked the veil into a fetching shape .      oh  yes .  with mirrors  all the power is your own .  there   s nowhere else it can come from     she said .      the swamp woman gets it from the swamp     said the duc .      ha .  and it   ll claim her one day .  she doesn   t understand what she   s doing .         and you do .      she felt a pang of pride .  he was actually resenting her .  she really had done a good job there .      i understand stories     she said .     that   s all i need .         but you haven   t brought me the girl     said the duc .     you promised me the girl .  and then it   ll be all over and i can sleep in a real bed and i won   t need anymore reflecting magic        but even a good job can go too far .      you   ve had your fill of magic .     said lilith sweetly .     you   d like me to stop .  it would be the easiest thing in the world .  i found you in the gutter .  would you like me to send you back .      his face became a mask of panic .      i didn   t mean that .  i just meant   well  then everything will be real .  just one kiss  you said .  i can   t see why that   s so hard to arrange .         the right kiss at the right time     said lilith .     it has to be at the right time  otherwise it won   t work .     she smiled .  he was trembling  partly out of lust  mainly out of terror  and slightly out of heredity .      don   t worry     she said .     it can   t not happen .         and these witches you showed me .         they   re just   part of the story .  don   t worry about them .  the story will just absorb them .  and you   ll get her because of stories .  won   t that be nice .  and now   shall we go .  i expect you   ve got some ruling to do .      he picked up the inflexion .  it was an order .  he stood up  extended an arm to take hers  and together they went down to the palace   s audience chamber .   lilith was proud of the duc .  of course  there was his embarrassing little nocturnal problem  because his morphic field weakened when he slept  but that wasn   t yet a major difficulty .  and there was the trouble with mirrors  which showed him as he really was  but that was easily overcome by banning all mirrors save hers .  and then there were his eyes .  she couldn   t do anything about the eyes .  there was practically no magic that could do anything about someone   s eyes .  all she had been able to come up with there were the smoked glasses .   even so  he was a triumph .  and he was so grateful .  she   d been good for him .   she   d made a man of him  for a start .     some way downriver from the waterfall  which was the second highest anywhere on the disc and had been discovered in the year of the revolving crab by the noted explorer guy de yoyo   granny weatherwax sat in front of a small fire with a towel around her shoulders and steamed .      still  look on the bright side     said nanny ogg .     at least i was holding my broom and you at the same time .  and magrat had hers .  otherwise we   d all be looking at the waterfall from underneath .         oh  good .  a silver lining     said granny  her eyes glinting evilly .      bit of an adventure  really     said nanny  grinning encouragingly .     one day we   ll look back on this and laugh .         oh  good     said granny .   nanny dabbed at the claw marks on her arm .  greebo  with a cat   s true instinct for self preservation  had clawed his way up his mistress and taken a flying leap to safety from the top of her head .  now he was curled up by the fire  dreaming cat dreams .   a shadow passed over them .  it was magrat  who had been combing the riverbanks .      i think i   ve got nearly everything     she said as she landed .     here   s granny   s broomstick .  and   oh  yes   the wand .     she gave a brave little smile .     little pumpkins were bobbing to the surface .  that   s how i found it .         my word  that was lucky     said nanny ogg encouragingly .     hear that  esme .  we shan   t be wanting for food  at any rate .         and i   ve found the basket with the dwarf bread in it     said magrat     although i   m afraid it might be spoilt .         it won   t be  take it from me     said nanny ogg .     you can   t spoil dwarf bread .  well  well     she said  sitting down again .     we   ve got quite a little picnic  haven   t we   and a nice bright fire and   and a nice place to sit and   i   m sure there   s lots of poor people in places like howondaland and suchlike who   d give anything to be here right now           if you don   t stop being so cheerful  gytha ogg  i shall give you such a ding around the ear with the flat of my hand     said granny weatherwax .      you sure you   re not catching a chill .     said nanny ogg .      i   m dryin    out     said granny weatherwax     from the inside .         look  i   m really sorry     said magrat .     i said i was sorry .      not that she was quite certain what for  she told herself .  the boat wasn   t her idea .  she hadn   t put the waterfall there .  she hadn   t even been in a position to see it coming .  she   d turned the boat into a pumpkin  but she hadn   t meant to .  it could have happened to anyone .      i managed to save desiderata   s notebooks  too     she said .      well  that   s a blessing     said nanny ogg .     now we know where we   re lost .      she looked around .  they were through the worst of the mountains  but there were still peaks around and high meadows stretching to the snowline . from somewhere in the distance came the clonking of goat bells .   magrat unfolded a map .  it was creased  damp  and the pencil had run .  she pointed cautiously to a smudged area .      i think we   re here     she said .      my word     said nanny ogg  whose grasp of the principles of cartography was even shakier than granny   s .     amazing how we can all fit on that little bit of paper .         i think perhaps it would be a good idea at the moment if we just followed the river     said magrat .     without in any way going on it     she added quickly .      i suppose you didn   t find my bag .     said granny weatherwax .     it had pers   nal items in .         probably sank like a stone     said nanny ogg .   granny weatherwax stood up like a general who   s just had news that his army has come second .      come on     she said .     where to next  then .        what was next was forest   dark and ferociously coniferous .  the witches flew over it in silence .  there were occasional  isolated cottages half hidden in the trees .  here and there a crag loomed over the sylvanian gloom  shrouded in mist even in mid afternoon .  once or twice they flew past castles  if that   s what you could call them  they didn   t look built  more extruded from the landscape .   it was the kind of landscape that had a particular type of story attached to it  featuring wolves and garlic and frightened women .  a dark and thirsty story  a story that flapped wings against the moon        der flabberghast     muttered nanny .      what   s that .     said magrat .      it   s foreign for bat .         i   ve always liked bats     said magrat .     in general .      the witches found that  by unspoken agreement  they were flying closer together .      i   m getting hungry     said granny weatherwax .     and don   t no one mention pumpkin .         there   s dwarf bread     said nanny .      there   s always the dwarf bread     said granny .     i fancy something cooked this year  thank you all the same .      they flew past another castle  occupying the entire summit of a crag .      what we need is a nice little town or something     said magrat .      but the one down there will have to do     said granny .   they looked down at it .  it wasn   t so much a town as a huddle of houses  clustering together against the trees .  it looked as cheerless as an empty hearth  but the shadows of the mountains were already speeding across the forest and something about the landscape tacitly discouraged night time flying .      can   t see many people about     said granny .      maybe they turn in early in these parts     said nanny ogg .      it   s hardly even sunset     said magrat .     perhaps we ought to go up to that castle .      they all looked at the castle .      no o o     said granny slowly  speaking for all of them .     we know our place .      so they landed  instead  in what was presumably the town square .  a dog barked  somewhere behind the buildings .  a shutter banged closed .      very friendly     said granny .  she walked over to a larger building that had a sign  unreadable under the grime  over the door .  she gave the woodwork a couple of thumps .      open up .     she said .      no  no  you don   t say that     said magrat .  she shouldered her way past  and tapped on the door .     excuse me .  bona fide travelers .         bona what .     said nanny .      that   s what you need to say     said magrat .     any inn has got to open up for bona fide travelers and give them succor .         has it .     said nanny  with interest .     that sounds like a thing worth knowing .      the door remained shut .      let me    ave a go     said nanny .     i know some foreign lingo .      she hammered on the door .      openny vous  gunga din  chop chop  pretty damn quick     she said .   granny weatherwax listened carefully .      that   s speaking foreign  is it .         my grandson shane is a sailor     said nanny ogg .     you   d be amazed  the words he learns about foreign parts .         i expects i would     said granny .     and i    opes they works better for him .      she thumped on the door again .  and this time it opened  very slowly .  a pale face peered around it .      excuse me       magrat began .   granny pushed the door open .  the face   s owner had been leaning on it  they could hear the scrape of his boots over the floor as he was shoved gently backward .      blessings be on this house     granny said  perfunctorily .  it was always a good opening remark for a witch .  it concentrated people   s minds on what other things might be on this house  and reminded them about any fresh cakes  newly baked bread or bundles of useful old clothing that might have temporarily escaped their minds .   it looked like one of the other things had been on this house already .   it was an inn  of sorts .  the three witches had never seen such a cheerless place in their lives .  but it was quite crowded .  a score or more pale faced people watched them solemnly from benches around the walls .   nanny ogg sniffed .      cor     she said .     talk about garlic .     and  indeed  bunches of it hung from every beam .     you can   t have too much garlic  i always say .  i can see i   m going to like it here .      she nodded to a white faced man behind the bar .      gooden day  big feller mine host .  trois beers por favor avec us  silver plate .         what   s a silver plate got to do with it .     demanded granny .      it   s foreign for please     said nanny .      i bet it isn   t really     said granny .     you   re just making it up as you goes along .      the innkeeper  who worked on the fairly simple principle that anyone walking through the door wanted something to drink  drew three beers .      see .     said nanny  triumphantly .      i don   t like the way everyone   s looking at us     said magrat  as nanny babbled on to the perplexed man in her very own esperanto .     a man over there grinned at me .      granny weatherwax sat down on a bench  endeavoring to position herself so that as small an amount of her body as possible was in contact with the wood  in case being foreign was something you could catch .      there     said nanny  bustling up with a tray     nothing to it .  i just cussed at him until he understood .         it looks horrible     said granny .      garlic sausage and garlic bread     said nanny .     my favorite .         you ought to have got some fresh vegetables     said magrat the dietitian .      i did .  there   s some garlic     said nanny happily  cutting a generous slice of eye watering sausage .     and i think i definitely saw something like pickled onions on one of the shelves .         yes .  then we   re going to need at least two rooms for tonight     said granny sternly .      three     said magrat  very quickly .   she risked another look around the room .  the silent villagers were staring at them intently  with a look she could only describe to herself as a sort of hopeful sadness .  of course  anyone who spent much time in the company of granny weatherwax and nanny ogg got used to being stared at  they were the kind of people that filled every space from edge to edge .  and probably people in these parts didn   t often see strangers  what with the thick forests and all .  and the sight of nanny ogg eating a sausage with extreme gusto would even outrank her pickled onion number as major entertainment anywhere .   even so   the way people were staring     outside  deep in the trees  a wolf howled .   the assembled villagers shivered in unison  as though they had been practicing .  the landlord muttered something to them .  they got up  reluctantly  and filed out of the door  trying to keep together .  an old lady laid her hand on magrat   s shoulder for a moment  shook her head sadly  sighed  and then scuttled away .  but magrat was used to this  too .  people often felt sorry for her when they saw her in granny   s company .   eventually the landlord lurched across to them with a lighted torch  and motioned them to follow him .      how did you make him understand about the beds .     said magrat .      i said     hey mister  jigajig toot sweet all same no .           said nanny ogg .   granny weatherwax tried this under her breath  and nodded .      your lad shane certainly gets around a bit  doesn   t he     she remarked .      he says it works every time     said nanny ogg .     in fact there were only two rooms  up a long  winding and creaky stairway .  and magrat got one to herself .  even the landlord seemed to want it that way .  he   d been very attentive .   she wished he hadn   t been so keen to bar the shutters  though .  magrat liked to sleep with a window open .  as it was  it was too dark and stuffy .   anyway  she thought  i am the fairy godmother .  the others are just accompanying me .   she peered hopelessly at herself in the room   s tiny cracked mirror and then lay and listened to them on the far side of the paper thin wall .      what   re you turning the mirror to the wall for  esme .         i just don   t like    em  staring like that .         they only stares if you   re staring at    em  esme .      silence  and then     eh  what   s this round thing for  then .         i reckon it   s supposed to be a pillow  esme .         hah .  i don   t call it a pillow .  and there   s no proper blankets  even .  what   d you say this thing   s called .         i think it   s called a duvit  esme .         we call them an eiderdown where i come from .  hah .      there was a respite .  then      have you brushed your tooth .      and another pause .  then      oo  you haven   t half got cold feet  esme .         no  they ain   t .  they   re lovely and snug .      and another silence .  then      boots .  your boots .  you   ve got your boots on .         i should just think i    ave got my boots on  gytha ogg .         and your clothes .  you haven   t even undressed .         you can   t be too careful in foreign parts .  there could be all sorts out there  a creepin    around .      magrat snuggled under the   what was it .    duvit  and turned over .  granny weatherwax appeared to need one hour   s sleep a night  whereas nanny ogg would snore on a fence rail .      gytha .  gytha .  gytha .         wha    .         are you awake .            m now           i keep    earing a noise .            so do i        magrat dozed for a while .      gytha .  gytha .            wha    now .            i   m sure someone rattled our shutters .            not at our time of life   now g    back t    slee           the air in the room was getting hotter and stuffier by the minute .  magrat got out of bed  unbolted the shutters and flung them back dramatically .   there was a grunt  and a distant thud of something hitting the ground .   the full moon streamed in .  she felt a lot better for that  and got back into bed .   it seemed no time at all before the voice from next door woke her again .      gytha ogg  what are you doing .         i   m    aving a snack .         can   t you sleep .         just can   t seem to be able to get off  esme     said nanny ogg .     can   t imagine why .         here  that   s garlic sausage you   re eating .  i   m actually sharing a bed with someone eating garlic sausage .         hey  that   s mine .  give it back        magrat was aware of booted footsteps in the pit of the night  and the sound of a shutter being swung back in the next room .   she thought she heard a faint    oof    and another muted thud .      i thought you liked garlic  esme     said nanny ogg   s resentful voice .      sausage is all right in its place  and its place ain   t in bed .  and don   t you say a word .  now move over .  you keep taking all the duvit .      after a while the velvet silence was broken by granny   s deep and resonant snore .  shortly afterward it was joined by the genteel snoring of nanny  who had spent far more time sleeping in company than granny and had evolved a more accommodating nasal orchestra .  granny   s snore would have cut logs .   magrat folded the horrible round hard pillow over her ears and burrowed under the bedclothes .     somewhere on the chilly ground  a very large bat was trying to get airborne again .  it had already been stunned twice  once by a carelessly opened shutter and once by a ballistic garlic sausage  and wasn   t feeling very well at all .  one more setback  it was thinking  and it   s back off to the castle .  besides  it   d be sunrise soon .   its red eyes glinted as it looked up at magrat   s open window .  it tensed     a paw landed on it .   the bat looked around .   greebo had not had a very good night .  he had investigated the whole place with regard to female cats  and found none .  he had prowled among the middens  and drawn a blank .  people in this town didn   t throw the garbage away .  they ate it .   he   d trotted into the woods and found some wolves and had sat and grinned at them until they got uncomfortable and went away .   yes  it had been a very uneventful night .  until now .   the bat squirmed under his claw .  it seemed to greebo   s small cat brain that it was trying to change its shape  and he wasn   t having any of that from a mouse with wings on .   especially now  when he had someone to play with .     genua was a fairytale city .  people smiled and were joyful the livelong day .  especially if they wanted to see another livelong day .   lilith made certain of that .  of course  people had probably thought they were happy in the days before she   d seen to it that the duc replaced the old baron  but it was a random  untidy happiness  which was why it was so easy for her to move in .   but it wasn   t a way of life .  there was no pattern to it .   one day they   d thank her .   of course  there were always a few difficult ones .  sometimes  people just didn   t know how to act .  you did your best for them  you ruled their city properly  you ensured that their lives were worthwhile and full of happiness every hour of the day and then  for no reason at all  they turned on you .   guards lined the audience chamber .  and there was an audience .  technically  of course  it was the ruler who gave the audience  but lilith liked to see people watching .  one pennyworth of example was worth a pound of punishment .   there wasn   t a lot of crime in genua these days .  at least  not what would be considered crime elsewhere .  things like theft were easily dealt with and hardly required any kind of judicial process .  far more important  in lilith   s book  were crimes against narrative expectation .  people didn   t seem to know how they should behave .   lilith held a mirror up to life  and chopped all the bits off life that didn   t fit     the duc lounged bonelessly on his throne  one leg dangling over the armrest .  he   d never got the hang of chairs .      and what has this one done .     he said  and yawned .  opening his mouth wide was something he was good at  at least .   a little old man cowered between two guards .   there   s always someone willing to be a guard  even in places like genua .  besides  you got a really smart uniform  with blue trousers and a red coat and a high black hat with a cockade in it .      but i   i can   t whistle     quavered the old man .    i   i didn   t know it was compulsory           but you are a toymaker     said the duc .     toymakers whistle and sing the whole day long .     he glanced at lilith .  she nodded .      i don   t know any   s songs     said the toymaker .     i never got taught s songs .  just how to make toys .  i was    prenticed at making toys .  seven years before the little hammer  man and boy           it says here     said the duc  making a creditable impersonation of someone reading the charge sheet in front of him     that you don   t tell the children stories .         no one ever told me about telling   s stories     said the toymaker .     look  i just make toys .  toys .  that   s all i   m good at .  toys .  i make good t toys .  i   m just a t toymaker .         you can   t be a good toymaker if you don   t tell stories to the children     said lilith  leaning forward .   the toymaker looked up at the veiled face .      don   t know any     he said .      you don   t know any .         i could t tell    em how to make toys     the old man quavered .   lilith sat back .  it was impossible to see her expression under the veil .      i think it would be a good idea if the people   s guards here took you away     she said     to a place where you will certainly learn to sing .  and possibly  after a while  you might even whistle .  won   t that be nice .      the old baron   s dungeons had been disgusting .  lilith had had them repainted and refurnished .  with a lot of mirrors .     when the audience was over one member of the crowd slipped out through the palace kitchens .  the guards on the side gate didn   t try to stop her .  she was a very important person in the small compass of their lives .      hello  mrs .  pleasant .      she stopped  reached into her basket and produced a couple of roast chicken legs .      just tryin    a new peanut coating     she said .     would value your opinions  boys .      they took them gratefully .  everyone liked to see mrs .  pleasant .  she could do things with a chicken that would almost make it glad it had been killed .      and now i   m just going out to get some herbs     she said .   they watched her as she went like a fat  determined arrow in the direction of the market place  which was right on the edge of the river .  then they ate the chicken legs .   mrs .  pleasant bustled among the market stalls  and she took great care to bustle .  even in genua there were always people ready to tell a tale .  especially in genua .  she was a cook  so she bustled .  and made sure she stayed fat and was  fortunately  naturally jolly .  she made sure she had floury arms at all times .  if she felt under suspicion  she   d say things like    lawks .     she seemed to be getting away with it so far .   she looked for the sign .  and there it was .  perched up on the roof pole of a stall that was otherwise stacked with cages of hens  gazoots  wheely cranes and other fowl  was a black cockerel .  the voodoo doctor was in .   even as her eye found it the cockerel   s head turned to look at her .   set a little way back from the rest of the stalls was a small tent  similar to many around the market .  a cauldron bubbled in front of it on a charcoal fire .  there were bowls beside it  and a ladle  and beside them a plate with coins on it .  there were quite a lot of coins  people paid for mrs .  gogol   s cooking whatever they thought it was worth  and the plate was hardly big enough .   the thick liquid in the cauldron was an unappetizing brown .  mrs .  pleasant helped herself to a bowlful  and waited .  mrs .  gogol had certain talents .   after a while a voice from the tent said     what   s new  mrs .  pleasant .         she   s shut up the toymaker     said mrs .  pleasant  to the air in general .     and yesterday it was old devereaux the innkeeper for not being fat and not having a big red face .  that   s four times this month .         you come in  mrs .  pleasant .      it was dark and hot inside the tent .  there was another fire in there  and another pot .  mrs .  gogol was hunched over it  stirring .  she motioned the cook to a pair of bellows .      blow up the coals a tad  and we   ll see what   s what     she said .   mrs .  pleasant obeyed .  she didn   t use magic herself  other than that necessary to get a roux to turn or bread to rise  but she respected it in others .  especially in the likes of mrs .  gogol .   the charcoal blazed white .  the thick liquid in the pot began to churn .  mrs .  gogol peered into the steam .      what   re you doing  mrs .  gogol .     said the cook anxiously .      trying to see what   s goin    to happen     said the voodoo woman .  the voice dropped into the rolling growl of the psychically gifted .   mrs .  pleasant squinted into the roiling mass .      someone   s going to be eatin    shrimp .     she said helpfully .      ye see that bit of okra .     said mrs .  gogol .     ye see the way the crab legs keep coming up just there .         you never were one to stint the crab meat     said mrs .  pleasant .      see the way the bubbles is so thick by the okuh leaves .  see the way it all spirals around that purple onion .         i see it .  i see it .     said mrs .  pleasant .      and you know what that means .         means it   s going to taste real fine .         sure     said mrs .  gogol  kindly .     and it means some people   s coming .         wow .  how many .      mrs .  gogol dipped a spoon into the seething mass and tasted it .      three people     she said .  she smacked her lips thoughtfully .     women .      she dipped the spoon again .      have a taste     she said .     there   s a cat  too .  ye can tell by the sassafras .     she smacked her lips .     gray .  one eye .     she explored the cavity of a tooth with her tongue .     the   left one .      mrs .  pleasant   s jaw dropped .      they   ll find you before they find me     said mrs .  gogol .     you lead    em here .      mrs .  pleasant stared at mrs .  gogol   s grim smile and then back down at the mixture in the pot .      they coming all this way for a taste .     she said .      sure .     mrs .  gogol sat back .     you been to see the girl in the white house .      mrs .  pleasant nodded .     young embers     she said .     yeah .  when i can .  when the sisters are out at the palace .  they got her real scared  mrs .  gogol .      she looked down at the pot again  and back up to mrs .  gogol .      can you really see    .         i expect you   ve got things to marinate .     said mrs .  gogol .      yeah .  yeah .     mrs .  pleasant backed out  but with reluctance .  then she halted .  mrs .  pleasant  at rest  was not easily moved again until she wanted to be .      that lilith woman says she can see the whole world in mirrors     she said  in slightly accusing tones .   mrs .  gogol shook her head .      all anyone gets in a mirror is themselves     she said .     but what you gets in a good gumbo is everything .      mrs .  pleasant nodded .  this was a well known fact .  she couldn   t dispute it .   mrs .  gogol shook her head sadly when the cook had gone .  a voodoo woman was reduced to all sorts of stratagems in order to appear knowing  but she felt slightly ashamed of letting an honest woman believe that she could see the future in a pot of gumbo .  because all you could see in a pot of mrs .  gogol   s gumbo was that the future certainly contained a very good meal .   she   d really seen it in a bowl of jambalaya she   d prepared earlier .     magrat lay with the wand under her pillow .  she wobbled gently between sleep and wakefulness .   certainly she was the best person for the wand .  there was no doubt about that .  sometimes   and she hardly dared give the thought headroom  when she was under the same roof as granny weatherwax   she really wondered about the others    commitment to witchcraft .  half the time they didn   t seem to bother .   take medicine  for example .  magrat knew she was much better than them at herbs .  she   d inherited several large books on the subject from goodie whemper  her predecessor in the cottage  and had essayed a few tentative notes of her own as well .  she could tell people things about the uses of devil   s bit scabious that would interest them so much they   d rush off  presumably to look for someone else to tell .  she could fractionally distil  and double distil  and do things that meant sitting up all night watching the color of the flame under the retort .  she worked at it .   whereas nanny just tended to put a hot poultice on everything and recommend a large glass of whatever the patient liked best on the basis that since you were going to be ill anyway you might as well get some enjoyment out of it .   magrat forbade her patients alcohol  because of what it did to the liver  if they didn   t know what it did to the liver  she spent some time telling them .    and granny   she just gave people a bottle of colored water and told them they felt a lot better .   and what was so annoying was that they often did .   where was the witchcraft in that .   with a wand  though  things could be different .  you could help people a lot with a wand .  magic was there to make life better .  magrat knew this in the pink fluttering boudoir of her heart .   she dipped under the surface of sleep again .   and there was an odd dream .  she never mentioned it to anyone afterward because  well  you didn   t .  not things like that .   but she thought she   d got up in the night  awakened by the silence  to get some more air .  and as she passed the mirror she saw a movement in it .   it wasn   t her face .  it looked a lot like granny weatherwax .  it smiled at her   a much nicer and friendlier smile than she   d ever got from granny  magrat recalled   and then vanished  the cloudy silver surface closing over it .   she hurried back to bed and awoke to the sound of a brass band  engaged in unrelenting oompah .  people were shouting and laughing .   magrat got dressed quickly  went out into the corridor  and knocked on the door of the older witches .  there was no reply .  she tried the handle .   after she   d rattled it a couple of times there was a thump as the chair wedged under the handle on the other side  the better to deter ravishers  burglars and other nocturnal intruders  fell over .   granny weatherwax   s boots protruded from under the covers at one end of the bed .  nanny ogg   s bare feet  nanny being something of a night time revolver  were beside them .  faint snores rattled the jug on the washbasin  these were no longer the fullnosed roars of a quick forty winks catnapper  but the well paced growls of someone who intends to make a night of it .   magrat knocked on the sole of granny   s boot .      hey  wake up .  something   s going on .      granny weatherwax waking up was quite an impressive sight  and one not seen by many people .   most people  on waking up  accelerate through a quick panicky pre consciousness check up  who am i  where am i  who is he she  good god  why am i cuddling a policeman   s helmet  what happened last night .   and this is because people are riddled by doubt .  it is the engine that drives them through their lives .  it is the elastic band in the little model airplane of their soul  and they spend their time winding it up until it knots .  early morning is the worst time   there   s that little moment of panic in case you have drifted away in the night and something else has moved in .  this never happened to granny weatherwax .  she went straight from fast asleep to instant operation on all six cylinders .  she never needed to find herself because she always knew who was doing the looking .   she sniffed .     something   s burning     she said .      they   ve got a bonfire  too     said magrat .   granny sniffed again .      they   re roasting garlic .     she said .      i know .  i can   t imagine why .  they   re ripping all the shutters off the windows and burning them in the square and dancing around the fire .      granny weatherwax gave nanny ogg a vicious jab with her elbow .      wake up  you .         wstph .         i didn   t get a wink of sleep all night     said granny reproachfully     what with her snoring .      nanny ogg raised the covers cautiously .      it   s far too early in the morning for it to be early in the morning     she said .      come on     said granny .     we needs your skill with languages .        the owner of the inn flapped his arms up and down and ran around in circles .  then he pointed at the castle that towered over the forest .  then he sucked vigorously at his wrist .  then he fell over on his back .  and then he looked expectantly at nanny ogg  while behind him the bonfire of garlic and wooden stakes and heavy window shutters burned merrily .      no     said nanny  after a while .     still non conprendy  mine hair .      the man got up  and brushed some dust off his leather breeches .      i think he   s saying that someone   s dead     said magrat .     someone in the castle .         well  i must say  everyone seems very cheerful about it     said granny weatherwax severely .   in the sunlight of the new day the village looked far more cheerful .  everyone kept nodding happily at the witches .      that   s because it was probably the landlord     said nanny ogg .     bit of a bloodsucker  i think he   s sayin    .         ah .  that   d be it  then .     granny rubbed her hands together and looked approvingly at the breakfast table  which had been dragged out into the sunshine .     anyway  the food has certainly improved .  pass the bread  magrat .         everyone keeps smiling and waving at us     said magrat .     and look at all this food .         that   s only to be expected     said granny  with her mouth full .     they   ve only had us here one night and already they   re learnin    it   s lucky to be kind to witches .  now help me get the lid off this honey .      under the table  greebo sat and washed himself .  occasionally he burped .   vampires have risen from the dead  the grave and the crypt  but have never managed it from the cat .       dear jason and all at no .      no .      no .      no .     and no .     but not at no .     until she gives back the bowl she definitly borrowed whatever she says .       well here we are  cor what a lark so far  dont arsk me about pumkins  still  no harm done .  im drawin a picture of where we stayed larst night i have put an x on our room where our room is .  the weather          what are you doing  gytha .  we   re ready to leave .      nanny ogg looked up  her face still creased with the effort of composition .      i thought it would be nice to send something to our jason .  you know  to stop him worryin    .  so i done a drawing of this place on a piece of card and mine hair here will give it to someone going our way .  you never know  it might get there .         continues fine .   nanny ogg sucked the end of her pencil .  not for the first time in the history of the universe  someone for whom communication normally came as effortlessly as a dream was stuck for inspiration when faced with a few lines on the back of a card .       well that about wraps it up for now  will wright again soone mum .  p . s .  the cat is looking very peeky i think he misses his home .        will you come on  gytha .  magrat   s getting my broom started for me .          p . p . s .  granny sends her love .     nanny ogg sat back  content in the knowledge of a job well done .      magrat reached the end of the town square and stopped to rest .   quite an audience had gathered to see a woman with legs .  they were very polite about it .  somehow  that made it worse .      it doesn   t fly unless you run really fast     she explained  aware even as she spoke how stupid this sounded  especially if you were listening in a foreign language .     i think it   s called hump starting .      she took a deep breath  scowled in concentration  and ran forward again .   this time it started .  it jolted in her hands .  the bristles rustled .  she managed to slip it into neutral before it could drag her along the ground .  one thing about granny weatherwax   s broomstick   it was one of the very old fashioned ones  built in the days when broomsticks were built to last and not fall apart with woodworm after ten years   was that while it might take some starting  when it went it didn   t hang about .   magrat had once considered explaining the symbolism of the witches    broomstick to granny weatherwax  and decided not to .  it would have been worse than the row about the significance of the maypole .   departure took some time .  the villagers insisted on giving them little gifts of food .  nanny ogg made a speech which no one understood but which was generally cheered .  greebo  hiccuping occasionally  oozed into his accustomed place among the bristles of nanny   s broomstick .   as they rose above the forest a thin plume of smoke also rose from the castle .  and then there were flames .      i see people dancing in front of it     said magrat .      always a dangerous business  rentin    property     said granny weatherwax .     i expect he was a bit lax when it came to redecoratin    and repairin    the roof and suchlike .  people take against that kind of thing .  my landlord hasn   t done a hand   s turn on my cottage the whole time i   ve been there     she added .     it   s shameful .  and me an old woman  too .         i thought you owned your place     said magrat  as the broomsticks set off over the forest .      she just ain   t paid no rent for sixty years     said nanny ogg .      is that my fault .     said granny weatherwax .     it   s not my fault .  i   d be quite willin    to pay .     she smiled a slow  self confident smile .     all he has to do is ask     she added .     this is the discworld  seen from above  its cloud formations circling in long curved patterns .   three dots emerged from the cloud layer .      i can see why travelin    doesn   t catch on .  i call this boring .  nothing but forest for hours and hours .         yes  but flying gets you to places quickly  granny .         how long   ve we been flying  anyway .         about ten minutes since you last asked  esme .         you see .  boring .         it   s sitting on the sticks i don   t like .  i reckon there ought to be a special broomstick for going long distances  right .  one you could stretch out on and have a snooze .      they all considered this .      and have your meals on     added nanny .     proper meals  i mean .  with gravy .  not just sandwiches and stuff .     an experiment in aerial cookery on a small oil burner had been hastily curtailed after it threatened to set fire to nanny   s broomstick .      i suppose you could do it if you had a really big broomstick     said magrat .     about the size of a tree  perhaps .  then one of us could do the steering and another one could do the cooking .         it   d never happen     said nanny ogg .     the reason being  the dwarfs would make you pay a fortune for a stick that big .         yes  but what you could do     said magrat  warming to her subject     is get people to pay you to give them rides .  there must be lots of people fed up with highwaymen and   and being seasick and that sort of thing .         how about it  esme .     said nanny ogg .     i   ll do the steering and magrat   ll do the cooking .         what shall i do  then .     said granny weatherwax suspiciously .      oh   well   there ought to be someone to  you know  welcome people onto the stick and give them their meals     said magrat .     and tell them what to do if the magic fails  for example .         if the magic fails everyone   ll crash into the ground and die     granny pointed out .      yes  but someone will have to tell them how to do that     said nanny ogg  winking at magrat .     they won   t know how to  not being experienced in flying .         and we could call ourselves       she paused .  as always on the discworld  which was right on the very edge of unreality  little bits of realness crept in whenever someone   s mind was resonating properly .  this happened now .         three witches airborne     she said .     how about that .         broomsticks airborne     said magrat .     or pan   air           there   s no need to bring religion into it     sniffed granny .   nanny ogg looked slyly from granny to magrat .      we could call it vir       she began .   a gust of wind caught all three sticks and whirled them up .  there was a brief panic as the witches brought them under control .      load of nonsense     muttered granny .      well  it passes the time     said nanny ogg .   granny looked morosely at the greenery below .      you   d never get people to do it     she said .     load of nonsense .          dear jason en famile      overleaf on the other side please find enclosed a sketch of somewhere some king died and was buried  search me why .  it   s in some village wear we stopped last night .  we had some stuff it was chewy you   ll never guess it was snails  and not bad and esme had three helpins before she found out and then had a row with the cook and magrat was sick all night just at the thought of it and had the dire rear .  thinking of you your loving mum .  ps the privies here are desgusting  they have them indores  so much for higeine .       several days passed .     in a quiet little inn in a tiny country granny weatherwax sat and regarded the food with deep suspicion .  the owner hovered with the frantic expression of one who knows  even before he starts  that he   s not going to come out of this ahead of the game .      good simple home cooking     said granny .     that   s all i require .  you know me .  i   m not the demanding sort .  no one could say i   m the demanding sort .  i just want simple food .  not all grease and stuff .  it comes to something when you complain about something in your lettuce and it turns out to be what you ordered .      nanny ogg tucked her napkin into the top of her dress and said nothing .      like that place last night     said granny .     you   d think you   d be all right with sandwiches  wouldn   t you .  i mean   sandwiches .  simplest food there is in the whole world .  you   d think even foreigners couldn   t get sandwiches wrong .  hah .         they didn   t call them sandwiches  granny     said magrat  her eyes dwelling on the owner   s frying pan .     they called them   i think they called them smorgy   s board .         they was nice     said nanny ogg .     i   m very partial to a pickled herring .         but they must think we   re daft  not noticing they   d left off the top slice     said granny triumphantly .     well  i told them a thing or two .  another time they   ll think twice before trying to swindle people out of a slice of bread that   s theirs by rights .         i expect they will     said magrat darkly .      and i don   t hold with all this giving things funny names so people don   t know what they   re eating     said granny  determined to explore the drawbacks of international cookery to the full .     i like stuff that tells you plain what it is  like   well   bubble and squeak  or   or           spotted dick     said nanny absently .  she was watching the progress of the pancakes with some anticipation .      that   s right .  decent honest food .  i mean  take that stuff we had for lunch .  i   m not saying it wasn   t nice     said granny graciously .     in a foreign sort of way  of course .  but they called it cwuissses dee grenolly  and who knows what that means .         frogs    legs     translated nanny  without thinking .   the silence was filled with granny weatherwax taking a deep breath and a pale green color creeping across magrat   s face .  nanny ogg now thought quicker than she had done for a very long time .      not actual frogs    legs     she said hurriedly .     it   s like toad in the hole is really only sausage and batter puddin    .  it   s just a joke name .         it doesn   t sound very funny to me     said granny .  she turned to glare at the pancakes .      at least they can   t muck up a decent pancake     she said .     what   d they call them here .         crap suzette  i think     said nanny .   granny forbore to comment .  but she watched with grim satisfaction as the owner finished the dish and gave her a hopeful smile .      oh  now he expects us to eat them     she said .     he only goes and sets fire to them  and then he still expects us to eat them .        it might later have been possible to chart the progress of the witches across the continent by some sort of demographic survey .  long afterward  in some quiet  onion hung kitchens  in sleepy villages nestling among hot hills  you might have found cooks who wouldn   t twitch and try to hide behind the door when a stranger came into the kitchen .       dear jason      it is defnity more warmer here  magrat says it is because we are getting further from the hub and  a funny thing  all the money is different .  you have to change it for other money which is all different shapes and is not proper money at all in my opinion .  we generally let esme sort that out  she gets a very good rate of exchange  it is amazing  magrat says she will wright a book called traveling on one dollar a day  and it   s always the same dollar .  esme is getting to act just like a foreigner  yesterday she took her shawl off  next thing it will be dancing on tables .  this is a picture of some famous bridge or other .  lots of love  mum .     the sun beat down on the cobbled street  and particularly on the courtyard of a little inn .      it   s hard to imagine     said magrat     that it   s autumn back home .         garkon .  mucho vino aveck zei  grassy ass .      the innkeeper  who did not understand one word and was a good natured man who certainly did not deserve to be called a garkon  smiled at nanny .  he   d smile at anyone with such an unlimited capacity for drink .      i don   t hold with putting all these tables out in the street  though     said granny weatherwax  although without much severity .  it was pleasantly warm .  it wasn   t that she didn   t like autumn  it was a season she always looked forward to  but at her time of life it was nice to know that it was happening hundreds of miles away while she wasn   t there .   underneath the table greebo dozed on his back with his legs in the air .  occasionally he twitched as he fought wolves in his sleep .      it says in desiderata   s notes     said magrat  turning the stiff pages carefully     that in the late summer here they have this special traditional ceremony where they let a lot of bulls run through the street .         that   d be something worth seeing     said granny weatherwax .     why do they do it .         so all the young men can chase them to show how brave they are     said magrat .     apparently they pull their rosettes off .      a variety of expressions passed across nanny ogg   s wrinkled face  like weather over a stretch of volcanic badlands .      sounds a bit strange     she said at last .     what do they do that for .         she doesn   t explain it very clearly     said magrat .  she turned another page .  her lips moved as she read on .     what does cojones mean .      they shrugged .      here  you want to slow down on that drink     said granny  as a waiter put down another bottle in front of nanny ogg .     i wouldn   t trust any drink that   s green .         it   s not like proper drink     said nanny .     it says on the label it   s made from herbs .  you can   t make a serious drink out of just herbs .  try a drop .      granny sniffed the opened bottle .      smells like aniseed     she said .      it says    absinthe    on the bottle     said nanny .      oh  that   s just a name for wormwood     said magrat  who was good at herbs .     my herbal says it   s good for stomach diforders and prevents sicknefs after meals .         there you are  then     said nanny .     herbs .  it   s practic   ly medicine .     she poured a generous measure for the other two .     give it a go  magrat .  it   ll put a cheft on your cheft .      granny weatherwax surreptitiously loosened her boots .  she was also debating whether to remove her vest .  she probably didn   t need all three .      we ought to be getting on     she said .      oh  i   m fed up with the broomsticks     said nanny .     more than a couple of hours on a stick and i   ve gone rigid in the dairy air .      she looked expectantly at the other two .     that foreign for bum     she added .     although  it   s a funny thing  in some foreign parts    bum    means    tramp    and    tramp    means    hobo    .  funny things  words .         a laugh a minute     said granny .      the river   s quite wide here     said magrat .     there   s big boats .  i   ve never been on a proper boat .  you know .  the kind that doesn   t sink easily .         broomsticks is more witchy     said granny  but not with much conviction .  she did not have nanny ogg   s international anatomical vocabulary  but bits of her she wouldn   t even admit to knowing the names of were definitely complaining .      i saw them boats     said nanny .     they looked like great big rafts with houses on .  you wouldn   t hardly know you   re on a boat  esme .     ere  what   s he doing .      the innkeeper had hurried out and was taking the jolly little tables back inside .  he nodded at nanny and spoke with a certain amount of urgency .      i think he wants us to go inside     said magrat .      i likes it out here     said granny .     i likes it out here  thank you     she repeated .  granny weatherwax   s approach to foreign tongues was to repeat herself loudly and slowly .         ere  you stop trying to take our table away .     snapped nanny  thumping his hands .   the innkeeper spoke hurriedly and pointed up the street .   granny and magrat glanced inquiringly at nanny ogg .  she shrugged .      didn   t understand any of that     she admitted .      we   re stoppin    where we are  thank you     said granny .  the innkeeper   s eyes met hers .  he gave in  waved his hands in the air in exasperation  and went inside .      they think they can take advantage of you when you   re a woman     said magrat .  she stifled a burp  discreetly  and picked up the green bottle again .  her stomach was feeling a lot better already .      that   s very true .  d   you know what .     said nanny ogg     i barricaded meself in my room last night and a man didn   t even try to break in .         gytha ogg  sometimes you       granny stopped as she caught sight of something over nanny   s shoulder .      there   s a load of cows coming down the street     she said .   nanny turned her chair around .      it must be that bull thing magrat mentioned     she said .     should be worth seein    .      magrat glanced up .  all along the street people were craning out of every second story window .  a jostle of horns and hooves and steaming bodies was approaching rapidly .      there   s people up there laughing at us     she said accusingly .   under the table greebo stirred and rolled over .  he opened his good eye  focused on the approaching bulls  and sat up .  this looked like being fun .      laughin    .     said granny .  she looked up .  the people aloft did indeed appear to be enjoying a joke .   her eyes narrowed .      we   re just goin    to carry on as if nothin    is happening     she declared .      but they   re quite big bulls     said magrat nervously .      they   re nothing to do with us     said granny .     it   s nothin    to do with us if a lot of foreigners want to get excited about things .  now pass me the herbal wine .        as far as lagro te kabona  innkeeper  could remember the events of that day  they seemed to happen like this   it was the time of the thing with the bulls .  and the mad women just sat there  drinking absinthe as if it was water .  he tried to get them to come indoors  but the old one  the skinny one  just shouted at him .  so he let them bide  but left the door open   people soon got the message when the bulls came down the street with the young men of the village after them .  whoever snatched the big red rosette from between the horns of the biggest bull got the seat of honor at that night   s feast plus   lagro smiled a smile of forty years remembrance   a certain informal but highly enjoyable relationship with the young women of the town for quite some time after     and the mad women just sat there .   the leading bull had been a bit uncertain about this .  its normal course of action would be to roar and paw the ground a bit to get the targets running in an interesting way and its mind wasn   t able to cope with this lack of attention  but that hadn   t been its major problem  because its major problem had been twenty other bulls right behind it .   and even that ceased to be its major problem  because the terrible old woman  the one all in black  had stood up  muttered something at it and smacked it between the eyes .  then the horrible dumpy one whose stomach had the resilience and capacity of a galvanized water tank fell backward off her chair  laughing  and the young one   that is  the one who was younger than the other two   started flapping at the bulls as if they were ducks .   and then the street was full of angry  bewildered bulls  and a lot of shouting  terrified young men .  it   s one thing to chase a lot of panicking bulls  and quite another to find that they   re suddenly trying to run the other way .   the innkeeper  from the safety of his bedroom window  could hear the horrible women shouting things to one another .  the dumpy one kept laughing and shouting some sort of battle cry      trythehorsemanswordesme .     and then the younger one  who was pushing her way through the animals as if being gored to death was something that only happened to other people  found the lead bull and took the rosette off it  with the same air of concern as an old woman may take a thorn out of her cat   s paw .  she held it as if she didn   t know what it was or what she should do with it     the sudden silence affected even the bulls .  their tiny little bloodshot brains sensed something wrong .  the bulls were embarrassed .   fortunately  the horrible women left on a riverboat that afternoon  after one of them rescued her cat which had cornered twenty five stone of confused bull and was trying to toss it in the air and play with it .   that evening lagro te kabona made a point of being very  very kind to his old mother .   and the village held a flower festival next year  and no one ever talked about the thing with the bulls ever  ever again .   at least  not in front of the men .     the big paddlewheel sloshed through the thick brown soup of the river .  the motive power was several dozen trolls under a sunshade  trudging along an endless belt .  birds sang in the trees on the distant banks .  the scent of hibiscus wafted across the water  almost but unfortunately not quite overpowering the scent of the river itself .      now this     said nanny ogg     is more like it .      she stretched out on the deckchair and turned to look at granny weatherwax  whose brows were knitted in the intense concentration of reading .   nanny   s mouth spread in an evil grin .      you know what this river   s called .     she said .      no .            s called the vieux river .         yes .         know what that means .         no .         the old  masculine  river     said nanny .      yes .         words have sex in foreign parts     said nanny  hopefully .   granny didn   t budge .      wouldn   t be at all surprised     she murmured .  nanny sagged .      that   s one of desiderata   s books  isn   t it .         yes     said granny .  she licked her thumb decorously and turned the page .      where   s magrat gone .         she   s having a lie down in the cabin     said granny  without looking up .      tummy upset .         it   s her head this time .  now be quiet  gytha .  i   m having a read .         what about .     said nanny cheerfully .   granny weatherwax sighed  and put her finger on the page to mark her place .      this place we   re going to     she said .     genua .  desiderata says it   s decadent .      nanny ogg   s smile remained fixed .      yes .     she said .     that   s good  is it .  i   ve never been to a city before .      granny weatherwax paused .  she   d been pondering for some while .  she wasn   t at all certain about the meaning of the word    decadent .     she   d dismissed the possibility that it meant    having ten teeth    in the same sense that nanny ogg  for example  was unident .  whatever it meant  it was something desiderata had felt necessary to write down .  granny weatherwax did not generally trust books as a means of information  but now she had no choice .   she had a vague idea that    decadent    had something to do with not opening the curtains all day .      she says it   s also a city of art  wit and culture     said granny .      we shall be all right there  then     said nanny confidently .      particularly noted for the beauty of its women  she says here .         we shall fade right in  no trouble .      granny turned the pages carefully .  desiderata had paid close attention to affairs all over the disc .  on the other hand  she hadn   t been writing for readers other than herself  so her notes tended to the cryptic and were aides m  moire rather than coherent accounts .   granny read     now l .  rules the citie as the power behint the throne  and baron s .  they say has been killd  drowned in the river .  he was a wicked man tho not i think as wicked as l  for she says she wants to make it a magic kingdom  a happy and peaseful place  and wen people do that look out for spies on every corner and no manne dare speak out  for who dare speke out against evile done in the name of happyness and pease .  all the streetes are clean and axes are sharp .  but e .  is safe at least  for now .  l .  has plans for her .  and mrs .  g who was the baron   s amour hides in the swamp and fites back with swamp magic  but you cannot fite mirror magic which is all reflection .      fairy godmothers came in twos  granny knew .  so that was desiderata and   and l   but who was this person in the swamp .      gytha .     said granny .      wazzat .     said nanny ogg  who was dozing off .      desiderata says some woman here is someone   s armor .         prob   ly a mettyfor     said nanny ogg .      oh     said granny darkly     one of them things .         but no one can stop mardi gras     she read .     if anything canne be done it be on samedi nuit morte  the last night of carnivale  the night halfway between the living and the dead  when magic flows in the streets .  if l .  is vooneruble it is then  for carnivale is everythinge she hates        granny weatherwax pulled her hat down over her eyes to shield them from the sun .      it says here they have a great big carnival every year     she said .     mardi gras  it   s called .         that means fat lunchtime     said nanny ogg  international linguist .     garkon .  etcetra gross mint tulip avec petit bowl de peanuts  pour favor .      granny weatherwax shut the book .   she would not of course admit it to a third party  least of all another witch  but as genua drew nearer granny was becoming less and less confident .   she was waiting in genua .  after all this time .  staring at her out of the mirror .  smiling .   the sun beat down .  she tried defying it .  sooner or later she was going to have to give in  though .  it was going to be time to remove another vest .   nanny ogg sat and drew cards for her relatives for a while  and then yawned .  she was a witch who liked noise and people around her .  nanny ogg was getting bored .  it was a big boat  more like a floating inn  and she felt certain there was some excitement somewhere .   she laid her bag on her seat and wandered away to look for it .   the trolls plodded on .       the sun was red  fat and low when granny weatherwax awoke .  she looked around guiltily from the shelter of her hatbrim in case anyone had noticed her asleep .  falling asleep during the day was something only old women did  and granny weatherwax was an old woman only when it suited her purposes .   the only spectator was greebo  curled up on nanny   s chair .  his one good eye was fixed on her  but it wasn   t so terrifying as the milky white stare of his blind one .      just considerin    our strategy     she muttered  just in case .   she closed the book and strode off to their cabin .  it wasn   t a big one .  some of the staterooms looked huge  but what with the herbal wine and everything granny hadn   t felt up to using any influence to get one .   magrat and nanny ogg were sitting on a bunk  in gloomy silence .      i feels a bit peckish     said granny .     i smelled stew on the way here  so let   s go and have a look  eh .  what about that .      the other two continued to stare at the floor .      i suppose there   s always pumpkin     said magrat .     and there   s always the dwarf bread .         there   s always dwarf bread     said nanny automatically .  she looked up  her face a mask of shame .      er  esme   er   you know the money           the money what we all gave you to keep in your knickers for safety .     said granny .  something about the way the conversation was going suggested the first few pebbles slipping before a major landslide .      that   s the money i   m referrin    to   er           the money in the big leather bag that we were goin    to be very careful about spendin    .     said granny .      you see   the money           oh  that money     said granny .         is gone       said nanny .      stolen .         she   s been gambling     said magrat  in tones of smug horror .     with men .         it wasn   t gambling .     snapped nanny .     i never gamble .  they were no good at cards .  i won no end of games .         but you lost money     said granny .   nanny ogg looked down again  and muttered something .      what .     said granny .      i said i won nearly all of them     said nanny .     and then i thought  here  we could really have a bit of money to  you know  spend in the city  and i   ve always been very good at cripple mr .  onion           so you decided to bet heavily     said granny .      how did you know that .         got a feelin    about it     said granny wearily .     and suddenly everyone else was lucky  am i right .         it was weird     said nanny .      hmm .         well  it   s not gambling     said nanny .     i didn   t see it was gambling .  they were no good when i started playing .  it   s not gambling to play against someone who   s no good .  it   s common sense .         there was nearly fourteen dollars in that bag     said magrat     not counting the foreign money .         hmm .      granny weatherwax sat down on the bunk and drummed her fingers on the woodwork .  there was a faraway look in her eyes .  the phrase    card sharp    had never reached her side of the ramtops  where people were friendly and direct and  should they encounter a professional cheat  tended to nail his hand to the table in an easy and outgoing manner without asking him what he called himself .  but human nature was the same everywhere .      you   re not upset  are you  esme .     said nanny anxiously .      hmm .         i expect i can soon pick up a new broom when we get home .         hm   what .         after she lost all her money she bet her broom     said magrat triumphantly .      have we got any money at all .     said granny .   a trawl of various pockets and knicker legs produced forty seven pence .      right     said granny .  she scooped it up .     that ought to be enough .  to start with  anyway .  where are these men .         what are you going to do .     said magrat .      i   m going to play cards     said granny .      you can   t do that .     said magrat  who had recognized the gleam in granny   s eye .     you   re going to use magic to win .  you mustn   t use magic to win .  not to affect the laws of chance .  that   s wicked .        the boat was practically a floating town  and in the balmy night air no one bothered much about going indoors .  the riverboat   s flat deck was dotted with groups of dwarfs  trolls and humans  lounging among the cargo .  granny threaded her way between them and headed for the long saloon that ran almost the entire length of the boat .  there was the sound of revelry within .   the riverboats were the quickest and easiest transport for hundreds of miles .  on them you got  as granny would put it  all sorts  and the riverboats going downstream were always crowded with a certain type of opportunist as fat lunchtime approached .   she walked into the saloon .  an onlooker might have thought it had a magic doorway .  granny weatherwax  as she walked toward it  strode as she usually strode .  as soon as she passed through  though  she was suddenly a bent old woman  hobbling along  and a sight to touch all but the wickedest heart .   she approached the bar  and then stopped .  behind it was the biggest mirror granny had ever seen .  she stared fixedly at it  but it seemed safe enough .  well  she   d have to risk it .   she hunched her back a little more and addressed the barman .      excuzee moir  young homme     she began .   .   the barman gave her a disinterested look and went on polishing a glass .      what can i do for you  old crone .     he said .   there was only the faintest suggestion of a flicker in granny   s expression of elderly imbecility .      oh   you can understand me .     she said .      we get all sorts on the river     said the barman .      then i was wondering if you could be so kind as to loan me a deck  i thinks it   s called  of cards     quavered granny .      going to play a game of old maid  are you .     said the barman .   there was a chilly flicker across granny   s eyes again as she said     no .  just patience .  i   d like to try and get the hang of it .      he reached under the counter and tossed a greasy pack toward her .   she thanked him effusively and tottered off to a small table in the shadows  where she dealt a few cards randomly on the drink ringed surface and stared at them .   it was only a few minutes later that a gentle hand was laid on her shoulder .  she looked up into a friendly  open face that anyone would lend money to .  a gold tooth glittered as the man spoke .      excuse me  good mother     he said     but my friends and i      he gestured to some more welcoming faces at a nearby table      would feel much more comfortable in ourselves if you were to join us .  it can be very dangerous for a woman traveling by herself .      granny weatherwax smiled nicely at him  and then waved vaguely at her cards .      i can never remember whether the ones are worth more or less than the pictures     she said .     forget my own head next  i expect .      they all laughed .  granny hobbled to the other table .  she took the vacant seat  which put the mirror right behind her shoulder .   she smiled to herself and then leaned forward  all eagerness .      so tell me     she said     how do you play this game  then .        all witches are very conscious of stories .  they can feel stories  in the same way that a bather in a little pool can feel the unexpected trout .   knowing how stories work is almost all the battle .   for example  when an obvious innocent sits down with three experienced card sharpers and says    how do you play this game  then .      someone is about to be shaken down until their teeth fall out .     magrat and nanny ogg sat side by side on the narrow bunk .  nanny was distractedly tickling greebo   s stomach  while he purred .      she   ll get into terrible trouble if she uses magic to win     said magrat .     and you know how she hates losing     she added .   granny weatherwax was not a good loser .  from her point of view  losing was something that happened to other people .      it   s her eggo     said nanny ogg .     everyone   s got one o    them .  a eggo .  and she   s got a great big one .  of course  that   s all part of bein    a witch  having a big eggo .         she   s bound to use magic     said magrat .      it   s tempting fate  using magic in a game of chance     said nanny ogg .     cheatin   s all right .  that   s practic   ly fair .  i mean  anyone can cheat .  but using magic   well  it   s tempting fate .         no .  not fate     said magrat darkly .   nanny ogg shivered .      come on     said magrat .     we can   t let her do it .         it   s her eggo     said nanny ogg weakly .     terrible thing  a big eggo .           i got     said granny     three little pictures of kings and suchlike and three of them funny number one cards .      the three men beamed and winked at one another .      that   s triple onion .     said the one who had introduced granny to the table  and who had turned out to be called mister frank .      and that   s good  is it .     said granny .      it means you win yet again  dear lady .     he pushed a pile of pennies toward her .      gosh     said granny .     that means i   ve got   what would it be   almost five dollars now .         can   t understand it     said mister frank .     it must be the famous beginner   s luck  eh .         soon be poor men if it goes on like this     said one of his companions .      she   ll have the coats off our backs  right enough     said the third man .     haha .         think we should give up right now     said mister frank .     haha .         haha .         haha .         oh  i want to go on     said granny  grinning anxiously .     i   m just getting the hang of it .         well  you   d better give us a sporting chance to win a little bit back  haha     said mister frank .     haha .         haha .         haha .         haha .  what about half a dollar a stake .  haha .         oh  i reckon she   ll want a dollar a stake  a sporting lady like her     said the third man .      haha .      granny looked down at her pile of pennies .  for a moment she looked uncertain and then  they could see  she realized  how much could she lose  the way the cards were going .      yes .     she said .     a dollar a stake .     she blushed .     this is exciting  isn   t it .         yeah     said mister frank .  he drew the pack toward him .   there was a horrible noise .  all three men stared at the bar  where shards of mirror were cascading to the floor .      what happened .      granny gave him a sweet old smile .  she hadn   t appeared to look around .      i reckon the glass he was polishing must of slipped out of his hand and smashed right into the mirror     she said .     i do hope he don   t have to pay for it out of his wages  the poor boy .      the men exchanged glances .      come on     said granny     i   ve got my dollar all ready .      mister frank looked nervously at the ravaged frame .  then he shrugged .   the movement dislodged something somewhere .  there was a muffled snapping noise  like a mousetrap carrying out the last rites .  mister frank went white and gripped his sleeve .  a small metal contraption  all springs and twisted metal  fell out .  a crumpled up ace of cups was tangled up in it .      whoops     said granny .     magrat peered through the window into the saloon .      what   s she doin    now .     hissed nanny ogg .      she   s grinning again     said magrat .   nanny ogg shook her head .     eggo     she said .     granny weatherwax had that method of play that has reduced professional gamblers to incoherent rage throughout the multiverse .   she held her cards tightly cupped in her hands a few inches from her face  allowing the merest fraction of each one to protrude .  she glared at them as if daring them to offend her .  and she never seemed to take her eyes off them  except to watch the dealing .   and she took far too long .  and she never  ever  took risks .   after twenty five minutes she was down one dollar and mister frank was sweating .  granny had already helpfully pointed out three times that he   d accidentally dealt cards off the bottom of the deck  and she   d asked for another pack    because  look  this one   s got all little marks on the back .      it was her eyes  that was what it was .  twice he   d folded on a perfectly good three card onion only to find that she   d been holding a lousy double bagel .  then the third time  thinking he   d worked out her play  he   d called her out and run a decent flush right into the maw of a five card onion that the old bag must have been patiently constructing for ages .  and then   his knuckles went white   and then the dreadful  terrible hag had said     have i won .  with all these little cards .  gorsh   aren   t i the lucky one .      and then she started humming when she looked at her cards .  normally  the three of them would have welcomed this sort of thing .  the teeth tappers  the eyebrow raisers  the ear rubbers   they were as good as money in the sock under the mattress  to a man who knew how to read such things .  but the appalling old crone was as transparent as a lump of coal .  and the humming was   insistent .  you found yourself trying to follow the tune .  it made your teeth tingle .  next thing you were glumly watching while she laid down a measly broken flush in front of your even more measly two card onion and said     what  is it me again .      mister frank was desperately trying to remember how to play cards without his sleeve device  a handy mirror and a marked deck .  in the teeth of a hum like a fingernail down a blackboard .   it wasn   t as if the ghastly old creature even knew how to play properly .   after an hour she was four dollars ahead and when she said     i am a lucky girl .     mister frank bit through his tongue .   and then he got a natural great onion .  there was no realistic way to beat a great onion .  it was something that happened to you once or twice in a lifetime .   she folded .  the old bitch folded .  she abandoned one blasted dollar and she folded .     magrat peered through the window again .      what   s happening .     said nanny .      they all look very angry .      nanny took off her hat and removed her pipe .  she lit it and tossed the match overboard .     ah .  she   ll be humming  you mark my words .  she   s got a very annoying hum  has esme .     nanny looked satisfied .     has she started cleaning out her ear yet .         don   t think so .         no one cleans out her ear like esme .        she was cleaning out her ear .   it was done in a very ladylike way  and the daft old baggage probably wasn   t even aware she was doing it .  she just kept inserting her little finger in her ear and swiveling it around .  it made a noise like a small pool cue being chalked .   it was displacement activity  that   s what it was .  they all cracked in the end     she folded again .  and it had taken him bloody five bloody minutes to put together a bloody onion .        i remember     said nanny ogg     when she come over our house for the party when king verence got crowned and we played chase my neighbor up the passage with the kiddies for ha   pennies .  she accused jason   s youngest of cheating and sulked for a week afterward .         was he cheating .         i expect so     said nanny proudly .     the trouble with esme is that she don   t know how to lose .  she   s never had much practice .         lobsang dibbler says sometimes you have to lose in order to win     said magrat .      sounds daft to me     said nanny .     that   s yen buddhism  is it .         no .  they   re the ones who say you have to have lots of money to win     said magrat .      in the path of the scorpion  the way to win is to lose every fight except the last one .  you use the enemy   s strength against himself .         what  you get him to hit himself  sort of thing .     said nanny .     sounds daft .      magrat glowered .      what do you know about it .     she said  with uncharacteristic sharpness .      what .         well  i   m fed up .     said magrat .     at least i   m making an effort to learn things .  i don   t go around just bullying people and acting bad tempered all the time .      nanny took her pipe out of her mouth .      i   m not bad tempered     she said mildly .      i wasn   t talking about you .         well  esme   s always been bad tempered     said nanny .     it comes natural to her .         and she hardly ever does real magic .  what good is being a witch if you don   t do magic .  why doesn   t she use it to help people .      nanny peered at her through the pipe smoke .         cos she knows how good she   d be at it  i suppose     she said .     anyway  i   ve known her a long time .  known the whole family .  all the weatherwaxes is good at magic  even the men .  they   ve got this magical streak in    em .  kind of a curse .  anyway   she thinks you can   t help people with magic .  not properly .  it   s true  too .         then what good    .      nanny prodded at the pipe with a match .      i seem to recall she come over and helped you out when you had that spot of plague in your village     she said .     worked the clock around  i recall .  never known her not treat someone ill who needed it  even when they  you know  were pretty oozy .  and when the big ole troll that lives under broken mountain came down for help because his wife was sick and everyone threw rocks at him  i remember it was esme that went back with him and delivered the baby .  hah   then when old chickenwire hopkins threw a rock at esme a little while afterward all his barns was mysteriously trampled flat in the night .  she always said you can   t help people with magic  but you can help them with skin .  by doin    real things  she meant .         i   m not saying she   s not basically a nice person       magrat began .      hah .  i am .  you   d have to go a long day   s journey to find someone basically nastier than esme     said nanny ogg     and this is me sayin    it .  she knows exactly what she is .  she was born to be good and she don   t like it .      nanny tapped her pipe out on the rail and turned back to the saloon .      what you got to understand about esme  my girl     she said     is that she   s got a psycholology as well as a big eggo .  i   m damn glad i ain   t .        granny was twelve dollars ahead .  everything else in the saloon had stopped .  you could hear the distant splash of the paddles and the cry of the leadman .   granny won another five dollars with a three card onion .        what do you mean  a psycholology .     said magrat .     have you been reading books .      nanny ignored her .      the thing to watch out for now     she said     is when she goes    tch  tch  tch    under her breath .  that comes after the ear cleanin    .  it gen   rally means she   s plannin    somethin    .        mister frank drummed his fingers on the table  realized to his horror that he was doing it  and bought three new cards to cover his confusion .  the old baggage didn   t appear to notice .   he stared at the new hand .   he ventured two dollars and bought one more card .   he stared again .   what were the odds  he thought  against getting a great onion twice in one day .   the important thing was not to panic .      i think     he heard himself say     that i may hazard another two dollars .      he glanced at his companions .  they obediently folded  one after another .      well  i don   t know     said granny  apparently talking to her cards .  she cleaned her ear again .     tch  tch  tch .  what d   you call it when  you know  you want to put more money in  sort of thing .         it   s called raising     said mister frank  his knuckles going white .      i   ll do one of them raisins  then .  five dollars  i think .      mister frank   s knees ground together .      i   ll see you and raise you ten dollars     he snapped .         i   ll do that too     said granny .      i can go another twenty dollars .         i       granny looked down  suddenly crestfallen .     i   ve   got a broomstick .      a tiny alarm bell rang somewhere at the back of mister frank   s mind  but now he was galloping headlong to victory .      right .      he spread the cards on the table .   the crowd sighed .   he began to pull the pot toward him .   granny   s hand closed over his wrist .      i ain   t put my cards down yet     she said archly .      you don   t need to     snapped mister frank .     there   s no chance you could beat that  madam .         i can if i can cripple it     said granny .     that   s why it   s called cripple mister onion  ain   t it .      he hesitated .      but   but   you could only do that if you had a perfect ninecard run     he burbled  staring into the depths of her eyes .   granny sat back .      you know     she said calmly     i thought i had rather a lot of these black pointy ones .  that   s good  is it .      she spread the hand .  the collective audience made a sort of little gasping noise  in unison .   mister frank looked around wildly .      oh  very well done  madam     said an elderly gentleman .  there was a round of polite applause from the crowd .  the big  inconvenient crowd .      er   yes     said mister frank .     yes .  well done .  you   re a very quick learner  aren   t you .         quicker   n you .  you owe me fifty five dollars and a broomstick     said granny .     magrat and nanny ogg were waiting for her as she swept out .      here   s your broom     she snapped .     and i hopes you   ve got all your stuff together     cos we   re leaving .         why .     said magrat .      because as soon as it gets quiet  some men are going to come looking for us .      they scurried after her toward their tiny cabin .      you weren   t using magic .     said magrat .      no .         and not cheating .     said nanny ogg .      no .  just headology     said granny .      where did you learn to play like that .     nanny demanded .   granny stopped .  they cannoned into her .      remember last winter  when old mother dismass was taken really bad and i went and sat up with her every night for almost a month .         yes .         you sit up every night dealing cripple mister onion with someone who   s got a detached retina in her second sight and you soon learn how to play     said granny .       dear jason and everyone      what you get more of in foreign parts is smells  i am getting good at them .  esme is shouting at everyone  i think she thinks they   re bein foreign just to spite her  don   t know when i last saw her enjoi herselfe so much .  mind you they need a good shakin up if you ask me  for lunch we stopped somehwere and they did steak tartere and they acted very snooty just becos i wanted myne well done .  all the best  mum    the moon was closer here .   the orbit of the discworld   s moon meant that it was quite high when it passed over the high ramtops .  here  nearer to the rim  it was bigger .  and more orange .      like a pumpkin     said nanny ogg .      i thought we said we weren   t going to mention pumpkins     said magrat .      well  we didn   t have any supper     said nanny .   and there was another thing .  except during the height of summer the witches weren   t used to warm nights .  it didn   t seem right  gliding along under a big orange moon over dark foliage that clicked and buzzed and whirred with insects .      we must be far enough from the river now     said magrat .     can   t we land  granny .  no one could have followed us .      granny weatherwax looked down .  the river in this countryside meandered in huge glistening curves  taking twenty miles to cover five .  the land between the snaking water was a patchwork of hillsides and woodlands .  a distant glow might have been genua itself .      riding a broomstick all night is a right pain in the itinerant     said nanny .      oh  all right .         there   s a town over there     said magrat .     and a castle .         oh  not another one           it   s a nice little castle     said magrat .     can   t we just call in .  i   m fed up with inns .      granny looked down .  she had very good night vision .      are you sure that   s a castle .     she said .      i can see the turrets and everything     said magrat .     of course it   s a castle .         hmm .  i can see more than turrets     said granny .     i think we   d better have a look at this  gytha .        there was never any noise in the sleeping castle  except in the late summer when ripe berries fell off the bramble vines and burst softly on the floor .  and sometimes birds would try to nest in the thorn thickets that now filled the throne room from floor to ceiling  but they never got very far before they  too  fell asleep .  apart from that  you   d need very keen hearing indeed to hear the growth of shoots and the opening of buds .   it had been like this for ten years .  there was no sound in the      open up there .         bony fidy travelers seeking sucker .         no sound in the        here  give us a leg up  magrat .  right .  now        there was a tinkle of broken glass .      you   ve broken their window .         not a sound in the        you   ll have to offer to pay for it  you know .      the castle gate swung open slowly .  nanny ogg peered around it at the other two witches  while pulling thorns and burrs from her hair .      it   s bloody disgusting in here     she said .     there   s people asleep all over the place with spiders    webs all over    em .  you were right  esme .  there   s been magic going on .      the witches pushed their way through the overgrown castle .  dust and leaves had covered the carpets .  young sycamores were making a spirited attempt to take over the courtyard .  vines festooned every wall .   granny weatherwax pulled a slumbering soldier to his feet .  dust billowed off his clothes .      wake up     she demanded .      fzhtft     said the soldier  and slumped back .      it   s like that everywhere     said magrat  fighting her way through a thicket of bracken that was growing up from the kitchen regions .     there   s the cooks all snoring and nothing but mold in the pots .  there   s even mice asleep in the pantry .         hmm     said nanny .     there   ll be a spinning wheel at the bottom of all this  you mark my words .         a black aliss job .     said nanny ogg .      looks like it     said granny .  then she added  quietly     or someone like her .         now there was a witch who knew how stories worked     said nanny .     she used to be in as many as three of    em at once .      even magrat knew about black aliss .  she was said to have been the greatest witch who ever lived   not exactly bad  but so powerful it was sometimes hard to tell the difference .  when it came to sending palaces to sleep for a hundred years or getting princesses to spin straw into glod   no one did it better than black aliss .      i met her once     said nanny  as they climbed the castle   s main staircase  which was a cascade of old man   s trousers .     old deliria skibbly took me to see her once  when i was a girl .  of course  she was getting pretty   eccentric by then .  gingerbread houses  that kind of thing .     she spoke sadly  as one might talk about an elderly relative who   d taken to wearing her underwear outside her clothes .      that must have been before those two children shut her up in her own oven .     said magrat  untangling her sleeve from a briar .      yeah .  sad  that .  i mean  she didn   t really ever eat anyone     said nanny .     well .  not often .  i mean  there was talk  but           that   s what happens     said granny .     you get too involved with stories  you get confused .  you don   t know what   s really real and what isn   t .  and they get you in the end .  they send you weird in the head .  i don   t like stories .  they   re not real .  i don   t like things that ain   t real .      she pushed open a door .      ah .  a chamber     she said sourly .     could even be a bower .         doesn   t the stuff grow quickly .     said magrat .      part of the time spell     said granny .     ah .  there she is .  knew there   d be someone somewhere .      there was a figure lying on a bed  in a thicket of rose bushes .      and there   s the spinning wheel     said nanny  pointing to a shape just visible in a clump of ivy .      don   t touch it .     said granny .      don   t worry  i   ll pick it up by the treadle and pitch it out of the window .         how do you know all this .     said magrat .         cos it   s a rural myth     said nanny .     it   s happened lots of times .      granny weatherwax and magrat looked down at the sleeping figure of a girl of about thirteen  almost silvery under the dust and pollen .      isn   t she pretty     sighed magrat  the generous hearted .   from behind them came the crash of a spinning wheel on some distant cobbles  and then nanny ogg appeared  brushing her hands .      seen it happen a dozen times     she said .      no you ain   t     said granny .      once  anyway     said nanny  unabashed .     and i heard about it dozens of times .  everyone has .  rural myth  like i said .  everyone   s heard about it happening in their cousin   s friend   s neighbor   s village           that   s because it does     said granny .   granny picked up the girl   s wrist .      she   s asleep because she   ll have got a       nanny said .   granny turned .      i know  i know .  i know  right .  i know as well as you .  you think i don   t know .     she bent over the limp hand .     that   s fairy godmothering  this is     she added  half to herself .     always do it impressively .  always meddling  always trying to be in control .  hah .  someone got a bit of poison .  send everyone to sleep for a hundred years .  do it the easy way .  all this for one prick .  as if that was the end of the world .     she paused .  nanny ogg was standing behind her .  there was no possible way she could have detected her expression .     gytha .         yes  esme .     said nanny ogg innocently .      i can feel you grinnin    .  you can save the tu   penny ha   penny psycholology for them as wants it .      granny shut her eyes and muttered a few words .      shall i use my wand .     said magrat hesitantly .      don   t you dare     said granny  and went back to her muttering .   nanny nodded .     she   s definitely getting a bit of color back     she said .   a few minutes later the girl opened her eyes and stared up blearily at granny weatherwax .      time to get up     said granny  in an unusually cheerful voice     you   re missing the best part of the decade .      the girl tried to focus on nanny  then on magrat  and then looked back at granny weatherwax .      you .     she said .   granny raised her eyebrows and looked at the other two .      me .         you are   still here .         still .     said granny .     never been here before in my life  miss .         but       the girl looked bewildered .  and frightened  magrat noticed .      i   m like that myself in the mornings  dear     said nanny ogg  taking the girl   s other hand and patting it .     never at my best till i   ve had a cup of tea .  i expect everyone else   ll be waking up any minute .  of course  it   ll take    em a while to clean the rats    nests out of the kettles   esme .      granny was staring at a dust covered shape on the wall .      meddling       she whispered .      what   s up  esme .      granny weatherwax strode across the room and wiped the dust off a huge ornate mirror .      hah .     she said  and spun around .     we   ll be going now     she said .      but i thought we were going to have a rest .  i mean  it   s nearly dawn     said magrat .      no sense in outstaying our welcome     said granny  as she left the room .      but we haven   t even had a       magrat began .  she glanced at the mirror .  it was a big oval one  in a gilt frame .  it looked perfectly normal .  it wasn   t like granny weatherwax to be frightened of her own reflection .      she   s in one of her moods again     said nanny ogg .     come on .  no sense in staying here .     she patted the bewildered princess on the head .     cheerio  miss .  a couple of weeks with a broom and an axe and you   ll soon have the old place looking like new .         she looked as if she recognized granny     said magrat  as they followed the stiff hurrying figure of esme weatherwax down the stairs .      well  we know she doesn   t  don   t we     said nanny ogg .     esme has never been in these parts in her life .         but i still don   t see why we have to rush off     magrat persisted .     i expect people will be jolly grateful that we   ve broken the spell and everything .      the rest of the palace was waking up .  they jogged past guards staring in amazement at their cobwebbed uniforms and the bushes that were growing everywhere .  as they crossed the forested courtyard an older man in faded robes staggered out of a doorway and leaned against the wall  trying to get his bearings .  then he saw the accelerating figure of granny weatherwax .      you .     he shouted  and     guards .      nanny ogg didn   t hesitate .  she snatched magrat   s elbow and broke into a run  catching up with granny weatherwax at the castle gates .  a guard who was better at mornings than his colleague staggered forward and made an attempt to bar their way with his pike  but granny just pushed at it and swiveled him around gently .   then they were outside and running for the broomsticks leaning against a convenient tree .  granny snatched at hers without stopping and  for once  it fired up on almost the first attempt .   an arrow whiffled past her hat and stuck in a branch .      i don   t call that gratitude     said magrat  as the brooms glided up and over the trees .      a lot of people are never at their best just after waking up     said nanny .      everyone seemed to think they knew you  granny     said magrat .   granny   s broomstick jerked in the wind .      they didn   t .     she shouted .     they never saw me before  all right .      they flew on in troubled silence for a while .   then magrat  who in nanny ogg   s opinion had an innocent talent for treading on dangerous ground  said     i wonder if we did the right thing .  i   m sure it was a job for a handsome prince .         hah .     said granny  who was riding ahead .     and what good would that be .  cutting your way through a bit of bramble is how you can tell he   s going to be a good husband  is it .  that   s fairy godmotherly thinking  that is .  goin    around inflicting happy endings on people whether they wants them or not  eh .         there   s nothing wrong with happy endings     said magrat hotly .      listen  happy endings is fine if they turn out happy     said granny  glaring at the sky .     but you can   t make    em for other people .  like the only way you could make a happy marriage is by cuttin    their heads off as soon as they say    i do     yes .  you can   t make happiness        granny weatherwax stared at the distant city .      all you can do     she said     is make an ending .        they had breakfast in a forest clearing .  it was grilled pumpkin .  the dwarf bread was brought out for inspection .  but it was miraculous  the dwarf bread .  no one ever went hungry when they had some dwarf bread to avoid .  you only had to look at it for a moment  and instantly you could think of dozens of things you   d rather eat .  your boots  for example .  mountains .  raw sheep .  your own foot .   then they tried to get some sleep .  at least  nanny and magrat did .  but all it meant was that they lay awake and listened to granny weatherwax muttering under her breath .  they   d never seen her so upset .   afterward  nanny suggested that they walk for a while .  it was a nice day  she said .  this was an interesting kind of forest  she said  with lots of new herbs which could do with bein    looked at .  everyone   d feel better for a stroll in the sunshine  she said .  it   d improve their tempers .   and it was  indeed  a nice forest .  after half an hour or so  even granny weatherwax was prepared to admit that in certain respects it wasn   t totally foreign and shoddy .  magrat wandered off the path occasionally  picking flowers .  nanny even sang a few verses of a wizard   s staff has a knob on the end with no more than a couple of token protests from the other two .   but there was still something wrong .  nanny ogg and magrat could feel something between them and granny weatherwax  some sort of mental wall  something important deliberately hidden and unsaid .  witches usually had few secrets from one another  if only because they were all so nosy that there was never any chance to have secrets .  it was worrying .   and then they turned a corner by a stand of huge oak trees and met the little girl in the red cloak .   she was skipping along in the middle of the path  singing a song that was simpler and a good deal cleaner than any in nanny ogg   s repertoire .  she didn   t see the witches until she was almost on top of them .  she stopped  and then smiled innocently .      hello  old women     she said .      ahem     said magrat .   granny weatherwax bent down .      what   re you doing out in the forest all by yourself  young lady .         i   m taking this basket of goodies to my granny     said the girl .   granny straightened up  a faraway look in her eyes .      esme     said nanny ogg urgently .      i know .  i know     said granny .   magrat leaned down and set her face in the idiot grimace generally used by adults who   d love to be good with children and don   t stand a dog   s chance of ever achieving it .     er .  tell me  miss   did your mother tell you to watch out for any bad wolves that might happen to be in the vicinity .         that   s right .         and your granny       said nanny ogg .     i guess she   s a bit bedbound at the moment  right .         that   s why i   m taking her this basket of goodies       the child began .      thought so .         do you know my granny .     said the child .      ye   ess     said granny weatherwax .     in a way .         it happened over skund way when i was a girl     said nanny ogg quietly .     they never even found the gran           and where is your granny   s cottage  little girl .     said granny weatherwax loudly  nudging nanny sharply in the ribs .   the girl pointed up a side track .      you   re not the wicked witch  are you .     she said .   nanny ogg coughed .      me .  no .  we   re   we   re       granny began .      fairies     said magrat .   granny weatherwax   s mouth dropped open .  such an explanation would never have occurred to her .      only my mummy warned me about the wicked witch too     said the girl .  she gave magrat a sharp look .     what kind of fairies .         er .  flower fairies .     said magrat .     look  i   ve got a wand           which ones .         what .         which flowers .         er     said magrat .     well .  i   m   fairy tulip and that   s       she avoided looking directly at granny       fairy   daisy   and this is           fairy hedgehog     said nanny ogg .   this addition to the supernatural pantheon was given due consideration .      you can   t be fairy hedgehog     said the child  after some thought .     a hedgehog   s not a flower .         how do you know .            cos it   s got spikes .         so   s holly .  and thistles .         oh .         and i   ve got a wand     said magrat .  only now did she risk a look at fairy daisy .      we ought to be getting along     said granny weatherwax .     you just stay here with fairy tulip  i think it was  and we   ll just go and make sure your granny   s all right .  all right .         i bet it   s not a real wand     said the child  ignoring her and facing magrat with a child   s unerring ability to find a weak link in any chain .     i bet it can   t turn things into things .         well       magrat began .      i bet     said the girl     i bet you can   t turn that tree stump over there into   into   into a pumpkin .  haha  bet you anything you can   t .  bet you a trillion dollars you can   t turn that stump into a pumpkin .         i can see the two of you are going to get along fine     said fairy hedgehog .     we won   t be long .        two broomsticks skimmed low above the forest path .      could just be coincidence     said nanny ogg .         t   aint     said granny .     the child even has a red cloak on .         i had a red cloak when i was fifteen     said nanny .      yes  but your granny lived next door .  you didn   t have to worry about wolves when you visited her     said granny .      except old sumpkins the lodger .         yes  but that was just coincidence .      a trail of blue smoke drifted among the trees ahead of them .  somewhere away to one side there was the sound of a falling tree .      woodcutters .     said nanny .     it   s all right if there   s woodcutters .  one of them rushes in           that   s only what children get told     said granny  as they sped onward .     anyway  that   s no good to the grandmother  is it .  she   s already been et .         i always hated that story     said nanny .     no one ever cares what happens to poor defenseless old women .      the path vanished abruptly on the edge of a glade .  hemmed in by the trees was a straggly kitchen garden  in which a few pathetic stalks fought for what little sun there was .  in the middle of the garden was what had to be a thatched cottage because no one would build a haystack that badly .   they leapt off the broomsticks  leaving them to drift to a halt in the bushes  and hammered on the cottage door .      we could be too late     said nanny .     the wolf might        after a while there was the muffled sound of someone shuffling across the floor within  and then the door opened a crack .  a suspicious eye was visible in the gloom .      yes .     said a small and quavering voice from somewhere beneath the eye .      are you grandmother .     granny weatherwax demanded .      are you the taxgatherers  dear .         no  ma   am  we   re              fairies     said fairy hedgehog quickly .      i don   t open the door to people i don   t know  dear     said the voice  and then it took on a slightly petulant tone .        specially people who never does the washing up even after i leaves out a bowl of nearly fresh milk for    em .         we   d like to talk to you for a few minutes     said fairy daisy .      yes .  have you got any identification  dear .         i know we   ve got the right grandmother     said fairy hedgehog .     there   s a family likeness .  she   s got big ears .         look  it   s not her that   s got the big ears     snapped fairy daisy .     it   ll be the wolf that   s got big ears .  that   s the whole point .  don   t you ever pay attention .      the grandmother watched them with interest .  after a lifetime of believing in them she was seeing fairies for the first time  and it was an experience .  granny weatherwax caught her perplexed expression .      put it like this  ma   am     she said  in a despotically reasonable tone of voice     how would you like to be eaten alive by a wolf .         i don   t think i would like that  dear  no     said the hidden grandmother .      the alternative   s us     said granny .      lawks .  are you sure .         on our word as fairies     said fairy hedgehog .      well .  really .  all right .  you can come in .  but none of your tricks .  and mind you do the washing up .  you haven   t got a pot of gold about you  have you .         that   s pixies  isn   t it .         no  they   re the ones in wells .  it   s goblins she means .         don   t be daft .  they   re the ones you get under bridges .         that   s trolls .  everyone knows that   s trolls .         not us  anyway .         oh     said the grandmother .     i might have known .        magrat liked to think she was good with children  and worried that she wasn   t .  she didn   t like them very much  and worried about this too .  nanny ogg seemed to be effortlessly good with children by alternately and randomly giving them either a sweet or a thick ear  while granny weatherwax ignored them for most of the time and that seemed to work just as well .  whereas magrat cared .  it didn   t seem fair .      bet you a million trillion zillion dollars you can   t turn that bush into a pumpkin     said the child .      but  look  all the others got turned into pumpkins     magrat pointed out .      it   s bound not to work sooner or later     said the child placidly .   magrat looked helplessly at the wand .  she   d tried everything   wishing  sub vocalizing and even  when she   d thought the other witches were out of earshot  banging it against things and shouting     anything but pumpkins .         you don   t know how to do it really  do you     stated the child .      tell me     said magrat     you said your mummy knows about the big bad wolf in the woods  didn   t you .         that   s right .         but nevertheless she sent you out by yourself to take those goodies to your granny .         that   s right .  why .         nothing .  just thinking .  and you owe me a million trillion zillion squillion dollars .        there   s a certain freemasonry about grandmothers  with the added benefit that no one has to stand on one leg or recite any oaths in order to join .  once inside the cottage  and with a kettle on the boil  nanny ogg was quite at home .  greebo stretched out in front of the meager fire and dozed off as the witches tried to explain .      i don   t see how a wolf can get in here  dear     said the grandmother kindly .     i mean  they   re wolves .  they can   t open doors .      granny weatherwax twitched aside a rag of curtain and glared out at the clearing .      we know     she said .   nanny ogg nodded toward the little bed in an alcove by the fireplace .      is that where you always sleep .     she said .      when i   m feeling poorly  dear .  other times i sleeps in the attic .         i should get along up there now  if i was you .  and take my cat up with you  will you .  we don   t want him getting in the way .         is this the bit where you clean the house and do all the washing for a saucer of milk .     said the grandmother hopefully .      could be .  you never know .         funny  dear .  i was expecting you to be shorter           we get out in the fresh air a lot     said nanny .     off you go now .      that left the two of them .  granny weatherwax looked around the cave like room .  the rushes on the floor were well on the way to composthood .  soot encrusted the cobwebs on the ceiling .   the only way housework could be done in this place was with a shovel or  for preference  a match .      funny  really     said nanny  when the old woman had climbed the rickety stairs .     she   s younger   n me .  mind you  i take exercise .         you never took exercise in your life     said granny weatherwax  still watching the bushes .     you never did anything you didn   t want to do .         that   s what i mean     said nanny happily .     look  esme  i still say this could all be just           it ain   t .  i can feel the story .  someone   s been making stories happen in these parts  i know it .         and you know who  too .  don   t you  esme .     said nanny slyly .   she saw granny look around wildly at the grubby walls .      i reckon she   s too poor to afford a mirror     said nanny .     i ain   t blind  esme .  and i know mirrors and fairy godmothers go together .  so what   s going on .         i ain   t saying .  i don   t want to look a fool if i   m wrong .  i   m not going to   there   s something coming .      nanny ogg pressed her nose against the dirty window .      can   t see anything .         the bushes moved .  get into the bed .         me .  i thought it was you who was going into the bed .         can   t imagine why you   d think that .         no .  come to think of it  neither can i     said nanny wearily .  she picked up the floppy mob cap from the bedpost  put it on  and slid under the patchwork quilt .         ere  this mattress is stuffed with straw .         you won   t have to lie on it for long .         it prickles .  and i think there   s things in it .      something bumped against the wall of the house .  the witches fell silent .   there was a snuffling noise under the back door .      you know     whispered nanny  as they waited     the scullery   s terrible .  there   s no firewood .  and there   s hardly any food .  and there   s a jug of milk that   s practically on the march        granny sidled quickly across the room to the fireplace  and then back to her station by the front door .   after a moment there was a scrabbling at the latch  as if it was being operated by someone who was unfamiliar either with doors or with fingers .   the door creaked open slowly .   there was an overwhelming smell of musk and wet fur .   uncertain footsteps tottered across the floor and toward the figure huddling under the bedclothes .   nanny raised the mob cap   s floppy frill just enough to see out .      wotcha     she said  and then     oh  blimey  i never realized you had teeth that big        granny weatherwax pushed the door shut and stepped forward briskly .  the wolf spun around  a paw raised protectively .      nooaaaaaw .      granny hesitated for a second  and then hit it very hard on the head with a cast iron frying pan .   the wolf crumpled .   nanny ogg swung her legs out of the bed .      when it happened over skund way they said it was a werewolf or something  and i thought  no  werewolves aren   t like that     she said .     i never thought it was a real wolf .  gave me quite a turn  that .         real wolves don   t walk on their hind legs and open doors     said granny weatherwax .     come on  help me get it outside .         took me right back  seeing a great big hairy slathering thing heading toward me     said nanny  picking up one end of the stunned creature .     did you ever meet old sumpkins .      it was  indeed  a normal looking wolf  except that it was a lot thinner than most .  ribs showed plainly under the skin and the fur was matted .  granny hauled a bucket of cloudy water from the well next to the privy and poured it over its head .   then she sat down on a tree stump and watched it carefully .  a few birds sang  high in the branches .      it spoke     she said .     it tried to say    no    .         i wondered about that     said nanny .     then i thought maybe i was imagining things .         no point in imagining anything     said granny .     things are bad enough as they are .      the wolf groaned .  granny handed the frying pan to nanny ogg .   after a while she said     i think i   m going to have a look inside its head .      nanny ogg shook her head .     i wouldn   t do that  if i was you .         i   m the one who   s me  and i   ve got to know .  just you stand by with the frying pan .      nanny shrugged .   granny concentrated .     it is very difficult to read a human mind .  most humans are thinking about so many things at any given moment that it is almost impossible to pick out one stream in the flood .   animal minds are different .  far less cluttered .  carnivore minds are easiest of all  especially before meals .  colors don   t exist in the mental world  but  if they did  a hungry carnivore mind would be hot and purple and sharp as an arrow .  and herbivore minds are simple  too   coiled silver springs  poised for flight .   but this wasn   t any kind of normal mind .  it was two minds .   granny had sometimes picked up the mind of hunters in the forest  when she was sitting quietly of an evening and letting her mind wander .  just occasionally they felt like this  or at least like a faint shadow of this .  just occasionally  when the hunter was about to make a kill  the random streams of thought came together .  but this was different .  this was the opposite   this was cracked and crippled attempts at cogitation peeling away from the sleek arrowhead of predatory intent .  this was a predatory mind trying to think .   no wonder it was going mad .     she opened her eyes .   nanny ogg held the frying pan over her head .  her arm trembled .      well     she said     who   s there .         i could do with a glass of water     said granny .  natural caution surfaced through the turmoil of her mind .     only not out of that well  mind you .      nanny relaxed a little .  when a witch started rummaging in someone else   s mind  you could never be sure who was coming back .  but granny weatherwax was the best .  magrat might always be trying to find herself  but granny didn   t even understand the idea of the search .  if she couldn   t find the way back to her own head  there wasn   t a path .      there   s that milk in the cottage     nanny volunteered .      what color was it again .         well   still fairly white .         okay .      when nanny ogg   s back was safely turned granny permitted herself a small shudder .   she stared at the wolf  wondering what she could do for it .  a normal wolf wouldn   t enter a cottage  even if it could open the door .  wolves didn   t come near humans at all  except if there were a lot of them and it was the end of a very hard winter .  and they didn   t do that because they were big and bad and wicked  but because they were wolves .   this wolf was trying to be human .   there was probably no cure .      here   s your milk     said nanny ogg .   granny reached up and took it without looking .      someone made this wolf think it was a person     she said .     they made it think it was a person and then they didn   t think anymore about it .  it happened a few years ago .         how do you know .         i   ve   got its memories     said granny .  and instincts  too  she thought .  she knew it   d be some days before she   d stop wanting to chase sledges over the snow .      oh .         it   s stuck between species .  in its head .         can we help it .     said nanny .   granny shook her head .      it   s gone on for too long .  it   s habit now .  and it   s starving .  it can   t go one way  it can   t go t   other .  it can   t act like a wolf  and it can   t manage being a human .  and it can   t go on like it is .      she turned to face nanny for the first time .  nanny took a step back .      you can   t imagine how it feels     she said .     wandering around for years .  not capable of acting human  and not able to be a wolf .  you can   t imagine how that feels .         i reckon maybe i can     said nanny .     in your face .  maybe i can .  who   d do that to a creature .         i   ve got my suspicions .      they looked around .   magrat was approaching  with the child .  beside them walked one of the woodcutters .      hah     said granny .     yes .  of course .  there   s always got to be      she spat the words      a happy ending .      a paw tried to grip her ankle .   granny weatherwax looked down into the wolf   s face .      preeees     it growled .     annn enndinggg .  noaaaow .      she knelt down  and took the paw .      yes .     she said .      yessss .      she stood up again  all authority  and beckoned to the approaching trio .      mr .  woodcutter .     she said .     a job for you          the woodcutter never understood why the wolf laid its head on the stump so readily .   or why the old woman  the one in whom anger roiled like pearl barley in a bubbling stew  insisted afterward that it be buried properly instead of skinned and thrown in the bushes .  she had been very insistent about that .   and that was the end of the big bad wolf .     it was an hour later .  quite a few of the woodcutters had wandered up to the cottage  where there seemed to be a lot of interesting activity going on .  woodcutting is not a job that normally offers much in the way of diversion .   magrat was washing the floor with as much magical assistance as could be afforded by a bucket of soapy water and a scrubbing brush .  even nanny ogg  whose desultory interest in the proud role of housewife had faded completely just as soon as her eldest daughter was old enough to hold a duster  was cleaning the walls .  the old grandmother  who wasn   t entirely in touch with events  was anxiously following both of them around with a saucer of milk .  spiders who had inherited the ceiling for generations were urged gently but firmly out of the door .   and granny weatherwax was walking around the clearing with the head woodcutter  a barrelchested young man who clearly thought he looked better in his studded leather wristlets than was  in fact  the case .      it   s been around for years  right .     he said .     always lurking around the edges of villages and that .         and you never tried talking to it .     said granny .      talk to it .  it   s a wolf  right .  you don   t talk to wolves .  animals can   t talk .         hmm .  i see .  and what about the old woman .  there   s a lot of you woodcutters .  did you ever  you know  drop in to see her .         huh .  no fear .         why .      the head woodcutter leaned forward conspiratorially .      well  they say she   s a witch  right .         really .     said granny .     how do you know .         she   s got all the signs  right .         what signs are those .      the woodcutter was pricked by a slight uneasiness .      well   she   s   she lives all by herself in the wood  right .         yes    .         and   and   she   s got a hook nose and she   s always muttering to herself           yes    .         and she   s got no teeth  right .         lawks     said granny .     i can see where you wouldn   t want to be having with the likes of her  right .         right .     said the woodcutter  relieved .      quite likely turn you into just about anything as soon as look at you  right .     granny stuck her finger in her ear and twiddled it reflectively .      they can do that  you know .         i bet they can .  i bet they can     said granny .     makes me glad there   s all you big strong lads around .  tch  tch .  hmm .  can i have a look at your chopper  young man .      he handed over his axe .  granny sagged dramatically as she grasped it .  there were still traces of wolf blood on the blade .      deary me  it   s a big one     she said .     and you   re good with this  i expect .         won the silver belt two years running at the forest revels     said the woodcutter proudly .      two years running .  two years running .  lawks .  that is good .  that   s very good .  and here   s me hardly able to lift it .     granny grasped the axe in one hand and swung it inexpertly .  the woodcutter jumped backward as the blade whirred past his face and then buried itself a quarter of an inch deep in a tree .      sorry about that     said granny weatherwax .     aren   t i a daft old woman .  never was any good with anything technical .      he grinned at her  and tried to pull the axe free .   he sank to his knees  his face suddenly white .   granny leaned down until she was level with his ear .      you could have seen to the old woman     she said quietly .     you could have talked to the wolf .  but you didn   t  right .      he tried to speak  but his teeth didn   t seem to want to part .      i can see you   re very sorry about all that     she said .     i can see you   re seein    the error of your ways .  i bet you can   t wait to be up and repairing her cottage for her  and getting the garden back in good order  and seeing she has fresh milk every day and a good supply of wood  right .  in fact i wouldn   t be surprised if you wasn   t generous enough to build her a new cottage  with a proper well an    all .  somewhere near the village so she don   t have to live alone  right .  you know  i can see the future sometimes and i just know that   s what   s goin    to happen  right .      sweat ran off his face .  now his lungs didn   t seem to be operating  either .      an    i knows you   re goin    to keep your word  and i   m so pleased about it that i   m going to make sure you   re especially lucky     said granny  her voice still in the same pleasant monotone .     i knows it can be a dangerous job  woodchoppin    .  people can get hurt .  trees can accidentally fall on    em  or the top of their chopper can suddenly come off and cut their head open .     the woodcutter shuddered as granny went on     so what i   m goin    to do is a little spell to make sure that none of this    appens to you .  on account of me bein    so grateful .  because of you helpin    the old lady .  right .  just nod .      he managed to move his head a fraction .  granny weatherwax smiled .      there .     she said  standing up and brushing a speck of leafmold off her dress .     you see how sweet life can be  if we all helps one another .        the witches left around lunchtime .  by then the old woman   s garden was full of people  and the air with the sound of sawing and hammering .  news like granny weatherwax travels fast .  three woodcutters were digging over the vegetable plot  two more were fighting to clean the chimney  and four of them were halfway down a new well that was being dug with impressive speed .   the old grandmother  who was still the kind of person who hangs onto one idea until another one dislodges it by force  was running out of saucers to put the milk in .   the witches sneaked away in all the busyness .      there     said magrat  as they strolled down the path     it just goes to show how people will pitch in and help  if only someone sets an example .  you don   t have to bully people all the time  you know .      nanny ogg glanced at granny .      i saw you talking to the head woodcutter     she said .     what was you talking about .         sawdust     said granny .      oh yes .         one of the woodcutters told me     said magrat     that there   s been other odd things happening in this forest .  animals acting human  he said .  there used to be a family of bears living not far away .         nothing unusual about a family of bears living together     said nanny .     they   re very convivial animals .         in a cottage .         that   s unusual .         that   s what i mean     said magrat .      you   d definitely feel a bit awkward about going around to borrow a cup of sugar     said nanny .    i expect the neighbors had something to say about it .         yes     said magrat .     they said    oink    .         what   d they say    oink    for .         because they couldn   t say anything else .  they were pigs .         we had people like that next door when we lived at       nanny began .      i mean pigs .  you know .  four legs .  curly tail .  what pork is before it   s pork .  pigs .         can   t see anyone letting pigs live in a cottage     said granny .      he said they didn   t .  the pigs built their own .  there were three of them .  little pigs .         what happened to them .     said nanny .      the wolf ate them .  they were the only animals stupid enough to let him get near them  apparently .  nothing was found of them except their spirit level .         that   s a shame .         the woodcutter says they didn   t build very good houses  mind you .         well  it   s only to be expected .  what with the trotters and all     said nanny .      he says the roof leaks something dreadful  right over his bed .      the witches walked on in silence .      i remember hearing once     said nanny  with the occasional glance at granny weatherwax     about some ole enchantress in history who lived on an island and turned shipwrecked sailors into pigs .         that   s a terrible thing to do     said magrat  on cue .      i suppose it   s all according to what you really are  inside     said nanny .     i mean  look at greebo here .     greebo  curled around her shoulders like a smelly fur  purred .     he   s practically a human .         you do talk a lot of tosh  gytha     said granny weatherwax .      that   s    cos people won   t tell me what they really think is going on     said nanny ogg  grimly .      i said i   m not sure     said granny .      you looked into the wolf   s mind .         yes .  i did .         well  then        granny sighed .     someone   s been here before us .  passing through .  someone who knows about the power of stories  and uses    em .  and the stories have   kind of hung around .  they do that  when they get fed           what   d anyone want to do that for .     said nanny .      practice     said granny .      practice .  what for .     said magrat .      i expect we   ll find out presently     said granny gnomically .      you ought to tell me what you think     said magrat .     i am the official godmother around here  you know .  i ought to be told things .  you   ve got to tell me things .      nanny ogg went chilly .  this was the kind of emotional countryside with which she was  as head ogg  extremely familiar .  that sort of comment at this sort of time was like the tiny sliding of snow off the top branch of a tall tree high in the mountains during the thaw season .  it was one end of a process that  without a doubt  would end with a dozen villages being engulfed .  whole branches of the ogg family had stopped talking to other branches of the ogg family because of a    thank you very much    in the wrong tones and the wrong place  and this was far worse .      now     she said hurriedly     why don   t we           i don   t have to explain anything     said granny weatherwax .      but we   re supposed to be three witches     said magrat .     if you can call us witches     she added .      what do you mean by that  pray .     said granny .      pray .     thought nanny .  someone has ended a sentence with    pray .     that   s like that bit when someone hits someone else with a glove and then throws it on the floor .  there   s no going back when someone   s ended a sentence with    pray .     but she tried  anyway .      how about a nice        magrat plunged on with the brave desperation of someone dancing in the light of their burning bridges .      well     she said     it seems to me           yes .     said granny .      it seems to me     magrat tried again     that the only magic we do is all   well  headology .  not what anyone else would call magic .  it   s just glaring at people and tricking them .  taking advantage of their gullibility .  it wasn   t what i expected when i set out to become a witch           and who says     said granny weatherwax  slowly and deliberately     that you   ve become a witch now .         my word  the wind is getting up  perhaps we should       said nanny ogg .      what did you say .     said magrat .   nanny ogg put her hand over her eyes .  asking someone to repeat a phrase you   d not only heard very clearly but were also exceedingly angry about was around defcon ii in the lexicon of squabble .      i should have thought my voice was clear enough     said granny .     i   m very amazed my voice wasn   t clear enough .  it sounded clear enough to me .         looks a bit gusty  why don   t we    .         well  i should just think i can be smug and bad tempered and ill considerate enough to be a witch     said magrat .     that   s all that   s required  isn   t it .         ill considerate .  me .         you like people who need help  because when they need help they   re weak  and helping them makes you feel strong .  what harm would a bit of magic do .         because it   d never stop at just a bit  you stupid girl .      magrat backed off  her face flushed .  she reached into her bag and pulled out a slim volume  which she flourished like a weapon .      stupid i may be     she panted     but at least i   m trying to learn things .  do you know the kind of things people can use magic for .  not just illusion and bullying .  there   s people in this book that can   can   walk on hot coals  and stick their hands in a fire and not get hurt .         cheap trickery .     said granny .      they really can .         impossible .  no one can do that .         it shows they can control things .  magic   s got to be more than just knowing things and manipulating people .         oh .  it   s all wishing on stars and fairy dust  is it .  making people happier .         there   s got to be some of that .  otherwise what   s the good of anything .  anyway   when i went to desiderata   s cottage you were looking for the wand  weren   t you .         i just didn   t want it falling into the wrong hands .         like any hands but yours  i expect .      they glared at each other .      haven   t you got any romance in your soul .     said magrat plaintively .      no     said granny .     i ain   t .  and stars don   t care what you wish  and magic don   t make things better  and no one doesn   t get burned who sticks their hand in a fire .  if you want to amount to anything as a witch  magrat garlick  you got to learn three things .  what   s real  what   s not real  and what   s the difference           and always get the young man   s name and address     said nanny .     it worked for me every time .  only joking     she said  as they both glared at her .   the wind was rising  here on the edge of the forest .  bits of grass and leaves whirled through the air .      we   re going the right way  anyway     said nanny madly  seeking anything that would be a distraction .     look .  it says    genua    on the signpost .      it did indeed .  it was an old  worm eaten signpost right on the edge of the forest .  the end of the arm had been carved into the likeness of a pointing finger .      a proper road  too     nanny burbled on .  the row cooled a bit  simply because both sides were not talking to each other .  not simply not exchanging vocal communication   that   s just an absence of speaking .  this went right through that and out the other side  into the horrible glowering worlds of not talking to one another .      yellow bricks     said nanny .     whoever heard of anyone making a road out of yellow bricks .      magrat and granny weatherwax stood looking in opposite directions with their arms folded .      brightens the place up  i suppose     said nanny .  on the horizon  genua sparkled in the middle of some more greenery .  in between  the road dipped into a wide valley dotted with little villages .  a river snaked through them on the way to the city .   the wind whipped at their skirts .      we   ll never fly in this     said nanny  still womanfully trying to make enough conversation for three people .      so we   ll walk  then  eh .     she said  and added  because there   s a spark of spitefulness even in innocent souls like nanny ogg   s     singing as we go  how about it .         i   m sure it   s not my place to mind what anyone chooses to do     said granny .     it   s nothing to do with me .  i expect some people with wands and big ideas might have something to say .         huh .     said magrat .   they set off along the brick road toward the distant city  in single file with nanny ogg as a kind of mobile buffer state in the middle .      what some people need     said magrat  to the world in general     is a bit more heart .         what some people need     said granny weatherwax  to the stormy sky     is a lot more brain .      then she clutched at her hat to stop the wind from blowing it off .   what i need  thought nanny ogg fervently  is a drink .   three minutes later a farmhouse dropped on her head .     by this time the witches were well spaced out .  granny weatherwax was striding along in front  magrat was sulking along at the rear  and nanny was in the middle .   as she said afterward  it wasn   t even as if she was singing .  it was just that one moment there was a small  plump witch  and the next there was the collapsing remains of a wooden farmhouse .   granny weatherwax turned and found herself looking at a crumbling  unpainted front door .  magrat nearly walked into a back door of the same gray  bleached wood .   there was no sound but the crackle of settling timber .      gytha .     said granny .      nanny .     said magrat .   they both opened their doors .   it was a very simple design of house  with two downstairs rooms separated by a front to back passageway .  in the middle of the passageway  surrounded by shattered and termite ridden floorboards  under the pointy hat that had been rammed down to her chin  was nanny ogg .  there was no sign of greebo .      wha    happened .     she said .     wha    happened .         a farmhouse dropped on your head     said magrat .      oh .  one o    them things     said nanny vaguely .   granny gripped her by the shoulders .      gytha .  how many fingers am i holding up .     she said urgently .      wha    fingers .     s    all gone dark .      magrat and granny gripped the brim of nanny   s hat and half lifted  half unscrewed it from her head .  she blinked at them .      that   s the willow reinforcement     she said  as the pointy hat creaked back into shape like a resurrecting umbrella .  she was swaying gently .     stop a hammer blow  a hat with willow reinforcement .  all them struts  see .  distributes the force .  i shall write to mr .  vernissage .      magrat  bemused  looked around the little house .      it just dropped out of the sky .     she said .      could have been a big tornado or something somewhere     said nanny ogg .     picked it up  see  then the wind drops and down it comes .  you get funny things happening in high winds .  remember that big gale we had last year .  one of my hens laid the same egg four times .         she   s rambling     said magrat .      no i ain   t  that   s just my normal talking     said nanny .   granny weatherwax peered into one of the rooms .     i suppose there wouldn   t be any food and drink about the place .     she said .      i think i could force myself to drink some brandy     said nanny quickly .   magrat peered up the stairs .      coo ee     she called  in the strangled voice of someone who wants to be heard without doing anything so bad mannered as raise their voice .     is there anyone here .      nanny  on the other hand  looked under the stairs .  greebo was a cowering ball of fur in a corner .  she hauled him out by the scruff of his neck and gave him a slightly bewildered pat .  despite mr .  vernissage   s millinery masterpiece  despite the worm eaten floor  and despite even the legendary thick skull of the oggs  she was definitely feeling several twinkles short of a glitter and suffering a slight homesick tinged dip in her usual sunny nature .  people didn   t hit you over the head with farmhouses back home .      you know  greebo     she said     i don   t think we   re in lancre .         i   ve found some jam     said granny weatherwax  from the kitchen .   it didn   t take a lot to cheer up nanny ogg .     that   s fine     she called out .     it   ll go nicely on the dwarf bread .      magrat came into the room .      i   m not sure we should be taking other people   s provisions     she said .     i mean  this place must belong to someone .         oh .  did someone speak  gytha .     said granny weatherwax archly .   nanny rolled her eyes .      i was merely saying  nanny     said magrat     that this isn   t our property .         she says it don   t belong to us  esme     said nanny .      tell anyone who wants to know  gytha  that it   s like salvage from a shipwreck     said granny .      she says finders keepers  magrat     said nanny .   something flickered past the window .  magrat went and peered out through the grimy pane .      that   s funny .  there   s a lot of dwarfs dancing around the house     she said .      oh  yes .     said nanny  opening a cupboard .   granny stiffened .     are they   i means  ask her if they   re singing     she said .      they singing  magrat .         i can hear something     said magrat .     sounds like    dingdong  dingdong .            that   s a dwarf song all right     said nanny .     they   re the only people who can make a hiho last all day .         they seem very happy about it     said magrat doubtfully .      probably it was their farmhouse and they   re glad to get it back .      there was a hammering on the back door .  magrat opened it .  a crowd of brightly dressed and embarrassed dwarfs stepped back hurriedly and then peered up at her .      er     said the one who was apparently the leader     is   is the old witch dead .         which old witch .     said magrat .   the dwarf looked at her for a while with his mouth open .  he turned and had a whispered consultation with his colleagues .  then he turned back .      how many have you got .         there   s a choice of two     said magrat .  she wasn   t feeling in a very good mood and wasn   t prompted to aid the conversation more than necessary .  uncharacteristic nastiness made her add     free for the asking .         oh .     the dwarf considered this .     well  which old witch did the house land on .         nanny .  no  she   s not dead .  she   s just a bit stunned .  but thanks all the same for asking     said magrat .     that   s very kind of you .      this seemed to puzzle the dwarfs .  they went into a huddle .  there was a lot of sotto voce arguing .   then the head dwarf turned back to magrat .  he removed his helmet and turned it around and around nervously in his hands .      er     he said     can we have her boots .         what .         her boots .     said the dwarf  blushing .     can we have them  please .         what do you want her boots for .      the dwarf looked at her .  then he turned and went into a huddle with his colleagues again .  he turned back to magrat .      we   ve just got this   feeling   that we ought to have her boots     he said .   he stood there blinking .      well  i   ll go and ask     said magrat .     but i don   t think she   ll say yes .      as she went to close the door the dwarf twiddled his hat some more .      they are ruby colored  aren   t they .     he said .      well  they   re red     said magrat .     is red all right .         they   ve got to be red .     all the other dwarfs nodded .     it   s no good if they   re not red .      magrat gave him a blank look and shut the door .      nanny     she said slowly  when she was back in the kitchen     there   s some dwarfs outside who want your boots .      nanny looked up .  she   d found a stale loaf in a cupboard and was industriously chewing .  it was amazing what you   d eat if the alternative was dwarf bread .      what d   they want    em for .     she said .      didn   t say .  they just said they had a feeling they want your boots .         that sounds highly suspicious to me     said granny .      old shaker wistley over creel springs way was a devil for boots     said nanny  putting down the bread knife .     especially black button boots .  he used to collect    em .  if he saw you going past in a new pair he had to go and have a lie down .         i reckon that   s a bit sophisticated for dwarfs     said granny .      maybe they want to drink out of    em     said nanny .      what do you mean  drink out of them .     said magrat .      ah  well  that   s what they do in foreign parts     said nanny .     they drink fizzy wine out of ladies    boots .      they all looked down at nanny   s boots .   not even nanny could imagine why anyone would want to drink out of them  or what they would do afterward .      my word .  that   s even more sophisticated than old shaker wistley     said nanny reflectively .      they seemed a bit puzzled about it     said magrat .      i expect they would be .  it ain   t often people get a feeling they ought to go around pulling a decent witch   s boots off .  this sounds like another story flapping around .  i think     said granny weatherwax     that we ought to go and talk to these dwarfs .      she strode out into the passageway and opened the door .      yes .     she demanded .   the dwarfs backed away at the sight of her .  there was a lot of whispering and elbowing and muttered comments in the nature of    no  you     and    i asked last time .     finally a dwarf was pushed forward .  it might have been the original dwarf .  it was hard to tell  with dwarfs .      er     he said .     er .  boots .         what for .     said granny .   the dwarf scratched its head .     damned if i know     he said .     we were just wondering about it ourselves     s   matterofact .  we were just coming off shift in the coal mine half an hour ago  we saw the farmhouse land on   on the witch  and   well           you just knew you had to run up and steal her boots .     said granny .   the dwarf   s face widened into a relieved grin .      that   s right .     he said .     and sing the ding dong song .  only she was supposed to be squashed .  no offense meant     he added quickly .      it   s the willow reinforcement     said a voice behind granny .     worth its weight in glod .      granny stared for a while  and then smiled .      i think you lads ought to come inside     she said .     i   ve got some questions to ask you .      the dwarfs looked very uncertain .      um     said the spokesdwarf .      nervous of going into a house with witches in it .     said granny weatherwax .   the spokesdwarf nodded  and then went red .  magrat and nanny ogg exchanged glances behind granny   s back .  something had definitely gone wrong somewhere .  in the mountains dwarfs certainly weren   t afraid of witches .  the problem was to stop them digging up your floor .      you   ve been down from the mountains for some time  i expect     said granny .      very promising seam of coal down here     mumbled the spokesdwarf  twiddling his hat .      bet it   s a long time since you   ve had proper dwarf bread  then     said granny .   the spokesdwarf   s eyes misted over .      baked from the finest stone ground grit  just like mother used to jump up and down on it     granny went on .   a sort of collective sigh went up from the dwarfs .      you just can   t get it down here     said the spokesdwarf  to the ground .     it   s the water  or something .  it falls to bits after hardly any years at all .         they puts flour in it     said someone behind him  sourly .      it   s worse   n that .  the baker over in genua puts dried fruit in it     said another dwarf .      well  now     said granny  rubbing her hands together     i may be able to help you here .  could be i   ve got some dwarf bread to spare .         nah .  not proper dwarf bread     said the spokesdwarf moodily .     proper dwarf bread   s got to be dropped in rivers and dried out and sat on and left and looked at every day and put away again .  you just can   t get it down here .         this could be     said granny weatherwax     your lucky day .         to be frank     said nanny ogg     i think the cat pissed on some of it .      the spokesdwarf looked up  his eyes aglow .      hot damn .          dear jason et everybody      whot a life  all kinds of thing goin on  what with talkin wolves and women asleep in castles  i shall have a story or two to tell you when i gets back and no mistake .  also  dont tawk to me about farmhouses  which reminds me  please send somone to mr .  vernissage over in slice and present mrs .  ogg   s compluments and what a good hat he makes  he can say    as approved by nanny ogg     it stops      of all known farmhouses  also  if you writes to people saying how good their stuff is sometimes you get free stuff  there could be a new hat in this for me so see to it .     lilith stepped out from her room of mirrors .  shadowy images of herself trailed after her  fading .   witches ought to be squashed when a farmhouse lands on them .  lilith knew that .  all squashed  except for their boots sticking out .   sometimes she despaired .  people just didn   t seem able to play their parts properly .   she wondered whether there was such a thing as the opposite of a fairy godmother .  most things had their opposite  after all .  if so  she wouldn   t be a bad fairy godmother  because that   s just a good fairy godmother seen from a different viewpoint .   the opposite would be someone who was poison to stories and  thought lilith  quite the most evil creature in the world .   well  here in genua was one story no one could stop .  it had momentum  this one .  try to stop it and it   d absorb you  make you part of its plot .  she didn   t have to do a thing .  the story would do it for her .  and she had the comfort of knowing that she couldn   t lose .  after all  she was the good one .   she strolled along the battlements and down the stairs to her own room  where the two sisters were waiting .  they were good at waiting .  they could sit for hours without blinking .   the duc refused even to be in the same room as them .   their heads turned as she came in .   she   d never given them voices .  it wasn   t necessary .  it was enough that they were beautiful and could be made to understand .      now you must go to the house     she said .     and this is very important .  listen to me .  some people will be coming to see ella tomorrow .  you must let them do so  do you understand .      they were watching her lips .  they watched anything that moved .      we shall need them for the story .  it won   t work properly unless they try to stop it .  and afterward   perhaps i will give you voices .  you   ll like that  won   t you .      they looked at one another  and then at her .  and then at the cage in the corner of the room .   lilith smiled  and reached in  and took out two white mice .      the youngest witch might be just your type     she said .     i shall have to see what i can do with her .  and now   open          the broomsticks drifted through the afternoon air .   for once  the witches weren   t arguing .   the dwarfs had been a taste of home .  it would have done anyone   s heart good to see the way they just sat and stared at the dwarf bread  as if consuming it with their eyes  which was the best way to consume dwarf bread .  whatever it was that had driven them to seek ruby colored boots seemed to wear off under its down to earth influence .  as granny said  you could look a long way before you found anything realer than dwarf bread .   then she   d gone off alone to talk to the head dwarf .   she wouldn   t tell the others what he   d told her  and they didn   t feel bold enough to ask .  now she flew a little ahead of them .   occasionally she   d mutter something like    godmothers .     or    practicing .      but even magrat  who hadn   t had as much experience  could feel genua now  as a barometer feels the air pressure .  in genua  stories came to life .  in genua  someone set out to make dreams come true .   remember some of your dreams .     genua nestled on the delta of the vieux river  which was the source of its wealth .  and genua was wealthy .  genua had once controlled the river mouth and taxed its traffic in a way that couldn   t be called piracy because it was done by the city government  and therefore sound economics and perfectly all right .  and the swamps and lakes back in the delta provided the crawling  swimming and flying ingredients of a cuisine that would have been world famous if  as has already been indicated  people traveled very much .   genua was rich  lazy and unthreatened  and had once spent quite a lot of time involved in that special kind of civic politics that comes naturally to some city states .  for example  once it had been able to afford the largest branch of the assassins    guild outside ankh morpork  and its members were so busy that you sometimes had to wait for months .    but the assassins had all left years ago .  some things sicken even jackals .   the city came as a shock .  from a distance  it looked like a complicated white crystal growing out of the greens and browns of the swamp .   closer to  it resolved into  firstly  an outer ring of smaller buildings  then an inner ring of large  impressive white houses and  finally  at the very center  a palace .  it was tall and pretty and multi turreted  like a toy castle or some kind of confectionery extravaganza .  every slim tower looked designed to hold a captive princess .   magrat shivered .  but then she thought of the wand .  a godmother had responsibilities .      reminds me of another one of them black aliss stories     said granny weatherwax .     i remember when she locked up that girl with the long pigtails in a tower just like one of them .  rumplestiltzel or someone .         but she got out     said magrat .      yes  it does you good to let your hair down     said nanny .      huh .  rural myths     said granny .   they drew nearer to the city walls .  then magrat said     there   s guards on the gate .  are we going to fly over .      granny stared at the highest tower through narrowed eyes .     no     she said .     we   ll land and walk in .  so   s not to worry people .         there   s a nice flat green bit just behind those trees     said magrat .     granny walked up and down experimentally .  her boots squeaked and gurgled in watery accusation .      look  i said i   m sorry     said magrat .     it just looked so flat .         water gen   rally does     said nanny  sitting on a tree stump and wringing out her dress .      but even you couldn   t tell it was water     said magrat .     it looks so   so grassy with all that weed and stuff floating on it .         seems to me the land and the water around here can   t decide who is which     said nanny .  she looked around at the miasmic landscape .   trees grew out of the swamp .  they had a jagged  foreign look and seemed to be rotting as they grew .  where the water was visible  it was black like ink .  occasionally a few bubbles would eructate to the surface like the ghosts of beans on bath night .  and somewhere over in the distance was the river  if it was possible to be that sure in this land of thick water and ground that wobbled when you set foot on it .   she blinked .      that   s odd     she said .      what .     said granny .      thought i saw   something running       muttered nanny .     over there .  between the trees .         must be a duck then  in this place .         it was bigger   n a duck     said nanny .     funny thing is  it looked a bit like a little house .         oh yes  running along with smoke coming out of the chimney  i expect     said granny witheringly .   nanny brightened .     you saw it too .      granny rolled her eyes .      come on     she said     let   s get to the road .         er     said magrat     how .      they looked at the nominal ground between their reasonably dry refuge and the road .  it had a yellowish appearance .  there were floating branches and tufts of suspiciously green grass .  nanny pulled a branch off the fallen tree she was sitting on and tossed it a few yards .  it struck damply  and sank with the noise of someone trying to get the last bit out of the milkshake .      we fly over to it  of course     nanny said .      you two can     said granny .     there   s nowhere for me to run and get mine started .      in the end magrat ferried her across on her broom  nanny bringing up the rear with granny   s erratic stick in tow .      i just    ope no one saw us  that   s all     said granny  when they   d reached the comparative safety of the road .   other roads joined the swamp causeway as they got nearer to the city .  they were crowded  and there was a long line at the gate .   from ground level  the city was even more impressive .  against the steam of the swamps it shone like a polished stone .  colored flags flew over the walls .      looks very jolly     said nanny .      very clean     said magrat .      it just looks like that from outside     said granny  who had seen a city before .     when you get inside it   ll be all beggars and noise and gutters full of i don   t know what  you mark my words .         they   re turning quite a lot of people away     said nanny .      they said on the boat that lots of people come here for fat lunchtime     said granny .     probably you get lots of people who ain   t the right sort .      half a dozen guards watched them approach .      very smartly turned out     said granny .     that   s what i like to see .  not like at home .      there were only six suits of chain mail in the whole of lancre  made on the basis of one size doesn   t quite fit all .  bits of string and wire had to be employed to take in the slack  since in lancre the role of palace guard was generally taken by any citizen who hadn   t got much to do at the moment .   these guards were all six footers and  even granny had to admit  quite impressive in their jolly red and blue uniforms .  the only other real city guards she   d ever seen were those in ankh morpork .  the sight of ankh morpork   s city guard made thoughtful people wonder who could possibly attack that was worse .  they certainly weren   t anything to look at .   to her amazement  two pikes barred her way as she stepped under the arched gateway .      we   re not attacking  you know     she said .   a corporal gave her a salute .      no ma   am     he said .     but we have orders to stop borderline cases .         borderline .     said nanny .     what   s borderline about us .      the corporal swallowed .  granny weatherwax   s gaze was a hard one to meet .      well     he said     you   re a bit   grubby .      there was a ringing silence .  granny took a deep breath .      we had a bit of an accident in the swamp     said magrat quickly .      i   m sure it   ll be all right     said the corporal wretchedly .     the captain   ll be here directly .  only there   s all kinds of trouble if we let the wrong sort in .  you   d be amazed at some of the people we get here .         can   t go letting the wrong sort in     said nanny ogg .     we wouldn   t want you to let the wrong sort in .  i daresay we wouldn   t want to come into the kind of city that   d let the wrong sort in  would we  esme .      magrat kicked her on the ankle .      good thing we   re the right sort     said nanny .      what   s happening  corporal .      the captain of the guard strolled out of a door in the archway and walked over to the witches .      these   ladies want to come in  sir     said the corporal .      well .         they   re a bit   you know  not one hundred percent clean     said the corporal  wilting under granny   s stare .     and one of them   s got messy hair           well .     snapped magrat .         and one of them looks like she uses bad language .         what .     said nanny  her grin evaporating .     i   ll tan your hide  you little bugger .         but  corporal  they have got brooms     said the captain .     it   s very hard for cleaning staff to look tidy all the time .         cleaning staff .     said granny .      i   m sure they   re as anxious as you are to get tidied up     said the captain .      excuse me     said granny  empowering the words with much the same undertones as are carried by words like    charge .     and    kill .        excuse me  but does this pointy hat i   m wearing mean anything to you .      the soldiers looked at it politely .      can you give me a clue .     said the captain  eventually .      it means           we   ll just trot along in  if it   s all the same to you     said nanny ogg .     got a lot of cleaning up to do .     she flourished her broomstick .     come  ladies .      she and magrat grasped granny   s elbows firmly and propelled her under the archway before her fuse burned out .  granny weatherwax always held that you ought to count up to ten before losing your temper .  no one knew why  because the only effect of this was to build up the pressure and make the ensuing explosion a whole lot worse .   the witches didn   t stop until they were out of sight of the gate .      now  esme     said nanny soothingly     you shouldn   t take it personal .  and we are a bit mucky  you must admit .  they were just doing their job  all right .  how about that .         they treated us as if we was ordinary people     said granny  in a shocked voice .      this is foreign parts  granny     said magrat .     anyway  you said the men on the boat didn   t recognize the hat  either .         but then i dint want    em to     said granny .     that   s different .         it   s just an   an incident  granny     said magrat .      they were just stupid soldiers .  they don   t even know a proper free form hairstyle when they see it .      nanny looked around .  crowds milled past them  almost in silence .      and you must admit it   s a nice clean city     she said .   they took stock of their surroundings .   it was certainly the cleanest place they   d ever seen .  even the cobblestones had a polished look .      you could eat your tea off the street     said nanny  as they strolled along .      yes  but you   d eat your tea off the street anyway     said granny .      i wouldn   t eat all of it .  even the gutters are scrubbed .  not a ronald  in sight  look .         gytha .         well  you said that in ankh morpork           this is somewhere else .         it   s so spotless     said magrat .     makes you wish you   d cleaned your sandals .         yeah .     nanny ogg squinted along the street .     makes you wish you were a better person  really .         why are you two whispering .     said granny .   she followed their gaze .  there was a guard standing on the street corner .  when he saw them looking at him he touched his helmet and gave them a brief smile .      even the guards are polite     said magrat .      and there   s so many of them  too     said granny .      amazing  really  needing all these guards in a city where people are so clean and quiet     said magrat .      perhaps there   s so much niceness to be spread around they need a lot of people to do it     said nanny ogg .   the witches wandered through the packed streets .      nice houses  though     said magrat .     very decorative and olde worlde .      granny weatherwax  who lived in a cottage that was as olde worlde as it was possible to be without being a lump of metamorphic rock  made no comment .   nanny ogg   s feet started to complain .      we ought to find somewhere to stop the night     she said .     we can look for this girl in the morning .  we   ll all do a lot better for a good night   s sleep .         and a bath     said magrat .     with soothing herbs .         good idea .  i could just go a bath too     said nanny .      my word  doesn   t autumn roll around quickly     said granny sourly .      yeah .  when did you last have a bath  esme .         what do you mean  last .         see .  then there   s no call to make comments about my ablutions .         baths is unhygienic     granny declared .     you know i   ve never agreed with baths .  sittin    around in your own dirt like that .         what do you do  then .     said magrat .      i just washes     said granny .     all the bits .  you know .  as and when they becomes available .        however available they were  and no further information was vouchsafed on this point  they were certainly more available than accommodation in genua in fat lunchtime .   all the taverns and inns were more than full .  gradually the press of crowds pushed them out of the main streets and into the less fashionable quarters of the city  but still there was no room for the three of them .   granny weatherwax had had enough .      the very next place we see     she said  setting her jaw firmly     we   re goin    in .  what   s that inn over there .      nanny ogg peered at the sign .      hotel   no   va   cancies     she muttered  and then brightened up .     hotel nova cancies     she repeated .     that means    new  er  cancies    in foreign     she added helpfully .      it   ll do     said granny .   she pushed open the door .  a round  red faced man looked up from the desk .  he was new to the job and very nervous  the last incumbent had disappeared for not being round and red faced enough .   granny didn   t waste time .      you see this hat .     she demanded .     you see this broom .      the man looked from her to the broom  and back again .      yes .     he said .     what   s that mean .         means we want three rooms for the night     said granny  looking smugly at the other two .      with sausage     said nanny .      and one vegetarian meal     said magrat .   the man looked at all three of them .  then he went over to the door .      you see this door .  you see this sign .     he said .      we don   t bother about signs     said granny .      well  then     said the man     i give up .  what   s a pointy hat and a broom really mean .         that means i   m a witch     said granny .   the man put his head on one side .      yeah .     he said .     is that another word for daft old woman .          dear jason and everyone  wrote nanny ogg  dyou know  they dont know about witches here  thats how bakcward they are in foreign parts .  a man gave esme some cheek and she would of lost her temper so me and magrat and i got hold of her and rushed her out because if you make someone think they   ve been turned into something there   s always trouble  you remember what happened larst time when afterward you had to go and dig a pond for mr .  wilkins to live in       they had managed to find a table to themselves in a tavern .  it was packed with people of all species .  the noise was at shouting level and smoke wreathed the air .      will you stop that scribbling  gytha ogg .  it gets on my nerves     snapped granny .      they must have witches here     said magrat .     everywhere has witches .  you   ve got to have witches abroad .  you find witches everywhere .         like cockroaches     said nanny ogg cheerfully .      you should   ve let me make him believe he was a frog     muttered granny .      you can   t do that  esme .  you can   t go around making people believe they   re things just because they   ve been cheeky and don   t know who you are     said gytha .     otherwise we   d be up to here in people hopping about .      despite many threats  granny weatherwax had never turned anyone into a frog .  the way she saw it  there was a technically less cruel but cheaper and much more satisfying thing you could do .  you could leave them human and make them think they were a frog  which also provided much innocent entertainment for passers by .      i always felt sorry for mr .  wilkins     said magrat  staring moodily at the table top .     it was so sad watching him try to catch flies on his tongue .         he shouldn   t have said what he said     said granny .      what  that you were a domineering old busybody .     said nanny innocently .      i don   t mind criticism     said granny .     you know me .  i   ve never been one to take offense at criticism .  no one could say i   m the sort to take offense at criticism           not twice  anyway     said nanny .     not without blowing bubbles .         it   s just that i can   t stand unfairness     said granny .     and you stop that grinning .  anyway  i don   t see why you   re making a fuss about it .  it wore off after a couple of days .         mrs .  wilkins says he still goes out swimming a lot     said magrat .     it   s given him a whole new interest  she said .         perhaps they have a different kind of witch in the city     said magrat hopelessly .     perhaps they wear different sort of clothes .         there   s only one kind of witch     said granny .     and we   re it .      she looked around the room .  of course  she thought  if someone was keeping witches out  people wouldn   t know about them .  someone who didn   t want anyone else meddling here .  but she let us in        oh  well  at least we   re in the dry     said nanny .  a drinker standing in a crowd behind her threw back his head to laugh and spilled beer down her back .   she muttered something under her breath .   magrat saw the man look down to take another swig and stare  wide eyed  into the mug .  then he dropped it and fought his way out of the room  clutching at his throat .      what did you do to his drink .     she said .      you ain   t old enough to be tole     said nanny .   at home  if a witch wanted a table to herself it   just happened .  the sight of the pointy hat was enough .  people kept a polite distance  occasionally sending free drinks to her .  even magrat got respect  not particularly because anyone was in awe of her  but because a slight to one witch was a slight to all witches and no one wanted granny weatherwax coming around to explain this to them .  here they were being jostled  as if they were ordinary .  only nanny ogg   s warning hand on granny weatherwax   s arm was keeping a dozen jovial drinkers from unnatural amphibianhood  and even nanny   s usually very elastic temper was beginning to twang .  she always prided herself on being as ordinary as muck  but there was ordinary and there was ordinary .  it was like being that prince whatsisname  in the nursery story  who liked to wander around his kingdom dressed up as a commoner  she   d always had a shrewd suspicion that the little pervert made sure people knew who he was beforehand  just in case anyone tried to get too common .  it was like getting muddy .  getting muddy when you had a nice hot tub to look forward to was fun  getting muddy when all you had to look forward to was more mud was no fun at all .  she reached a conclusion .      hey  why don   t we have a drink .     said nanny ogg brightly .     we   d all feel better for a drink .         oh no     said granny .     you caught me with that herbal drink last time .  i   m sure there was alcohol in that .  i def   nitely felt a bit woozy after the sixth glass .  i ain   t drinking any more foreign muck .         you   ve got to drink something     said magrat soothingly .     i   m thirsty  anyway .     she looked vaguely at the crowded bar .     perhaps they do some kind of fruit cup  or something .         bound to     said nanny ogg .  she stood up  glanced at the bar  and surreptitiously removed a hatpin from her hat .     shan   t be a moment .      the two of them were left in their own private gloom .  granny sat staring fixedly in front of her .      you really shouldn   t take it so bad  just because people aren   t showing you any respect     said magrat  pouring soothing oil on the internal fires .     they   ve hardly ever shown me any respect at all .  it   s not a problem .         if you ain   t got respect  you ain   t got a thing     said granny distantly .      oh  i don   t know .  i   ve always managed to get along     said magrat .      that   s    cos you   re a wet hen  magrat garlick     said granny .   there was a short  hot silence  ringing with the words that shouldn   t have escaped and a few grunts of pained surprise from the direction of the bar .   i know she   s always thought that  magrat told herself within the glowing walls of her embarrassment .  i just never thought she   d ever say it .  and she   ll never say sorry  because that   s not the kind of thing she does .  she just expects people to forget things like that .  i was just trying to be friends again .  if she ever really has any friends .      here we are then     said nanny ogg  emerging from the crush with a tray .     fruit drinks .      she sat down and looked from one to the other .      made from bananas     she said  in the hope of striking a spark of interest from either woman .     i remember our shane brought a banana home once .  my  we had a good laugh about that .  i said to the man     what kind of fruit drinks do people drink around here .     and this is what he gave me . made from bananas .  a banana drink .  you   ll like it .  it   s what everyone drinks here .  it   s got bananas in it .         it   s certainly very   strongly flavored     said magrat  sipping hers cautiously .     has it got sugar in it too .         very likely     said nanny .  she looked at granny   s middle distance frown for a moment  and then picked up her pencil and licked the end professionally .       anywey one good thing is the drink here is v .  cheap theres this one called a bananana dakry which is basicly rum with a bananana  in it .  i can feel it doin me good .  it is v .  damp here .  i hope we find somewhere to stay tonigt i expect we shal becaus esme alweys falls on her feet or at any rate on someones feet .  i have drawern a picture of a banananana dakry you can see it is empty right down to the bottom .  love  mum xxxx    in the end they found a stable .  it was  as nanny ogg cheerfully commented  probably warmer and more hygienic than any of the inns and there were millions of people in foreign parts who   d give their right arms for such a comfy  dry place to sleep .   this cut about as much ice as a soap hacksaw .   it doesn   t take much to make witches fall out .   magrat lay awake  using her sack of clothes as a pillow and listening to the warm soft rain on the roof .   it   s all gone wrong before we   ve even started  she thought .  i don   t know why i let them come with me .  i   m perfectly capable of doing something by myself for once  but they always treat me as if i was a   a wet hen .  i don   t see why i should have to put up with her sulking and snapping at me the whole time .  what   s so special about her  anyway .  she hardly ever does anything really magical  whatever nanny says .  she really does just shout a lot and bully people .  and as for nanny  she means well but she has no sense of responsibility .  i thought i   d die when she started singing the hedgehog song in the inn  i just hope to goodness the people didn   t know what the words meant .   i   m the fairy godmother around here .  we   re not at home now .  there   s got to be different ways of doing things  in foreign parts .     she got up at first light .  the other two were asleep  although    asleep    was too moderate a word for the sounds granny weatherwax was making .   magrat put on her best dress  the green silk one that was unfortunately now a mass of creases .  she took out a bundle of tissue paper and slowly unwrapped her occult jewelry  magrat bought occult jewelry as a sort of distraction from being magrat .  she had three large boxes of the stuff and was still exactly the same person .   she did her best to remove the straw from her hair .  then she unpacked the magic wand .   she wished she had a mirror to inspect herself in .      i   ve got the wand     she said quietly .     i don   t see why i need any help .  desiderata said i was to tell them not to help .      it crossed her mind to reflect that desiderata had been very lax on that point .  the one thing you could be sure of  if you told granny weatherwax and nanny ogg not to help  was that they would rush to help if only out of spite .  it was quite surprising to magrat that anyone as clever as desiderata should have slipped up on that minor point .  she   d probably got a psycholology too   whatever that was .   moving quietly  so as not to wake the other two  she opened the door and stepped lightly into the damp air .  wand at the ready  she was prepared to give the world whatever it wished for .   it would help if this included pumpkins .   nanny ogg opened one eye as the door creaked shut .   she sat up and yawned and scratched herself .  she fumbled in her hat and retrieved her pipe .  she nudged granny weatherwax in the ribs .      i ain   t asleep     said granny .      magrat   s gone off somewhere .         hah .         and i   m going out to get something to eat     muttered nanny .  there was no talking to esme when she was in that kind of mood .   as she stepped out greebo dropped lightly off a beam and landed on her shoulder .   nanny ogg  one of life   s great optimists  stepped out to take whatever the future had to offer .   preferably with rum and bananas in it .     the house wasn   t hard to find .  desiderata had made very exact notes .   magrat   s gaze took in the high white walls and ornate metal balconies .  she tried to straighten a few wrinkles in her dress  tugged some recalcitrant bits of hay from her hair  and then marched up the driveway and knocked on the door .   the knocker broke off in her hand .   looking around anxiously lest someone should have noted this vandalism  magrat tried to wedge it back .  it fell off  knocking a lump out of the marble step .   finally she knocked gently with her knuckle .  a fine cloud of paint dust lifted off the door and floated down to the ground .  that was the only effect .   magrat considered her next move .  she was pretty sure that fairy godmothers weren   t supposed to leave a little card pushed under the door saying something like    called today but you were out  please contact the depot for a further appointment .     anyway  this wasn   t the kind of house that got left empty  there would be a score of servants infesting a place like this .   she crunched over the gravel and peered around the side of the house .  maybe the back door   witches were generally more at home around back doors         nanny ogg always was .  she was heading for the one belonging to the palace .  it was easy enough to get into  this wasn   t a castle like the ones back home  which expressed very clear ideas about inside and outside and were built to keep the two separate .  this was  well  a fairy tale castle  all icing sugar battlements and tiny  towering turrets .  anyway  no one took much notice of little old ladies .  little old ladies were by definition harmless  although in a string of villages across several thousand miles of continent this definition was currently being updated .   castles  in nanny ogg   s experience  were like swans .  they looked as if they were drifting regally through the waters of time  but in fact there was a hell of a lot of activity going on underneath .  there   d be a maze of pantries and kitchens and laundries and stables and breweries   she liked the idea of breweries   and people never noticed another old biddy around the place  eating any spare grub that was lying around .   besides  you got gossip .  nanny ogg liked gossip  too .     granny weatherwax wandered disconsolately along the clean streets .  she wasn   t looking for the other two .  she was quite certain of that .  of course  she might just happen to bump into them  sort of accidentally  and give them a meaningful look .  but she certainly wasn   t looking for them .   there was a crowd at the end of the street .  working on the reasonable assumption that nanny ogg might be in the middle of it  granny weatherwax drifted over .   nanny wasn   t there .  but there was a raised platform .  and a small man in chains .  and some bright uniformed guards .  one of them was holding an axe .   you did not have to be a great world traveler to understand that the purpose of this tableau was not to give the chained man a signed testimonial and a collection from everyone at the office .   granny nudged a bystander .      what   s happening .      the man looked sideways at her .      the guards caught him thieving     he said .      ah .  well  he looks guilty enough     said granny .  people in chains had a tendency to look guilty .     so what   re they going to do to him .         teach him a lesson .         how d   they do that  then .         see the axe .      granny   s eyes hadn   t left it the whole time .  but now she let her attention rove over the crowd  picking up scraps of thought .   an ant has an easy mind to read .  there   s just one stream of big simple thoughts  carry  carry  bite  get into the sandwiches  carry  eat .  something like a dog is more complicated   a dog can be thinking several thoughts at the same time .  but a human mind is a great sullen lightning filled cloud of thoughts  all of them occupying a finite amount of brain processing time .  finding whatever the owner thinks they   re thinking in the middle of the smog of prejudices  memories  worries  hopes and fears is almost impossible .   but enough people thinking much the same thing can be heard  and granny weatherwax was aware of the fear .      looks like it   ll be a lesson he won   t forget in a hurry     she murmured .      i reckon he   ll forget it quite quickly     said the watcher  and then shuffled away from granny  in the same way that people move away from lightning rods during a thunderstorm .   and at this point granny picked up the discordant note in the orchestra of thought .  in the middle of it were two minds that were not human .   their shape was as simple  clean and purposeful as a naked blade .  she   d felt minds like that before  and had never cherished the experience .   she scanned the crowd and found the minds    owners .  they were staring unblinkingly at the figures on the platform .   the watchers were women  or at least currently the same shape as women  taller than she was  slender as sticks  and wearing broad hats with veils that covered their faces .  their dresses shimmered in the sunlight   possibly blue  possibly yellow  possibly green .  possibly patterned .  it was impossible to tell .  the merest movement changed the colors .   she couldn   t make out their faces .   there were witches in genua all right .  one witch  anyway .   a sound from the platform made her turn .   and she knew why people in genua were quiet and nice .   there were countries in foreign parts  granny had heard  where they chopped off the hands of thieves so that they wouldn   t steal again .  and she   d never been happy with that idea .   they didn   t do that in genua .  they cut their heads off so they wouldn   t think of stealing again .   granny knew exactly where the witches were in genua now .   they were in charge .     magrat reached the house   s back door .  it was ajar .   she pulled herself together again .   she knocked  in a polite  diffident sort of way .      er       she said .   a bowlful of dirty water hit her full in the face .  through the tidal roaring of a pair of ears full of suds  she heard a voice say     gosh  i   m sorry .  i didn   t know anyone was standing there .      magrat wiped the water out of her eyes  and tried to focus on the dim figure in front of her .  a kind of narrative certainty rose in her mind .      is your name ella .     she said .      that   s right .  who   re you .      magrat looked her new found god daughter up and down .  she was the most attractive young woman magrat had ever seen   skin as brown as a nut  hair so blond as to be almost white  a combination not totally unusual in such an easygoing city as genua had once been .   what were you supposed to say at a time like this .   she removed a piece of potato peel from her nose .      i   m your fairy godmother     she said .     funny thing  it sounds silly now i come to tell someone        ella peered at her .      you .         um .  yes .  i   ve got the wand  and everything .     magrat waggled the wand  in case this helped .  it didn   t .   ella put her head on one side .      i thought you people were supposed to appear in a shower of glittering little lights and a twinkly noise     she said suspiciously .      look  you just get the wand     said magrat desperately .     you don   t get a whole book of instructions .      ella gave her another searching look .  then she said     i suppose you   d better come in  then .  you   re just in time .  i was making a cup of tea  anyway .        the iridescent women got into an open topped carriage .  beautiful as they were  granny noted  they walked awkwardly .   well  they would .  they wouldn   t be used to legs .   she also noticed the way people didn   t look at the carriage .  it wasn   t that they didn   t see it .  it was simply that they wouldn   t let their gaze dwell on it  as if merely recognizing it would lead them into trouble .   and she noticed the coach horses .  they had better senses than the humans did .  they knew what was behind them  and they didn   t like it at all .   she followed them as they trotted  flat eared and wild eyed  through the streets .  eventually they were driven into the driveway of a big and dilapidated house near the palace .   granny lurked by the wall and noted the details .  plaster was dropping off the house walls  and even the knocker had fallen off the door .   granny weatherwax did not believe in atmospheres .  she did not believe in psychic auras .  being a witch  she   d always thought  depended more on what you didn   t believe .  but she was prepared to believe that there was something very unpleasant in that house .  not evil .  the two not exactly women weren   t evil  in the same way that a dagger or a sheer cliff isn   t evil .  being evil means being able to make choices .  but the hand wielding a dagger or pushing a body over a cliff could be evil  and something like that was going on .   she really wished that she didn   t know who was behind it .     people like nanny ogg turn up everywhere .  it   s as if there   s some special morphic generator dedicated to the production of old women who like a laugh and aren   t averse to the odd pint  especially of some drink normally sold in very small glasses .  you find them all over the place  often in pairs .    they tend to attract one another .  possibly they broadcast inaudible signals indicating that here is someone who could be persuaded to go    ooo    at pictures of other people   s grandchildren .   nanny ogg had found a friend .  her name was mrs .  pleasant  she was a cook  and she was the first black person nanny had ever spoken to .   she was also a cook of that very superior type who spends most of the time holding court in a chair in the center of the kitchen  apparently taking very little heed of the activity going on around her .   occasionally she   d give an order .  and they   d only need to be occasionally  because she   d seen to it over the years that people either did things her way or not at all .  once or twice  with some ceremony  she   d get up  taste something  and maybe add a pinch of salt .   such people are always ready to chat to any wandering peddlers  herbalists  or little old women with cats on their shoulders .  greebo rode on nanny   s shoulder as though he   d just eaten the parrot .      you be a comin    here for fat lunchtime  then .     said mrs .  pleasant .      helping a friend with a bit of business     said nanny .     my  these biscuits are tasty .         i means  i see by your eye     said mrs .  pleasant  pushing the plate nearer to her     that you are of a magical persuasion .         then you sees a lot further than most people in these parts     said nanny .     y   know  what   d improve these biscuits no end   d be something to dip    em in  what d   you think .         how    bout something with bananas in it .         bananas would be just the thing     said nanny happily .  mrs .  pleasant waved imperiously at one of the maids  who set to work .   nanny sat on her chair  swinging her stumpy legs and looking around the kitchen with interest .  a score of cooks were working with the single mindedness of an artillery platoon laying down a barrage .  huge cakes were being constructed .  in the fireplaces whole carcasses of animals were being roasted  turnspit dogs galloped in their treadmills .  a huge man with a bald head and a scar right across his face was patiently inserting little sticks into sausages .   nanny hadn   t had any breakfast .  greebo had had some breakfast  but this didn   t make any difference .  they were both undergoing a sort of exquisite culinary torture .   they both turned  as if hypnotized  to watch two maids stagger by under a tray of canap  s .      i can see you is a very observant woman  mrs .  ogg     said mrs .  pleasant .      just a slice     said nanny  without thinking .      i also determines     mrs .  pleasant said  after a while     that you have a cat of no usual breed upon your shoulder there .         you   re right there .         i knows i   m right .      a brimming glass of yellow foam was slid in front of nanny .  she looked at it reflectively and tried to get back to the matter in hand .      so     she said     where would i go  do you think  to find out about how you do magic in           would you like somethin    to eat .     said mrs .  pleasant .      what .  my word .      mrs .  pleasant rolled her eyes .      not this stuff .  i wouldn   t eat this stuff     she said bitterly .   nanny   s face fell .      but you cook it     she pointed out .      only    cos i   m told to .  the old baron knew what good food was .  this stuff .  it   s nothing but pork and beef and lamb and rubbish for them that never tasted anything better .  the only thing on four legs that   s worth eating is alligator .  i mean real food .      mrs .  pleasant looked around at the kitchen .      sara .     she shouted .   one of the sub cooks turned around .      yes     m .         me and this lady is just going out .  just you see to everything  okay .         yes     m .      mrs .  pleasant stood up and nodded meaningfully at nanny ogg .      walls have ears     she said .      coo .  do they .         we goin    to go for a little stroll .        there were  it now seemed to nanny ogg  two cities in genua .  there was the white one  all new houses and blue roofed palaces  and around it and even under it was the old one .  the new one might not like the presence of the old one  but it couldn   t quite ever do without it .  someone  somewhere  has to do the cooking .   nanny ogg quite liked cooking  provided there were other people around to do things like chop up the vegetables and wash the dishes afterward .  she   d always reckoned that she could do things to a bit of beef that the bullock had never thought of .  but now she realized that wasn   t cooking .  not compared to cooking in genua .  it was just staying alive as pleasantly as possible .  cooking anywhere outside genua was just heating up things like bits of animals and birds and fish and vegetables until they went brown .   and yet the weird thing was that the cooks in genua had nothing edible to cook  at least  not what nanny would have thought of as food .  to her mind  food went around on four legs  or possibly one pair of legs and one pair of wings .  or at least it had fins on .  the idea of food with more than four legs was an entirely new kettle of fi   of miscellaneous swimming things .   they didn   t have much to cook in genua .  so they cooked everything .  nanny had never heard of prawns or crawfish or lobsters  it just looked to her as though the citizens of genua dredged the river bottom and boiled whatever came up .   the point was that a good german cook could more or less take the squeezings of a handful of mud  a few dead leaves and a pinch or two of some unpronounceable herbs and produce a meal to make a gourmet burst into tears of gratitude and swear to be a better person for the rest of their entire life if they could just have one more plateful .   nanny ogg ambled along as mrs .  pleasant led her through the market .  she peered at cages of snakes  and racks of mysteriously tendrilled herbs .  she prodded trays of bivalves .  she stopped for a chat to the nanny ogg shaped ladies who ran the little stalls that  for a couple of pennies  dispensed strange chowders and shellfish in a bun .  she sampled everything .  she was enjoying herself immensely .  genua  city of cooks  had found the appetite it deserved .   she finished a plate of fish and exchanged a nod and a grin with the little old woman who ran the fish stall .      well  all this is       she began  turning to mrs .  pleasant .   mrs .  pleasant had gone .   some people would have bustled off to look for her in the crowds  but nanny ogg just stood and thought .   i asked about magic  she thought  and she brought me here and left me .  because of them walls with ears in  i expect .  so maybe i got to do the rest myself .   she looked around her .  there was a very rough tent a little way from the stalls  right by the river .  there was no sign outside it  but there was a pot bubbling gently over a fire .  rough clay bowls were stacked beside the pot .  occasionally someone would step out of the crowd  help themselves to a bowlful of whatever was in the pot  and then throw a handful of coins into the plate in front of the tent .   nanny wandered over and looked into the pot .  things came to the surface and sank again .  the general color was brown .  bubbles formed  grew  and burst stickily with an organic    blop .     anything could be happening in that pot .  life could be spontaneously creating .   nanny ogg would try anything once .  some things she   d try several thousand times .   she unhooked the ladle  picked up a bowl  and helped herself .   a moment later she pushed aside the tent flap and looked into the blackness of the interior .   a figure was seated cross legged in the gloom  smoking a pipe .      mind if i step inside .     said nanny .   the figure nodded .   nanny sat down .  after a decent interval she pulled out her own pipe .      mrs .  pleasant   s a friend of yours  i expect .         she knows me .         ah .      from outside  there was the occasional clink as customers helped themselves .   blue smoke coiled from nanny ogg   s pipe .      i don   t reckon     she said     that many people goes away without paying .         no .      after another pause nanny ogg said     i    spects some of    em tries to pay with gold and jewels and scented ungulants and stuff like that .         no .         amazin    .      nanny ogg sat in silence for a while  listening to the distant noises of the market and summoning her powers .      what   s it called .         gumbo .         it   s good .         i know .         i reckon anyone who could cook like that could do anything      nanny ogg concentrated      mrs    .  gogol .      she waited .      pretty near  mrs .  ogg .      the two women stared at one another   s shadowy outline  like plotters who had given the sign and countersign and were waiting to see what would happen next .      where i come from  we call it witchcraft     said nanny  under her breath .      where i come from  we call it voodoo     said mrs .  gogol .   nanny   s wrinkled forehead wrinkled still further .      ain   t that all messin    with dolls and dead people and stuff .     she said .      ain   t witchcraft all runnin    around with no clothes on and stickin    pins in people .     said mrs .  gogol levelly .      ah     said nanny .     i sees what you mean .      she shifted uneasily .  she was a fundamentally honest woman .      i got to admit  though       she added     sometimes   maybe just one pin        mrs .  gogol nodded gravely .     okay .  sometimes   maybe just one zombie     she said .      but only when there ain   t no alternative .         sure .  when there ain   t no alternative .         when   you know   people ain   t showing respect  like .         when the house needs paintin    .      nanny grinned  toothily .  mrs .  gogol grinned  outnumbering her in teeth by a factor of thirty .      my full name   s gytha ogg     she said .     people calls me nanny .         my full name   s erzulie gogol     said mrs .  gogol .     people call me mrs .  gogol .         the way i saw it     said nanny     this is foreign parts  so maybe there   s a different kind of magic .  stands to reason .  the trees is different  the people is different  the drinks is different and has got banana in    em  so the magic   d be different too .  then i thought   gytha  my girl  you   re never too old to learn .         sure thing .         there   s something wrong with this city .  felt it as soon as we set foot here .      mrs .  gogol nodded .   there was no sound for a while but the occasional puffing of a pipe .   then there was a clink from outside  followed by a thoughtful pause .   a voice said     gytha ogg .  i know you   re in there .      the outline of mrs .  gogol took its pipe out of its mouth .      that   s good     she said .     good sense of taste there .      the tent flap opened .      hallo  esme     said nanny ogg .      blessings be on this   tent     said granny weatherwax  peering into the gloom .      this here   s mrs .  gogol     said nanny .     she   s by way of bein    a voodoo lady .  that   s what witches are in these parts .         they ain   t the only witches in these parts     said granny .      mrs .  gogol was very impressed at you detecting me in here     said nanny .      it wasn   t hard     said granny .     once i   d spotted that greebo washing himself outside  the rest was all deduction .        in the gloom of the tent nanny had formed a mental picture of mrs .  gogol as being old .  what she hadn   t expected  when the voodoo lady stepped out into the open air  was a handsome middle aged woman taller than granny .  mrs .  gogol wore heavy gold earrings  a white blouse and a full red skirt with flounces .  nanny could feel granny weatherwax   s disapproval .  what they said about women with red skirts was even worse than whatever they said about women with red shoes  whatever that was .   mrs .  gogol stopped and raised an arm .  there was a flurry of wings .   greebo  who had been rubbing obsequiously against nanny   s leg  looked up and hissed .  the largest and blackest cockerel nanny had ever seen had settled on mrs .  gogol   s shoulder .  it turned on her the most intelligent stare she had ever seen on a bird .      my word     she said  taken aback .     that   s the biggest cock i   ve ever seen  and i   ve seen a few in my time .      mrs .  gogol raised one disapproving eyebrow .      she never had no proper upbringing     said granny .      what with living next to a chicken farm and all  is what i was going to say next     said nanny .      this is legba  a dark and dangerous spirit     said mrs .  gogol .  she leaned closer and spoke out of the corner of her mouth .     between you and me  he just a big black cockerel .  but you know how it is .         it pays to advertise     nanny agreed .     this is greebo .  between you and me  he   s a fiend from hell .         well  he   s a cat     said mrs .  gogol  generously .     it   s only to be expected .          dear jason and everyone      isn   t it amazing the things what happen when you dont expect it  for example we met mrs .  gogol who works as a coke by day but is a voodoo witch  you mustnt beleive all the stuff about black magic  exetra  this is a blind  shes just like us only different .  its true about the zombies though but its not what you think       genua was a strange city  nanny decided .  you got off the main streets  walked along a side road  went through a little gate and suddenly there were trees everywhere  with moss and them llamas hanging from them  and the ground began to wobble underfoot and become swamp .  on either side of the track there were dark pools in which  here and there  among the lilies  were the kind of logs the witches had never seen before .      them   s bloody big newts     she said .      they   re alligators .         by gods .  they must get good grub .         yeah .      mrs .  gogol   s house itself looked a simple affair of driftwood from the river  roofed with moss and built out over the swamp itself on four stout poles .  it was close enough to the center of the city that nanny could hear street cries and the clip clop of hooves  but the shack in its little swamp was wreathed in silence .      don   t people bother you here .     said nanny .      not them as i don   t want to meet .     the lily pads moved .  a v shaped ripple drifted across the nearest pool .      self reliance     said granny approvingly .     that   s always very important .      nanny regarded the reptiles with a calculating stare .  they tried to match it  and gave up when their eyes started watering .      i reckon i could just do with a couple of them at home     she said thoughtfully  as they slid away again .     our jason could dig another pond  no problem .  what was it you said they et .         anything they want to .         i knows a joke about alligators     said granny  in the tones of one announcing a great and solemn truth .      you never .     said nanny ogg .     i never heard you tell a joke in your whole life .         just because i don   t tell    em don   t mean i don   t know    em     said granny haughtily .     it   s about this man           what man .     said nanny .      this man went into an inn .  yes .  it was an inn .  and he saw a sign .  the sign said    we serve every kind of sandwich .     so he said    get me an alligator sandwich   and make it quick .         they looked at her .   nanny ogg turned to mrs .  gogol .      so   you live alone here  then .     she said brightly .     not a living soul around .         in a manner of speakin        said mrs .  gogol .      you see  the point is  alligators are       granny began  in a loud voice  and then stopped .   the shack   s door had opened .     this was another big kitchen .   once upon a time it had provided employment for half a dozen cooks .  now it was a cave  its far corners shadowy  its hanging saucepans and tureens dulled by dust .  the big tables had been pushed to one side and stacked almost ceiling high with ancient crockery  the stoves  which looked big enough to take whole cows and cook for an army  stood cold .   in the middle of the gray desolation someone had set up a small table by the fireplace .  it was on a square of bright carpet .  a jam jar contained flowers that had been arranged by the simple method of grabbing a handful of them and ramming them in .  the effect was a little area of slightly soppy brightness in the general gloom .   ella shuffled a few things around desperately and then stood looking at magrat with a sort of defensively shy smile .      silly of me  really .  i expect you   re used to this sort of thing     she said .      um .  yes .  oh  yes .  all the time     said magrat .      it was just that i expected you to be a bit   older .  apparently you were at my christening .         ah .  yes .     said magrat .     well  you see  the thing is           still  i expect you can look like whatever you want     said ella helpfully .      ah .  yes .  er .      ella looked slightly puzzled for a moment  as if trying to work out why   if magrat could look like whatever she wanted   she   d chosen to look like magrat .      well  now     she said .     what do we do next .         you mentioned tea     said magrat  buying time .      oh  sure .     ella turned to the fireplace  where a blackened kettle hung over what granny weatherwax always called an optimist   s fire .       what   s your name .     she said over her shoulder .      magrat     said magrat  sitting .      that   s a   nice name     said ella  politely .     of course  you know mine .  mind you  i spend so much time cooking over this wretched thing now that mrs .  pleasant calls me embers .  silly  isn   t it .      emberella  thought magrat .  i   m fairy godmothering a girl who sounds like something you put up in the rain .      it could use a little work     she conceded .      i haven   t the heart to tell her off  she thinks it sounds jolly     she said .     i think it sounds like something you put up in the rain .         oh  i wouldn   t say that     said magrat .     uh .  who   s mrs .  pleasant .         she   s the cook at the palace .  she comes around to cheer me up when they   re out        ella spun around  holding the blackened kettle like a weapon .      i   m not going to that ball .     she snapped .     i   m not going to marry the prince .  do you understand .      the words came out like steel ingots .      right .  right .     said magrat  taken aback by their force .      he looks slimy .  he makes my flesh crawl     said embers darkly .     they say he   s got funny eyes .  and everyone knows what he does at night .      everyone bar one  magrat thought .  no one ever tells me things like that .   aloud  she said     well  it shouldn   t be too much to arrange .  i mean  normally it   s marrying princes that   s the hard bit .         not for me it isn   t     said embers .     it   s all been arranged .  my other godmother says i   ve got to do it .  she says it   s my destiny .         other godmother .     said magrat .      everyone gets two     said ella .     the good one and the bad one .  you know that .  which one are you .      magrat   s mind raced .      oh  the good one     she said .     definitely .         funny thing     said ella .     that   s just what the other one said  too .        granny weatherwax sat in her special knees clenched  elbows in way that put as little as possible of herself in contact with the outside world .      by gor     this is good stuff     said nanny ogg  polishing her plate with what granny could only hope was bread .     you ought to try a drop  esme .         another helping  mrs .  ogg .     said mrs .  gogol .      don   t mind if i do  mrs .  gogol .     nanny nudged granny in the ribs .     it   s really good  esme .  just like stew .      mrs .  gogol looked at granny with her head on one side .      i think perhaps mistress weatherwax isn   t worried about the food     she said .     i think mistress weatherwax is worried about the service .      a shadow loomed over nanny ogg .  a gray hand took her plate away .   granny weatherwax gave a little cough .      i   ve got nothing against dead people     she said .     some of my best friends are dead .  it just don   t seem right  though  dead people walking about .      nanny ogg looked up at the figure even now ladling a third helping of mysterious liquid onto her plate .      what d    you think about it  mr .  zombie .         it   s a great life  mrs .  ogg     said the zombie .      there .  see  esme .  he don   t mind .  better than being shut up in a stuffy coffin all day  i   ll be bound .      granny looked up at the zombie .  he was   or  technically  had been   a tall  handsome man .  he still was  only now he looked like someone who had walked through a room full of cobwebs .      what   s your name  dead man .     she said .      i am called saturday .         man saturday  eh .     said nanny ogg .      no .  just saturday  mrs .  ogg .  just saturday .      granny weatherwax looked into his eyes .  they were more sentient than most eyes she had seen that belonged to people who were  technically  alive .   she was vaguely aware that there were things you had to do to a dead person to turn them into a zombie  although it was a branch of magic she   d never wanted to investigate .  yet you needed more than just a lot of weird fish innards and foreign roots   the person had to want to come back .  they had to have some terrible dream or desire or purpose that would enable them to overcome the grave itself     saturday   s eyes burned .   she reached a decision .  she held out a hand .      very pleased to meet you  mister saturday     she said .     and i   m sure i   d enjoy your lovely stew .         it   s called gumbo     said nanny .     it   s got lady   s fingers in it .         i know well enough that lady   s fingers is a kind of plant  thank you very much     said granny .     i   m not entirely ignorant .         all right  but make sure you get a helping with snakes    heads in it as well     said nanny ogg .     they   re the best part .         what kind of plant is snakes    heads .         best if you just eat up  i reckon     said nanny .   they were sitting on the warped wood veranda around the back of mrs .  gogol   s shack  overlooking the swamp .  mossy beards hung from every branch .  unseen creatures buzzed in the greenery .  and everywhere there were v shaped ripples cutting gently through the water .      i expect it   s really nice here when the sun   s out     said nanny .   saturday trudged into the shack and returned with a makeshift fishing pole  which he baited and cast over the rail .  then he sort of switched off  no one has more patience than a zombie .   mrs .  gogol leaned back in her rocking chair and lit her pipe .      this used to be a great ole city     she said .      what happened to it .     said nanny .     greebo was having a lot of trouble with legba the cockerel .   for one thing  the bird refused to be terrorized .  greebo could terrorize most things that moved upon the face of the discworld  even creatures nominally much bigger and tougher than he was .  yet somehow none of his well tried tactics   the yawn  the stare and above all the slow grin   seemed to work .  legba merely looked down his beak at him  and pretended to scratch at the ground in a way that brought his two inch spurs into even greater prominence .   that only left the flying leap .  this worked on nearly every creature .  very few animals remained calm in the face of an enraged ball of whirring claws in the face .  in the case of this bird  greebo suspected  it might well result in his becoming a furry kebab .   but this had to be resolved .  otherwise generations of cats would laugh at him .   cat and bird circled through the swamp  each apparently paying the other no attention whatsoever .   things gibbered in the trees .  small iridescent birds barreled through the air .  greebo glared up at them .  he would sort them out later .   and the cockerel had vanished .   greebo   s ears flattened against his head .   there was still the birdsong and the whine of insects  but they were elsewhere .  here there was silence   hot  dark and oppressive   and trees that were somehow much closer together than he remembered .   greebo looked around .   he was in a clearing .  around its sides  hanging from bushes or tied to trees  were things .  bits of ribbon .  white bones .  tin pots .  perfectly ordinary things  anywhere else .   and in the center of the clearing  something like a scarecrow .  an upright pole with a crosspiece  on which someone had put an old black coat .  above the coat  on the tip of the pole  was a top hat .  on top of the hat  watching him thoughtfully  was legba .   a breeze blew through the stifling air  causing the coat to flap gently .   greebo remembered a day when he   d chased a rat into the village windmill and had suddenly found that what had seemed merely a room with odd furniture in it was a great big machine which would  if he put a paw wrong  crush him utterly .   the air sizzled gently .  he could feel his fur standing on end .   greebo turned and stalked away haughtily  until he judged himself out of sight  whereupon his legs spun so fast that his paws skidded .   then he went and grinned at some alligators  but his heart wasn   t in it .   in the clearing  the coat moved gently again and then was still .  somehow  that was worse .   legba watched .  the air grew heavier  just as it does before a storm .        this used to be a great old city .  a happy place .  no one tried to make it happy .  it just happened  all by itself     said mrs .  gogol .     that was when the old baron was alive .  but he was murdered .         who done it .     said nanny ogg .      everyone knows it was the duc     said mrs .  gogol .   the witches looked at one another .  royal intrigues were obviously a bit different in foreign parts .      pecked to death  was he .     said nanny .      a foul deed .     said granny .      the duc is a title  not a bird     said mrs .  gogol patiently .     the baron was poisoned .  it was a terrible night .  and  in the morning  the duc was in the palace .  then there was the matter of the will .         don   t tell me     said granny .     i bet there was a will leaving everything to this duc .  i bet the ink was still wet .         how did you know that .     said mrs .  gogol .      stands to reason     said granny loftily .      the baron had a young daughter     said mrs .  gogol .      she   d be still alive  i reckon     said granny .      you surely know a lot of things  lady     said mrs .  gogol .     why   d you think that  then .         well       said granny .  she was about to say  because i know how the stories work .  but nanny ogg interrupted .      if this baron was as great as you say  he must have had a lot of friends in the city  right .     she said .      that is so .  the people liked him .         well  if i was a duc with no more claim on things than a smudgy will and a little bottle of ink with the cork still out  i   d be lookin    for any chance to make things a bit more official     said nanny .     marryin    the real heir   d be favorite .  he could thumb his nose at everyone  then .  i bet she don   t know who she really is  eh .         that   s right     said mrs .  gogol .     the duc   s got friends  too .  or keepers  maybe .  not people you   d want to cross .  they   ve brought her up  and they don   t let her out much .      the witches sat in silence for a while .   granny thought  no .  that   s not quite right .  that   s how it   d appear in a history book .  but that   s not the story .   then granny said        scuse me  mrs .  gogol  but where do you come in all this .  no offense  but i reckon that out here in the swamp it   d be all the same whoever was doing the rulin    .      for the first time since they   d met her  mrs .  gogol looked momentarily uneasy .      the baron was   a friend of mine     she said .      ah     said granny understandingly .      he wasn   t keen on zombies  mark you .  he said he thought the dead should be allowed their rest .  but he never insisted .  whereas this new one        not keen on the interestin    arts .     said nanny .      oh  i reckon he is     said granny .     he   d have to be .  not your magic  maybe  but i bet he   s got a lot of magic around him .         why d   you say that  lady .     said mrs .  gogol .      well     said nanny     i can see that you  being a lady o    spirit  wouldn   t put up with this if you didn   t have to .  there   s lots of ways to sort matters out  i    spect .  i    spect  if you dint like someone  their legs might unexpectedly drop off  or they might find mysterious snakes in their boots           alleygators under their bed     suggested granny .      yes .  he   s got protection     said mrs .  gogol .      ah .         powerful magic .         more powerful   n you .     said granny .   there was a long and difficult pause .      yes .         ah .         for now     mrs .  gogol added .   there was another pause .  no witch ever liked admitting to less than near absolute power  or even hearing another witch doing so .      you   re biding your time  i expect     said granny kindly .      wifing your strength     said nanny .      it   s powerful protection     said mrs .  gogol .   granny sat back in her chair .  when she spoke next  it was as a person who has certain ideas in their mind and wants to find out what someone else knows .      what sort .     she said .     exactly .      mrs .  gogol reached into the cushions of her rocking chair and  after some rummaging  produced a leather bag and a pipe .  she lit the pipe and puffed a cloud of bluish smoke into the morning air .      you look in mirrors a lot these days  mistress weatherwax .     she said .   granny   s chair tipped backward  almost throwing her off the veranda and into the inky waters .  her hat flew away into the lily pads .   she had time to see it settle gently on the water .  it floated for a moment and then        was eaten .  a very large alligator snapped its jaws shut and gazed smugly at granny .   it was a relief to have something to shout about .      my hat .  it ate my hat .  one of your alleygators ate my hat .  it was my hat .  make it give it back .      she snatched a length of creeper off the nearest tree and flailed at the water .   nanny ogg backed away .      you shouldn   t do that  esme .  you shouldn   t do that .     she quavered .  the alligator backed water .      i can hit cheeky lizards if i want .         yes  you can  you can     said nanny soothingly     but not   with a   snake        granny held up the creeper for inspection .  a medium sized three banded coit gave her a frightened look  considered biting her nose for a moment  thought better of it  and then shut its mouth very tightly in the hope she   d get the message .  she opened her hand .  the snake dropped to the boards and slithered away quickly .   mrs .  gogol hadn   t stirred in her chair .  now she half turned .  saturday was still patiently watching his fishing line .      saturday  go and fetch the lady   s hat     she said .      yes  m   m .      even granny hesitated at that .      you can   t make him do that .     she said .      but he   s dead     said mrs .  gogol .      yes  but it   s bad enough being dead without bein    in bits too     said granny .     don   t you go in there  mr .  saturday .         but it was your hat  lady     said mrs .  gogol .      yes  but       said granny        a   hat was all it was .  i wouldn   t send anyone into any alligators for any hat .      nanny ogg looked horrified .   no one knew better than granny weatherwax that hats were important .  they weren   t just clothing .  hats defined the head .  they defined who you were .  no one had ever heard of a wizard without a pointy hat   at least  no wizard worth speaking of .  and you certainly never heard of a witch without one .  even magrat had one  although she hardly ever wore it on account of being a wet hen .  that didn   t matter too much  it wasn   t the wearing of the hats that counted so much as having one to wear .  every trade  every craft had its hat .  that   s why kings had hats .  take the crown off a king and all you had was someone good at having a weak chin and waving to people .  hats had power .  hats were important .  but so were people .   mrs .  gogol took another puff at her pipe .      saturday  go and get my best hat for holidays     she said .      yes  mrs .  gogol .      saturday disappeared into the hut for a moment  and came out with a large and battered box securely wrapped with twine .      i can   t take that     said granny .     i can   t take your best hat .         yes you can     said mrs .  gogol .     i   ve got another hat .  oh  yes .  i   ve got another hat all right .      granny put the box down carefully .      it occurs to me  mrs .  gogol     she said     that you ain   t everything you seem .         oh yes i is  mistress weatherwax .  i never bin nothing else  just like you .         you brought us here .         no .  you brought yourselves here .  of your own free will .  to help someone  ain   t that right .  you decided to do it  ain   t that right .  no one forced you  ain   t that right .     cept yourselves .         she   s right about all that     said nanny .     we   d have felt it  if it was magic .         that   s right     said granny .     no one forced us  except ourselves .  what   s your game  mrs .  gogol .         i ain   t playing no game  mistress weatherwax .  i just want back what   s mine .  i want justice .  and i wants her stopped .         her who .     said nanny ogg .   granny   s face had frozen into a mask .      her who   s behind all this     said mrs .  gogol .     the duc hasn   t got the brains of a prawn  mrs .  ogg .  i mean her .  her with her mirror magic .  her who likes to control .  her who   s in charge .  her who   s tinkering with destiny .  her that mistress weatherwax knows all about .      nanny ogg was lost .      what   s she talking about  esme .     she said .   granny muttered something .      what .  didn   t hear you     nanny said .   granny weatherwax looked up  her face red with anger .      she means my sister  gytha .  right .  got that .  do you understand .  did you hear .  my sister .  want me to repeat it again .  want to know who she   s talking about .  you want me to write it down .  my sister .  that   s who .  my sister .           they   re sisters .     said magrat .   her tea had gone cold .      i don   t know     said ella .     they look   alike .  they keep themselves to themselves most of the time .  but i can feel them watching .  they   re very good at watching .         and they make you do all the work .     she said .      well  i only have to cook for myself and the outside staff     said ella .     and i don   t mind the cleaning and the laundry all that much .         do they do their own cooking  then .         i don   t think so .  they walk around the house at night  after i   ve gone to bed .  godmother lilith says i must be kind to them and pity them because they can   t talk  and always see that we   ve got plenty of cheese in the larder .         they eat nothing but cheese .     said magrat .      i don   t think so     said ella .      i should think the rats and mice get it  then  in an old place like this .         you know  it   s a funny thing     said ella     but i   ve never seen a mouse anywhere in this house .      magrat shivered .  she felt watched .      why don   t you just walk away .  i would .         where to .  anyway  they always find me .  or they send the coachmen and grooms after me .         that   s horrible .         i   m sure they think that sooner or later i   ll marry anyone to get away from laundry     said ella .     not that the prince   s clothes get washed  i expect     she added bitterly .     i expect they get burned after he   s worn them .         what you want to do is make a career of your own     said magrat encouragingly  to keep her spirits up .     you want to be your own woman .  you want to emancipate yourself .         i don   t think i want to do that     said ella  speaking with caution in case it was a sin to offend a fairy godmother .      you do really     said magrat .      do i .         yes .         oh .         you don   t have to marry anyone you don   t want to .      ella sat back .      how good are you .     she said .      er   well   i suppose i           the dress arrived yesterday     said ella .     it   s up in the big front room  on a stand so it doesn   t get creased .  so that it stays perfect .  and they   ve polished up the coach specially .  they   ve hired extra footmen  too .         yes  but perhaps           i think i   m going to have to marry someone i don   t want to     said ella .     granny weatherwax strode up and down the driftwood balcony .  the whole shack trembled to her stamping .  ripples spread out as it bounced on the water .      of course you don   t remember her .     she shouted .     our mam kicked her out when she was thirteen .  we was both tiny then .  but i remember the rows .  i used to hear them when i was in bed .  she was wanton .         you always used to say i was wanton  when we was younger     said nanny .   granny hesitated  caught momentarily off balance .  then she waved a hand irritably .      you was  of course     she said dismissively .     but you never used magic for it  did you .         din   t have to     said nanny happily .     an off the shoulder dress did the trick most of the time .         right off the shoulder and onto the grass  as i recall     said granny .     no  she used magic .  not just ordinary magic  neither .  oh  she was willful .      nanny ogg was about to say  what .  you mean not compliant and self effacing like what you is  esme .  but she stopped herself .  you didn   t juggle matches in a fireworks factory .      young men   s fathers used to come around to complain     said granny darkly .      they never came around to complain about me     said nanny happily .      and always looking at herself in mirrors     said granny .     prideful as a cat  she was .  prefer to look in a mirror than out of a window  she would .         what   s her name .         lily .         that   s a nice name     said nanny .      it isn   t what she calls herself now     said mrs .  gogol .      i bet it isn   t .         and she   s  like  in charge of the city .     said nanny .      she was bossy  too .         what   d she want to be in charge of a city for .     said nanny .      she   s got plans     said mrs .  gogol .      and vain .  really vain .     said granny  apparently to the world in general .      did you know she was here .     said nanny .      i had a feelin    .  mirrors .         mirror magic isn   t bad     protested nanny .     i   ve done all kinds of stuff with mirrors .  you can have a lot of fun with a mirror .         she doesn   t just use one mirror     said mrs .  gogol .      oh .         she uses two .         oh .  that   s different .      granny stared at the surface of the water .  her own face stared back at her from the darkness .   she hoped it was her own face  anyway .      i   ve felt her watchin    us  the whole way here     she said .     that   s where she   s happiest  inside mirrors .  inside mirrors  making people into stories .      she prodded the image with a stick .     she even got a look at me in desiderata   s house  just before magrat came in .  it ain   t nice  seeing someone else in your reflection        she paused .     where is magrat  anyway .         out fairy godmothering  i think     said nanny .     she said she didn   t need any help .        magrat was annoyed .  she was also frightened  which made her even more annoyed .  it was hard for people when magrat was annoyed .  it was like being attacked by damp tissue .      you have my personal word on it     she said .     you don   t have to go to the ball if you don   t want to .         you won   t be able to stop them     said ella darkly .     i know how things work in this city .         look  i said you won   t have to go .     said magrat .   she looked thoughtful .      there isn   t someone else you   d rather marry  is there .     she said .      no .  i don   t know many people .  i don   t get much chance .         good     said magrat .     that makes it easier .  i suggest we get you out of here and   and take you somewhere else .         there isn   t anywhere else .  i told you .  there   s just swamp .  i tried once or twice  and they sent the coachmen after me .  they weren   t unkind .  the coachmen  i mean .  they   re just afraid .  everyone   s afraid .  even the sisters are afraid  i think .      magrat looked around at the shadows .      what of .     she said .      they say that people disappear .  if they upset the duc .  something happens to them .  everyone   s very polite in genua     said ella sourly .     and no one steals and no one raises their voice and everyone stays indoors at night  except when it   s fat tuesday .     she sighed .     now that   s something i   d like to go to .  to the carnival .  they always make me stay in  though .  but i hear it passing through the city and i think  that   s what genua ought to be .  not a few people dancing in palaces  but everyone dancing in the streets .      magrat shook herself .  she felt a long way from home .      i think perhaps i might need a bit of help with this one     she said .      you   ve got a wand     said ella .      i think there   s times when you need more than a wand     said magrat .  she stood up .      but i   ll tell you this     she said .     i don   t like this house .  i don   t like this city .  emberella .         yes .         you won   t go to the ball .  i   ll make sure of that        she turned around .      i told you     murmured ella  looking down .     you can   t even hear them .      one of the sisters was at the top of the steps leading into the kitchen .  her gaze was fixed immovably on magrat .   they say that everyone has the attributes of some kind of animal .  magrat possibly had a direct mental link to some small furry creature .  she felt the terror of all small rodents in the face of unblinking death .  modulated over the menace of the gaze were all sorts of messages  the uselessness of flight  the stupidity of resistance  the inevitability of oblivion .   she knew she could do nothing .  her legs weren   t under her control .  it was as if commands were coming straight down that stare and into her spinal cord .  the sense of helplessness was almost peaceful        blessings be upon this house .      the sister spun around much faster than any human should be able to move .   granny weatherwax pushed open the door .     oh deary me     she thundered     and lawks .         yeah     said nanny ogg  crowding through the doorway behind her .     lawks too .         we   re just a couple of old beggar women     said granny  striding across the floor .      begging from house to house     said nanny ogg .     not coming directly here by any manner o    means .      they each caught one of magrat   s elbows and lifted her off her feet .   granny turned her head .      what about you  miss .      ella shook her head without looking up .      no     she said     i mustn   t come .      granny   s eyes narrowed .     i suppose not     she said .     we all have our path to walk  or so it is said  although not by me .  come  gytha .         we   re just off     said nanny ogg  brightly .   they turned .   another sister appeared in the doorway .      ye gods     said nanny ogg .     i never saw her move .         we was just going out     said granny weatherwax loudly .     if it   s all the same with you  m   lady .      she met the stare head on .   the air tingled .   then granny weatherwax said  between gritted teeth     when i say run  gytha           i hear you     said nanny .   granny groped behind her and found the teapot magrat had just used .  she weighed it in her hands  keeping the movements slow and gentle .      ready  gytha .         waitin     esme .         run .      granny hurled the teapot high into the air .  the heads of both sisters snapped around .   nanny ogg helped the stumbling magrat out of the door .  granny slammed it shut as the nearer sister darted forward  mouth open  too late .      we   re leaving the girl in there .     shouted nanny  as they ran down the drive .      they   re guarding her     said granny .     they   re not going to harm her .         i ain   t seen teeth like those on anyone before .     said nanny .      that   s    cos they ain   t anyone .  they   re snakes .      they reached the comparative security of the roadway and leaned against the wall .      snakes .     nanny wheezed .  magrat opened her eyes .      it   s lily   s doing     said granny .     she was good at that kind of thing  i remember .         really snakes .         yeah     said granny darkly .     she made friends easily .         blimey .  i couldn   t do that .         she didn   t used to be able to either  for more   n a few seconds .  that   s what using mirrors does for you .         i   i       magrat stuttered .      you   re all right     said nanny .  she looked up at esme weatherwax .      we shouldn   t leave the girl  whatever you say .  in a house with snakes walking around thinking they   re human     she said .      it   s worse than that .  they   re walking around thinking they   re snakes     said granny .      well  whatever .  you never do that sort of thing .  the worst you ever did was make people a bit confused about what they was .         that   s because i   m the good one     said granny bitterly .   magrat shuddered .      so are we going to get her out .     said nanny .      not yet .  there   s going to be a proper time     said granny .     can you hear me  magrat garlick .         yes  granny     said magrat .      we   ve got to go somewhere and talk     said granny .     about stories .         what about stories .     said magrat .      lily is using them     said granny .     don   t you see that .  you can feel it in this whole country .  the stories collect round here because here   s where they find a way out .  she feeds    em .  look  she don   t want your ella to marry that duc man just because of politics or something .  that   s just an   explanation .     s not a reason .  she wants the girl to marry the prince because that   s what the story demands .         what   s in it for her .     said nanny .      in the middle of    em all  the fairy godmother or the wicked witch   you remember .  that   s where lily is putting herself  like   like       she paused  trying to find the right word .     remember that time last year when the circus thing came to lancre .         i remember     said nanny .     them girls in the spangly tights and the fellows pourin    whitewash down their trousers .  never saw a elephant  though .  they said there   d be elephants and there wasn   t any .  it had elephants on the posters .  i spent a whole tuppence and there wasn   t a single ele           yes  but what i   m sayin        said granny  as they hurried along the street     is there was that man in the middle  you remember .  with the mustache and the big hat .         him .  but he didn   t do anything much     said nanny .     he just stood in the middle of the tent and sometimes he cracked his whip and all the acts just went on around him .         that   s why he was the most important one there     said granny .     it was the things going on around him that made him important .         what   s lily feeding the stories .     said magrat .      people     said granny .  she frowned .      stories .     she said .     well  we   ll have to see about that          green twilight covered genua .  the mists curled up from the swamp .   torches flared in the streets .  in dozens of yards shadowy figures moved  pulling the covers off floats .  in the darkness there was a flash of sequins and a jingle of bells .   all year the people of genua were nice and quiet .  but history has always allowed the downtrodden one night somewhere in any calendar to restore temporarily the balance of the world .  it might be called the feast of fools  or the king of the bean .  or even samedi nuit mort  when even those with the most taxing and responsible of duties can kick back and have fun .   most of them  anyway     the coachmen and the footmen were sitting in their shed at one side of the stable yard  eating their dinner and complaining about having to work on dead night .  they were also engaging in the time honored rituals that go therewith  which largely consist of finding out what their wives have packed for them today and envying the other men whose wives obviously cared more .   the head footman raised a crust cautiously .      i   ve got chicken neck and pickle     he said .     anyone got any cheese .      the second coachman inspected his box .     it   s boiled bacon again     he complained .     she always gives me boiled bacon .  she knows i don   t like it .  she don   t even cut the fat off .         is it thick white fat .     said the first coachman .      yeah .  horrible .  is this right for a holiday feast or what .         i   ll swap you a lettuce and tomato .         right .  what you got  jimmy .      the underfootman shyly opened his perfect package .  there were four sandwiches  crusts cut off .  there was a sprig of parsley .  there was even a napkin .      smoked salmon and cream cheese     he said .      and still a bit of the wedding cake     said the first coachman .     ain   t you et that all up yet .         we have it every night     said the underfootman .   the shed shook with the ensuing laughter .  it is a universal fact that any innocent comment made by any recently married young member of any workforce is an instant trigger for coarse merriment among his or her older and more cynical colleagues .  this happens even if everyone concerned has nine legs and lives at the bottom of an ocean of ammonia on a huge cold planet .  it   s just one of those things .      you make the most of it     said the second coachman gloomily  when they   d settled down again .     it starts off kisses and cake and them cutting the crusts off  and next thing you know it   s down to tongue pie  cold bum and the copper stick .         the way i see it     the first coachman began     it   s all about the way you        there was a knocking at the door .   the underfootman  being the junior member  got up and opened it .      it   s an old crone     he said .     what do you want  old crone .         fancy a drink .     said nanny ogg .  she held up a jug over which hung a perceptible haze of evaporating alcohol  and blew a paper squeaker .      what .     said the footman .      shame for you lads to be working .  it   s a holiday .  whoopee .         what   s going on .     the senior coachman began  and then he entered the cloud of alcohol .     gods .  what is that stuff .         smells like rum  mr .  travis .      the senior coachman hesitated .  from the streets came music and laughter as the first of the processions got under way .  fireworks popped across the sky .  it wasn   t a night to be without just a sip of alcohol .      what a nice old lady     he said .   nanny ogg waved the jug again .     up your eye .     she said .     mud in your bottom .        what might be called the classical witch comes in two basic varieties  the complicated and the simple  or  to put it another way  the ones that have a room full of regalia and the ones that don   t .  magrat was by inclination one of the former sort .  for example  take magical knives .  she had a complete collection of magical knives  all with the appropriate colored handles and complicated runes all over them .   it had taken many years under the tutelage of granny weatherwax for magrat to learn that the common kitchen breadknife was better than the most ornate of magic knives .  it could do all that the magical knife could do  plus you could also use it to cut bread .   every established kitchen has one ancient knife  its handle worn thin  its blade curved like a banana  and so inexplicably sharp that reaching into the drawer at night is like bobbing for apples in a piranha tank .   magrat had hers stuck in her belt .  currently she was thirty feet above the ground  one hand holding onto her broomstick  the other onto a drainpipe  both legs dangling .  housebreaking ought to be easy  when you had a broomstick .  but this did not appear to be the case .   finally she got both legs around the pipe and a firm grip on a timely gargoyle .  she waggled the knife in between the two halves of the window and lifted the latch .  after a certain amount of grunting  she was inside  leaning against the wall and panting .  blue lights flashed in front of her eyes  echoing the fireworks that laced the night outside .   granny had kept on asking her if she was sure she wanted to do this .  and she was amazed to find that she was sure .  even if the snake women were already wandering around the house .  being a witch meant going into places you didn   t want to go .   she opened her eyes .   there was the dress  in the middle of the floor  on a dressmaker   s dummy .   a klatchian candle burst over genua .  green and red stars exploded in the velvet darkness  and lit up the gems and silks in front of magrat .   it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen .   she crept forward  her mouth dry .     warm mists rolled through the swamp .   mrs .  gogol stirred the cauldron .      what are they doing .     said saturday .      stopping the story     she said .     or   maybe not        she stood up .      one way or another  it   s our time now .  let   s go to the clearing .      she looked at saturday   s face .      are you frightened .         i   know what will happen afterward     said the zombie .     even if we win .         we both do .  but we   ve had twelve years .         yes .  we   ve had twelve years .         and ella will rule the city .         yes .        in the coachmen   s shed nanny ogg and the coachmen were getting along  as she put it  like a maison en flamb   .   the underfootman smiled vaguely at the wall  and slumped forward .      that   s youngpipple today     said the head coachman  trying to fish his wig out of his mug .     can   t hold their drin   their drine   stuff           have a hair of the dog  mr .  travis .     said nanny  filling the mug .     or scale of the alligator or whatever you call it in these parts .         reckon     said the senior footman     we should be gettin    the coesshe ready  what say .         reckon you   ve got time for one more yet     said nanny ogg .      ver    generous     said the coachman .     ver    generous .  here   s lookin    at you  mrsrsrs goo          magrat had dreamed of dresses like this .  in the pit of her soul  in the small hours of the night  she   d danced with princes .  not shy  hardworking princes like verence back home  but real ones  with crystal blue eyes and white teeth .  and she   d worn dresses like this .  and they had fitted .   she stared at the ruched sleeves  the embroidered bodice  the fine white lace .  it was all a world away from her   well   nanny ogg kept calling them    magrats     but they were trousers  and very practical .   as if being practical mattered at all .   she stared for a long time .   then  with tears streaking her face and changing color as they caught the light of the fireworks  she took the knife and began to cut the dress into very small pieces .     the senior coachman   s head bounced gently off his sandwiches .   nanny ogg stood up  a little unsteadily .  she placed the junior footman   s wig under his slumbering head  because she was not an unkind woman .  then she stepped out into the night .   a figure moved near the wall .      magrat .     hissed nanny .      nanny .         did you see to the dress .         have you seen to the footmen .         right  then     said granny weatherwax  stepping out of the shadows .     then there   s just the coach .      she tiptoed theatrically to the coachhouse and opened the door .  it grated loudly on the cobbles .      shsss .     said nanny .   there was a stub of candle and some matches on a ledge .  magrat fumbled the candle alight .   the coach lit up like a glitter ball .   it was excessively ornate  as if someone had taken a perfectly ordinary coach and then gone insane with fretwork and gold paint .   granny weatherwax walked around it .      a bit showy     she said .      seems a real shame to smash it up     said nanny sadly .  she rolled up her sleeves and then  as an afterthought  tucked the hem of her skirt into her drawers .      bound to be a hammer somewhere around here     she said  turning to the benches along the walls .      don   t .  that   d make too much noise .     hissed magrat .     hang on a moment        she pulled the despised wand out of her belt  gripped it tightly  and waved it toward the coach .   there was a brief inrush of air .      blow me down     said nanny ogg .     i never would have thought of that .      on the floor was a large orange pumpkin .      it was nothing     said magrat  risking a touch of pride .      hah .  that   s one coach that   ll never roll again     said nanny .      hey   can you do that to the horses too .     said granny .   magrat shook her head .     um  i think that would be very cruel .         you   re right .  you   re right     said granny .     no excuse for cruelty to dumb animals .      the two stallions watched her with equine curiosity as she undid the loose box gates .      off you go     she said .     big green fields out there somewhere .      she glanced momentarily at magrat .     you have been em horse sipated .      this didn   t seem to have much effect .   granny sighed .  she climbed up onto the wooden wall that separated the boxes  reached up  grabbed a horse ear in either hand  and gently dragged their heads down level with her mouth .   she whispered something .   the stallions turned and looked one another in the eye .   then they looked down at granny .   she grinned at them  and nodded .   then     it is impossible for a horse to go instantly from a standing start to a gallop  but they almost managed it .      what on earth did you say to them .     said magrat .      mystic horseman   s word     said granny .     passed down to gytha   s jason  who passed it up to me .  works every time .         he told you it .     said nanny .      yes .         what  all of it .         yes     said granny  smugly .   magrat tucked the wand back into her belt .  as she did so  a square of white material fell onto the floor .   white gems and silk glimmered in the candlelight as she reached down hurriedly to pick it up  but there wasn   t a lot that escaped granny weatherwax .   she sighed .      magrat garlick       she began .      yes     said magrat meekly .     yes .  i know .  i   m a wet hen .      nanny patted her gently on the shoulder .      never mind     she said .     we   ve done a good night   s work here .  that ella has about as much chance of being sent to the ball tonight as i have of   of becoming queen .         no dress  no footmen  no horses and no coach     said granny .     i   d like to see her get out of that one .  stories .  hah .         so what   re we going to do now .     said magrat  as they crept out of the yard .      it   s fat lunchtime .     said nanny .     hot diggety pig .     greebo wandered out of the darkness and rubbed against her legs .      i thought lily was trying to stamp it out     said magrat .      may as well try to stamp out a flood     said nanny .     kick out a jam .         i don   t agree with dancing in the streets     said granny .     how much of that rum did you drink .         oh  come on  esme     said nanny .     they say if you can   t have a good time in genua you   re probably dead .     she thought about saturday .     you can probably have a bit of quiet fun even if you are dead  in genua .         hadn   t we better stay here  though .     said magrat .     just to make sure .      granny weatherwax hesitated .      what do you think  esme .     said nanny ogg .     you think she   s going to be sent to the ball in a pumpkin  eh .  get a few mice to pull it  eh .  heheh .      a vision of the snake women floated across granny weatherwax   s mind  and she hesitated .  but  after all  it had been a long day .  and it was ridiculous  when you came to think about it        well  all right     she said .     but i   m not going to kick any jam  you understand .         there   s dancing and all sorts     said nanny .      and banana drinks  i expect     said magrat .      it   s a million to one chance  yes     said nanny ogg happily .     lilith de tempscire smiled at herself in the double mirror .      oh deary me     she said .     no coach  no dress  no horses .  what is a poor old godmother to do .  deary me .  and probably lawks .      she opened a small leather case  such as a musician might use to carry his very best piccolo .   there was a wand in there  the twin of the one carried by magrat .  she took it out and gave it a couple of twists  moving the gold and silver rings into a new position .   the clicking sounded like the nastiest pump action mechanism .      and me with nothing but a pumpkin  too     said lilith .   and of course the difference between sapient and non sapient things was that while it was hard to change the shape of the former it was not actually impossible .  it was just a matter of changing a mental channel .  whereas a non sapient thing like a pumpkin  and it was hard to imagine anything less sapient than a pumpkin  could not be changed by any magic short of sorcery .   unless its molecules remembered a time when they weren   t a pumpkin     she laughed  and a billion reflected liliths laughed with her  all around the curve of the mirror universe .     fat lunchtime was no longer celebrated in the center of genua .  but in the shanty town around the high white buildings it strutted its dark and torchlit stuff .  there were fireworks .  there were dancers  and fire eaters  and feathers  and sequins .  the witches  whose idea of homely entertainment was a morris dance  watched openmouthed from the crowded sidewalk as the parades strutted by .      there   s dancing skeletons .     said nanny  as a score of bony figures whirred down the street .      they   re not     said magrat .     they   re just men in black tights with bones painted on .      someone nudged granny weatherwax .  she looked up into the large  grinning face of a black man .  he passed her a stone jug .      there you go  honey .      granny took it  hesitated for a moment  and then took a swig .  she nudged magrat and passed on the bottle .      frgtht .  .  gizeer .     she said .      what .     shouted magrat  above the noise of a marching band .      the man wants us to pass it on     said granny .   magrat looked at the bottle neck .  she tried surreptitiously to wipe it on her dress  despite the self evident fact that germs on it would have burned off long ago .  she ventured a brief nip  and then nudged nanny ogg .      kwizathugner .     she said  and dabbed at her eyes .   nanny up ended the bottle .  after a while magrat nudged her again .      i think we   re meant to pass it on .     she ventured .   nanny wiped her mouth and passed the now rather lighter jug randomly to a tall figure on her left .      here you go  mister     she said .   thank you .      nice costume you got there .  them bones are painted on really good .      nanny turned back to watch a procession of juggling fire eaters .  then a connection appeared to be made somewhere in the back of her mind .  she looked up .  the stranger had wandered off .   she shrugged .      what shall we do next .     she said .   granny weatherwax was staring fixedly at a group of ground zero limbo dancers .  a lot of the dances in the parades had this in common  they expressed explicitly what things like maypoles only hinted at .  they covered it with sequins  too .      you   ll never feel safe in the privy again  eh .     said nanny ogg .  at her feet greebo sat primly watching some dancing women wearing nothing but feathers  trying to work out what to do about them .      no .  i was thinkin    of something else .  i was thinkin    about   how stories work .  and now   i think i   d like something to eat     said granny weakly .  she rallied a bit .     and i mean some proper food  not somethin    scraped off the bottom of a pond .  and i don   t want any of this cuisine stuff  neither .         you ought to be more adventurous  granny     said magrat .      i ain   t against adventure  in moderation     said granny     but not when i   m eatin    .         there   s a place back there that does alligator sandwiches     said nanny  turning away from the parade .     can you believe that .  alligators in a sandwich .         that reminds me of a joke     said granny weatherwax .  something was nagging at her consciousness .   nanny ogg started to cough  but it didn   t work .      this man went into an inn     said granny weatherwax  trying to ignore the rising uneasiness .     and he saw this sign .  and it said    we serve all kinds of sandwiches .     and it said     get me an alligator sandwich   and i want it right away .         i don   t think alligator sandwiches is very kind to alligators     said magrat  dropping the observation into the leaden pause .      i always say a laugh does you good     said nanny .     lilith smiled at the figure of ella  standing forlornly between the snake women .      and such a raggedy dress  too     she said .     and the door to the room was locked .  tut tut .  however can it have happened .      ella stared at her feet .   lilith smiled at the sisters .     well     she said     we   ll just have to do the best we can with what we   ve got .  hmm .  fetch me   fetch me two rats and two mice .  i know you can always find rats and mice .  and bring in the big pumpkin .      she laughed .  not the mad  shrill laughter of the bad fairy who   s been defeated  but the rather pleasant laughter of someone who   s just seen the joke .   she looked reflectively at the wand .      but first     she said  transferring her gaze to ella   s pale face     you   d better bring in those naughty men who let themselves get so drunk .  that   s not respectful .  and if you haven   t got respect  you haven   t got anything .      the clicking of the wand was the only sound in the kitchen .     nanny ogg poked at the tall drink in front of her .      beats me why they puts an umbrella in it     she said  sucking the cocktail cherry off the stick .     i mean  do they want to stop it getting wet or something .      she grinned at magrat and granny  who were both staring gloomily at the passing celebrations .      cheer up     she said .     never seen such a pair of long faces in all my puff .         that   s neat rum you   re drinking     said magrat .      you   re telling me     said nanny  taking a swig .     cheers .         it was too easy     said granny weatherwax .      it was only easy    cos we done it     said nanny .     you want something done  we   re the girls to do it  eh .  you show me anyone else who could have nipped in there and done all that in the nick of time  eh .  especially the coach bit .         it doesn   t make a good story     said granny .      oh  bugger stories     said nanny loftily .     you can always change a story .         only at the right places     said granny .     anyway  maybe they could get her a new dress and horses and a coach and everything .         where .  when .     said nanny .     it   s a holiday .  and there   s no time  anyway .  they   ll be starting the ball at any moment .      granny weatherwax   s fingers drummed on the edge of the caf   table .   nanny sighed .      now what .     she said .      it doesn   t happen like this     said granny .      listen  esme  the only kind of magic that   d work right now is wand magic .  and magrat   s got the wand .     nanny nodded at magrat .     ain   t that so  magrat .         um     said magrat .      not lost it  have you .         no  but           there you are  then .         only   um   ella said she   d got two godmothers        granny weatherwax   s hand thumped down on the table .  nanny   s drink flew into the air and overturned .      that   s right .     roared granny .      that was nearly full .  that was a nearly full drink     said nanny reproachfully .      come on .         best part of a whole glass of           gytha .         did i say i wasn   t coming .  i was just pointing out           now .         can i just ask the man to get me ano           gytha .        the witches were halfway up the street when a coach rattled out of the driveway and trundled away .      that can   t be it .     said magrat .     we got rid of it .         we ort to have chopped it up     said nanny .     there   s good eating on a pumpk           they   ve got us     said granny  slowing down to a stop .      can   t you get into the minds of the horses .     said magrat .   the witches concentrated .      they ain   t horses     said nanny .     they feel like           rats turned into horses     said granny  who was even better at getting into people   s minds than she was at getting under their skins .     they feel like that poor old wolf .  minds like a firework display .     she winced at the taste of them in her own head .      i bet     said granny  thoughtfully  as the coach skidded around the corner     i bet i could make the wheels fall right off .         that   s not the way     said magrat .     anyway  ella   s in there .         there may be another way     said nanny .     i know someone who could get inside them minds right enough .         who .     said magrat .      well  we   ve still got our brooms     said nanny .     it should be easy to overtake it  right .        the witches landed in an alleyway a few minutes ahead of the coach .      i don   t hold with this     said granny .     it   s the sort of thing lily does .  you can   t expect me to like this .  think of that wolf .      nanny lifted greebo out of his nest among the bristles .      but greebo   s nearly human anyway     she said .      hah .         and it   ll only be temp   ry  even with the three of us doing it     she said .     anyway  it   ll be int   resting to see if it works .         yes  but it   s wrong     said granny .      not for these parts  it seems     said nanny .      besides     said magrat virtuously     it can   t be bad if we   re doing it .  we   re the good ones .         oh yes  so we is     said granny     and there was me forgetting it for a minute there .      nanny stood back .  greebo  aware that something was expected of him  sat up .      you must admit we can   t think of anything better  granny     said magrat .   granny hesitated .  but under all the revulsion was the little treacherous flame of fascination with the idea .  besides  she and greebo had hated one another cordially for years .  almost human  eh .  give him a taste of it  then  and see how he likes it   she felt a bit ashamed of the thought .  but not much .      oh  all right .      they concentrated .   as lily knew  changing the shape of an object is one of the hardest magics there is .  but it   s easier if the object is alive .  after all  a living thing already knows what shape it is .  all you have to do is change its mind .   greebo yawned and stretched .  to his amazement he went on stretching .   through the pathways of his feline brain surged a tide of belief .  he suddenly believed he was human .  he wasn   t simply under the impression that he was human  he believed it implicitly .  the sheer force of the unshakable belief flowed out into his morphic field  overriding its objections  rewriting the very blueprint of his self .   fresh instructions surged back .   if he was human  he didn   t need all this fur .  and he ought to be bigger     the witches watched  fascinated .      i never thought we   d do it     said granny .      no points on the ears  the whiskers were too long        he needed more muscle  all these bones were the wrong shape  these legs ought to be longer     and then it was finished .   greebo unfolded himself and stood up  a little unsteadily .   nanny stared  her mouth open .   then her eyes moved downward .      cor     she said .      i think     said granny weatherwax     that we   d better imagine some clothes on him right now .      that was easy enough .  when greebo had been clothed to her satisfaction granny nodded and stood back .      magrat  you can open your eyes     she said .      i hadn   t got them closed .         well  you should have had .      greebo turned slowly  a faint  lazy smile on his scarred face .  as a human  his nose was broken and a black patch covered his bad eye .  but the other one glittered like the sins of angels  and his smile was the downfall of saints .  female ones  anyway .   perhaps it was pheromones  or the way his muscles rippled under his black leather shirt .  greebo broadcast a kind of greasy diabolic sexuality in the megawatt range .  just looking at him was enough to set dark wings fluttering in the crimson night .      uh  greebo     said nanny .   he opened his mouth .  incisors glittered .      wrowwwwl     he said .      can you understand me .         yessss  nannyyy .      nanny ogg leaned against the wall for support .   there was the sound of hooves .  the coach had turned into the street .      get out there and stop that coach .      greebo grinned again  and darted out of the alley .   nanny fanned herself with her hat .      whoo eee     she said .     and to think i used to tickle his tummy   no wonder all the lady cats scream at night .         gytha .         well  you   ve gone very red  esme .         i   m just out of breath     said granny .      funny  that .  it   s not as if you   ve been running .        the coach rattled down the street .   the coachmen and footmen were not at all sure what they were .  their minds oscillated wildly .  one moment they were men thinking about cheese and bacon rinds .  and the next they were mice wondering why they had trousers on .   as for the horses   horses are a little insane anyway  and being a rat as well wasn   t any help .   so none of them were in a very stable frame of mind when greebo stepped out of the shadows and grinned at them .   he said     wrowwwl .      the horses tried to stop  which is practically impossible with a coach still piling along behind you .  the coachmen froze in terror .      wrowwwl .      the coach skidded around and came up broadside against a wall  knocking the coachmen off .  greebo picked one of them up by his collar and bounced him up and down while the maddened horses fought to get out of the shafts .      run awayy  furry toy .     he suggested .   behind the frightened eyes man and mouse fought for supremacy .  but they needn   t have bothered .  they would lose either way .  as consciousness flickered between the states it saw either a grinning cat or a six foot  well muscled  one eyed grinning bully .   the coachmouse fainted .  greebo patted him a few times  in case he was going to move        wake up  little mousy           and then lost interest .   the coach door rattled  jammed  and then opened .      what   s happening .     said ella .      wrowwwwl .      nanny ogg   s boot hit greebo on the back of his head .      oh no you don   t  my lad     she said .      want to     said greebo sulkily .      you always do  that   s your trouble     said nanny  and smiled at ella .     out you come  dear .      greebo shrugged  and then slunk off  dragging the stunned coachman after him .      what   s happening .     complained ella .     oh .  magrat .  did you do this .      magrat allowed herself a moment   s shy pride .      i said you wouldn   t have to go to the ball  didn   t i .      ella looked around at the disabled coach  and then back to the witches .      you ain   t got any snake women in there with you  have you .     said granny .  magrat gripped the wand .      they went on ahead     said ella .  her face clouded as she recalled something .      lilith turned the real coachmen into beetles     she whispered .     i mean  they weren   t that bad .  she made them get some mice and she made them human and then she said  there   s got to be balance  and the sisters dragged in the coachmen and she turned them into beetles and then   she trod on them        she stopped  horrified .   a firework burst in the sky  but in the street below a bubble of terrible silence hung in the air .      witches don   t kill people     said magrat .      this is foreign parts     muttered nanny  looking away .      i think     said granny weatherwax     that you ought to get right away from here  young lady .         they just went crack           we   ve got the brooms     said magrat .     we could all get away .         she   d send something after you     said ella darkly .     i know her .  something from out of a mirror .         so we   d fight it     said magrat .      no     said granny .     whatever   s going to happen   s going to happen here .  we   ll send the young lady off somewhere safe and then   we shall see .         but if i go away she   ll know     said ella .     she   s expecting to see me at the ball right now .  and she   ll come looking .         that sounds right  esme     said nanny ogg .     you want to face her somewhere you choose .  i don   t want her lookin    for us on a night like this .  i want to see her coming .      there was a fluttering in the darkness above them .  a small dark shape glided down and landed on the cobbles .  even in the darkness its eyes gleamed .  it stared expectantly at the witches with far too much intelligence for a mere fowl .      that   s mrs .  gogol   s cockerel     said nanny     ain   t it .         exactly what it is i might never exactly decide     said granny .     i wish i knew where she stood .         good or bad  you mean .     said magrat .      she   s a good cook     said nanny .     i don   t think anyone can cook like she do and be that bad .         is she the woman who lives out in the swamp .     said ella .     i   ve heard all kinds of stories about her .         she   s a bit too ready to turn dead people into zombies     said granny .     and that   s not right .         well  we just turned a cat into a person   i mean  a human person      nanny  inveterate cat lover  corrected herself      and that   s not strictly right either .  it   s probably a long way from strictly right .         yes  but we did it for the right reasons     said granny .      we don   t know what mrs .  gogol   s reasons are        there was a growl from the alleyway .  nanny scuttled toward it  and they heard her scolding voice .      no .  put him down this minute .         mine .  mine .      legba strutted a little way along the street  and then turned and looked expectantly at them .   granny scratched her chin  and walked a little way away from magrat and ella  sizing them up .  then she turned and looked around .      hmm     she said .     lily is expecting to see you  ain   t she .         she can look out of reflections     said ella nervously .      hmm     said granny again .  she stuck her finger in her ear and twiddled it for a moment .     well  magrat  you   re the godmother around here .  what   s the most important thing we have to do .      magrat had never played a card game in her life .      keep ella safe     she said promptly  amazed at granny suddenly admitting that she was  after all  the one who had been given the wand .     that   s what fairy godmothering is all about .         yes .      granny weatherwax frowned .      you know     she said     you two are just about the same size        magrat   s expression of puzzlement lasted for half a second before it was replaced by one of sudden horror .   she backed away .      someone   s got to do it     said granny .      oh  no .  no .  it wouldn   t work .  it really wouldn   t work .  no .         magrat garlick     said granny weatherwax  triumphantly     you shall go to the ball .        the coach cornered on two wheels .  greebo stood on the coachman   s box  swaying and grinning madly and cracking the whip .  this was even better than his fluffy ball with a bell in it     inside the coach magrat was wedged between the two older witches  her head in her hands .      but ella might get lost in the swamp .         not with that cockerel leading the way .  she   ll be safer in mrs .  gogol   s swamp than at the ball  i know that     said nanny .      thank you .         you   re welcome     said granny .      everyone   ll know i   m not her .         not with the mask on they won   t     said granny .      but my hair   s the wrong color .         i can tint that up a treat  no problem     said nanny .      i   m the wrong shape .         we can       granny hesitated .     can you  you know  puff yourself out a bit more .         no .         have you got a spare handkerchief  gytha .         i reckon i could tear a bit off my petticoat  esme .         ouch .         there .         and these glass shoes don   t fit .         they fit me fine     said nanny .     i gave    em a try .         yes  but i   ve got smaller feet than you .         that   s all right     said granny .     you put on a couple of pairs of my socks and they   ll fit real snug .      bereft of all further excuses  magrat struck out in sheer desperation .      but i don   t know how to behave at balls .      granny weatherwax had to admit that she didn   t  either .  she raised her eyebrows at nanny .      you used to go dancin    when you were young     she said .      well     said nanny ogg  social tutor     what you do is  you tap men with your fan   got your fan .    and say things like    la  sir .     it helps to giggle  too .  and flutter your eyelashes a bit .  and pout .         how am i supposed to pout .      nanny ogg demonstrated .      yuk .         don   t worry     said granny .     we   ll be there too .         and that   s supposed to make me feel better  is it .      nanny reached behind magrat and grabbed granny   s shoulder .  her lips formed the words  won   t work .  she   s all to pieces .  no confidence .   granny nodded .      perhaps i ought to do it     said nanny  in a loud voice .     i   m experienced at balls .  i bet if i wore my hair long and wore the mask and them shiny shoes and we hemmed up the dress a foot no one   d know the difference  what do you say .      magrat was so overawed by the sheer fascinating picture of this that she obeyed unthinkingly when granny weatherwax said     look at me  magrat garlick .        the pumpkin coach entered the palace drive at high speed  scattering horses and pedestrians  and braked by the steps in a shower of gravel .      that was fun     said greebo .  and then lost interest .   a couple of flunkies bustled forward to open the door  and were nearly thrown back by the sheer force of the arrogance that emanated from within .      hurry up  peasants .      magrat swept out  pushing the major domo away .  she gathered up her skirts and ran up the red carpet .  at the top  a footman was unwise enough to ask her for her ticket .      you impertinent lackey .      the footman  recognizing instantly the boundless bad manners of the well bred  backed away quickly .   down by the coach  nanny ogg said     you don   t think you might have overdone it a little bit .         i had to     said granny .     you know what she   s like .         how are we going to get in .  we ain   t got tickets .  and we ain   t dressed properly  either .         get the broomsticks down off the rack     said granny .     we   re going straight to the top .        they touched down on the battlements of a tower overlooking the palace grounds .  the strains of courtly music drifted up from below  and there was the occasional pop and flare of fireworks from the river .   granny opened a likely looking door in the tower and descended the circular stairs  which led to a landing .      posh carpet on the floor     said nanny .     why   s it on the walls too .         them   s tapestries     said granny .      cor     said nanny .     you live and learn .  well  i do anyway .      granny stopped with her hand on a doorknob .      what do you mean by that .     she said .      well  i never knew you had a sister .         we never talked about her .         it   s a shame when families break up like that     said nanny .      huh .  you said your sister beryl was a greedy ingrate with the conscience of an oyster .         well  yes  but she is my sister .      granny opened the door .      well  well     she said .      what   s up .  what   s up .  don   t just stand there .     nanny peered around her and into the room .      coo     she said .     magrat paused in the big  red velvet anteroom .  strange thoughts fireworked around her head  she hadn   t felt like this since the herbal wine .  but struggling among them like a tiny prosaic potato in a spray of psychedelic chrysanthemums was an inner voice screaming that she didn   t even know how to dance .  apart from in circles .   but it couldn   t be difficult if ordinary people managed it .   the tiny inner magrat struggling to keep its balance on the surge of arrogant self confidence wondered if this was how granny weatherwax felt all the time .   she raised the hem of her dress slightly and looked down at her shoes .   they couldn   t be real glass  or else she   d be hobbling toward some emergency first aid by now .  nor were they transparent .  the human foot is a useful organ but is not  except to some people with highly specialized interests  particularly attractive to look at .   the shoes were mirrors .  dozens of facets caught the light .   two mirrors on her feet .  magrat vaguely recalled something about   about a witch never getting caught between two mirrors  wasn   t it .  or was it never trust a man with orange eyebrows .  something she   d been taught  back when she   d been an ordinary person .  something   like   a witch should never stand between two mirrors because  because  because the person that walked away might not be the same person .  or something .  like   you were spread out among the images  your whole soul was pulled out thin  and somewhere in the distant images a dark part of you would get out and come looking for you  if you weren   t very careful .  or something .   she overruled the thought .  it didn   t matter .   she stepped forward  to where a little knot of other guests were waiting to make their entrance .      lord henry gleet and lady gleet .      the ballroom wasn   t a room at all  but a courtyard open to the soft night air .  steps led down into it .  at the far end  another much wider staircase  lined with flickering torches  led up into the palace itself .  on the far wall  huge and easily visible  was a clock .      the honorable douglas incessant .      the time was a quarter to eight .  magrat had a vague recollection of some old woman shouting something about the time  but   that didn   t matter either        lady volentia d    arrangement .      she reached the top of the stairs .  the butler who was announcing the arrivals looked her up and down and then  in the manner of one who had been coached carefully all afternoon for this very moment  bellowed      er   mysterious and beautiful stranger .      silence spread out from the bottom of the steps like spilled paint .  five hundred heads turned to look at magrat .   a day before  even the mere thought of having five hundred people staring at her would have melted magrat like butter in a furnace .  but now she stared back  smiled  and raised her chin haughtily .   her fan snapped open like a gunshot .   the mysterious and beautiful stranger  daughter of simplicity garlick  granddaughter of araminta garlick  her self possession churning so strongly that it was crystalizing out on the sides of her personality        stepped out .     a moment later another guest stalked past the butler .   the butler hesitated .  something about the figure worried him .  it kept going in and out of focus .  he wasn   t entirely certain if there was anyone else there at all .   then his common sense  which had temporarily gone and hidden behind something  took over .  after all  it was samedi nuit mort   people were supposed to dress up and look weird .  you were allowed to see people like that .      excuse me  er  sir     he said .     who shall i say it is .      i   m here incognito .   the butler was sure nothing had been said  but he was also certain that he had heard the words .      um   fine       he mumbled .     go on in  then   um .     he brightened .     damn good mask  sir .      he watched the dark figure walk down the steps  and leaned against a pillar .   well  that was about it .  he pulled a handkerchief out from his pocket  removed his powdered wig  and wiped his brow .  he felt as though he   d just had a narrow escape  and what was even worse was that he didn   t know from what .   he looked cautiously around  and then sidled into the anteroom and took up a position behind a velvet curtain  where he could enjoy a quiet roll up .   he nearly swallowed it when another figure loped silently up the red carpet .  it was dressed like a pirate that had just raided a ship carrying black leather goods for the discerning customer .  one eye had a patch over it .  the other gleamed like a malevolent emerald .  and no one that big ought to be able to walk that quietly .   the butler stuck the dog end behind his ear .      excuse me  milord     he said  running after the man and touching him firmly yet respectfully on the arm .     i shall need to see your tic   your   tic        the man transferred his gaze to the hand on his arm .  the butler let go hurriedly .      wrowwwl .         your   ticket        the man opened his mouth and hissed .      of course     said the butler  backing away with the efficient speed of someone who certainly isn   t being paid enough to face a needle toothed maniac in black leather     i expect you   re one of the duc   s friends  yes .         wrowwl .         no problem   no problem   but sir has forgotten sir   s mask           wrowwl .      the butler waved frantically to a side table piled high with masks .      the duc requested that everyone here is masked     said the butler .     er .  i wonder if sir would find something here to his liking .      there   s always a few of them  he thought to himself .  it says    masque    in big curly letters on the invite  in gold yet  but there   s always a few buggers who thinks it means it   s from someone called maskew .  this one was quite likely looting towns when he should have been learning to read .   the greasy man stared at the masks .  all the good ones had been taken by earlier arrivals  but that didn   t seem to dismay him .   he pointed .      want that one     he said .      er   a   very good choice  my lord .  allow me to help you on           wrowwl .      the butler backed away  clutching at his own arm .   the man glared at him  then dropped the mask over his head and squinted out through an eyehole at a mirror .   damn odd  the butler thought .  i mean  it   s not the kind of mask the men choose .  they go for skulls and birds and bulls and stuff like that .  not cats .   the odd thing was that the mask had just been a pretty ginger cat head when it was on the table .  on its wearer it was   still a cat head  only a lot more so  and somehow slightly more feline and a lot nastier than it should have been .      aaalwaaays waanted to bee ginger     said the man .      on you it looks good  sir     trilled the butler .   the cat headed man turned his head this way and that  clearly in love with what he was seeing .   greebo yowled softly and happily to himself and ambled into the ball .  he wanted something to eat  someone to fight  and then   well  he   d have to see .   for wolves and pigs and bears  thinking that they   re human is a tragedy .  for a cat  it   s an experience .   besides  this new shape was a lot more fun .  no one had thrown an old boot at him for over ten minutes .     the two witches looked around the room .      odd     said nanny ogg .     not what i   d expect in  you know  a royal bedroom .         is it a royal bedroom .         there   s a crown on the door .         oh .      granny looked around at the decor .      what do you know about royal bedrooms .     she said  more or less for something to say .     you   ve never been in a royal bedroom .         i might have been     said nanny .      you never have .         remember young verence   s coronation .  we all got invited to the palace .     said nanny .     when i went to have a   to powder my nose i saw the door open  so i went in and had a bit of a bounce up and down .         that   s treason .  you can get put in prison for that     said granny severely  and added     what was it like .         very comfy .  young magrat doesn   t know what she   s missing .  and it was a lot better than this  i don   t mind saying     said nanny .   the basic color was green .  green walls  green floor .  there was a wardrobe and a bedside table .  even a bedside rug  which was green .  the light filtered in through a window filled with greenish glass .      like being at the bottom of a pond     said granny .  she swatted something .     and there   s flies everywhere .     she paused  as if thinking very hard  and said     hmm           a duc pond     said nanny .   there were flies everywhere .  they buzzed on the window and zigzagged aimlessly back and forth across the ceiling .      duc pond     nanny repeated  because people who make that kind of joke never let well enough alone     like duck           i heard     said granny .  she flailed at a fat bluebottle .      anyway  you   d think there wouldn   t be flies in a royal bedroom     muttered nanny .      you   d think there   d be a bed  in fact     said granny .   which there wasn   t .  what there was instead  and what was preying somewhat on their minds  was a big round wooden cover on the floor .  it was about six feet across .  there were convenient handles .   they walked around it .  flies rose up and hummed away .      i   m thinking of a story     said granny .      me too     said nanny ogg  her tone slightly shriller than usual .     there was this girl who married this man and he said you can go anywhere you like in the palace but you mustn   t open that door and she did and she found he   d murdered all his other        her voice trailed off .   granny was staring hard at the cover  and scratching her chin .      put it like this     said nanny  trying to be reasonable against all odds .     what could we possibly find under there that   s worse than we could imagine .      they each took a handle .     five minutes later granny weatherwax and nanny ogg stepped outside the duc   s bedroom .  granny closed the door very quietly .   they stared at one another .      cor     said nanny  her face still pale .      yes     said granny .     stories .         i   d heard about   you know  people like him  but i never believed it .  yuk .  i wonder what he looks like .         you can   t tell just by lookin        said granny .      it explains the flies  at any rate     said nanny ogg .   she raised a hand to her mouth in horror .      and our magrat   s down there with him .     she said .     and you know what   s going to happen .  they   re going to meet one another and           but there   s hundreds of other people     said granny .     it   s hardly what you   d call intimate .         yes   but even the thought of him  you know  even touching her   i mean  it   d be like holding a           does ella count as a princess  d   you think .     said granny .      what .  oh .  yeah .  probably .  for foreign parts .  why .         then that means there   s more than one story here .  lily   s letting several happen all at the same time     said granny .     think about it .  it   s not touching that   s the trick .  it   s kissing .         we   ve got to get down there .     said nanny .     we   ve got to stop it .  i mean  you know me  i   m no prude  but   yuk           i say .  old woman .      they turned .  a small fat woman in a red dress and a towering white wig was peering haughtily at them from behind a fox mask .      yes .     snapped granny .      yes  my lady     said the fat woman .     where are your manners .  i demand that you direct me to the powder room this instant .  and what do you think you   re doing .      this was to nanny ogg  who was walking around her and staring critically at her dress .      you   re a     maybe a    .     said nanny .      what .  what is this impertinence .      nanny ogg rubbed her chin thoughtfully .     well  i dunno     she said     red in a dress has never been me .  you haven   t got anything in blue  have you .      the choleric woman turned to strike nanny with her fan  but a skinny hand tapped her on the shoulder .   she looked up into granny weatherwax   s face .   as she passed out dreamily she was aware of a voice  a long way off  saying     well  that   s me fitted .  but she   s never a size    .  and if i had a face like that i   d never wear red          lady volentia d   arrangement relaxed in the inner sanctum of the ladies    rest room .  she removed her mask and fished an errant beauty spot from the depths of her d  colletage .  then she reached around and down to try and adjust her bustle  an exercise guaranteed to produce the most ridiculous female gymnastics on every world except those where the panty girdle had been invented .   apart from being as well adapted a parasite as the oak bracket fungus lady volentia d   arrangement was  by and large  a blameless sort of person .  she always attended events for the better class of charity  and made a point of knowing the first names of nearly all her servants   the cleaner ones  at least .  and she was  on the whole  kind to animals and even to children if they had been washed and didn   t make too much noise .  all in all  she didn   t deserve what was about to happen to her  which was the fate mother nature had in store for any woman in this room on this night who happened to have approximately the same measurements as granny weatherwax .   she was aware of someone coming up beside her .      s   cuse me  missus .      it turned out to be a small  repulsive lower class woman with a big ingratiating smile .      what do you want  old woman .     said lady volentia .      s   cuse me     said nanny ogg .     my friend over there would like a word with you .      lady volentia looked around haughtily into        icy  blue eyed  hypnotic oblivion .        what   s this thing like an extra bu   hobo .         it   s a bustle  esme .         it   s damn uncomfortable is what it is .  i keep on feeling someone   s following me around .         the white suits you  anyway .         no it don   t .  black   s the only color for a proper witch .  and this wig is too hot .  who wants a foot of hair on their heads .      granny donned her mask .  it was an eagle   s face in white feathers stuck with sequins .   nanny adjusted some unmentionable underpinning somewhere beneath her crinoline and straightened up .      cor  look at us     she said .     them feathers in your hair really look good .         i   ve never been vain     said granny weatherwax .     you know that  gytha .  no one could ever call me vain .             no  esme     said nanny ogg .     granny twirled a bit .      are you ready then  dame ogg .     she said .      yes .  let   s do it  lady weatherwax .        the dance floor was thronged .  decorations hung from every pillar  but they were black and silver  the colors of the festival of samedi nuit mort .  an orchestra was playing on a balcony .  dancers whirled .  the din was immense .   a waiter with a tray of drinks suddenly found that he was a waiter without a tray of drinks .  he looked around  and then down to a small fox under a huge white wig .      bugger off and get us some more     said nanny pleasantly .     can you see her  your ladyship .         there   s too many people .         well  can you see the duc .         how do i know .  everyone   s got masks on .         hey  is that food over there .      many of the less energetic or more hungry of the genua nobility were clustered around the long buffet .  all they were aware of  apart from sharp digs with a pair of industrious elbows  was an amiable monotone at chest height  on the lines of       mind your backs   stand aside there   comin    through .      nanny fought her way to the table and nudged a space for granny weatherwax .      cor  what a spread  eh .     she said .     mind you  they have tiny chickens in these parts .     she grabbed a plate .      them   s quails .         i   ll    ave three .     ere  charlie chan .        a flunkey stared at her .      got any pickles .         i   m afraid not  ma   am .      nanny ogg looked along a table which included roast swans  a roasted peacock that probably wouldn   t have felt any better about it even if it had known that its tail feathers were going to be stuck back in afterward  and more fruits  boiled lobsters  nuts  cakes  creams and trifles than a hermit   s dream .      well  got any relish .         no  ma   am .         tomato ketchup .         no  ma   am .         and they call this a gormay paradise     muttered nanny  as the band struck up the next dance .  she nudged a tall figure helping himself to the lobster .     some place  eh .      very nice .      good mask you   ve got there .      thank you .   nanny was spun around by granny weatherwax   s hand on her shoulder .      there   s magrat .         where .  where .     said nanny .      over there   sitting by the potted plants .         oh  yes .  on the chassy longyew     said nanny .     that   s    sofa    in foreign  you know     she added .      what   s she doing .         being attractive to men  i think .         what  magrat .         yeah .  you   re really getting good at that hypnotism  ain   t you .          magrat fluttered her fan and looked up at the compte de yoyo .      la  sir     she said .     you may get me another plate of lark   s eggs  if you really must .         like a shot  dear lady .     the old man bustled off in the direction of the buffet .   magrat surveyed her empire of admirers  and then extended a languorous hand toward captain de vere of the palace guard .  he stood to attention .      dear captain     she said     you may have the pleasure of the next dance .           acting like a hussy     said granny disapprovingly .   nanny gave her an odd look .      not really     she said .     anyway  a bit of hussing never did anyone any harm .  at least none of those men look like the duc .     ere  what you doing .      this was to a small bald headed man who was trying surreptitiously to set up a small easel in front of them .      uh   if you ladies could just hold still for a few minutes     he said shyly .     for the woodcut .         what woodcut .     said granny weatherwax .      you know     said the man  opening a small penknife .     everyone likes to see their woodcut in the broadsheets after a ball like this .     lady thing enjoying a joke with lord whatsit     that sort of thing .      granny weatherwax opened her mouth to reply  but nanny ogg laid a gentle hand on her arm .  she relaxed a little and sought for something more suitable to say .        i knows a joke about alligator sandwiches     she volunteered  and shook nanny   s hand away .     there was a man  and he went into an inn and he said    do you sell alligator sandwiches .     and the other man said    yes    and he said     then give me an alligator sandwich   and don   t be a long time about it .         she gave him a triumphant look .      yes .     said the woodcutter  chipping away quickly     and then what happened .      nanny ogg dragged granny away quickly  searching for a distraction .      some people don   t know a joke when they hear it     said granny .   as the band launched into another number nanny ogg fumbled in a pocket and found the dance card that belonged to an owner now slumbering peacefully in a distant room .      this is     she turned the card around  her lips moving wonderingly     sir  roger the coverley .         ma   am .      granny weatherwax looked around .  a plump military man with big whiskers was bowing to her .  he looked as though he   d enjoyed quite a few jokes in his time .      yes .         you promised me the honor of this dance  m   lady .         no i didn   t .      the man looked puzzled .     but i assure you  lady d   arrangement   your card   my name is colonel moutarde        granny gave him a look of deep suspicion  and then read the dance card attached to her fan .        oh .         do you know how to dance .     hissed nanny .      of course .         never seen you dance     said nanny .   granny weatherwax had been on the point of giving the colonel as polite a refusal as she could manage .  now she threw back her shoulders defiantly .      a witch can do anything she puts her mind to  gytha ogg .  come  mr .  colonel .      nanny watched as the pair disappeared into the throng .         allo  foxy lady     said a voice behind her .  she looked around .  there was no one there .      down here .      she looked down .   a very small body wearing the uniform of a captain in the palace guard  a powdered wig and an ingratiating smile beamed up at her .      my name   s casanunda     he said .     i   m reputed to be the world   s greatest lover .  what do you think .      nanny ogg looked him up and down or  at least  down and further down .      you   re a dwarf     she said .      size isn   t important .      nanny ogg considered her position .  one colleague known for her shy and retiring nature was currently acting like that whatshername  the heathen queen who was always playing up to men and bathing in asses    milk and stuff  and the other one was acting very odd and dancing with a man even though she didn   t know one foot from the other . nanny ogg felt she was at least owed a bit of time in which to be her own woman .      can you dance as well .     she said wearily .      oh yes .  how about a date .         how old do you think i am .     said nanny .   casanunda considered .     all right  then .  how about a prune .      nanny sighed  and reached down for his hand .     come on .        lady volentia d   arrangement staggered limply along a passageway  a forlorn thin shape in complicated corsetry and ankle length underwear .   she wasn   t at all sure what had happened .  there had been that frightful woman  and then this feeling of absolute bliss and then   she   d been sitting on the carpet with her dress off .  lady volentia had been to enough balls in her dull life to know that there were occasions when you woke up in strange rooms with your dress off  but that tended to be later in the evening and at least you had some idea of why you were there     she eased her way along  holding onto the wall .  someone was definitely going to get told off about this .   a figure came around a bend in the corridor  idly tossing a turkey leg into the air with one hand and catching it with the other .      i say     said lady volentia     i wonder if you would be so good as to   oh        she looked up at a leather clad figure with an eye patch and a grin like a corsair raider .        wroowwwwl .         oh .  i say .        nothing to this dancing  granny weatherwax told herself .  it   s just moving around to music .   it helped to be able to read her partner   s mind .  dancing is instinctive  after you   ve got past that stage of looking down to see what your feet are doing  and witches are good at reading resonating instincts .  there was a slight struggle as the colonel tried to lead  but he soon gave in  partly in the face of granny weatherwax   s sheer refusal to compromise but mainly because of her boots .   lady d    arrangement   s shoes hadn   t fitted .  besides  granny was attached to her boots .  they had complicated iron fixtures  and toecaps like battering rams .  when it came to dancing  granny   s boots went exactly wherever they wanted to go .   she steered her helpless and slightly crippled partner toward nanny ogg  who had already cleared quite a space around her .  what granny could achieve with two pounds of hobnailed syncopation nanny ogg could achieve merely with her bosom .   it was a large and experienced bosom  and not one that was subject to restraint .  as nanny ogg bounced down  it went up  when she gyrated right  it hadn   t finished twirling left .  in addition  nanny   s feet moved in a complicated jig step regardless of the actual tempo  so that while her body actually progressed at the speed of a waltz her feet were doing something a bit nearer to a hornpipe .  the total effect obliged her partner to dance several feet away  and many surrounding couples to stop dancing just to watch in fascination  in case the build up of harmonic vibrations dropped her into the chandeliers .   granny and her helpless partner whirled past .      stop showin    off     granny hissed  and disappeared into the throng again .      who   s your friend .     said casanunda .      she   s       nanny began .   there was a blast of trumpets .      that was a bit off the beat     she said .      no  that means the duc is arriving     said casanunda .   the band stopped playing .  the couples  as one  turned and faced the main staircase .   there were two figures descending in stately fashion .   my word  he   s a sleek and handsome devil  nanny told herself .  it just goes to show .  esme   s right .  you can never tell by lookin    .   and her        that   s lily weatherwax .   the woman wasn   t masked .   give or take the odd laughter line and wrinkle  it was granny weatherwax to the life .   almost     nanny found she was turning to find the white eagle head in the crowd .  all heads were turned to the staircase  but there was one staring as if her gaze was a steel rod .   lily weatherwax wore white .  until that point it had never occurred to nanny ogg that there could be different colors of white .  now she knew better .  the white of lily weatherwax   s dress seemed to radiate  if all the lights went out  she felt  lily   s dress would glow .  it had style .  it gleamed  and had puffed sleeves and was edged with lace .   and lily weatherwax looked   nanny ogg had to admit it   younger .  there was the same bone structure and fine weatherwax complexion  but it looked   less worn .   if that   s what bein    bad does to you  nanny thought  i could of done with some of that years ago .  the wages of sin is death but so is the salary of virtue  and at least the evil get to go home early on fridays .   the eyes were the same  though .  somewhere in the genetics of the weatherwaxes was a piece of sapphire .  maybe generations of them .   the duc was unbelievably handsome .  but that was understandable .  he was wearing black .  even his eyes wore black .   nanny surfaced  and pushed her way through the throng to granny weatherwax .      esme .      she grabbed granny   s arm .      esme .         hmm .      nanny was aware that the crowd was moving  parting like a sea  between the staircase and the chaise longue at the far end of the hall .   granny weatherwax   s knuckles were as white as her dress .      esme .  what   s happening .  what are you doing .     said nanny .      trying   to   stop   the story     said granny .        what   s she doing  then .         letting   things   happen .      the crowd were pulling back past them .  it didn   t seem to be a conscious thing .  it was just happening that a sort of corridor was forming .   the prince walked slowly along it .  behind lily  faint images hung in the air so that she appeared to be followed by a succession of fading ghosts .   magrat stood up .   nanny was aware of a rainbow hue in the air .  possibly there was the tweeting of bluebirds .   the prince took magrat by the hand .   nanny glanced up at lily weatherwax  who had remained a few steps up from the foot of the stairs and was smiling beneficently .   then she tried to put a focus on the future .   it was horribly  easy .   normally the future is branching off at every turn and it   s only possible to have the haziest idea of what is likely to happen  even when you   re as temporally sensitive as a witch .  but here there were stories coiled around the tree of events  bending it into a new shape .   granny weatherwax wouldn   t know what a pattern of quantum inevitability was if she found it eating her dinner .  if you mentioned the words    paradigms of space time    to her she   d just say    what .     but that didn   t mean she was ignorant .  it just meant that she didn   t have any truck with words  especially gibberish .  she just knew that there were certain things that happened continually in human history  like three dimensional clich  s .  stories .        and now we   re part of it .  and i can   t stop it     said granny .     there   s got to be a place where i can stop it  and i can   t find it .      the band struck up .  it was playing a waltz .   magrat and the prince whirled around the dance floor once  never taking their eyes off each other .  then a few couples dared to join them .  and then  as if the whole ball was a machine whose spring had been wound up again  the floor was full of dancing couples and the sounds of conversation flowed back into the void .      are you going to introduce me to your friend .     said casanunda  from somewhere near nanny   s elbow .  people swept past them .      it   s all got to happen     said granny  ignoring the low level interruption .     everything .  the kiss  the clock striking midnight  her running out and losing the glass slipper  everything .         ur  yuk     said nanny  leaning on her partner   s head .     i   d rather lick toads .         she looks just my type     said casanunda  his voice slightly muffled .     i   ve always been very attracted to dominant women .      the witches looked at the whirling couple  who were staring into one another   s eyes .      i could trip them up  no trouble     said nanny .      you can   t .  that   s not something that can happen .         well  magrat   s sensible   more or less sensible     said nanny .     maybe she   ll notice something   s wrong .         i   m good at what i do  gytha ogg     said granny .     she won   t notice nothing until the clock strikes midnight .      they both turned to look up .  it was barely nine .      y   know     said nanny ogg .     clocks don   t strike midnight .  seems to me they just strike twelve .  i mean  it   s just a matter of bongs .      they both looked up at the clock again .     in the swamp  legba the black cockerel crowed .  he always crowed at sunset .     nanny ogg pounded up another flight of stairs and leaned against the wall to catch her breath .   it had to be somewhere around here .      another time you   ll learn to keep your mouth shut  gytha ogg     she muttered .      i expect we   re leaving the hurly burly of the ball for an intimate t  te    t  te somewhere .     said casanunda hopefully  trotting along behind her .   nanny tried to ignore him and ran along a dusty passage .  there was a balcony rail on one side  looking down into the ballroom .  and there        a small wooden door .   she rammed it open with her elbow .  within  mechanisms whirred in counterpoint to the dancing figures below as if the clock was propelling them  which  in a metaphorical sense  it was .   clockwork  nanny thought .  once you know about clockwork  you know about everything .   i wish i bloody well knew about clockwork .      very cozy     said casanunda .     she squeezed through the gap and into the clock space .  cogwheels clicked past her nose .   she stared at them for a moment .   lawks .  all this just to chop time up into little bits .      it might be just the teensiest bit cramped     said casanunda  from somewhere near her armpit .     but needs must  ma   am .  i remember once in quirm  there was this sedan chair and        let   s see  thought nanny .  this bit is connected to that bit  this one turns  that one turns faster  this spiky bit wobbles backward and forward     oh  well .  just twist the first thing you can grab  as the high priest said to the vestal virgin .    nanny ogg spat on her hands  gripped the largest cog wheel  and twisted .   it carried on turning  pulling her with it .   blimey .  oh  well     then she did what neither granny weatherwax nor magrat would have dreamed of doing in the circumstances .  but nanny ogg   s voyages on the sea of intersexual dalliance had gone rather further than twice around the lighthouse  and she saw nothing demeaning in getting a man to help her .   she simpered at casanunda .      things would be a lot more comfortable in our little pie de terre if you could just push this little wheel around a bit     she said .     i   m sure you could manage it     she added .      oh  no problem  good lady     said casanunda .  he reached up with one hand .  dwarfs are immensely strong for their size .  the wheel seemed to offer him no resistance at all .   somewhere in the mechanism something resisted for a moment and then went clonk .  big wheels turned reluctantly .  little wheels screamed on their axles .  a small important piece flew out and pinged off casanunda   s small bullet head .   and  much faster than nature had ever intended  the hands sped around the face .   a new noise right overhead made nanny ogg look up .   her self satisfied expression faded .  the hammer that struck the hours was swinging slowly backward .  it struck nanny that she was standing right under the bell at the same time as the bell  too  was struck .   bong        oh  bugger .         bong        bong          bong     mist rolled through the swamp .  and shadows moved with it  their shapes indistinct on this night when the difference between the living and the dead was only a matter of time .   mrs .  gogol could feel them among the trees .  the homeless .  the hungry .  the silent people .  those forsaken by men and gods .  the people of the mists and the mud  whose only strength was somewhere on the other side of weakness  whose beliefs were as rickety and home made as their homes .  and the people from the city   not the ones who lived in the big white houses and went to balls in fine coaches  but the other ones .  they were the ones that stories are never about .  stories are not  on the whole  interested in swineherds who remain swineherds and poor and humble shoemakers whose destiny is to die slightly poorer and much humbler .   these people were the ones who made the magical kingdom work  who cooked its meals and swept its floors and carted its night soil and were its faces in the crowd and whose wishes and dreams  undemanding as they were  were of no consequence .  the invisibles .   and me out here  she thought .  building traps for gods .   there are various forms of voodoo in the multiverse  because it   s a religion that can be put together from any ingredients that happen to be lying around .  and all of them try  in some way  to call down a god into the body of a human being .   that was stupid  mrs .  gogol thought .  that was dangerous .   mrs .  gogol   s voodoo worked the other way about .  what was a god .  a focus of belief .  if people believed  a god began to grow .  feebly at first  but if the swamp taught anything  it taught patience .  anything could be the focus of a god .  a handful of feathers with a red ribbon around them  a hat and coat on a couple of sticks   anything .  because when all people had was practically nothing  then anything could be almost everything .  and then you fed it  and lulled it  like a goose heading for p  t    and let the power grow very slowly  and when the time was ripe you opened the path   backward .  a human could ride the god  rather than the other way around .  there would be a price to pay later  but there always was .  in mrs .  gogol   s experience  everyone ended up dying .   she took a pull of rum and handed the jug to saturday .   saturday took a mouthful  and passed the jug up to something that might have been a hand .      let it begin     said mrs .  gogol .   the dead man picked up three small drums and began to beat out a rhythm  heartbeat fast .   after a while something tapped mrs .  gogol on the shoulder and handed her the jug .  it was empty .   might as well begin        lady bon anna smile on me .  mister safe way protect me .  stride wide man guide me .  hotaloga andrews catch me .      i stand between the light and the dark  but that no matter  because i am between .      here is rum for you .  tobacco for you .  food for you .  a home for you .      now you listen to me good             bong .   for magrat it was like waking from a dream into a dream .  she   d been idly dreaming that she was dancing with the most handsome man in the room  and   she was dancing with the most handsome man in the room .   except that he wore two circles of smoked glass over his eyes .   although magrat was soft hearted  a compulsive daydreamer and  as granny weatherwax put it  a wet hen  she wouldn   t be a witch if she didn   t have certain instincts and the sense to trust them .  she reached up and  before his hands could move  tweaked the things away .   magrat had seen eyes like that before  but never on something walking upright .   her feet  which a moment before had been moving gracefully across the floor  tripped over themselves .      er       she began .   and she was aware that his hands  pink and well manicured  were also cold and damp .   magrat turned and ran  knocking the couples aside in her madness to get away .  her legs tangled in the dress .  the stupid shoes skittered on the floor .   a couple of footmen blocked the stairs to the hall .   magrat   s eyes narrowed .  getting out was what mattered .      hai .         ouch .      and then she ran on  slipping at the top of the stairs .  a glass slipper slithered across the marble .      how the hell   s anyone supposed to move in these things .     she screamed at the world in general .  hopping frantically on one foot  she wrenched the other shoe off and ran into the night .   the prince walked slowly to the top of the steps and picked up the discarded slipper .   he held it .  the light glittered off its facets .   granny weatherwax leaned against the wall in the shadows .  all stories had a turning point  and it had to be close .     she was good at getting into other people   s minds  but now she had to get into hers .  she concentrated .  down deeper   past everyday thoughts and minor concerns  faster  faster   through layers of deep cogitation   deeper   past things sealed off and crusted over  old guilts and congealed regrets  but there was no time for them now   down   and there   the silver thread of the story .  she   d been part of it  was part of it  so it had to be a part of her .   it poured past .  she reached out .   she hated everything that predestined people  that fooled them  that made them slightly less than human .   the story whipped along like a steel hawser .  she gripped it .   her eyes opened in shock .  then she stepped forward .      excuse me  your highness .      she snatched the shoe from the duc   s hands  and raised it over her head .   her expression of evil satisfaction was terrible to behold .   then she dropped the shoe .   it smashed on the stairs .   a thousand glittering fragments scattered across the marble .     coiled as it was around the length of turtle shaped space time known as the discworld  the story shook .  one broken end flapped loose and flailed through the night  trying to find any sequence to feed on         in the clearing the trees moved .  so did the shadows .  shadows shouldn   t be able to move unless the light moves .  these did .   the drumming stopped .   in the silence there was the occasional sizzle as power crackled across the hanging coat .   saturday stepped forward .  green sparks flew out to his hands as he gripped the jacket and put it on .   his body jerked .   erzulie gogol breathed out .      you are here     she said .     you are still yourself .  you are exactly yourself .      saturday raised his hands  with his fists clenched .  occasionally an arm or leg would jerk as the power inside him squirrel caged around in its search for freedom  but she could see that he was riding it .      it will become easier     she said  more gently now .   saturday nodded .   with the power flowing inside him he had  she thought  the fire he   d had when he was alive .  he had not been a particularly good man  she knew .  genua had not been a model of civic virtue .  but at least he   d never told people that they wanted him to oppress them  and that everything he did was for their own good .   around the circle  the people of new genua   the old new genua   knelt or bowed .   he hadn   t been a kind ruler .  but he   d fitted .  and when he   d been arbitrary or arrogant or just plain wrong  he   d never suggested that this was justified by anything other than the fact that he was bigger and stronger and occasionally nastier than other people .  he   d never suggested that it was because he was better .  and he   d never told people they ought to be happy  and imposed a kind of happiness on them .  the invisible people knew that happiness is not the natural state of mankind  and is never achieved from the outside in .   saturday nodded again  this time in satisfaction .  when he opened his mouth  sparks flashed between his teeth .  and when he waded through the swamp  the alligators fought to get out of his way .     it was quiet in the palace kitchens now .  the huge trays of roast meat  the pigs    heads with apples in their mouths  the multilayered trifles had long ago been carried upstairs .  there was a clattering from the giant sinks at the far end  where some of the maids were making a start on the washing up .   mrs .  pleasant the cook had made herself a plate of red stripefish in crawfish sauce .  she wasn   t the finest cook in genua   no one got near mrs .  gogol   s gumbo  people would almost come back from the dead for a taste of mrs .  gogol   s gumbo   but the comparison was as narrow as that between  say  diamonds and sapphires .  she   d done her best to cook up a good banquet  because she had her professional pride  but there wasn   t much she felt she was able to do with lumps of meat .   genuan cooking  like the best cooking everywhere in the multiverse  had been evolved by people who had to make desperate use of ingredients their masters didn   t want .  no one would even try a bird   s nest unless they had to .  only hunger would make a man taste his first alligator .  no one would eat a shark   s fin if they were allowed to eat the rest of the shark .   she poured herself a rum and was just picking up the spoon when she felt herself being watched .   a large man in a black leather doublet was staring at her from the doorway  dangling a ginger cat mask from one hand .   it was a very direct stare .  mrs .  pleasant found herself wishing she   d done something about her hair and was wearing a better dress .      yes .     she said .     what d   you want .         waaant foood  miss uss pleassunt     said greebo .   she looked him up and down .  there were some odd types in genua these days .  this one must have been a guest at the ball  but there was something very   familiar about him .   greebo wasn   t a happy cat .  people had made a fuss just because he   d dragged a roast turkey off the table .  then the skinny female with the teeth had kept simpering at him and saying she   d see him later in the rose garden  which wasn   t at all the cat way of doing things  and that   d got him confused  because this wasn   t the right kind of body and nor was hers .  and there were too many other males around .   then he   d smelled the kitchen .  cats gravitate to kitchens like rocks gravitate to gravity .      i seen you somewhere before .     said mrs .  pleasant .   greebo said nothing .  he   d followed his nose to a bowl on one of the big tables .      waaant     he demanded .        fish heads .     said mrs .  pleasant .  they were technically garbage  although what she was planning with some rice and a few special sauces would turn them into the sort of dish kings fight for .      waaant     greebo repeated .   mrs .  pleasant shrugged .      you want raw fish heads  man  you take    em     she said .   greebo lifted the bowl uncertainly .  he wasn   t too good with fingers .  then he looked around conspiratorially and ducked under the table .   there were the sounds of keen gurgitation and the bowl being scraped around on the floor .   greebo emerged .      millluk .     he suggested .   fascinated  mrs .  pleasant reached for the milk jug and a cup        saaaaucerrr     greebo said .      and a saucer .   greebo took the saucer  gave it a long hard look  and put it on the floor .   mrs .  pleasant stared .   greebo finished the milk  licking the remnant off his beard .  he felt a lot better now .  and there was a big fire over there .  he padded over to it  sat down  spat on his paw and made an attempt to clean his ears  which didn   t work because inexplicably neither ears nor paw were the right shape  and then curled up as best he could .  which wasn   t very well  given that he seemed to have the wrong sort of backbone  too .   after a while mrs .  pleasant heard a low  asthmatic rumble .     greebo was trying to purr .   he had the wrong kind of throat .   in a minute he was going to wake up in a bad temper and want to fight something .   mrs .  pleasant got on with her own supper .  despite the fact that a hulking great man had just eaten a bowl of fish heads and lapped a saucer of milk in front of her  and was now stretched out uncomfortably in front of the fire  she found she didn   t feel the least bit afraid .  in fact she was fighting down an impulse to scratch his tummy .     magrat wrenched off the other slipper as she ran down the long red carpet toward the palace gateway and freedom .  just getting away  that was the important thing .  from was more urgent than to .   and then two figures drifted out of the shadows and faced her .  she raised the slipper pathetically as they approached in absolute silence  but even in the twilight she could feel their gaze .     the crowds parted .  lily weatherwax glided through  in a rustle of silk .   she looked granny up and down  without any expression of surprise .      all in white  too     she said  dryly .     my word  aren   t you the nice one .         but i   ve stopped you     said granny  still panting with the effort .     i   ve broken it .      lily weatherwax looked past her .  the snake sisters were coming up the steps  holding a limp magrat between them .      save us all from people who think literally     said lily .     the damn things come in pairs  you know .      she crossed to magrat and snatched the second slipper out of her hand .      the clock was interesting     she said  turning back to granny .     i was impressed with the clock .  but it   s no good  you know .  you can   t stop this sort of thing .  it has the momentum of inevitability .  you can   t spoil a good story .  i should know .      she handed the slipper to the prince  but without taking her eyes off granny .      it   ll fit her     she said .   two of the courtiers held magrat   s leg as the prince wrestled the slipper past her protesting toes .      there     said lily  still without looking down .     and do stop trying that hedge witch hypnotism on me  esme .         it fits     said the prince  but in a doubtful tone of voice .      yes  anything would fit     said a cheerful voice from somewhere toward the back of the crowd     if you were allowed to put two pairs of hairy socks on first .      lily looked down .  then she looked at magrat   s mask .  she reached out and pulled it off .      ow .         wrong girl     said lily .     but it still doesn   t matter  esme  because it is the right slipper .  so all we have to do is find the girl whose foot it fits        there was a commotion at the back of the crowd .  courtiers parted  revealing nanny ogg  oil covered and hung with spider webs .        if it   s a five and a half narrow fit  i   m your man     she said .     just let me get these boots off           i wasn   t referring to you  old woman     said lily coldly .      oh  yes you was     said nanny .     we know how this bit goes  see .  the prince goes all around the city with the slipper  trying to find the girl whose foot fits .  that   s what you was plannin    .  so i can save you a bit of trouble  how about it .      there was a flicker of uncertainty in lily   s expression .      a girl     she said     of marriageable age .         no problem there     said nanny cheerfully .   the dwarf casanunda nudged a courtier proudly in the knees .      she   s a very close personal friend of mine     he said proudly .   lily looked at her sister .      you   re doing this .  don   t think i don   t know     she said .      i ain   t doing a thing     said granny .     it   s real life happening all by itself .      nanny grabbed the slipper out of the prince   s hands and  before anyone else could move  slid it onto her foot .   then she waggled the foot in the air .   it was a perfect fit .      there .     she said .     see .  you could have wasted the whole day .         especially because there must be hundreds of five and a half              narrow fit              narrow fit wearers in a city this size     granny went on     unless  of course  you happened to sort of go to the right house right at the start .  if you had  you know  a lucky guess .         but that   d be cheatin        said nanny .   she nudged the prince .      i   d just like to add     she said     that i don   t mind doin    all the waving and opening things and other royal stuff  but i draw the line at sleepin    in the same bed as sunny jim here .         because he doesn   t sleep in a bed     said granny .      no  he sleeps in a pond     said nanny .     we had a look .  just a great big indoor pond .         because he   s a frog     said granny .      with flies all over the place in case he wakes up in the night and fancies a snack     said nanny .      i thought so .     said magrat  pulling herself out of the grip of the guards .     he had clammy hands .         lots of men have clammy hands     said nanny .     but this one   s got    em because he   s a frog .         i   m a prince of blood royal .     said the prince .      and a frog     said granny .      i don   t mind     said casanunda  from somewhere down below .     i enjoy open relationships .  if you want to go out with a frog  that   s fine by me        lily looked around at the crowd .  then she snapped her fingers .   granny weatherwax was aware of a sudden silence .   nanny ogg looked up at the people on either side of her .  she waved a hand in front of a guard   s face .      coo     she said .        you can   t do that for long     said granny .     you can   t stop a thousand people for long .      lily shrugged .     they   re not important .  whoever will remember who was at the ball .  they   ll just remember the flight and the slipper and the happy ending .         i   ve told you .  you can   t start it again .  and he   s a frog .  even you can   t keep him in shape the whole day long .  he turns back into his old shape at night .  he   s got a bedroom with a pond in it .  he   s a frog     said granny flatly .      but only inside     said lily .      inside   s where it counts     said granny .      outside   s quite important  mind     said nanny .      lots of people are animals inside .  lots of animals are people inside     said lily .     where   s the harm .         he   s a frog .         especially at night     said nanny .  it had occurred to her that a husband who was a man all night and a frog all day might be almost acceptable  you wouldn   t get the wage packet  but there   d be less wear and tear on the furniture .  she also couldn   t put out of her mind certain private speculations about the length of his tongue .      and you killed the baron     said magrat .      you think he was a particularly nice man .     said lily .     besides  he didn   t show me any respect .  if you   ve got no respect  you   ve got nothing .      nanny and magrat found themselves looking at granny .      he   s a frog .         i found him in the swamp     said lily .     i could tell he was pretty bright .  i needed someone   amenable to persuasion .  shouldn   t frogs have a chance .  he   ll be no worse a husband than many .  just one kiss from a princess seals the spell .         a lot of men are animals     said magrat  who   d picked up the idea from somewhere .      yes .  but he   s a frog     said granny .      look at it my way     said lily .     you see this country .  it   s all swamps and fogs .  there   s no direction .  but i can make this a great city .  not a sprawling place like ankh morpork  but a place that works .         the girl doesn   t want to marry a frog .         what will that matter in a hundred years    time .         it matters now .      lily threw up her hands .     what do you want  then .  it   s your choice .  there   s me   or there   s that woman in the swamp .  light or dark .  fog or sunshine .  dark chaos or happy endings .         he   s a frog  and you killed the old baron     said granny .      you   d have done the same     said lily .      no     said granny .     i   d have thought the same  but i wouldn   t have done it .         what difference does that make  deep down .         you mean you don   t know .     said nanny ogg .   lily laughed .      look at the three of you     she said .     bursting with inefficient good intentions .  the maiden  the mother and the crone .         who are you calling a maiden .     said nanny ogg .        who are you calling a mother .     said magrat .   granny weatherwax glowered briefly like the person who has discovered that there is only one straw left and everyone else has drawn a long one .      now  what shall i do with you .     said lily .     i really am against killing people unless it   s necessary  but i can   t have you running around acting stupidly        she looked at her fingernails .      so i think i shall have you put away somewhere until this has run its course .  and then   can you guess what i   m going to do next .      i   m going to expect you to escape .  because  after all  i am the good one .        ella walked cautiously through the moonlit swamp  following the strutting shape of legba .  she was aware of movement in the water  but nothing emerged   bad news like legba gets around  even among alligators .   an orange light appeared in the distance .  it turned out to be mrs .  gogol   s shack  or boat  or whatever it was .  in the swamp  the difference between the water and the land was practically a matter of choice .      hallo .  is there anyone there .         come along in  child .  take a seat .  rest up a little .      ella stepped cautiously onto the rocking veranda .  mrs .  gogol was sitting in her chair  a whiteclad raggedy doll in her lap .      magrat said           i know all about it .  come to erzulie .           who are you .         i am your   friend  girl .      ella moved so as to be ready to run .      you   re not a godmother of any kind  are you .         no .  no gods .  just a friend .  did anyone follow you .         i   don   t think so .         it   s no matter if they did  girl .  no matter if they did .  maybe we ought to move out into the river for a spell  even so .  we   ll be a lot safer with water all around .      the shack lurched .      you better sit down .  the feets make it shaky until we get into deep water .      ella risked a look  nevertheless .   mrs .  gogol   s hut traveled on four large duck feet  which were now rising out of the swamp .  they splashed their way through the shallows and  gently  sculled out into the river .     greebo woke up and stretched .   and the wrong sort of arms and legs .   mrs .  pleasant  who had been sitting watching him  put down her glass .      what do you want to do now  mr .  cat .     she said .   greebo padded over to the door into the outside world and scratched at it .      waant to go owwwt  miss uss pleas unt     he said .      you just have to turn the handle there     she said .   greebo stared at the door handle like someone trying to come to terms with a piece of very advanced technology  and then gave her a pleading look .   she opened the door for him  stood aside as he slunk out  and then shut it  locked it and leaned against it .        ember   s bound to be safe with mrs .  gogol     said magrat .      hah .     said granny .      i quite liked her     said nanny ogg .      i don   t trust anyone who drinks rum and smokes a pipe     said granny .      nanny ogg smokes a pipe and drinks anything     magrat pointed out .      yes  but that   s because she   s a disgustin    old baggage     said granny  without looking up .   nanny ogg took her pipe out of her mouth .      that   s right     she said amiably .     you ain   t nothing if you don   t maintain an image .      granny looked up from the lock .      can   t shift it     she said .     it   s octiron  too .  can   t magic it open .         it   s daft  locking us up     said nanny .     i   d have had us killed .         that   s because you   re basically good     said magrat .     the good are innocent and create justice .  the bad are guilty  which is why they invent mercy .         no  i know why she   s done this     said granny  darkly .     it   s so   s we   ll know we   ve lost .         but she said we   d escape     said magrat .     i don   t understand .  she must know the good ones always win in the end .         only in stories     said granny  examining the door hinges .     and she thinks she   s in charge of the stories .  she bends them around herself .  she thinks she   s the good one .         mind you     said magrat     i don   t like swamps .  if it wasn   t for the frog and everything  i   d see lily   s point           then you   re nothing but a daft godmother     snapped granny  still fiddling with the lock .     you can   t go around building a better world for people .  only people can build a better world for people .  otherwise it   s just a cage .  besides  you don   t build a better world by choppin    heads off and giving decent girls away to frogs .         but progress       magrat began .      don   t you talk to me about progress .  progress just means bad things happen faster .  anyone got another hatpin .  this one   s useless .      nanny  who had greebo   s ability to make herself instantly at home wherever she happened to be  sat down in the corner of the cell .      i heard this story once     she said     where this bloke got locked up for years and years and he learned amazin    stuff about the universe and everythin    from another prisoner who was incredibly clever  and then he escaped and got his revenge .         what incredibly clever stuff do you know about the universe  gytha ogg .     said granny .      bugger all     said nanny cheerfully .        then we   d better bloody well escape right now .      nanny pulled a scrap of pasteboard out of her hat  found a scrap of pencil up there too  licked the end and thought for a while .  then she wrote       dear jason unt so witer  as they say in foreign parts       well here   s a thing yore ole mum doin time in prison again  im a old lag  youll have to send me a cake with a vial in it and i shall have little arrows on my close just my joke .  this is a sketch of the dunjon .  im putting a x where we are  which is inside .  magrat is shown wering a posh dress  she has been acting like a courgette .  also inc .  esme getting fed up becaus she can   t get the lock to work but i expect it will all be ok because the good ones win in the end and that   s us .  and all becaus some girl don   t want to marry a prince who is a duck who is really a frog and i cant say i blame her  you don   t want descendants who have got jenes and start off living in a jamjar and then hop about and get squashed       she was interrupted by the sound of a mandolin being played quite well  right on the other side of the wall  and a small but determined voice raised in song .         si consuenti d   amoure  ventre dimo tondreturoooo           how i hunger my love for the dining room of your warm maceration     said nanny  without looking up .         della della t   ozentro  audri t   dren vontarieeeeee        the shop  the shop  i have a lozenge  the sky is pink     said nanny .   granny and magrat looked at one another .         guarunto del tari  bella pore di larientos           rejoice  candlemaker  you have a great big           i don   t believe any of this     said granny .     you   re making it up .         word for word translation     said nanny .     i can speak foreign like a native  you know that .         mrs .  ogg .  is that you  my love .      they all looked up toward the barred window .  there was a small face peering in .      casanunda .     said nanny .      that   s me  mrs .  ogg .         my love     muttered granny .      how did you get up to the window .     said nanny  ignoring this .      i always know where i can get my hands on a stepladder  mrs .  ogg .         i suppose you don   t know where you can get your hands on a key .         wouldn   t do any good .  there   s too many guards outside your door  mrs .  ogg .  even for a famous swordsman like me .  her ladyship gave strict orders .  no one   s to listen to you or look at you  even .         how come you   re in the palace guard  casanunda .         soldier of fortune takes whatever jobs are going  mrs .  ogg     said casanunda earnestly .        but all the rest of    em are six foot tall and you   re   of the shorter persuasion .         i lied about my height  mrs .  ogg .  i   m a world famous liar .         is that true .         no .         what about you being the world   s greatest lover .      there was silence for a while .      well  maybe i   m only no .        said casanunda .     but i try harder .         can   t you go and find us a file or something  mr .  casanunda .     said magrat .      i   ll see what i can do  miss .      the face disappeared .      maybe we could get people to visit us and then we could escape in their clothes .     said nanny ogg .      now i   ve gone and stuck the pin in my finger     muttered granny weatherwax .      or maybe we could get magrat to seduce one of the guards     said nanny .      why don   t you .     said magrat  as nastily as she could manage .      all right .  i   m game .         shut up  the pair of you     said granny .     i   m trying to think        there was another sound at the window .   it was legba .   the black cockerel peered in between the bars for a moment  and then fluttered away .      gives me the creeps  that one     said nanny .     can   t look at him without thinking wistfully of sage and onion and mashed potatoes .        her crinkled face crinkled further .      greebo .     she said .     where   d we leave him .         oh  he   s only a cat     said granny weatherwax .     cats know how to look after themselves .         he   s really just a big softie       nanny began  before someone started pulling down the wall .   a hole appeared .  a gray hand appeared and grasped another stone .  there was a strong smell of river mud .   rock crumbled under heavy fingers .      ladies .     said a resonant voice .      well  mister saturday     said nanny     as i live and breathe   saving your presence  o   course .      saturday grunted something and walked away .   there was a hammering on the door and someone started fumbling with keys .      we don   t want to hang around here     said granny .     come on .      they helped one another out through the hole .   saturday was on the other side of a small courtyard  striding toward the sound of the ball .   and there was something behind him  trailing out like the tail of a comet .      what   s that .         mrs .  gogol   s doing     said granny weatherwax grimly .   behind saturday  widening as it snaked through the palace grounds to the gate  was a stream of deeper darkness in the air .  at first sight it seemed to contain shapes  but closer inspection indicated that they weren   t shapes at all but a mere suggestion of shapes  forming and reforming .  eyes gleamed momentarily in the swirl .  there was the chittering of crickets and the whine of mosquitoes  the smell of moss and the stink of river mud .      it   s the swamp     said magrat .      it   s the idea of the swamp     said granny .     it   s what you have to have first  before you have the swamp .         oh  dear     said nanny .  she shrugged .     well  ella   s got away and so have we  so this is the part where we escape  yes .  that   s what we   re supposed to do .      none of them moved .      they aren   t very nice people in there     said magrat  after a while     but they don   t deserve alligators .         you witches stand right there     said a voice behind them .  half a dozen guards were crowded around the hole in the wall .      life   s certainly busier in the city     said nanny  pulling another hatpin from her hat .      they   ve got crossbows     warned magrat .     there   s not much you can do against crossbows .  projectile weapons is lesson seven and i haven   t had that yet .         they can   t pull triggers if they think they   ve got flippers     said granny menacingly .      now     said nanny     let   s not have any of that  eh .  everyone knows the good ones always win specially when they   re outnumbered .      the guards emerged .   as they did so a tall black shape dropped noiselessly from the wall behind them .      there     said nanny     i said he wouldn   t go far from his mummy  didn   t i .        one or two of the guards realized that she was staring proudly past them  and turned .   as far as they were concerned  they confronted a tall  broad shouldered man with a mane of black hair  an eyepatch and a very wide grin .   he stood with his arms casually folded .   he waited until he had their full attention  and then greebo let his lips part slowly .   several of the men took a step backward then .   one of them said     why worry .  it   s not as if he   s got a weap        greebo raised one hand .   claws make no noise as they slide out  but they ought to .  they ought to make a noise like    tzing .      greebo   s grin widened .   ah .  these still worked     one of the men was bright enough to raise his crossbow but stupid enough to do it with nanny ogg standing behind him with a hatpin .  her hand moved so swiftly that any wisdom seeking saffron clad youth would have started the way of mrs .  ogg there and then .  the man screamed and dropped the bow .      wrowwwl        greebo leapt .   cats are like witches .  they don   t fight to kill  but to win .  there is a difference .  there   s no point in killing an opponent .  that way  they won   t know they   ve lost  and to be a real winner you have to have an opponent who is beaten and knows it .  there   s no triumph over a corpse  but a beaten opponent  who will remain beaten every day of the remainder of their sad and wretched life  is something to treasure .     cats do not  of course  rationalize this far .  they just like to send someone limping off minus a tail and a few square inches of fur .   greebo   s technique was unscientific and wouldn   t have stood a chance against any decent swordsmanship  but on his side was the fact that it is almost impossible to develop decent swordsmanship when you seem to have run into a food mixer that is biting your ear off .   the witches watched with interest .      i think we can leave him now     said nanny .     i think he   s having fun .      they hurried toward the hall .     the orchestra was in the middle of a complicated number when the lead violinist happened to glance toward the door  and then dropped his bow .  the cellist turned to see what had caused this  followed his colleague   s fixed stare  and in a moment of confusion tried to play his instrument backward .   in a succession of squeaks and flats  the orchestra stopped playing .  the dancers continued for a while out of sheer momentum  and then stopped and milled about in confusion .  and then  one by one  they too looked up .   saturday stood at the top of the steps .   in the silence came the drumming  making the music that had gone before seem as insignificant as the chittering of crickets .  this was the real blood music  every other music that had ever been written was merely a pitiful attempt to sing along .   it poured into the room  and with it came the heat and the warm  vegetable smell of the swamp .  there was a suggestion of alligator in the air   not the presence of them  but the promise .   the drumming grew louder .  there were complex counter rhythms  much more felt than heard .   saturday brushed a speck of dust off the shoulder of his ancient coat  and reached out an arm .   the tall hat appeared in his hand .   he reached out his other hand .   the black cane with the silver top whirred out of the empty air and was snatched up triumphantly .   he put the hat on his head .  he twirled the cane .   the drums rolled .  except that   maybe it wasn   t drums now  maybe it was a beat in the floor itself  or in the walls  or in the air .  it was fast and hot and people in the hall found their feet moving of their own accord  because the drumming seemed to reach the toes via the hindbrain without ever passing near the ears .   saturday   s feet moved too .  they beat out their own staccato rhythms on the marble floor .   he danced down the steps .   he whirled .  he leapt .  the tails of his coat whipped through the air .  and then he landed at the foot of the step  his feet striking the ground like the thud of doom .   and only now was there a stirring .   there was a croak from the prince .      it can   t be him .  he   s dead .  guards .  kill him .      he looked around madly at the guards by the stairs .   the guard captain went pale .      i  uh  again .  i mean  i don   t think       he began .      do it now .        the captain raised his crossbow nervously .  the point of the bolt wove figures of eight in front of his eyes .      i said do it .      the bow twanged .   there was a thud .   saturday looked down at the feathers buried in his chest  and then grinned and raised his cane .   the captain looked up with the certain terror of death in his face .  he dropped his bow and turned to run  and managed two steps before he toppled forward .      no     said a voice behind the prince .     this is how you kill a dead man .      lily weatherwax stepped forward  her face white with fury .      you don   t belong here anymore     she hissed .     you   re not part of the story .      she raised a hand .   behind her  the ghost images suddenly focused on her  so that she became more iridescent .  silver fire leapt across the room .   baron saturday thrust out his cane .  the magic struck  and coursed down him to earth  leaving little silver trails that crackled for a while and then winked out .      no  ma   am     he said     there ain   t no way to kill a dead man .      the three witches watched from the doorway .      i felt that     said nanny .     it should have blown him to bits .         blown what to bits .     said granny .     the swamp .  the river .  the world .  he   s all of them .  ooh  she   s a clever one  that mrs .  gogol .         what .     said magrat .     what do you mean  all of them .      lily backed away .  she raised her hand again and sent another fireball toward the baron .  it hit his hat and burst off it like a firework .      stupid  stupid .     muttered granny .     she   s seen it doesn   t work and she   s still trying it .         i thought you weren   t on her side     said magrat .      i ain   t .  but i don   t like to see people being stupid .  that kind of stuff   s no use  magrat garlick  even you can   oh  no  surely not again        the baron laughed as a third attempt earthed itself harmlessly .  then he raised his cane .  two courtiers tumbled forward .   lily weatherwax  still backing away  came up against the foot of the main staircase .   the baron strolled forward .      you want to try anything else  lady .     he said .   lily raised both hands .   all three witches felt it   the terrible suction as she tried to concentrate all the power in the vicinity .   outside  the one guard remaining upright found that he was no longer fighting a man but merely an enraged tomcat  although this was no consolation .  it just meant that greebo had an extra pair of claws .   the prince screamed .   it was a long  descending scream  and ended in a croak  somewhere around ground level .     baron saturday took one heavy  deliberate step forward  and there was no more croak .   the drums stopped abruptly .   and then there was a real silence  broken only by the swish of lily   s dress as she fled up the stairs .   a voice behind the witches said     thank you  ladies .  could you step aside  please .      they looked around .  mrs .  gogol was there  holding embers by the hand .  she had a fat  gaily embroidered bag over her shoulder .   all three watched as the voodoo woman led the girl down into the hall and through the silent crowds .      that   s not right either     said granny under her breath .      what .     said magrat .     what .      baron saturday thumped his stick on the floor .      you know me     he said .     you all know me .  you know i was killed .  and now here i am .  i was murdered and what did you do    .         how much did you do  mrs .  gogol .     muttered granny .     no  we ain   t having this .         ssh  i can   t hear what he   s saying     said nanny .      he   s telling them they can have him ruling them again  or embers     said magrat .      they   ll have mrs .  gogol     muttered granny .     she   ll be one o    them eminences greases .         well  she   s not too bad     said nanny .      in the swamp she   s not too bad     said granny .     with someone to balance her up she   s not too bad .  but mrs .  gogol tellin    a whole city what to do   that   s not right .  magic   s far too important to be used for rulin    people .  anyway  lily only had people killed   mrs .  gogol   d set    em to choppin    wood and doin    chores afterward .  i reckon  after you   ve had a busy life  you ort to be able to relax a bit when you   re dead .         lie back and enjoy it  sort of thing     said nanny .   granny looked down at the white dress .      i wish i had my old clothes on     she said .     black   s the proper color for a witch .      she strode down the steps  and then cupped her hands around her mouth .      coo ee .  mrs .  gogol .      baron saturday stopped speaking .  mrs .  gogol nodded at granny .      yes  miss weatherwax .         mistress     snapped granny  and then softened her voice again .      this ain   t right  you know .  she   s the one who ought to rule  fair enough .  and you used magic to help her this far  and that   s all right .  but it stops right here .  it   s up to her what happens next .  you can   t make things right by magic .  you can only stop making them wrong .      mrs .  gogol pulled herself up to her full  impressive height .     who   s you to say what i can and can   t do here .         we   re her godmothers     said granny .      that   s right     said nanny ogg .      we   ve got a wand  too     said magrat .      but you hate godmothers  mistress weatherwax     said mrs .  gogol .      we   re the other kind     said granny .     we   re the kind that gives people what they know they really need  not what we think they ought to want .        among the fascinated crowd several pairs of lips moved as people worked this out .      then you   ve done your godmothering     said mrs .  gogol  who thought faster than most .     you did it very well .         you didn   t listen     said granny .     there   s all sorts of things to godmotherin    .  she might be quite good at ruling .  she might be bad at it .  but she   s got to find out for herself .  with no interference from anyone .         what if i say no .         then i expect we   ll just have to go on godmotherin        said granny .      do you know how long i worked to win .     said mrs .  gogol  haughtily .     do you know what i lost .         and now you   ve won  and there   s the end of it     said granny .      are you looking to challenge me  mistress weatherwax .      granny hesitated  and then straightened her shoulders .  her arms moved away from her sides  almost imperceptibly .  nanny and magrat moved away slightly .      if that   s what you want .         my voodoo against your   headology .         if you like .         and what   s the stake .         no more magic in the affairs of genua     said granny .     no more stories .  no more godmothers .  just people  deciding for themselves .  for good or bad .  right or wrong .         okay .         and you leave lily weatherwax to me .        mrs .  gogol   s intake of breath was heard around the hall .      never .         hmm .     said granny .     you don   t think you   re going to lose  do you .         i don   t want to hurt you  mistress weatherwax     said mrs .  gogol .      that   s good     said granny .     i don   t want you to hurt me either .         i don   t want there to be any fighting     said ella .   they all looked at her .      she   s the ruler now  ain   t she .     said granny .     we   ve got to listen to what she says .         i   ll keep out of the city     said mrs .  gogol  ignoring her     but lilith is mine .         no .      mrs .  gogol reached into her bag  and flourished the raggedy doll .      see this .         yes .  i do     said granny .      it was going to be her .  don   t let it be you .         sorry  mrs .  gogol     said granny firmly     but i see my duty plain .         you   re a clever woman  mistress weatherwax .  but you   re a long way from home .      granny shrugged .  mrs .  gogol held up the doll by its waist .  it had sapphire blue eyes .      you know about magic with mirrors .  this is my kind of mirror  mistress weatherwax .  i can make it be you .  and then i can make it suffer .  don   t make me do that .  please .         please yourself  mrs .  gogol .  but i   ll deal with lily .           i should box a bit clever if i was you  esme     muttered nanny ogg .     she   s good at this sort of thing .         i think she could be very ruthless     said magrat .      i   ve got nothing but the greatest respect for mrs .  gogol     said granny .     a fine woman .  but talks a bit too much .  if i was her  i   d have had a couple of big nails right through that thing by now .         you would  too     said nanny .     it   s a good thing you   re good  ain   t it .         right     said granny  raising her voice again .     i   m going to find my sister  mrs .  gogol .  this is family .      she walked steadfastly toward the stairs .   magrat took out the wand .      if she does anything bad to granny  she   s going to go through the rest of her life bright orange and round  with seeds in     she said .      i don   t think esme would like it if you did something like that     said nanny .     don   t worry .  she doesn   t believe all that stuff about pins and dolls .         she doesn   t believe anything .  but that doesn   t matter .     said magrat .     mrs .  gogol does .  it   s her power .  it   s what she thinks that matters .         don   t you reckon esme knows that too .      granny weatherwax reached the foot of the stairs .      mistress weatherwax .      granny turned .   mrs .  gogol had a long sliver of wood in her hand .  shaking her head desperately  she jabbed it into the doll   s foot .   everyone saw esme weatherwax wince .   another sliver was thrust into a raggedy arm .   slowly  granny raised her other hand and shuddered when she touched her sleeve .  then  limping slightly  she continued to climb the stairs .      i can do the heart next  mistress weatherwax .     shouted mrs .  gogol .      i   m sure you can .  you   re good at it .  you know you   re good at it     said granny  without looking around .   mrs .  gogol stuck another sliver into a leg .  granny sagged  and clutched at the banister .  beside her  one of the big torches flamed .      next time .     said mrs .  gogol .     right .  next time .  i can do it .      granny turned around .   she looked at the hundreds of upturned faces .   when she spoke  her voice was so quiet that they had to strain to hear .      i know you can too  mrs .  gogol .  you really believe .  just remind me again   we   re playin    for lily  right .  and for the city .         what does that matter now .     said mrs .  gogol .     ain   t you going to give in .      granny weatherwax thrust a little finger into her ear and wiggled it thoughtfully .      no     she said .     no  i don   t reckon that   s what i do now .  are you watchin     mrs .  gogol .  are you watchin    real close .      her gaze traveled the room and rested for just a fraction of a second on magrat .     then she reached over  carefully  and thrust her arm up to the elbow into the burning torch .   and the doll in erzulie gogol   s hands burst into flame .   it went on blazing even after the witch had screamed and dropped it onto the floor .  it went on burning until nanny ogg ambled over with a jug of fruit juice from the buffet  whistling between her teeth  and put it out .   granny withdrew her hand .  it was unscathed .      that   s headology     she said .     it   s the only thing that matters .  everything else is just messin    about .  hope i didn   t hurt you  mrs .  gogol .      she went on up the stairs .   mrs .  gogol kept on staring at the damp ashes .  nanny ogg patted her companionably on the shoulder .      how did she do that .     said mrs .  gogol .      she didn   t .  she let you do it     said nanny .     you got to watch yourself around esme weatherwax .  i   d like to see one of them zen buggers come up against her one day .         and she   s the good one .     said baron saturday .      yeah     said nanny .     funny how things work out  really .      she looked thoughtfully at the empty fruit juice jug in her hand .      what this needs     she said  in the manner of one reaching a conclusion after much careful consideration     is some bananas and rum and stuff in it        magrat grabbed her dress as nanny strode determinedly dak   rywards .        not now     she said .     we   d better get after granny .  she might need us .         shouldn   t think so for one minute     said nanny .     i wouldn   t like to be in lily   s shoes when esme catches up with her .         but i   ve never seen granny so agitated     said magrat .     anything could happen .         good job if it does     said nanny .  she nodded meaningfully at a flunkey who  being quick on the uptake  leapt to attention .      but she might do something   dreadful .         good .  she   s always wanted to     said nanny .     another banana dak   ry  mahatma coat  chop chop .         no .  it wouldn   t be a good idea     magrat persisted .      oh  all right     said nanny .  she handed the empty jug to baron saturday  who took it in a kind of hypnotic daze .      we   re just going to sort things out     she said .     sorry about this .  on with the motley   if anyone   s got any left .        when the witches had gone mrs .  gogol reached down and picked up the damp remains of the doll .   one or two people coughed .      is that it .     said the baron .     after twelve years .         the prince is dead     said mrs .  gogol .     such as he was .         but you promised that i would be revenged on her     the baron said .        i think there will be revenge     said mrs .  gogol .  she tossed the doll onto the floor .     lilith has been fighting me for twelve years and she never got through .  this one didn   t even have to sweat .  so i think there will be revenge .         you don   t have to keep your word .         i do .  i   ve got to keep something .     mrs .  gogol put her arm around ella   s shoulder .      this is it  girl     she said .     your palace .  your city .  there isn   t a person here who will deny it .      she glared at the guests .  one or two of them stepped backward .   ella looked up at saturday .      i feel i should know you     she said .  she turned to mrs .  gogol .     and you     she added .     i   ve seen you both   before .  a long time ago .      baron saturday opened his mouth to speak .  mrs .  gogol held up her hand .      we promised     she said .     no interference .         not from us .         not even from us .     she turned back to ella .     we   re just people .         you mean       said ella     i   ve slaved in a kitchen for years   and now   i   m supposed to rule the city .  just like that .         that   s how it goes .      ella looked down  deep in thought .      and anything i say people have to do .     she said innocently .   there were a few nervous coughs from the crowd .      yes     said mrs .  gogol .     ella stood looking down at the floor  idly biting a thumbnail .  then she looked up .      then the first thing that   s going to happen is the end of the ball .  right now .  i   m going to find the carnival .  i   ve always wanted to dance in the carnival .     she looked around at the worried faces .     it   s not compulsory for anyone else to come     she added .   the nobles of genua had enough experience to know what it means when a ruler says something is not compulsory .   within minutes the hall was empty  except for three figures .      but   but   i wanted revenge     said the baron .     i wanted death .  i wanted our daughter in power .      two out of three isn   t bad .   mrs .  gogol and the baron turned around .  death put down his drink and stepped forward .   baron saturday straightened up .      i am ready to go with you     he said .   death shrugged .  ready or not  he seemed to indicate  was all the same to him .      but i held you off     the baron added .     for twelve years .     he put his arm around erzulie   s shoulders .     when they killed me and threw me in the river  we stole life from you .      you stopped living .  you never died .  i did not come for you then .      you didn   t .      i had an appointment with you tonight .   the baron handed his cane to mrs .  gogol .  he removed the tall black hat .  he shrugged off the coat .   power crackled in its folds .      no more baron saturday     he said .   perhaps .  it   s a nice hat .   the baron turned to erzulie .      i think i have to go .         yes .         what will you do .      the voodoo woman looked down at the hat in her hands .      i will go back to the swamp     she said .      you could stay here .  i don   t trust that foreign witch .         i do .  so i will go back to the swamp .  because some stories have to end .  whatever ella becomes  she   ll have to make it herself .      it was a short walk to the brown  heavy waters of the river .   the baron paused at the edge .      will she live happily ever after .     he said .   not forever .  but perhaps for long enough .   and so stories end .   the wicked witch is defeated  the ragged princess comes into her own  the kingdom is restored .  happy days are here again .  happy ever after .  which means that life stops here .   stories want to end .  they don   t care what happens next       nanny ogg panted along a corridor .      never seen esme like that before     she said .    she   s in a very funny mood .  she could be a danger to herself .         she   s a danger to everyone else     said magrat .     she        the snake women stepped out into the passageway ahead of them .      look at it like this     said nanny  under her breath     what can they do to us .         i can   t stand snakes     said magrat quietly .      they   ve got those teeth  of course     said nanny  as if conducting a seminar .     more like fangs  really .  come on  girl .  let   s see if we can find another way .         i hate them .      nanny tugged at magrat  who did not move .      come on .         i really hate them .         you   ll be able to hate them even better from a long way off .      the sisters were nearly on them .  they didn   t walk  they glided .  perhaps lily wasn   t concentrating now  because they were more snake like than ever .  nanny thought she could see scale patterns under the skin .  the jawline was all wrong .      magrat .      one of the sisters reached out .  magrat shuddered .   the snake sister opened its mouth .   then magrat looked up and  almost dreamily  punched it so hard that it was carried several feet along the passage .   it wasn   t a blow that featured in any way or path .  no one ever drew this one as a diagram or practiced it in front of a mirror with a bandage tied around their head .  it was straight out of the lexicon of inherited  terrified survival reflexes .      use the wand .     shouted nanny  darting forward .     don   t ninj at them .  use the wand .  that   s what it   s for .      the other snake instinctively turned to follow the movement  which is why instinct is not always the keynote to survival  because magrat clubbed it on the back of the head .  with the wand .   it sagged  losing shape as it fell .   the trouble with witches is that they   ll never run away from things they really hate .   and the trouble with small furry animals in a corner is that  just occasionally  one of them   s a mongoose .     granny weatherwax had always wondered  what was supposed to be so special about a full moon .  it was only a big circle of light .  and the dark of the moon was only darkness .   but halfway between the two  when the moon was between the worlds of light and dark  when even the moon lived on the edge   maybe then a witch could believe in the moon .   now a half moon sailed above the mists of the swamp .   lily   s nest of mirrors reflected the cold light  as they reflected everything else .  leaning against the wall were the three broomsticks .   granny picked up hers .  she wasn   t wearing the right color and she wasn   t wearing a hat  she needed something she was at home with .   nothing moved .      lily .     said granny softly .   her own image looked out at her from the mirrors .      it can all stop now     said granny .     you could take my stick and i   ll take magrat   s .  she can always share with gytha .  and mrs .  gogol won   t come after you .  i   ve fixed that .  and we could do with more witches back home .  and no more godmothering .  no more getting people killed so their daughters are ready to be in a story .  i know that   s why you did it .  come on home .  it   s an offer you can   t refuse .      the mirror slid back noiselessly .      you   re trying to be kind to me .     said lily .      don   t think it don   t take a lot of effort     said granny in a more normal voice .   lily   s dress rustled in the darkness as she stepped out .      so     she said     you beat the swamp woman .         no .         but you   re here instead of her .         yes .      lily took the stick out of granny   s hands  and inspected it .      never used one of these things     she said .     you just sit on it and away you go .         with this one you have to be running quite fast before it takes off     said granny     but that   s the general idea  yes .           hmm .  do you know the symbology of the broomstick .     said lily .      is it anything to do with maypoles and folksongs and suchlike .     said granny .      oh  yes .         then i don   t want to hear about it .         no     said lily .     i imagine you don   t .      she handed the stick back .      i   m staying here     she said .     mrs .  gogol may have come up with a new trick  but that doesn   t mean she has won .         no .  things have come to an end  see     said granny .     that   s how it works when you turn the world into stories .  you should never have done that .  you shouldn   t turn the world into stories .  you shouldn   t treat people like they was characters  like they was things .  but if you do  then you   ve got to know when the story ends .         you   ve got to put on your red hot shoes and dance the night away .     said lily .      somethin    like that  yes .         while everyone else lives happily ever after .         i don   t know about that     said granny .     that   s up to them .  what i   m sayin    is  you   re not allowed to go around one more time .  you   ve lost .         you know a weatherwax never loses     said lily .      one of    em learns tonight     said granny .      but we   re outside the stories     said lily .     me because i   am the medium through which they happen  and you because you fight them .  we   re the ones in the middle .  the free ones        there was a sound behind them .  the faces of magrat and nanny ogg appeared over the top of the stairwell .      you need any help  esme .     said nanny cautiously .   lily laughed .      here   s your little snakes  esme .         you know     she added     you   re really just like me .  don   t you know that .  there isn   t a thought that   s gone through my head that you haven   t thought  too .  there isn   t a deed i   ve done that you haven   t contemplated .  but you never found the courage .  that   s the difference between people like me and people like you .  we have the courage to do what you only dream of .         yes .     said granny .     is that what you think .  you think i dream .      lily moved a finger .  magrat floated up out of the stairwell  struggling .  she waved her wand frantically .      that   s what i like to see     said lily .     people wishing .  i never wished for anything in my life .  i always made things happen .  so much more rewarding .      magrat gritted her teeth .      i   m sure i wouldn   t look good as a pumpkin  dear     said lily .  she waved a hand airily .  magrat rose .      you   d be surprised at the things i can do     said lily dreamily  as the younger witch drifted smoothly over the flagstones .     you should have tried mirrors yourself  esme .  it does wonders for a soul .  i only let the swamp woman survive because her hate was invigorating .  i do like being hated  you know .  and you do know .  it   s a kind of respect .  it shows you   re having an effect .  it   s like a cold bath on a hot day .  when stupid people find themselves powerless  when they fume in their futility  when they   re beaten and they   ve got nothing but that yawning in the acid pit of their stomachs   well  to be honest  it   s like a prayer .  and the stories   to ride on stories   to borrow the strength of them   the comfort of them   to be in the hidden center of them   can you understand that .  the sheer pleasure of seeing the patterns repeat themselves .  i   ve always loved a pattern .  incidentally  if the ogg woman continues to try to sneak up behind me i shall really let your young friend drift out over the courtyard and then  esme  i might just lose interest .         i was just walkin    about     said nanny .     no law against it .         you changed the story your way  and now i   m going to do it mine     said lily .     and once again   all you have to do is go .  just go away .  what happens here doesn   t matter .  it   s a city far away of which you know little .  i   m not totally certain i could out trick you     she added     but these two   they haven   t got the right stuff in them .  i could make jam of them .  i hope you know that .  so tonight  i suggest  a weatherwax learns to lose .      granny stood silent for a while  leaning on her useless broom .      all right .  put her down     she said .     and then i   ll say you   ve won .         i wish i could believe that     said lily .     oh   but you   re the nice one  aren   t you .  you have to keep your word .         watch me     said granny .  she walked to the parapet and looked down .  the two faced moon was still bright enough to illuminate the billowing fogs that surrounded the palace like a sea .      magrat .  gytha .     she said .     sorry about this .  you   ve won  lily .  there ain   t nothing i can do .      she jumped .   nanny ogg rushed forward and stared over the edge  just in time to see a dim figure vanish in the mists .   all three figures left on the tower took a deep breath .      it   s a trick     said lily     to get me off guard .         it isn   t .     screamed magrat  dropping to the stones .      she had her broomstick     said lily .      it don   t work .  it won   t start .     shouted nanny .     right     she said  menacingly  striding toward the slim shape of lily .     we   ll soon wipe that smug look off your face        she halted as silver pain shot through her body .   lily laughed .      it   s true  then .     she said .     yes .  i can see it in your faces .  esme was bright enough to know she couldn   t win .  don   t be stupid .  and don   t point that silly wand at me  miss garlick .  old desiderata would have defeated me long ago if she could .  people have no understanding .         we ought to go down there     said magrat .     she might be lying there             that   s it .  be good .  it   s what you   re good at     said lily  as they ran to the stairwell .      but we   ll be back     snarled nanny ogg .     even if we have to live in the swamp with mrs .  gogol and eat snakes    heads .         of course     said lily  arching an eyebrow .     that   s what i said .  one needs people like you around .  otherwise one is never quite sure one is still working .  it   s a way of keeping score .      she watched them disappear down the steps .   a wind blew over the tower .  lily gathered up her skirts and walked to the end  where she could see the shreds of mist streaming over the rooftops far below .  there were the faint strains of music from the distant carnival dance as it wound its way through the streets .   it would soon be midnight .  proper midnight  not some cut price version caused by an old woman crawling around in a clock .   lily tried to see through the murk to the bottom of the tower .      really  esme     she murmured     you did take losing hard .        nanny reached out and restrained magrat as they ran down the spiral stairs .      slow down a bit  i should     she said .      but she could be hurt    .         so could you  if you trip .  anyway     said nanny     i don   t reckon esme is lyin    in a crumpled heap somewhere .  that   s not the way she   d go .  i reckon she did it just to make sure lily forgot about us and wouldn   t try anything on us .  i reckon she thought we were   what was that tsortean bloke who could only be wounded if you hit    im in the right place .  no one ever beat    im until they found out about it .  his knee  i think it was .  we   re her tsortean knee  right .         but we know you have to run really fast to get her broomstick going .     shouted magrat .      yeah  i know     said nanny .     that   s what i thought .  and now i   m thinking   how fast do you go when you   re dropping .  i mean  straight down .         i   don   t know     said magrat .      i reckon esme thought it was worth findin    out     said nanny .     that   s what i reckon .      a figure appeared around the bend in the stairs  plodding upward .  they stood aside politely to let it pass .      wish i could remember what bit of him you had to hit     nanny said .     that   s going to be nagging at me all night  now .      the heel .      right .  oh  thanks .      any time .   the figure continued onward and upward .      he had a good mask on  didn   t he     said magrat  eventually .   she and nanny sought confirmation in each other   s face .   magrat went pale .  she looked up the stairs .      i think we should run back up and       she began .   nanny ogg was much older .     i think we should walk     she said .       lady volentia d   arrangement sat in the rose garden under the big tower and blew her nose .   she   d been waiting for half an hour and she   d had enough .   she   d hoped for a romantic t  te    t  te  he   d seemed such a nice man  sort of eager and shy at the same time .  instead  she   d nearly been hit on the head when an old woman on a broom and wearing what looked  as far as she could see through the blur of speed  like lady volentia   s own dress  had screamed down out of the mist .  her boots had plowed through the roses before the curve of her flight took her up again .   and some filthy smelly tomcat kept brushing up against her legs .   and it had started off as such a nice evening           ullo  your ladyship .      she looked around at the bushes .      my name   s casanunda     said a hopeful voice .     lily weatherwax turned when she heard the tinkle of glass from within the maze of mirrors .   her brow wrinkled .  she ran across the flagstones and opened the door into the mirror world .   there was no sound but the rustle of her dress and the soft hiss of her own breathing .  she glided into the place between the mirrors .   her myriad selves looked back at her approvingly .  she relaxed .   then her foot struck something .  she looked down and saw on the flagstones  black in the moonlight  a broomstick lying in shards of broken glass .     her horrified gaze rose to meet a reflection .   it glared back at her .      where   s the pleasure in bein    the winner if the loser ain   t alive to know they   ve lost .      lilith backed away  her mouth opening and shutting .   granny weatherwax stepped through the empty frame .  lily looked down  beyond her avenging sister .      you broke my mirror .         was this what it was all for  then .     said granny .     playin    little queens in some damp city .  serving stories .  what sort of power is that .         you don   t understand   you   ve broken the mirror           they say you shouldn   t do it     said granny .     but i reckoned  what   s another seven years    bad luck .      image after image shatters  all the way around the great curve of the mirror world  the crack flying out faster than light        you have to break both to be safe   you   ve upset the balance           hah .  i did .     granny stepped forward  her eyes two sapphires of bitterness .     i   m goin    to give you the hidin    our mam never gave you  lily weatherwax .  not with magic  not with headology  not with a stick like our dad had  aye  and used a fair bit as i recall   but with skin .  and not because you was the bad one .  not because you meddled with stories .  everyone has a path they got to tread .  but because  and i wants you to understand this prop   ly  after you went i had to be the good one .  you had all the fun .  an    there   s no way i can make you pay for that  lily  but i   m surely goin    to give it a try           but   i   i   i   m the good one     lily murmured  her face pale with shock .     i   m the good one .  i can   t lose .  i   m the godmother .  you   re the wicked witch   and you   ve broken the mirror           moving like a comet  the crack in the mirrors reaches its furthest point and curves back  speeding down the countless worlds        you   ve got to help me put   the images must be balanced       lily murmured faintly  backing up against the remaining glass .      good .  good .  feeding people to stories .  twisting people   s lives .  that   s good  is it .     said granny .     you mean you didn   t even have fun .  if i   d been as bad as you  i   d have been a whole lot worse .  better at it than you   ve ever dreamed of .      she drew back her hand .      the crack returned toward its point of origin  carrying with it the fleeing reflections of all the mirrors     her eyes widened .   the glass smashed and crazed behind lily weatherwax .   and in the mirror  the image of lily weatherwax turned around  smiled beatifically  and reached out of the frame to take lily weatherwax into its arms .      lily .        all the mirrors shattered  exploding outward in a thousand pieces from the top of the tower so that  just for a moment  it was wreathed in twinkling fairy dust .     nanny ogg and magrat came up onto the roof like avenging angels after a period of lax celestial quality control .   they stopped .   where the maze of mirrors had been were empty frames .  glass shards covered the floor and  lying on them  was a figure in a white dress .   nanny pushed magrat behind her and crunched forward cautiously .  she prodded the figure with the toe of her boot .      let   s throw her off the tower     said magrat .      all right     said nanny .     do it  then .      magrat hesitated .     well     she said     when i said let   s throw her off the tower  i didn   t mean me personally throwing her off  i meant that if there was any justice she ought to be thrown off           then i shouldn   t say any more on that score  if i was you     said nanny  kneeling carefully on the crunching shards .     besides  i was right .  this is esme .  i   d know that face anywhere .  take off your petticoat .         why .         look at her arms  girl .      magrat stared .  then she raised her hands to her mouth .      what has she been doing .         trying to reach straight through glass  by the looks of it     said nanny .     now get it off and help me tear it into strips and then go and find mrs .  gogol and see if she   s got any ointments and can help us  and tell her if she can   t she   d better be a long way away by morning .     nanny felt granny weatherwax   s wrist .     maybe lily weatherwax could make jam of us but i   m damn sure i could knock mrs .  gogol   s eye out with the fender if it came to it .      nanny removed her patent indestructible hat and fished around inside the point .  she pulled out a velvet cloth and unwrapped it  revealing a little cache of needles and a spool of thread .   she licked a thread and held a needle against the moon  squinting .      oh  esme  esme     she said  as she bent to her sewing     you do take winning hard .        lily weatherwax looked out at the multi layered  silvery world .      where am i .      inside the mirror .      am i dead .      the answer to that  said death  is somewhere between no and yes .   lily turned  and a billion figures turned with her .      when can i get out .      when you find the one that   s real .   lily weatherwax ran on through the endless reflections .     a good cook is always the first one into the kitchen every morning and the last one to go home at night .   mrs .  pleasant damped down the fires .  she did a quick inventory of the silverware and counted the tureens .  she     she was aware of being stared at .   there was a cat in the doorway .  it was big and gray .  one eye was an evil yellow green  the other one pearly white .  what remained of its ears looked like the edge of a stamp .  nevertheless  it had a certain swagger  and generated an i can beat you with one paw feel that was strangely familiar .   mrs .  pleasant stared at it for a while .  she was a close personal friend of mrs .  gogol and knew that shape is merely a matter of deeply ingrained personal habit  and if you   re a resident of genua around samedi nuit mort you learn to trust your judgment rather more than you trust your senses .      well now     she said  with barely a trace of a tremor in her voice     i expect you   d like some more fish legs  i mean heads  how about that .      greebo stretched and arched his back .      and there   s some milk in the coolroom     said mrs .  pleasant .   greebo yawned happily .   then he scratched his ear with his back leg .  humanity   s a nice place to visit  but you wouldn   t want to live there .     it was a day later .      mrs .  gogol   s healing ointment really seems to work     said magrat .  she held up a jar that was half full of something pale green and strangely gritty and had a subtle smell which  you could quite possibly believe  occupied the whole world .        it   s got snakes    heads in it     said nanny ogg .      don   t you try to upset me     said magrat .     i know the snake   s head is a kind of flower .  a fritillary  i think .  it   s amazing what you can do with flowers  you know .      nanny ogg  who had in fact spent an instructive if gruesome half hour watching mrs .  gogol make the stuff  hadn   t the heart to say so .      that   s right     she said .     flowers .  no getting anything past you  i can see that .      magrat yawned .   they had been given the run of the palace  although no one felt like running anywhere .  granny had been installed in the next room .      go and get some sleep     said nanny .     i   ll go and take over from mrs .  gogol in a moment .         but nanny   gytha       said magrat .      hmm .         all that   stuff   she was saying  when we were traveling .  it was so   so cold .  wasn   t it .  not wishing for things  not using magic to help people  not being able to do that fire thing   and then she went and did all those things .  what am i supposed to make of that .         ah  well     said nanny .     it   s all according to the general and the specific  right .         what does that mean .     magrat lay down on the bed .      means when esme uses words like    everyone    and    no one    she doesn   t include herself .         you know   when you think about it   that   s terrible .           that   s witchcraft .  up at the sharp end .  and now   get some sleep .      magrat was too tired to object .  she stretched out and was soon snoring in a genteel sort of way .   nanny sat and smoked her pipe for a while  staring at the wall .   then she got up and pushed open the door .   mrs .  gogol looked up from her stool by the bed .      you go and get some sleep too     said nanny .     i   ll take over for a spell .         there   s something not right     said mrs .  gogol .     her hands are fine .  she just won   t wake up .         it   s all in the mind  with esme     said nanny .      i could make some new gods and get everyone to believe in    em real good .  how about that .     said mrs .  gogol .  nanny shook her head .      i shouldn   t think esme   d want that .  she   s not keen on gods .  she thinks they   re a waste of space .         i could cook up some gumbo  then .  people   ll come a long way to taste that .         it might be worth a try     nanny conceded .     every little helps  i always say .  why not see to it .  leave the rum here .      after the voodoo lady had gone nanny smoked her pipe some more and drank a little rum in a thoughtful sort of way  looking at the figure on the bed .   then she bent down close to granny weatherwax   s ear  and whispered      you ain   t going to lose  are you .          granny weatherwax looked out at the multi layered  silvery world .      where am i .      inside the mirror .      am i dead .      the answer to that  said death  is somewhere between no and yes .   esme turned  and a billion figures turned with her .      when can i get out .      when you find the one that   s real .      is this a trick question .      no .   granny looked down at herself .      this one     she said .     and stories just want happy endings .  they don   t give a damn who they   re for .       dear jason eksetra      well so much for genua but i learned about mrs .  gogol   s zombie medicin and she gave me the told me how to make banananana dakry and gave me a thing call a banjo youll be amazed and all in all is a decent soul i reckon if you keeps her where you can see her .  it looks like we got esme back but i don   t know shes actin funny and quiet not like herself normally so im keepin an eye on her just in case lily puled a farst one in the mirror .  but i think shes geting better because when she woke up she arsked magrat for a look at the wand and then she kind of twidled and twisted them rings on it and turned the po into a bunch of flowers and magrat said she could never make the wand do that and esme said no because  she wasted time wishing for thinges instead of working out how to make them happen .  what i say is  what a good job esme never got a wand when she was young  lily would have bin a picnic by comparisen .  enclosed is a picture of the cemtry here you can see folks are buried in boxes above ground the soil being so wet because you dont want to be dead and drownded at the same time  they say travelin brordens the mind  i reckon i could pull mine out my ears now and knot it under my chin  all the best  mum .     in the swamp mrs .  gogol the voodoo witch draped the tail coat over its crude stand  stuck the hat on the top of the pole and fastened the cane to one end of the crosspiece with a bit of twine .   she stood back .   there was a fluttering of wings .  legba dropped out of the sky and perched on the hat .  then he crowed .  usually he only crowed at nightfall  because he was a bird of power  but for once he was inclined to acknowledge the new day .   it was said afterward that  every year on samedi nuit mort  when the carnival was at its height and the drums were loudest and the rum was nearly all gone  a man in a tail coat and a top hat and with the energy of a demon would appear out of nowhere and lead the dance .   after all  even stories have to start somewhere .       there was a splash  and then the waters of the river closed again .   magrat walked away .   the wand settled into the rich mud  where it was touched only by the feet of the occasional passing crawfish  who don   t have fairy godmothers and aren   t allowed to wish for anything .  it sank down over the months and passed  as most things do  out of history .  which was all anyone could wish for .     the three broomsticks rose over genua  with the mists that curled toward the dawn .   the witches looked down at the green swamps around the city .  genua dozed .  the days after fat lunchtime were always quiet  as people slept it off .  currently they included greebo  curled up in his place among the bristles .  leaving mrs .  pleasant had been a real wrench .      well  so much for la douche vita     said nanny philosophically .      we never said goodbye to mrs .  gogol     said magrat .      i reckon she knows we   re going right enough     said nanny .     very knowin    woman  mrs .  gogol .         but can we trust her to keep her word .     said magrat .      yes     said granny weatherwax .      she   s very honest  in her way     said nanny ogg .      well  there   s that     granny conceded .     also  i said i might come back .      magrat looked across at granny   s broomstick .  a large round box was among the baggage strapped to the bristles .      you never tried on that hat she gave you     she said .      i had a look at it     said granny coldly .     it don   t fit .         i reckon mrs .  gogol wouldn   t give anyone a hat that didn   t fit     said nanny .     let   s have a look  eh .      granny sniffed  and undid the lid of the box .  balls of tissue paper tumbled down toward the mists as she lifted the hat out .   magrat and nanny ogg stared at it .   they were of course used to the concept of fruit on a hat   nanny ogg herself had a black straw hat with wax cherries on for special family feuding occasions .  but this one had rather more than just cherries .  about the only fruit not on it somewhere was a melon .      it   s definitely very   foreign     said magrat .      go on     said nanny .     try it on .      granny did so  a bit sheepishly  increasing her apparent height by two feet  most of which was pineapple .      very colorful .  very   stylish     said nanny .     not everyone could wear a hat like that .         the pomegranates suit you     said magrat .      and the lemons     said nanny ogg .      eh .  you two ain   t laughing at me  are you .     said granny weatherwax suspiciously .      would you like to have a look .     said magrat .     i have a mirror somewhere          the silence descended like an axe .  magrat went red .  nanny ogg glared at her .   they watched granny carefully .      ye ess     she said  after what seemed a long time     i think i should look in a mirror .      magrat unfroze  fumbled in her pockets and produced a small  wooden framed hand mirror .  she passed it across .   granny weatherwax looked at her reflection .  nanny ogg surreptitiously maneuverd her broomstick a bit closer .      hmm     said granny  after a while .      it   s the way the grapes hang over your ear     said nanny  encouragingly .     you know  that   s a hat of authority if ever i saw one .         hmm .         don   t you think .     said magrat .      well     said granny  grudgingly     maybe it   s fine for foreign parts .  where i ain   t going to be seen by anyone as knows me .  no one important  anyway .         and when we get home you can always eat it     said nanny ogg .   they relaxed .  there was a feeling of a hill climbed  a dangerous valley negotiated .   magrat looked down at the brown river and the suspicious logs on its sandbanks .      what i want to know is     she said     was mrs .  gogol really good or bad .  i mean  dead people and alligators and everything        granny looked at the rising sun  poking through the mists .      good and bad is tricky     she said .     i ain   t too certain about where people stand .  p   raps what matters is which way you face .      you know     she added     i truly believe i can see the edge from here .         funny thing     said nanny     they say that in some foreign parts you get elephants .  you know  i   ve always wanted to see an elephant .  and there   s a place in klatch or somewhere where people climb up ropes and disappear .         what for .     said magrat .      search me .  there   s prob   ly some cunnin    foreign reason .         in one of desiderata   s books     said magrat     she says that there   s a very interesting thing about seeing elephants .  she says that on the sto plains  when people say they   re going to see the elephant  it means they   re simply going on a journey because they   re fed up with staying in the same place .         it   s not staying in the same place that   s the problem     said nanny     it   s not letting your mind wander .         i   d like to go up toward the hub     said magrat .     to see the ancient temples such as are described in chapter one of the way of the scorpion .         and they   d teach you anything you don   t know already  would they .     said nanny  with unusual sharpness .   magrat glanced at granny .      probably not     she said meekly .      well     said nanny .     what   s it to be  esme .  are we going home .  or are we off to see the elephant .      granny   s broomstick turned gently in the breeze .        you   re a disgustin    old baggage  gytha ogg     said granny .      that   s me     said nanny cheerfully .      and  magrat garlick           i know     said magrat  overwhelmed with relief     i   m a wet hen .      granny looked back toward the hub  and the high mountains .  somewhere back there was an old cottage with the key hanging in the privy .  all sorts of things were probably going on .  the whole kingdom was probably going to rack and ruin without her around to keep people on the right track .  it was her job .  there was no telling what stupidities people would get up to if she wasn   t there     nanny kicked her red boots together idly .      well  i suppose there   s no place like home     she said .      no     said granny weatherwax  still looking thoughtful .     no .  there   s a billion places like home .  but only one of    em   s where you live .         so we   re going back .     said magrat .      yes .      but they went the long way  and saw the elephant .       like finding that bloody butterfly whose flapping wings cause all these storms we   ve been having lately and getting it to stop .      and people are wrong about urban myths .  logic and reason say that these are fictional creations  retold again and again by people who are hungry for evidence of weird coincidence  natural justice and so on .  they aren   t .  they keep on happening all the time  everywhere  as the stories bounce back and forth across the universe .  at any one time hundreds of dead grandmothers     are being whisked away on the roof racks of stolen cars and loyal alsatians are choking on the fingers of midnight burglars .  and they   re not confined to any one world .  hundreds of female mercurian jivpts turn four tiny eyes on their rescuers and say     my brood husband will be livid   it was his travel module .     urban myths are alive .      considered backward  that is  by people who wear more clothes than they do .      bad spelling can be lethal .  for example  the greedy seraph of al ybi was once cursed by a badly educated deity and for some days everything he touched turned to glod  which happened to be the name of a small dwarf from a mountain community hundreds of miles away who found himself magically dragged to the kingdom and relentlessly duplicated .  some two thousand glods later the spell wore off .  these days  the people of al ybi are renowned for being unusually short and bad tempered .      which explains a lot about witches .      desiderata had sent a note via old mother dismass asking to be excused on account of being dead .  second sight enables you to keep a very tight rein on your social engagements .      nanny ogg didn   t know what a coquette was  although she could probably hazard a guess .      hence  for example  the way of mrs .  cosmopolite  very popular among young people who live in the hidden valleys above the snowline in the high ramtops .  disdaining the utterances of their own saffron clad  prayer wheel spinning elders  they occasionally travel all the way to no .    quirm street in flat and foggy ankh morpork  to seek wisdom at the feet of mrs .  marietta cosmopolite  a seamstress .  no one knows the reason for this  apart from the aforesaid attractiveness of distant wisdom  since they can   t understand a word she says or  more usually  screams at them .  many a bald young monk returns to his high fastness to meditate on the strange mantra vouchsafed to him  such as    push off  you .     and    if i see one more of you little orange devils peering in at me he   ll feel the edge of my hand  all right .     and    why are you buggers all coming around here staring at my feet .     they have even developed a special branch of martial arts based on their experiences  where they shout incomprehensibly at one another and then hit their opponent with a broom .      granny weatherwax had once pressed him about this  and since there are no secrets from a witch  he   d shyly replied     well  ma   am  what happens is  i gets hold of    un and smacks    un between the eyes with hammer before    un knows what   s    appening  and then i whispers in his ear  i sez     cross me  you bugger  and i   ll have thy goolies on t   anvil  thou knows i can .            many of the more traditional dwarf tribes have no female pronouns  like    she    or    her .     it follows that the courtship of dwarfs is an incredibly tactful affair .      well  not often .  not on a daily basis  anyway .  at least  not everywhere .  but probably in some cold countries people say     hey  those eskimos .  what a people .  fifty words for snow .  can you believe that .  amazing .     quite a lot .      of course  lots of dwarfs  trolls  native people  trappers  hunters and the merely badly lost had discovered it on an almost daily basis for thousands of years .  but they weren   t explorers and didn   t count .      nanny ogg sent a number of cards home to her family  not a single one of which got back before she did .  this is traditional  and happens everywhere in the universe .      something about nanny ogg rubbed off on people     the yen buddhists are the richest religious sect in the universe .  they hold that the accumulation of money is a great evil and burden to the soul .  they therefore  regardless of personal hazard  see it as their unpleasant duty to acquire as much as possible in order to reduce the risk to innocent people .      black aliss wasn   t very good with words either .  they had to give her quite a lot of money to go away and not make a scene .      whereas in ankh morpork  business was often so slow that some of the more go ahead guild members put adverts in shop windows offering deals like    stab two  poison one free .         ronald the third of lancre  believed to be an extremely upleasant monarch  was remembered by posterity only in this obscure bit of rhyming slang .      nanny ogg knew how to start spelling    banana     but didn   t know how you stopped .      always in front of you in any queue  for a start .      racism was not a problem on the discworld  because   what with trolls and dwarfs and so on   speciesism was more interesting .  black and white lived in perfect harmony and ganged up on green .      as desiderata said  fairy godmothers tend to get heavily involved with kitchens .      two logs and hope .      this is the last line of a discworld joke lost  alas  to posterity .       about the author   terry pratchett is
