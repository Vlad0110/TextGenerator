databank by matt elson      this novel is dedicated to    daniel carnahan    who will understand marcus   s dilemma .       special thanks are due in the writing of this novel to ricia mainhardt  john betancourt  and byron preiss .     additional help during the period in which this was written came from michael d .  toman  laura j .  lehew  and bridgett and marty marquardt .            steve chang followed jane maynard into the office of mojave center governor  the gestalt robot who was supposed to be running the underground city of mojave center .  now the office was temporarily occupied by r .  hunter  the robot who had been specifically designed and built to lead the search for the missing governor robot .      good morning     said hunter .     i trust your breakfast was good .     he was already standing  six and a half brawny feet of humaniform robot in a northern european physiognomy now  with short blond hair and blue eyes  though he could change his shape and appearance at will .     steve  jane   this is professor gene titus  our historian on the team for this mission .         pleased to meet you both .     gene was a tall  pleasant looking man  only a little older than steve  with bushy brown hair .  he smiled broadly as he shook hands with them .     i   m a specialist in roman history  especially the early imperial period .  from what hunter tells me  this trip we   re about to take should be quite an experience .         we   ve done two of them already     said jane .     there   s nothing like it .         hi     said steve .  he hung back a little  waiting to see what sort of guy gene would turn out to be .      so hunter was telling me .     gene turned to the weird object standing against the wall .     so these are two of the six gestalt robots we   re looking for .      steve said nothing .  this was jane   s specialty .      that   s right     said jane .     mojave center governor split into his six component robots and these are the two we have brought back from the past so far .         and so what is this  exactly .         this thing in front of us is what mc   and   look like  physically merged and shut down .  if we get the other four back here to merge with them  we   ll have mc governor put back together again .  at that point  he   ll actually be humaniform .         not    if    we bring them back     said hunter soberly .     when we bring them back .      steve grinned .     that   s the right spirit .  but  if you don   t mind my asking .  .  .         yes .         you look kind of young to be a professor .         i just received my first position this year .  my doctoral degree is so new  the ink   s wet .     he winked .   jane laughed .      i see .     steve smiled too  pleased at gene   s casual attitude .  he had expected gene to be a little more stuffy in his manner .   gene turned to jane .     hunter has only started to brief me .  you   re the roboticist .         that   s right .         then i guess you can explain something to me .  the laws of robotics must be dictating the robots    behavior somehow  but i don   t quite see the connection .         hunter  do you want to finish the briefing .  or does it matter .         go ahead     said hunter .  his manner was serious and direct  telling steve that he did not want to waste time with unnecessary talk .      the third law of robotics says      a robot must protect his own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law         said jane .      what about it .     gene asked .      mc governor is one of a small number of experimental governor robots that were being tested recently .  all the others have malfunctioned .  the governor robot oversight committee  for whom hunter is working  needs to get hold of mc governor to find out what may have happened to them all .  mc governor has split into his component robots and fled .  without interviewing him  i can only surmise his reasons  but i believe that under the third law  he split to avoid experiencing the same malfunction as the other governor robots .  also under the same law  i think he fled in order to avoid being dismantled during a study of the problem .         i see .  so that   s why they fled to different times in history .     gene nodded soberly .     i   ve already given hunter my promise to keep the existence of time travel confidential .  if time travel became widespread  history would be very vulnerable to all the people who might change it .  but do the other laws apply to the robots    decision to flee .         oh  yes .  the component robots miniaturized themselves to microscopic size when they used the time travel device .  their intention was to avoid receiving any instructions from humans   in the case of mc    who went back to the dinosaur age  he was anticipating survival into the human era .  the second law of robotics says      a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law .             and if humans couldn   t see the robots  they wouldn   t give them any orders .         that   s the idea     said steve .      then what   s the problem .     gene looked back and forth between jane and hunter .      there are two problems     said hunter .     the first is that the miniaturization process was flawed .  all the component robots return to full size at some point back in history  without their desire or control .  when they do this  they begin to interact with humans .  since they have to obey human orders  they may change history .  even worse  their obedience to the first law of robotics might even guarantee that they will make certain changes .         the first law says      a robot may not injure a human being  or  through inaction  allow a human being to come to harm         said jane .      yes  i see the connection     said gene .      i arranged hypnotic sleep courses in latin and ancient german for steve and jane     said hunter .     in the case of german  we had to use a probable reconstruction of the language based on what our finest linguist robots could surmise .  i assume it went well .         adfirmo     said jane  smiling .     i affirm .         we won   t really know until we try speaking to the natives     said steve .      gene  were you able to use the lesson packages i sent you when we made our arrangements .     hunter asked .      yes .  i used them while i slept on the plane on my way here .  the flight wasn   t as long as a good night   s sleep  but i concentrated on the german since i already had to learn latin as part of my education .         excellent .  i have accessed these languages thoroughly myself .  now  then .  i have arranged for a security detail to take all of us to room f    of the bohung institute .  i left your clothing and lapel pin radios there during the night  after i received them from the robots who made them .         you still want me to review them for authenticity .     gene asked .     you mentioned that when you first contacted me .         definitely     said hunter .     let us go .        hunter was deliberately keeping the tension he felt from the humans .  the first law imperative was driving him hard to get back into the past as fast as possible  but of course he knew that all of the team   s preparations had to be made first .  now  as he led the humans out of the office to the waiting security vehicle  he opened his internal communication link to the city computer .      please contact all the members of the governor robot oversight committee in a conference call .         acknowledged     said the city computer .   hunter felt that his responsibilities to the committee required that he report on the progress of his missions .  however  he had not shared with them the fact that time travel was involved .  if the ability to travel through time were to become widely known and used  the potential harm to humans would be immense .  his judgment of how to follow the first law in this matter therefore prevented him from explaining the details to the committee .  he also wanted to confer with them alone  so that the human members of his team would not mistakenly reveal the existence of time travel .   the team rode the electric cart silently down the broad  clean thoroughfares of mojave center .  around them  robots and humans pursued their daily routines  unaware that in the bohung institute  the first and only device for time travel was among them .  the underground city  beneath the mojave desert in california  remained calm and safe .      have you briefed gene about wayne nystrom .     steve asked hunter .      not yet     said hunter .      that name is familiar to me     said gene .     has he been in the news or something .         not lately     said jane .     but from time to time  he has appeared in the scientific news because of his advances in robotics .  he invented the governor robots .         is he going to be joining the team .     gene asked .      i wish .     steve grinned and shook his head .     he   s operating on his own  trying to get the component robots away from us .  he wants to conduct his own investigation of their malfunction  without us .         his own .  is he able to go back in time  too .         up to now     said steve .      what do you mean .      steve looked at hunter .     you know the technicalities better than i do .         i do not know all the particulars myself     said hunter .     however  dr .  nystrom has appeared in the past during both of our previous missions .         does he have a second time travel device .         no     said hunter .     the device we have all used was initially created by mc governor  accomplished by modifying an existing piece of research equipment .  the component robots all used it  and wayne nystrom followed them  preceding us .  we were the last to use it .         you didn   t get hold of him when he returned to this time .     gene was puzzled .      no .  on our first mission  i did not realize he was a factor in this project     said hunter .      may i ask what happened  or is that prying .     gene glanced at all three of the others  uncertainly .      of course you may ask     said hunter .     you are part of the team .  i had security robots guard the institute and stationed a robot just outside the door .  wayne apparently returned from the late cretaceous to room f    and quickly reprogrammed the console to send him back to the time of captain henry morgan .  that   s where we became aware of him next .         and now .         when we returned  i moved a robot named ishihara to the inside of the room with orders to apprehend wayne and to report to me when he appeared .         but nystrom hasn   t come back .         no     said hunter .      what about that  hunter .     steve asked .     do you think he   s still back in morgan   s time  in the     s .  now that we have mc   safely here  maybe we should go after wayne .         he has no reason to remain there     said hunter .     and from what i can tell  our history has not been changed except in regard to the explosions .  i believe he may have some other plan in mind that is beyond my anticipation for now .  so our best plan of action is to continue our mission to recover mc    as planned .         explosions .     gene eyed hunter carefully .     i caught a news item on my way here about a mysterious explosion in germany   come to think of it  in the general area we   re about to visit .  is there a connection .         that is correct     said hunter .     when the component robots reach the approximate time from which they first journeyed back into the past   in other words  about now   they explode with nuclear force .  this is caused by the instability in their atomic structure caused by the flawed miniaturization .  the destruction to human life acts as a first law imperative on me .         i get it     gene said grimly .     we have to go back and get that one right now .  that   s mc   .         you are correct again     said hunter .   all night  while he had prepared the clothing and new communicators for the team  he had monitored the news .  millions were dead in northwestern germany  just east of the ems river and the weser river r in a heavily populated industrial area .  the radiation was beginning to spread over most of europe .  worst of all  some news analysts were concerned that terrorists might be attempting to disrupt world peace .  hunter feared that old  mutual fears and accusations by different nations could cause additional violence .  the first law required that he eliminate the cause of the explosion without delay .   the security vehicle pulled up in front of the bohung institute .  hunter led the team silently inside the building  through the robot security detail guarding it .  he had arranged to shut down the institute as soon as he had realized the importance of the experimental time travel device that mc governor had created .   inside  hunter took his team to room f    and introduced gene to ishihara .  this large room housed an opaque sphere about fifteen meters in diameter .  the remainder of the room was lined with countertops  most of them occupied with computers  monitors  a communications console  and miscellaneous office items .  clothing was stacked on one counter near the door to an adjacent room .   ishihara passed out oral vaccines to the humans  which hunter had chosen and requisitioned during the night .  these vaccines could not guarantee protection from disease  because the modern microbes had mutated considerably in the millennia that had passed since roman times  but hunter knew they would improve the humans    chances of avoiding serious illness .  the humans took them immediately .   ishihara waited impassively by the door .  everyone turned to hunter for instructions .  he pointed to the stack of clothing he had left earlier .      gene  please examine the clothing for authenticity     said hunter .     you will find tunics  heavy cloaks  and boots for male costumes  jane has a full length gown  cloak  and boots .  if you pass them  steve will look them over to make sure they are sturdy and practical enough .         and here are our new communicator pins     said jane  picking up small silver broaches .  she held one out to gene  showing him the button to be pressed to activate the radio .     we can use them to hold our cloaks on .         that is my intention     said hunter .     when the clothing has been approved  take turns changing in the adjacent room .      hunter received a message through his internal link .     city computer calling r .  hunter .         hunter here .     while the humans examined their new clothes  he would have time to respond without disturbing them .      i have the governor robot oversight committee on a conference call for you .      please connect me .      instantly  the four faces of the committee members appeared on his internal video screen in split portrait shots .  everyone exchanged polite  perfunctory greetings .  then hunter got to the point .      i am pleased to report that mc   is safely in custody     said hunter .      excellent     said dr .  redfield  the pretty blonde .     where did you find him .         in the west indies     said hunter .  he decided not to mention jamaica  because that would set a precedent of being specific .  being vague with the committee was the only way to avoid having to tell them  sooner or later  about the time travel device .     he is well  but has been instructed to merge with mc   and shut down .  they are in a secure location .         you   ve been very efficient     said professor post  scratching his black beard thoughtfully .     do you know where you will find your next quarry .         i have a lead in europe     said hunter .      where .     dr .  chin moved a strand of her long black hair away from her face .     which country .         i do not have an exact location     said hunter .  that was technically true  since he had not yet heard a report on ground zero of the explosion and the coordinates he had obtained from the console of the time travel device did not match those of any known town or city .  still  he was aware that he was very close to telling them an outright lie .      you have found the first two component robots in only a few days     said dr .  khanna .     what is your estimate for completing your assignment .         i would be unwise to predict that i can apprehend each of the remaining component robots in only one day     said hunter .     matters have proceeded well so far  allowing me to move quickly .  still  the first two pursuits were quite different and i expect the remaining four to be very unpredictable as well .         i understand     said dr .  khanna .      i   m sure we   re all very impressed with your efficiency so far     said dr .  redfield .      i should begin the next mission     said hunter .     if you have no more questions  i shall get started .         of course     said professor post .     good luck .      everyone signed off .          after gene inspected each item of clothing  he passed it to steve .  then steve held it up  shook it loose  and tugged at the seams .  hunter had explained that they were going to a forested mountain area in autumn  the rainy season in northern germany .  they would need warm clothes .  the cloaks and outer tunics were made of wool  while the undertunics were made of linen .      yours are fine     said steve  handing jane her outfit .  she went to change first .   all the clothes passed inspection .  when everyone had changed  hunter passed each of the humans a small leather pouch filled with common roman coins from the era to which they were going .  all the communicator pins were in place  fastening the humans    cloaks at the neck .      well  gene     said jane .     i know you said the clothes are authentic   but how do we look .         you look perfect     said gene .     as a matter of fact  you will look right at home in the mountains of central europe in this period .         we shall masquerade as traveling merchants     said hunter  adjusting his own long brown cloak .  since his radio links were internal  he fastened his cloak with an ordinary silver pin .     i shall be somewhat vague in order to avoid being tripped up in a small mistake  but r shall present us as visitors from roman gaul seeking trade in silverwork with the german tribes across the rhine .         you have some .     gene asked .   hunter pointed to a leather bag  sitting on a counter where the clothing had been .     each item inside is a relatively inexpensive piece of jewelry that i shall present as samples and gifts .  none is authentic  but i had some of the robots here in mojave center develop them last night from authentic models .  the metallic content and style of art and design are accurate .  i believe that their presence in roman germany will not cause any alteration of history or culture .  gene  please look them over and see if you agree .  steve  the leather bag has a shoulder strap so you can carry the jewelry in it conveniently .         come to think of it  hunter     steve said with a grin  running a hand through his black hair     that works for you three just fine .  when we come into contact with romans or germans  how are you going to explain having someone of east asian descent with you .  we better have our story straight about who i am .      hunter looked at steve .  his boots  tunic  and cloak were certainly acceptable  but he was right that his chinese features would stand out in ancient germany .     gene  what do you suggest .         well .  .  .     gene thought a moment  looking up from the jewelry box .     you know  even though rome had no official contact with china  some roman merchants were aware of han dynasty china .  they traded through the parthians for chinese silk and sold it to the wealthiest romans .  so maybe steve could be a slave who accompanied his merchant owners through the parthian empire with a load of silk and then was sold .         okay .     steve laughed .     if that will hold up with the romans  it   s good enough for me .         very well     said hunter .     gene  what do you think of the silverwork .         it looks fine to me     said gene .     i   m not a specialist in roman art as such  but i certainly don   t see any glaring problems .     he closed and latched the box .      good .     hunter looked at each of them .     unless you have questions  i believe we are ready to go .         this way .     steve picked up the leather bag .  then he slung the bag over his shoulder and moved to the big sphere that dominated the room .  it was a solid metal globe fifteen meters in diameter .  first he helped jane and gene climb inside .  then he followed  sliding down into the curved bottom with them .   hunter set the coordinates and the timer on the console .  when he had finished  he hoisted himself inside and closed the sphere .  for a long moment  the team sat crowded together in the dark .     steve felt himself land on hard  rocky ground .  he pushed himself up and saw that hunter  jane  and gene were doing the same .  they were on a steep  grassy slope  in a dense forest .  the leaves were an autumn blaze of orange  red  and yellow .  overhead  the sky was cloudy and gray .  steve smelled rain .  far below  he could see a gray river winding its way between the bluffs on each side of it  reflecting the subdued sunlight .      is that the rhine .     steve asked .      the weser river     said hunter .     the rhine is well west of here .         this is quite a view .     steve got to his feet .  the forest was full of both evergreens and hardwoods .     well  hunter .  where do we go .         we shall have to explore some     said hunter .     in all likelihood  mc   will return to normal size out in the forest somewhere  which is most of the surrounding territory .  according to the history i accessed through the city computer  the german tribes have a mixed economy  based on tilled fields  cattle  and hunting .  each tribe has a number of separate villages .  gene  does that match your information .         yes  it does .     gene got to his feet and helped pull jane up .     generally speaking  they will be the ones who actually know the forest and routinely move through it .         what about the romans .     jane straightened her gown .     they   ve conquered this area  as i understand it .  why aren   t they going to be in the forest  too .         the romans haven   t really been here very long     said gene .     they don   t have a settled presence here  with families and merchants .  all they really have is an army of occupation .  they   re outnumbered and limited in the range of territory they actually walk or ride through .  in most cases  they will only march out in a troop large enough to defend itself .         come on  hunter     said steve impatiently .     which way do we go .         i believe that friendly contact with the germans will most likely facilitate our mission     said hunter .     according to what you have said  gene  do you agree .         yes  i do     said gene .     and they shouldn   t be hard to locate .  instead of looking for them  i think that if we simply start hiking  then warriors  hunters  or sentries of the cherusci tribe are likely to find us .      hunter nodded and began to hike up the slope  eastward away from the weser  pushing through thick branches .  jane and gene followed in single file over the rocky ground .  steve deliberately took up the rear .  after all  he had to look like their slave .      hey  gene     steve said  as they continued up the uneven slope .     is all the country here this rough .         most of it .  this province goes east to the elbe river and west to the rhine .  we   re in the middle of it here .  it   s very mountainous  and many of the valleys are swamps .  it includes part of modem westphalia .      up ahead  hunter stopped at a small  level clearing .  the three humans caught up to him .  steve could not see or hear any reason for them to have halted already .      nine humans are nearby     hunter said quietly .     they are moving quietly  without speaking  ahead to our right .  from the sound of their movements through the brush  i believe that they are still unaware of our presence .  however  this is the contact we want .         we don   t want to be mistaken for deer and shot     said steve .     should we start talking loudly or something .         we shall start using latin     said hunter  switching to that language     to support the idea that we have just crossed over from gaul .  stay close and keep talking .     he started walking again .      do you see anything yet .     jane asked  trying out her own latin .      specto     said hunter .     i am looking .  so far  i can only hear them .  they are still at a distance that is beyond human hearing  but they are drawing closer .      the forest was dense  with thick underbrush and many fallen logs blocking their way .  in the rare patches of direct sunlight  the air was warm  but most of the ground was shaded by the canopy of trees .  steve   s cloak kept snagging on branches until he got used to keeping it pulled tightly against his body .  in the lead  hunter  because of his height  found the going slow as he worked his way through the tree branches .  every so often  gene leaned over and freed jane   s cloak from a snag .      veni  vidi  vici     muttered steve .     i   m a slave from foreign parts .  it   s understandable if my latin is bad  right .         yes  it is understandable     said hunter  pushing through some thick pine branches and holding them back for the others .     but we should not be overheard speaking english unless we simply cannot communicate our point to each other without it .  do continue talking  however .         keep talking     steve said cheerfully  in latin .     talk so they know we   re human and not tonight   s dinner .  what shall we talk about .         gene     said jane .     exactly who are these germans  anyway .  who   s about to find us .         they   re barbarian warriors     said gene .     semipastoral nomads  technically .  right now  they aren   t really very different from the gauls across the rhine  but they will be .         hunter  are they any closer .     jane asked .     you   ll hear them before we will .         i think they have heard us     said hunter .     the pattern of their footsteps is changing .  they have begun to spread out some as they approach us .         gaul on one side of the rhine and germany over here     said steve .     france as opposed to germany .  that   s centuries in the future  though .     he stepped over a thick  exposed tree root .     right .         yes and no     said gene .     their divergent history has already begun .  a generation ago  julius caesar established the rhine river as the border between roman held gaul and the land of the independent german tribes across it .  in   b . c .   the younger stepson of caesar augustus  a man named drusus  invaded the land across the rhine and pushed the border eastward to the elbe river because it   s a more defensible border from the roman side .  that   s the territory where we are now .     he paused to point out a slippery  moss covered rock to jane  who stepped over it .      so it   s a roman province     said steve .      well  so far .  a roman named publius quinctilius varus is governor right now .  he considers the province thoroughly subdued and is overconfident   to say the least   of his power .     gene held another branch back out of the way for jane and steve .   ahead of them  hunter had stopped for a moment  looking around carefully .     they are very close     he whispered in english .     i also hear the sound of small animals  probably hunting dogs .     he began walking again .   steve could not hear any sign of the other people .     dogs .  why aren   t they barking and howling and coming after us .         they   re well trained     said gene .     to flush game sometimes and to sneak up quietly at other times .         simply remain calm     hunter said in latin  this time in a normal tone .     continue our conversation if you wish .  lower your voices  though  if you go on discussing history .  we do not want to give our friends ideas they do not already have .         not much chance of that     said gene .     these events are already in motion .         what do you mean that this is a roman province    so far    .     jane asked gene .      the province doesn   t stay roman very long     said gene .      a german prince of the cherusci tribe  called arminius  has been granted roman citizenship .  he   s been dealing with varus in this new province  representing the cherusci .  in fact  the entire tribe has been given the privileged position of a federated state within the roman empire .  for this reason  many of the cherusci have latin names  like arminius himself .         but what happened to the romans .     steve ducked under another low branch  hurrying to keep up .  he looked around for the germans that hunter could hear  but still saw no direct sign of them .  then he noticed some birds suddenly fluttering out of a tree a short distance away .  he realized that they might have been disturbed by humans walking near them .      this year     said gene     arminius leads an uprising against the romans .  the cherusci germans and some allied tribes ambushed varus in the teutoburger forest  destroying him and his entire army .  the roman border will be pushed back to the rhine until the empire falls completely .  as a result  gaul will be culturally and linguistically romanized to a degree that germany never will be .         what of it .     steve demanded .     i mean  the roman empire was huge .  this one province couldn   t have meant that much to the romans  could it .         not to the living roman empire     said gene .     but think of it this way .  if this province had remained within the roman empire  then maybe more of germany would have been conquered by the romans .  when the roman empire collapsed  the germanic tribes that helped bring it down might have been culturally latinized and much more like the tribes in gaul  which became france  than the germany of our history .  the history of the new germany would have been extremely different forever after  altering major world events in many different centuries .         so the real difference would came later     said steve .     i see .         when was the ambush in teutoburger forest .     hunter asked .      it       gene stopped as an arrow whistled in front of hunter and hit a tree trunk .            hunter stopped immediately .  he heard the humans on his team halt behind him .  no one spoke .   nine strange young men stepped into view .  some appeared in front of the team  while others moved out of the trees on each side .  black and gray dogs stepped out with them  their noses quivering .  hunter was alert for violence  the first law dominating his thoughts .   none of the germans was as tall as hunter  but they were heavyset muscular men wearing fur tunics and leather leggings .  all had long  shaggy hair .  most were blond  while a few had red hair .  each of them held a long  heavy spear .  they carried bows on their shoulders  quivers of arrows and long knives hung on  their belts .   hunter waited patiently  neither speaking nor moving .  a tall  hulking german with bushy red hair and a full beard that matched stepped up in front of hunter .  in addition to his weapons  he carried some sort of steer horn on a thong over his shoulder .  while his companions held their spears ready for action  he rested the butt of his spear confidently on the ground .  he looked over hunter with quick blue eyes .      hail  strangers     the german said stiffly in latin .     i am vicinius  of the cherusci .  who are you .         hail  vicinius     said hunter .     i am called hunter  but we are not hunting today .  we seek the cherusci tribe in friendship .  you can see that we are unarmed .     he turned and introduced the humans on the team by their first names .   vicinius nodded politely to each of them  though his eyes widened slightly in surprise at the introduction of jane .  none of his companions lowered their spears .  they did not smile or speak  either .  steve glanced at one who was glowering suspiciously at the group .      you seek us .     vicinius asked .     why .         we come seeking friends with whom to trade     said hunter .     we have only a few poor samples of gifts today  but now we seek friends for the future .         where are these gifts .     vicinius glanced at all of them .     i see no packhorse .      steve unslung the leather bag from his shoulder  expecting hunter to call him forward .      this is a poor place to talk     said hunter .     may we find a spot that is more comfortable .      vicinius had glanced at steve when he had shifted the leather bag  so the question about the presence of gifts was answered .  steve now realized that hunter was angling for an invitation back to the home village of these hunters .  holding the bag uncertainly  he said nothing .   vicinius seemed to understand hunter   s meaning  as well .  he looked over the group again  appraising them .  his companions waited for him to speak .      hunter     gene said quietly  switching to english so the germans could not understand .     i suggest some warrior bonding .  compliment his weapons and his skill at arms .  if he offers you a chance to show off  do well but don   t embarrass him .  and try speaking german to him .         you have fine spears     said hunter politely in german .     your companions are all very fit .         you speak our language .     vicinius smiled for the first time  looking hunter in the eye again  and some of his companions murmured among themselves in surprise .      we all speak it to some degree     said hunter .     vicinius  we have heard that the men of the cherusci tribe are great hunters and warriors .  as traders  we are impressed by this reputation .  would one of your party be so kind as to demonstrate this skill with weapons .      vicinius grinned in appreciation of this compliment  and so did some of his companions .  he turned and looked around among the trees for a moment .  then he hefted his spear  reared back  and heaved it through the air .   the big spear flew among the leafy branches  somehow missing all of them  and struck a tree trunk about thirty five yards away with a loud thunk .   hunter estimated the weight of the spear from its appearance and the sound it had made striking the tree .  the distance and the size of the target alone were not particularly impressive  but he could see that in this throw  vicinius   s challenge had been to throw the spear through the dense forest without hitting the many tree branches and underbrush that would have deflected the weapon from its target .  he had accomplished the maneuver perfectly .      will you throw .     vicinius gestured for one of his companions to offer a spear to hunter .   hunter accepted the spear .  he wanted to make a good impression on these hunters and warriors but he remembered gene   s warning not to embarrass their host .  hunter carefully raised the spear and threw it at the same tree .   hunter   s spear also flew straight  missing all the surrounding branches  and struck the same tree trunk .  however  it hit just below the first spear .  the other warriors nodded their appreciation of his throw but said nothing .   vicinius  however  laughed aloud .     excellent .  you must be a fine hunter .         i have come to trade  not to hunt     said hunter  in what he hoped was a modest tone of voice .      and your friends .         traders as well .      vicinius nodded  looking them over again .  he pointed to another of the warriors .  that man also took a broad stance and cast his spear .  it  too  sailed among the dense leaves and branches to strike a different tree trunk .  he turned and grinned at vicinius and hunter .      very impressive     said hunter .   vicinius pointed to another warrior  then nodded toward gene .  the other man tossed his spear vertically to the surprised historian .   steve stifled a laugh .     good luck  gene .         i   ll need it     said gene  grinning .  he moved up next to hunter  where he had more open space  and carefully gripped the spear .     well  i don   t know about this .         you can do it     said jane .      i wonder .     gene took a deep breath and imitated the stance he had seen the warriors take .  then he clenched his teeth and threw the spear .   it flew forward but  halfway to its target  the shaft of the spear grazed an overhanging branch and glanced off to the left .  it fell out of sight in the underbrush .   all the germans laughed .  so did steve .  gene shrugged  still smiling .   this time a warrior stepped up without bidding from vicinius .  he threw his spear as well  striking another tree near the first two that had spears hanging from them .  the other warriors  now much more relaxed than they had been at first  cheered good naturedly .   another warrior tossed his spear to steve  who caught it with his free hand .      uh oh     said steve  grinning as he set down the leather bag between his feet .      you can   t do much worse than i did     said gene .     go ahead .  we   re only traders  after all .         hey  i   m only a slave .     steve reared back like the others and threw the spear .  it  too  clattered against some tree branches halfway to its target and fell out of sight .  the warriors laughed  as did jane and gene .   several of the warriors ran to fetch the spears .      don   t i get a throw .     jane asked  looking around at the other warriors .      i   m afraid not     said gene .     it   s a cultural matter with them .         well  i probably wouldn   t do any better than you two  anyway     said jane .      those things are heavier than they look     said steve .     i didn   t know it was so hard .     he picked up the leather bag again .      you three have spirit     said vicinius .      we have more spirit than skill     said hunter .     however  i thank you for the game .         it is well     said vicinius .     you said you were traders from gaul .         that is right .         in what do you trade .         silverwork .         silver  eh .     vicinius glanced at the leather bag .  then he looked at hunter   s face for a long moment .     please come to our village .  it is not far .  you will be my guests .         thank you .     hunter knew that bringing strangers back to the village was an important decision .  vicinius might also be more cautious than usual because of the tension between the romans and germans now .  however  the reason for his hesitation did not really matter .   some of the other german warriors had already gone to fetch the spears .  then vicinius waved once and turned to lead the way through the forest .   hunter followed him  remaining back a short distance to stay with his team .  they were much slower than the germans .  as they picked their way through the forest  steve was the most surefooted .      hunter     jane said quietly in english .     something has occurred to me about the component robots .      he waited for her to come up next to him .  then they walked together .     what is it .         i simply can   t believe that they have chosen when and where to go in the past purely by chance .         you feel they have specific motives behind their choices .     hunter asked .      they must     said jane .     random flight would have taken them to many parts of the world  far from the centers of historical focus .     .      why did mc   choose to go to what would become alberta in the late cretaceous .         i have no way of knowing about that     said jane .     but sir henry morgan was a historical figure  even though a minor one .  and mc     s flight to the border of the roman empire just can   t be an accident .         why do you feel this way .         in both morgan   s time and especially now  most of the world was not well documented historically .  the vast majority of land area is outside historical record .  and most of the land within historical record does not have anything very significant occurring at any given time .  for some reason  mc   and   chose to be in the area of recorded human history  even while intending to remain microscopic .         they represent only two of the six component robots     said hunter .      i thought of that .  as a roboticist  i was intrigued by this mystery  so before breakfast this morning  i got on the city computer .  i found out that when mc governor did certain tasks with the city  he sometimes delegated them to his component personalities .      hunter turned to her in surprise  holding a pine branch out of the way for her .     how did you learn that .         i asked for any information that might help identify the component robots    separate abilities  tendencies  or personalities .     she took the branch from hunter and in turn held it for gene .      i see     said hunter .     i was focused on mc governor as an integral individual first  who split up .  i did not think to approach the component robots as individuals while mc governor was still functioning .         i found out that mc   specialized in the environmental impact of mojave center on the surrounding area     said jane .     mc   specialized in general troubleshooting for mc governor .  mc   handled security concerns for mojave center .  i   m sure these match up in some way with the places they chose to go .     she stepped over a large  fallen tree trunk and caught her cloak on a short branch .      what about the other three component robots .     hunter stopped to pull her cloak free .      i don   t recall .  i left my notes with my regular clothes back in room f    .         you believe that these specialties reflect their choices of where and in what time period to hide .         yes  even though they intended to remain microscopic forever .  it may be a subliminal influence of their specialties  rather than part of their deliberate  rational thought .  but if i can figure out what kind of influence mc     s specialty  for instance  had on him  i might have a shortcut for finding him here .         you say that mc   handled security matters for mojave center     hunter said .     this strikes me as irrelevant to his presence here .  do you have any guess as to where he might be now  or where he would go here  with this information .         no     jane said .     not yet .      the germans quietly led the way through the forest .  hunter saw that they were still carefully watching the birds in the trees and stopping occasionally simply to listen .  the dogs  too  were on the alert .  he decided that they were still hoping to find prey for dinner  even on their way home .     dr .  wayne nystrom squatted next to a cold  fast  flowing stream in the forest .  he drank some water out of his cupped hand and wiped his hand on a patch of grass .  then he shivered in the chilly breeze and looked around at the trees .  a few birds chirped and twittered in the branches .  otherwise  the forest looked the same in every direction .    i m freezing   he muttered to himself .  he stood up and slowly turned around again  hoping to see a sign of human life somewhere .  the view  however  was the same now that he was standing as it had been when he was squatting .   wayne had been lost ever since his arrival here .  all he knew about his location was that he was some  where in the german forest east of the rhine in a . d .    .  he had no idea where to find human habitation .   only a few hours ago by his own time  but seventeen centuries in the future from this year  he had taken some time to tinker with his belt unit .  this was the device that he carried to trigger the time travel sphere back in room f    of the bohung institute .  in working with it  he had learned that it could control the settings in the console of the sphere even when he was in another time .  this occurred during the early stage of its function  just before the sphere picked him up to move him through time .  instantly  he had realized that he could use this capability to his own advantage .   first he had used the unit   s controls to slow down the action of the device .  this had allowed him enough time to monitor and read all the records inside the console that ran the sphere .  since these records contained each setting that had been used so far  they told him where all the other component robots had gone .  at the time wayne read them  hunter and his team had not used the sphere since going to jamaica in      .   based on when each of the component robots had left its own time  wayne had judged that of the remaining component robots still at large  the one here in germany was due to explode the soonest .  guessing that hunter would try to capture him next  wayne had also picked this location .  if at all possible  he wanted to grab mc   and study him here in this time  before hunter could take him back .   he had arrived safely  but moving directly from jamaica in the summer of      left him unprepared for life in this forested mountain area in central europe .  the water in the stream was clear and certainly untouched by industrial pollution  but finding food in this northern forest was going to require more work than buying tropical fruit in port royal  jamaica .  worst of all  without heavier clothing  he might not survive the night .  he was not sure how cold these mountains would get at night .   rubbing his arms  he stood up and looked around .  all he could do was start walking .  he chose a direction at random and began to pick his way through the underbrush .      somewhere across the rhine in a . d .        he said quietly .  in the solitude  he liked hearing the sound of his own voice .  however  he was not a historian and did not know much about what would be happening nearby .  he only knew that he was in germany in roman times .   he had smelled the faint odor of woodsmoke for several minutes before he suddenly realized what it meant .  in these times  of course  open fires were the principal means for cooking and keeping warm   though in a forest  the odor of smoke could also mean a forest fire .  however  this smoke was too faint to present an immediate danger .  encouraged  he followed the scent .          as the team followed vicinius and his warriors up the forested slope  steve and gene fell into step behind hunter and jane .  they took turns holding branches back for each other and pointing out the best way to climb over fallen logs or large  exposed tree roots .  their cloaks repeatedly snagged on twigs and had to be freed .   on the team   s first mission  their paleontologist had taken a haughty  condescending attitude toward steve .  during the second mission  their historian had run off with a local pirate .  steve knew that it was unfair to blame gene for what the others had done  but he could not help being circumspect toward him .   soon vicinius had led everyone to a narrow trail  where the walking was much easier .  nearly an hour passed on the trail before steve heard small children shouting and dogs barking .  by then  he could also smell smoke from the village fires .  the sun was low  behind the trees to the west .      vicinius     said hunter  as the village came into view ahead .     is this the village of your prince arminius .         no  hunter .     vicinius shook his head .     arminius lives in another village not far from here .      the village was nestled into a small clearing .  from the tree stumps  steve could tell that the tribe had used the trees they had cut down to build rough huts  which were jammed together in a crude circle .  children came running to welcome home the warriors  and in the center of the village circle  women tended cookfires .  he was surprised to see that there were only a few horses  hobbled just outside the village .      first we shall eat     said vicinius .     you will be guests at my mother   s fire .         we thank you     said hunter .   around them  everyone was turning to look at the strangers .  the children came running up to them  while the village elders walked forward slowly  studying them .  vicinius waited for only one older man to come forward .  he was a stocky man  slightly short er than vicinius  but white haired and bent forward with age .      father  these are traders in silver from gaul     said vicinius .     this one is called hunter .         welcome     said the old man .     i am odover  the village chief .         we are pleased to meet you     said hunter .   steve suddenly realized that the children  all of them either blond or red haired  were staring at him .  some were making jokes to each other and laughing  others were just watching him .  odover  too  had just noticed him .      who is your companion .     odover asked hunter .     his name is steve     said hunter .     he comes from a far land beyond the parthian empire to the east .         you are welcome     odover said to steve .  then he turned and waved for the other villagers to make way for them .  they backed away at his bidding .   steve felt a little self conscious under the stares of the villagers  but none of them actually approached him .  odover and vicinius took their guests to the cookfire in front of one specific hut and gestured for them to sit down around it .  they did not introduce the elderly woman tending the fire or the two younger women stirring an iron pot of stew that was boiling over it .  the women looked up at the strangers curiously but did not speak .   looking around  he counted twelve huts .  they were made of narrow  vertical logs lashed together .  cracks between them had been filled with mud and straw .  around the huts  a narrow perimeter of land had been cleared of trees .  in parts of the perimeter  green crops that he could not identify grew in rows .   the stew smelled good to steve .  it obviously had meat and vegetables in it  but he had no idea what kind .  he waited to see what would happen next .      first we shall eat     said odover .     then we shall talk .     he waved to a young boy  who ducked into the hut .  a moment later  the boy came out with a large  earthenware jug cradled in both arms .  he gave it to odover  who passed it to vicinius .   vicinius pulled a wooden plug from the jug with his teeth and drank from it first .   steve was surprised .  he was accustomed to guests receiving the first offer of food and drink .  next to him  jane glanced at gene in puzzlement .      to prove it   s safe     gene whispered in english .     when strangers meet in this time  it   s a courtesy to share the same container and for the host to eat or drink first to show that nothing has been poisoned .         our mead is a humble drink     said vicinius  giving the jug to hunter .     arminius has some good roman wine from gaul  but this is all we have in this village .      hunter accepted the jug and drank from it .     thank you .  it is quite good .     he passed it to steve .   steve took a slight drink .  he found the mead had a heavy flavor and was stronger than he had expected .  swallowing hard  he gave it in turn to jane .   steve suddenly realized that as jane took a drink from the jug  both vicinius and odover were blinking at her in surprise .  the women at the fire also turned to look .  none of them spoke  however  and she merely passed the jug to gene .      they   re surprised because they consider this to be a ceremonial drink     gene said quietly in english .     their women will eat dinner separately  but they will allow us our little quirks  apparently .         good     said jane .   soon the women at the fire were ladling stew into earthenware bowls and handing them out .  odover poured more mead into individual cups and shared them .  then the german women took their own stew elsewhere .   steve tasted his steaming stew .  the meat  which was stringy beef  had been boiled tender .  the lightly salted stew was not bad .      they have salt beds near here     said gene quietly .     of course  they won   t get pepper here for many centuries .         it is good     said hunter  to their hosts .   vicinius nodded his acceptance of the compliment .     you traveled far today .         yes     said hunter .     it was not difficult  but it was quite a long way .         how did you cross the river from gaul .         fishing boats     gene said quickly .     a couple of fishermen carried us across .         from the other side .  a fishing village of gauls is upstream some distance  but it is quite far .         vicinius  perhaps you can help us with a problem     said hunter  changing the subject .      how can i help .         we are searching for an acquaintance who is lost in the forest somewhere .         really .     vicinius was startled .     if he is lost  he may be in danger .  the forest is cold at night .         we have completely lost him     said hunter .     we do not even know where to look .         you should have told me sooner     said vicinius  with concern .     we could have searched for signs of him on our way back to the village .         he is a small man  rather slender .  perhaps we can look for him tomorrow .      vicinius nodded  still looking at hunter with a puzzled expression .     you seem very calm for a man who is searching for someone .  i don   t understand .         he   s a little weird     said steve quickly .  he felt that hunter needed some help in his charade about what mc   was really like .     we want to find him  but we don   t know where he   ll go or what he   ll do .  he   s unpredictable and may not even have any clothes to wear .  his name is mc   .         an odd name     vicinius agreed .      yes .     gene leaned forward .     he may be  shall we say  touched by the gods .         ah .     vicinius nodded his understanding .     yes  i see .  touched by the gods .         a little crazy     gene muttered in english .     or mildly retarded .  but harmless .         i understand     said hunter quietly .     this is related to their beliefs in some way .         yes .  many preindustrial cultures view mildly retarded or crazy people as having the special protection of the gods     said gene .      i shall spread the word through the village tonight  after we have finished dinner     said vicinius .     no one will harm a man who has been touched by the gods .  sooner or later  someone will find some sign of him .         thank you     said hunter .   by the time they had finished dinner  night had fallen .  most of the light now came from the waning cookfires  though some families had raised flaming torches near the fronts of their huts .  steve waited patiently as more mead was poured  wondering when he should open the leather bag .      we must give our new friends our gifts     said hunter finally .     you have been very hospitable .      taking that as a cue  steve pulled up the leather bag and opened it .      one at a time     gene said quietly .     hand them to hunter  as our representative .  hunter  first give the largest item to odover  the village chief .  give him the second largest  too  and then we   ll see how they respond .      steve felt around inside the bag for the largest object .  when he pulled it out  he discovered that it was a serving bowl with handles and feet in the shape of flowers and leaves .  he gave it to hunter .   hunter took the bowl in both hands and stood up to present it to odover .  the village chief received it while still sitting .  he looked it over carefully  nodding as he turned it to reflect the yellow firelight .      it is very fine work     odover said finally .  his voice was nonchalant  but he kept looking closely at the bowl  still turning it .   steve could see that odover was very impressed .  the german just didn   t want to admit it too openly .  steve took the next object out of the bag .  it was a long  thick armband with a stag   s head in deep relief .  he had to stand in order to give it to hunter  who in turn offered it to odover .   the village chief grinned broadly this time  revealing some missing and broken teeth .  he slipped the armband over his upper arm and turned to see the firelight reflect off it .     ah  very good .  very good .      steve pulled out the third item  which was a large  circular pendant shaped like a bear  hanging on a heavy silver chain .  hunter started to hand it to odover  as well  but the village chief pointed to vicinius  instead .  so hunter turned and gave it to the seated warrior .      this is very fine work     said vicinius  accepting the pendant .  for a moment  he looked carefully at the bear  smiling .     yes  perhaps it will bring me the strength of a bear .     he looped the chain over his neck and then looked down at the pendant lying against his chest .     it is a fine gift .      steve felt one item remaining in the bottom of the bag .  it was a small box with a hinged lid .  trees were shaped in relief on the lid .  as he handed the box to hunter  he felt something slide inside the box .      something   s inside it     he said to hunter .     better take a look .      hunter opened the lid .  steve could see three rings inside the box .  one had a tree on it  one had a fish  and the last had a wolf .  hunter turned the box toward vicinius and held it out to him .   vicinius took it  nodding  and placed the box on his lap .  he said nothing  but his eyes widened with approval .  first he gave two of the rings to odover  then slipped the one with the wolf on his own finger .  he closed the lid and ran his hand over the shapes on top of it .      we are only poor traders     said gene .     our gifts are small and few .  please forgive us for not bringing better ones .         it is beautiful work     said vicinius .  he gave the silver box to his father .   odover nodded as he examined it .  then he leaned toward vicinius and spoke quietly in his ear .  vicinius stood up and walked away into the shadows .   just outside the circle of firelight  many of the other villagers had gathered to watch .  steve could see women standing there  often surrounded by children with pale blond hair .  other warriors also surrounded the fire of the village chief  curious about the strangers .   odover said nothing  waiting patiently for vicinius .  he held the box and the bowl on his lap  looking at them as he studied the decorative shapes on them .  no one spoke .   finally vicinius walked back to the fire with two warriors .  his companions carried bundles of furs .   vicinius held four spears bundled in his arms along with a long  straight dagger .   odover simply gestured silently toward hunter .      we have only the worst gifts for our new friends .     vicinius rested the spears on the ground and signaled for his companions to bring the furs forward .      refuse at first for the sake of modesty     gene whispered .     let him press the gifts on us .         your generosity is not necessary     said hunter .     you have already been excellent hosts .         we welcome you to our village     said odover .     please accept our humble gifts .         you are not dressed for our mountain life     said vicinius .     we have fur tunics and cloaks for all of you .      hunter accepted the first bundle of furs and passed it to steve .  then steve set down the bundle and shook out the top article of clothing .  it was a long  hooded cloak of rich brown fur  much warmer than anything the team was wearing .   steve handed it to gene and picked up the next one .  this cloak  with similar fur  was shorter .  he gave it to jane .  the longest  of course  he saved for hunter .  the robot was not as susceptible to cold as the humans  but the garment would be part of his masquerade .  steve swirled the last cloak in the bundle over his own shoulders .  he was warm enough by the fire now  but he could feel that this cloak would make a big difference .      they are fine furs     said gene .   hunter shook out the second bundle .  these were calf length tunics similar in size to those the team was wearing  but made of deerskin .     you are very kind     hunter said .      the spears  of course  are for you to hunt or defend yourselves .  this dagger is for her .      hunter passed each weapon to steve  who handed a spear to gene and the dagger to jane .      this has been a good day     said vicinius .     in times to come  we will have more furs .  you will always be welcome in our village .         thank you     said hunter .      it has grown late     said vicinius .     you shall be guests in one of our huts .  please come .         warm clothes and a place to sleep     said steve .     we can   t beat that .             as the sun went down  wayne began to shiver uncontrollably in the brush outside a barbarian village .  in the twilight  he had watched the villagers stir their dinners over their fires .  he had even heard one tall  hulking man addressed repeatedly by the latin name    arminius     though the rest of the language was completely beyond him .   he was hoping that perhaps after everyone went to sleep  he could sneak into the village and find some old clothes to steal  along with some leftover food .  all evening  a light but cold breeze had blown the smoke and the scent of cooking meat to him from the village .   he watched the fur clad people in the village as they slowly covered their fires and put out their torches .  they were retiring into their huts for the night .  the wind shifted slightly  no longer blowing in his face but from behind him .   suddenly a dog in the village  its nose twitching  turned toward him .  it began to bark  and ran in his direction .  in a moment  every dog in the village was barking furiously  following the first one .  shouts rose up from the villagers .   belatedly realizing that the dogs had caught his scent  wayne turned and tried to run .  he stumbled through the underbrush  crashing into tree branches in the darkness  his legs stiff from the cold .  he flailed through the leaves and pine needles as he heard heavy footsteps and barking dogs close in on him .   strong hands grabbed wayne from behind as young men shouted to each other in a harsh  guttural language .  he felt himself yanked backward  his arms pinned behind him .  then he was marched roughly back through the woods toward the village .     hunter and his team accepted a hut for the night in the village of odover .  at vicinius   s bidding  the young family to whom it belonged had vacated it to share a hut that belonged to some neighbors .  hunter moved his sleeping pallet  made of pine boughs covered with a soft deer hide  so that it blocked the door of the hut .      are you afraid of something in particular .     steve asked  as he arranged his own bedding .      no     said hunter .     this is just a precaution .         aren   t we intruding too much .     jane asked .     i mean  under chaos theory  displacing an entire family here means that we   ve interfered .         vicinius just wants to stay on the good side of rich roman merchants     said gene .     besides  this was his idea .  we would be more disruptive if we refused their hospitality .         anyhow  we know now that chaos theory isn   t right in its most extreme form     said steve .     hunter  you admitted that after our first two missions .         correct     said hunter .     it is now clear that our presence in the past in and of itself does not cause significant changes .  nor does consuming small amounts of food and water and interacting with the local people .  however  i must remind all of you that at some point  more significant actions that we take might truly change the future .         how much would we have to do to create permanent change .     gene asked .     i mean  sure  if we assassinated an emperor  the change would be pretty big  i suppose .         a greater danger would be introducing new technology     said hunter .     this is why i made certain that the silverwork we brought was consistent with this time and place .  but to answer your question  i do not know where the threshold of creating permanent change begins .  so we must still try to avoid unnecessary changes as much as possible .         the romans have to be ambushed in teutoburger wald .     gene nodded grimly .     i understand .         did our gifts impress them .     jane asked .     they didn   t seem all that excited to me .         definitely     said gene .     that reserve is part of their negotiating  they don   t really want to let on just how valuable they consider decorative gifts of silver .  but their return gifts are the proof .         furs  spears  and a dagger .     steve sounded skeptical .     aren   t those just routine belongings for them .         yes and no     said gene .     furs represent all the effort and danger of a hunt .  and the spears all have metal tips .  the germans still get most of their metal from the romans right now .  if you look around the village tomorrow  you   ll see that swords are very rare and that most of the spears simply have fire hardened wooden points  with no metal at all .  giving us metal pointed spears and offering a dagger to jane were a great honor and sacrifice for them .         they don   t even have any horses to speak of     said steve .     just a couple .  is that normal .  doesn   t everybody ride horseback in this time .         no     said gene .     it   s a question of wealth .  they know how to breed and train and ride  of course .  but these german tribes are only beginning to accumulate herds of horses .  by the time of emperor constantine the great  in a few more centuries  german mercenary cavalry will be the finest in the roman military .  another century after that  they will bring down the western roman empire  roughly everything west of the balkans .  but that   s still in the future .         they   re hoping we   ll bring more silver later     said jane .     but we aren   t coming back .  that   s going to be disruptive .  won   t they feel we betrayed their friendship .         not with the battle of teutoburger forest coming up     said gene .     after that  they   ll just figure we were scared to come back  or prohibited by the roman authorities .         we must also consider wayne     said hunter .     i have been thinking about his disappearance .  i now suspect that wayne has the same information i have for finding the fugitive robots  taken from the console of the sphere .         we left ishihara in room f    to nab him     said steve .     that sphere is the only time travel machine he has .  he   ll show up there sooner or later .         i have considered the situation     said hunter .     he may have met trouble in jamaica  in which case he may never return to our time .  however  he may also have learned to move from one time period to another without returning to room f    between trips .         can he do that .     jane asked .      i have not risked altering my own device to find out     said hunter .     however  i have thought about the design of the controls in both my unit and also in the console itself .  theoretically  it may be possible .         why don   t you find out for sure .     gene asked .      the first law prevents me from taking the risk of harming the unit     said hunter .     as long as you are with me here in this time  i do not dare take it apart .  perhaps when we return home again  i shall examine it carefully .         so you really believe wayne may be here     said jane .     or about to arrive .         i believe it is a realistic possibility     said hunter .      then we   ll have to look for him  too     said steve .     i   d like to nab the guy once and for all .  these missions would be a lot easier without him interfering .  we could take him home and lock him up or something .         that would pose a legal problem     said hunter .     we can arrange to detain him without harm in this time  if we catch him .  we cannot imprison him at home without becoming guilty of kidnapping .  nothing he has done on these missions to the past can be used against him without revealing the existence of time travel .         not to mention the question of legal jurisdiction     jane said wryly .     would a court in  say  california in our century indict him for kidnapping rita in the caribbean in the seventeenth century .  i wouldn   t count on it .         all right     said steve .     so we take him home and simply guard room f    so he can   t get near the place .  that would do  i guess .         i have another worry     said hunter .     mc   may already be full sized and active in one of the roman forts on the rhine  where governor varus lives .         varus has three legions  i believe     said gene .     the romans  might be fairly close to this village .  we could separate  to see if mc   is with them .      steve laughed .      i don   t think hunter will go for that     said jane .      no .         we have had problems in our earlier missions when we separated     said hunter .      then why did you give us these lapel pin communicators .     gene asked .     you must have anticipated some need for them .         we may have to separate at some point     said hunter .     or we may become separated by events beyond our control .  for now  however  we shall not separate unnecessarily .         got it     said gene .     but in that case  what will our plan of action be .         when exactly was the battle in teutoburger forest .         i don   t have a date     said gene .     i   ve never seen the exact day mentioned in the records .  a historian named dio cassius wrote the most precise account of the event .  but it was in the fall  so we aren   t too far off the mark .  since the villagers here have no particular concern over our origins in roman gaul  i would say it hasn   t happened yet .         hold it     said steve .     if you don   t know the date  then what are we doing here .         we did not come to this time specifically for the battle     hunter reminded him .     i calculated that mc   would return to full size about this time .  the battle is just my biggest concern .  if mc   tries to prevent it under the first law  he may change history in the way we discussed earlier .  gene  do you think the battle is coming up soon .         yes  i would say so .  winter weather comes on early in these northern mountains .  autumn is fairly short .         tomorrow  i shall ask vicinius to take us on a search for mc       said hunter .     the next morning  just after dawn  the team rose  wearing the warmer tunics and cloaks their hosts had given them .  the sky was overcast and the surrounding trees were lost in fog .  vicinius greeted his guests around the cookfire again  wearing his new silver pendant around his neck .  odover also joined them again  his silver armband glistening on his arm .  breakfast was a gruel made of various seeds and forest vegetation .  steve found it tolerable  but not as good as the meaty stew had been the night before      vicinius     said hunter .     i know this is the rainy season  but it has not begun to fall today .  we would like to search for our lost friend .         of course     said vicinius .     my friends and i had poor fortune on our hunt yesterday .  today they must tend the village cattle  but i will take you through the forest .  maybe i will find some prey today .     he picked up his spear and slung the strap of the steer horn over his shoulder again .   steve was glad to have the heavier clothing as vicinius led the team out of the village along a well worn path .  jane wore her new dagger in her belt and the others all carried their spears .  some of the children and dogs in the village ran alongside them for a while  but they eventually returned home .      where are we going .     steve asked .     hunter  we aren   t just going to wander all over the mountain at random  are we .         what do you suggest  vicinius .     hunter asked .     where should we look first .         along the river     said vicinius .     he will need water .  and if he is hungry  fishing will be easier than hunting .  his tracks will be clear in the mud  too .      steve allowed vicinius to move up a little on the trail  then lowered his voice and switched to english .     jane  is mc   going to care about going to the river .  a human needs food and water  but a robot doesn   t .  are we going to be wandering off to the river for nothing .         i don   t know .  you   re right that the component robots get their energy from the tiny solar converters in their skin .  but they do need small amounts of water to replace their simulated saliva and sweat .         i just don   t want to go all the way down to some river for nothing .         i think we have to     said gene quietly .     vicinius   s argument is sound from his point of view .  unless we get some specific clue as to mc     s whereabouts that we can show him  we can   t reasonably refuse to go along with him .      steve nodded and hurried after vicinius and hunter .   as the morning wore on  the fog gradually lifted over the treetops .  the sky remained gray and dark  however  and drizzle fell intermittently .  they all raised their hoods against it .  steve was more glad than ever that he had the fur cloak  with its residual animal oils  to keep the dampness off him .   suddenly vicinius stopped up ahead .  he stood motionless  staring across a ravine into the distance .  hunter joined him first  then the others caught up .   steve moved around hunter to see what they were looking at .  in the distance  a line of soldiers was marching along a mountain road .  at the rear of the line  he could see horse drawn wagons .  each soldier wore armor and a helmet with a bright red crest .  a short distance past them  steve could see a bend in the river .  even he knew that they were roman legionaries .      their camp is not far     said vicinius casually .     we will go around it to reach the river .         they build a fortified camp every night     said gene .      where are they going .     hunter asked .      roman business     vicinius said shortly .  he pushed on down the trail  ignoring the romans .   steve looked at gene in surprise .  he definitely had the feeling that vicinius knew more about the romans than he was telling .  gene merely shrugged .   the trail wound down the mountain slope .  the weser was often visible through the trees below .  steve could see birds in the trees  but he only heard small animals fleeing from them in the underbrush .   they had almost reached the edge of the forest down in the river valley when vicinius stopped abruptly again .  this time he pointed to the ground .  steve hurried forward  hoping to see the small footprints of mc   .  instead  he found animal tracks in the soft ground .      wild boar tracks     said gene .      yes     said vicinius .     they are a challenge to hunt and kill  but the meat is very fine .     he grinned .     and the tracks are fresh .         how can you tell .     jane asked .      the shape is very clear  meaning that the drizzle hasn   t had time to blur the edges     said steve .      it is very near     said hunter .  vicinius looked at him in surprise .     i see no immediate sign of it .         i hear it digging in the soil     said hunter .     it has not noticed us yet .         they have no fear     said vicinius  still looking at hunter .     your hearing must be very good .         we have no experience as hunters     said hunter .     we shall remain here out of danger if you wish to pursue it .      vicinius nodded  adjusting his grip on his spear .  he crept off the trail into the brush  following the tracks .  even steve could see the trail of trampled weeds and broken branches the boar had left .      what if it hurts him .     gene asked hunter .     he wouldn   t have found these tracks if he hadn   t been taking us down to the river .  haven   t we altered his plans .         yes     said hunter .     stay here .     he followed vicinius  also moving quietly and hefting his spear into position to throw it if necessary .      it   s a difficult choice for him     said jane .     ordinarily  the first law tells him not to change history   if a boar is going to injure vicinius  he should allow it .  but if we   re responsible for creating the danger  the first law is open to some interpretation about what he has to do .      suddenly a loud snorting reached them  and vicinius whooped  taunting his prey .  steve heard the snapping of twigs  branches  and underbrush .  gene hurried after hunter .      watch it .     steve yelled  following him into the trees off the trail .   jane joined him .   the boar had trampled a small clearing for itself a short distance in front of hunter and vicinius .  it looked huge to steve  he had never seen a wild boar  and this one was at least as big as the biggest modem hog he had ever seen .  this boar  however  was a shaggy dark brown instead of pink  and it sported long  curved tusks curling forward from its face .  with fast moving eyes  it warily watched its tormentors .            vicinius slowly and carefully crept to his right  his spear held high .  hunter stood motionless  his spear also ready to throw .  the boar made a snuffling sound and feinted  but did not charge .   gene paused a safe distance behind hunter .      do not participate     hunter said over his shoulder .     please back away .      gene moved back and stepped behind a large tree .      come on .     steve took jane   s arm in his free hand and pulled her back out of sight .     hunter will take care of them .         i didn   t doubt it     said jane  in an annoyed tone .     but we could watch .         i don   t want hunter to argue with me .  this is our chance  while the first law has him occupied .  let   s go .     still pulling her arm  he started back up the trail .      stop it .     she yanked her arm free .     are you crazy .  splitting up just gets us all into more trouble .  haven   t you learned that by now .      behind them  vicinius was still whooping and calling the boar  teasing it .      what if mc   is with the romans .  they aren   t far .  we saw them on this side of the river .  and we both know that hunter will just give me an argument .  vicinius probably won   t want to visit them and hunter can   t just abandon him .  so we should go  while hunter   s busy .         i can   t believe you want to do this  after all the trouble we   ve had before .         i don   t have time to argue .  you coming or not .         no .     she glared at him with her clear blue eyes  challenging him .      see you later .     steve turned and hurried on down the trail .  he would walk along the river until he could see either the roman legionaries or their camp .      steve .         yeah .     he turned to look .      all right  i   m coming .     she hurried up alongside him  her fur cloak swirling .     but i want one promise from you .         what is it .         after we get away  we   ll radio hunter and tell him we   re okay .         i don   t want to           or else i   ll yell to him right now .         all right .     steve couldn   t help grinning .     come on  let   s get out of here .      vicinius was still baiting the boar with his calls and shouts .  that meant hunter   s attention was still riveted by the first law imperative .  gene had not noticed steve and jane   s departure  either .  they hurried down the trail .   they reached the edge of the forest quickly .  steve turned to his right and started hiking along the edge of the trees .  jane kept up  looking behind them every so often .  they couldn   t hear anything .      if hunter had noticed that we left  he would have yelled or something     said steve .  he looked at the river  which looked narrow and calm under the gray sky .     i   ll bet it   s running real fast  up in the mountains like this .      steve and jane kept up a good pace .  light rain began to fall again and they moved under the canopy of trees  pulling their cloaks tight around them .  they had heard no sign of hunter .      this should be far enough     said jane  stopping .     let   s radio him .         all right .     steve halted and switched on the radio in the small pin on his cloak .     hunter  this is steve .         steve  i have been calling you and jane     hunter said promptly .     is she with you .         yes .  we hadn   t turned on our radios .  how are vicinius and the wild boar .         vicinius killed it .  what happened to you .         we   re fine  hunter .  i want to go see if mc   is with the romans and i knew vicinius wouldn   t want to go .  we   re going  hunter .         we should remain together .         sorry  hunter .  we   ll contact you again later .  maybe we   ll have mc   with us when we do .     steve shut off his communicator again  so that hunter could not argue with him .      he could follow us     said jane .     we   ve left a real easy trail in this damp ground .         he might     steve said slowly .     hard to say .  certainly we can   t outrun him if he wants to join us .         he won   t want to leave gene behind     she pointed out .     he can   t go faster than gene .         good point .  and vicinius will want to get the boar back to his village .  he can   t carry it alone and hunter won   t reveal that he can  either .         can they carry it together .  all three of them .         maybe .  if they do  that will delay them for a long .  .  .     he was interrupted by the sound of a horn .  it came from the direction where the boar had been .      what was that .     jane jumped in surprise .      vicinius   s horn     said steve .     the one he   s been carrying on a strap .         what   s he doing .  calling his warriors .         i guess so .  or maybe the women of the village and the older men  too .  they could bring a pack animal for the boar .         does that mean hunter is free to follow us .         maybe .  but let   s just go and see if he catches up to us or not .     steve started walking again .      i just don   t want to do what rita did to us on the last mission  when we had to spend all our time trying to find her instead of looking for mc   .         we aren   t doing anything like that     steve said testily .     come on  jane .  she was just out seeing the sights  adventuring on her own .  you and i are looking for mc   and we   re still in touch with hunter .         well  we can   t risk changing history  either .  we   ll have to be more careful than usual without hunter around to remind us .         even hunter has changed his mind  remember .  back in the dinosaur age  he thought that almost any action could change the future drastically .  that hasn   t proved out at all .     he looked at her  blinking drizzle out of his eyes .      yes  i know .     her tone told him that she had run out of arguments  whether she was convinced or not .   soon  up ahead on a nearby slope above them  steve could see part of the twisting mountain road that the romans were using .  the wooden palisade of the roman camp was visible on a ridge and the last of their wagons was just driving through the open gate .  getting to the road would require a tough hike  but at least their route was clear .     in the middle of the afternoon  under a light drizzle  marcus gaius aemilianus had just finished supervising the unloading of the wagons inside the roman camp when he heard a voice calling to him .      tribune .  over here  tribune .     one of the sentries standing at the gate was waving his arm .  the gate was open very slightly .     we have visitors .      marcus frowned .  unexpected visits from the germans here were rare .  however  this was his first assignment as a tribune and finding out what they wanted was one of his duties .   mid afternoon was late in the day for traders .  they usually finished their business in time to return home before sundown .  puzzled  he turned  causing his red cloak to swirl behind him  and walked quickly to the gate .      what is it  flavius .     marcus asked .      this lady is from a trading family in gaul     said flavius  indicating a woman with long  straight brown hair standing in a fur cloak just outside the opening in the gate .     she has become separated from her party and seeks shelter .         good day     said marcus .     i am marcus aemilianus  tribune and personal aide to governor publius quinctilius varus of this province .  you must be in need of shelter .         yes  we are .     she spoke latin with an odd accent .     i am jane maynard and this is my slave  steve .         you are welcome  of course .     marcus stood back and gestured for her to enter .  he had expected to see her slave carrying baggage of some sort .  flavius closed the gate behind the two visitors .     you have no belongings with you .         no .  we  um  were out looking for another friend of ours and got lost .  so when we saw you up here  we decided to ask for your help .         i am glad to be of service .  in this new province  taking care of civilians is a serious duty for those of us in the roman army .  come inside with me  out of this constant drizzle .     he began to walk with them  back toward the officers    tent .   he took another glance at her slave .     where are you from .  not egypt .         no     said steve  with an easy grin as he walked a step behind jane .     from a distant land called    sina .             sina .     marcus shook his head .      have you seen any other strangers .     jane asked .     i mean  neither german nor roman .         this would be the other friend you were seeking .         yes .      marcus shook his head .     no .  but sit down with me and i will have wine warmed for us .  you may describe him to me .        hunter only told vicinius and gene that steve and jane had gone ahead  without elaborating .  however  he had lost several hours by the time the villagers came to fetch the boar that vicinius had killed .  vicinius blew his horn at intervals to make sure they could follow the sound .  then  while they waited  vicinius set to work cleaning and quartering the boar .  hunter and gene helped  taking direction from vicinius .   finally  several of the older men arrived with two old packhorses .  vicinius arranged for the quarters of the boar to be lashed to the horses .  then  at last  he turned to hunter with a big smile .      that boar will feed the village for days .  my friends who were with me yesterday will wish they had been free today  instead .         it was a very dangerous quarry     said hunter .     you are indeed an excellent hunter .  are we ready to continue on our way .         of course     said vicinius cheerfully .     we will go along the river .     he picked up his spear and slipped past hunter .     come on .      hunter and gene followed him .  when they reached the edge of the trees  vicinius ignored steve and jane   s footprints  which turned to the right in the soft earth .  instead  he marched straight out across the narrow flood plain to the edge of the rushing water .      i would like to rejoin steve and jane     hunter said courteously  coming up alongside vicinius .      this is where the footprints of your other friend will be     said vicinius .     along the water .  but if he approached the river from upstream  then steve and jane might cross his tracks coming or going from the forest .  we must move downstream to look for his tracks there .         i am concerned about steve and jane     said hunter .     our party should be together .      vicinius turned to look upstream in the distance .  the wind blew his long  shaggy hair from his face .     the romans are nearby .  if you wish  i will search downstream for you and sound my horn if i find any sign of your friend .         maybe we can go downstream for a little while     said gene .     we have a lot of daylight left .  we can go after steve and jane later .         agreed     said hunter .  he felt some internal stress from the first law  but steve and jane seemed safe for the time being .   vicinius moved down the bank quickly  hopping from rock to rock  over exposed tree roots .  he wasted no time  glancing quickly at the mud or soft sod near the water .  hunter had no trouble keeping up  of course  but he repeatedly waited for gene to find his way over the rough ground .   over their heads  hunter saw the sun only as a slight glow behind the gray clouds .  hunter calculated how much time they would have to reverse direction  catch up to steve and jane  and return to the village .  after more than an hour had passed  they had seen animal tracks leading to the water but no human   s tracks .      i have found something     vicinius said suddenly .  he crouched near the edge of the water .   hunter stood over him  magnifying his vision to examine the details of several partial footprints .      they are unusually small     said vicinius .     and he is barefoot .  this matches what you told me .         yes     said hunter  as he identified the footprints .     these are the footprints of mc   .         really .     gene leaned down to take a good look  leaning on his spear .      he   s moving downstream     said vicinius  standing up .     come on .         what about steve and jane .     gene asked .   hunter looked at the sun again .     if we are going to catch up to steve and jane in time to return to the village together  we have to reverse direction now .      vicinius looked at him in surprise  waiting .      what do you want to do .     gene asked .      the footprints are sharp and clear     hunter continued .     mc   made them earlier today  since the intermittent drizzle has not had time to dull their edges or wash them away .         yes  of course     said vicinius .      we shall catch mc   first     said hunter .  finding mc   was a more pressing first law problem than rejoining steve and jane  who appeared to be in no particular danger .  he followed vicinius  and signaled steve and jane on his internal transmitter .  they did not answer .          wayne lay on the ground in the german village in the drizzle .  the previous night  he had been grabbed by the villagers amid a great deal of shouting and arguing and roughly dragged back to the middle of the village .  in the midst of all the yelling  he had only made out two words .  one tall  hulking young man was named    arminius    and seemed to be in charge .  he called out to a slender  wiry young man named    julius    and then walked away from the crowd of villagers around wayne  uninterested .   when they had realized that wayne could not understand any of what they were saying  julius yanked his arms around a tree trunk  then lashed his wrists together with rawhide thongs .  leaving him out in the rain and cold  the villagers had gone to bed in their huts .   the village dogs barked at wayne and sniffed around him at first  but soon lost interest .  he had not slept  exactly  but he had dozed from exhaustion even as he shivered .  the next morning  in the early dawn light  he discovered that he had been lashed to a tree trunk next to the village refuse heap .  only the cold kept down the smell of rotting waste .   most of the villagers had ignored him as they went about their morning routine .  julius and a few of the other warriors had given him a curious glance  but no more .  some of the children had poked him with sticks to see what he would do  but they  too  had lost interest when he had just stared at them .   afterward wayne had spent most of the day quietly straining at the leather thongs .  he had quickly noticed that the untanned leather binding his wrists was absorbing the steady drizzle that was falling .  when he pulled  no matter how much it hurt his wrists  the thongs stretched slightly .  the more they stretched  the thinner they became  and he gently rubbed them against the rough tree trunk in a sawing motion .  the rawhide thongs were much weaker than finished leather .   he had given up any hope of escaping the village by running away .  all he wanted to do was reach the control unit on his belt .  to survive  he would have to risk going back to room f    in his own time .     as the gray  overcast day slowly darkened into evening  jane sat primly on a rough wooden bench in the governor   s tent .  with an amused smirk  steve was standing attentively behind her against the wall of the tent .  demetrius  the governor   s elderly personal greek slave  who had served dinner  stood behind the governor and steve had decided to imitate him .   governor publius quinctilius varus was hosting her as the guest of marcus  his aide .  the other roman officers were eating in a separate tent .  steve  as jane   s personal slave  was expected to remain in her company .      you were very fortunate to find us     said governor varus .  he was in his early thirties  with short brown hair .  his heavy woolen tunic looked very warm and comfortable .     these barbarians would not know how to behave with a lost lady from gaul .      jane smiled politely and picked daintily at the piece of roasted fowl in front of her .  it smelled very good  and lay on an engraved gold plate  but she was so tense that her appetite was gone .  she was anxious not to say anything that would ruin their masquerade .      oh  you need not be too fearful     said governor varus .     they know their place .  the power of my great uncle has been made clear to them often enough .     he smiled confidently and raised his engraved golden goblet of wine .      your great uncle .         the governor is married to the grandniece of caesar augustus     said marcus .      oh .  um  congratulations .     jane felt her face grow hot  wondering if she should have known that already .      he is a fine man     said governor varus .     his confidence in appointing me was a great honor .     he frowned at jane   s plate .     is the dinner not to your liking .         oh  no  it   s fine .  i   m  uh  just talking too much .     she picked up a piece of meat and bit into it .      tomorrow i shall see that you are reunited with your party     said governor varus .     after all  i cannot have you wandering about unescorted in these rugged mountains .         thank you     said jane .  she wished that steve would join the conversation  but she did not know exactly what the etiquette was concerning slaves .  earlier in the afternoon  marcus had made small talk with her over mulled wine and she had been comfortable with him .  still  she remembered how their historian on the jamaican mission  rita  had caused a great deal of trouble by befriending a young buccaneer .      she is also searching for a lost friend     said marcus .     i told her that i knew of no one of his description .         oh .  and who is your friend .     governor varus gestured slightly with one hand  and demetrius stepped forward with a pitcher to refill his goblet .      well  he  um .  .  .         may i .     steve asked quietly over her shoulder .     oh  yes .  please explain .         he is called mc       said steve  with more courtesy in his voice than jane had ever heard before .      eh .     governor varus laughed and looked up at steve .     what kind of a name is that .         we don   t know .  he is a slave from a far land  touched by the gods .         ah .  i see .     governor varus sipped his wine .     so he is not likely to find his way in the forest on his own .         no  probably not     said steve .     but he is very cooperative .  and no threat to anyone .         and he ran away .         no     said steve quickly .      no .  then what happened .  you were all on horseback  weren   t you .         well .  .  . we lost our mounts .         you what .     governor varus raised his eyebrows mockingly  and caught marcus   s eye .      i needed a private moment     said jane .     in the woods .  that   s why i dismounted .         that   s right     steve said quickly .     i dismounted  too  and mc   was to hold the horses .  he lost them and ran to get them .  we never did catch him .      governor varus just shook his head  still smiling .     the poor fool .         how did he lose them .     marcus asked .     thunder startled them     said steve .      i don   t recall any thunder or lightning today     said marcus thoughtfully .      it was a long way off     said steve .     this dreary land  with its foul cold rains .     governor varus shook his head .     not like autumn in rome  is it  marcus .         no  certainly not  sir .  when we crossed the alps  we left behind the world we knew .      jane suppressed a smile .  these romans  unquestioned masters of their world  had no idea just how big the entire planet was .  she wished she could tell them  just to take their arrogance down a little .      you must be careful in searching for your lost slave     said marcus .      the germans are a simple barbaric people  from what i have seen     said governor varus .     and drusus  the younger stepson of caesar  conquered them many years ago .  so please do not misunderstand .  the danger here is no greater than it would be in your native gaul .         we have only held this province for eighteen years     said marcus .     julius caesar conquered gaul a couple of generations before that .      the governor laughed gently .     ah  marcus .  these people are barbarians .  you expect too much from them .         i   m only suggesting caution     said marcus stiffly .      fair enough  my young friend .  perhaps you should be the one  then  to accompany our guest tomorrow .     governor varus turned to jane .     as my personal aide  his duties are at my whim .  he will see to your needs tomorrow .         that is very kind of you     said jane .      i fear we are not prepared to provide accommodations for a lady     said governor varus .     marcus  what do you suggest .         she may have my tent     said marcus .     my tentmates and i will join the troops .         very well     said governor varus .     send your tentmates to the troops  they are regular officers anyway .  but you will move your cot to my tent .  my aide should not be bunking with common troops .     he looked at jane again .     i am sorry we have nothing better .         thank you  governor     said jane .     that is more than generous .     she thought the conversation had ended when she felt steve surreptitiously kick the back of her stool .  quickly  she tried to remember what she had left out .   when marcus and governor varus turned their attention back to their meals  steve poked her in the back with a stiff finger .  she flinched  and reviewed the conversation she had just had .  they had accommodations for the night  plans for tomorrow  and the friendship of the roman command .   he jabbed her again .   they had food  clothing  shelter .  .  . it was food .  suppressing an embarrassed smile  she looked up at marcus .      is something wrong .     he was puzzled .      uh  steve  my slave  must be very hungry  as well .         demetrius will see to him after he is finished with us     said marcus .   steve let out a barely audible sigh of relief .     at last wayne saw that the rawhide binding his wrists had worn thin .  all day  he had sat at the base of the tree and either pulled on the rawhide or sawed it against the tree trunk .  he was weak from hunger and his wrists had been scraped raw by the effort .   though he was in plain sight of the center of the village  no one seemed to take more than passing notice of him .  certainly no one had bothered to bring him any food .  all day  young men had arrived from the woods  and the man called arminius had spent all his time talking to them .   when wayne knew that one more hard pull would snap the thongs  he paused to organize his thoughts .  he was sure hunter would have a robot waiting back in the bohung institute to apprehend him  but that was better than waiting where he was to freeze or starve .  at least a robot could not let any actual harm come to him .  besides  wayne was very experienced in handling robot logic .   with one more hard yank  he broke the rawhide .  the momentum caused him to fall backward on the ground  and he heard a couple of children call out in surprise .  before they could attract anyone else   s attention  however  he fumbled with stiff  cold  half numb fingers for his belt unit .  as small  light footsteps ran toward him  he triggered it .     hunter tracked mc   with vicinius and gene through most of the afternoon .  he considered attempting radio contact  but that had never accomplished anything with mc   or mc   .  if the component robots shut down their receiving ability  such an attempt was worthless  and if they heard him  they were merely warned of his pursuit .  this time he decided not to give mc   advance notice that he was being followed .   the tracks were fresh  but hunter could not hear mc   moving through the forest ahead .  his lead was still too great .  as a robot  mc   would be able to move quickly through the rough ground  powered by his solar cells but  of course  hunter could more than compensate .  vicinius  as a native of these mountains  also maintained a good pace  but gene was simply not in good enough condition to keep up .  hunter repeatedly had to stop and wait for him .      we must return to the village     said vicinius  halting in a slight clearing to look at the sky .     the night will come on us soon .      gene  who was breathing hard  simply stopped and nodded  leaning against a tree trunk .      agreed     said hunter .     tomorrow i shall return to this spot to pick up the trail again .     he could continue to track mc   and then return to the village at night  but that would ruin his masquerade as a mere trader from gaul .      we are not far from the trail that goes from my father   s village to the village where arminius lives     said vicinius .     this place will be easy to find tomorrow .     he hefted his spear again and changed direction  now heading home .   night was falling by the time the three of them returned to the village .  one large fire in the center of the village illuminated the village instead of the individual cookfires of the previous evening .  the villagers roasted big chunks of boar meat on spits .  they were in a festive mood  and cheered when they saw vicinius .   he waved  laughing  and then stopped to receive the congratulations and thanks of his friends and relatives .  hunter remained where he was  not wanting to interfere .  gene stopped next to him  leaning forward on his knees .      i   ll sleep well tonight     said gene  grinning a little .     i haven   t had a workout like that in years .         you are well  overall .         yeah  i   m okay .  but as soon as i get fed  i   m going right to bed .         hunter     steve said over hunter   s internal receiver .     steve here .  you there .         yes  steve .  where are you .         we   re in the roman camp .         are you well .         we   re just fine .  i   m calling from a tent the roman governor gave jane .         what about you .         oh  i   m her slave  remember .  they expect me to sleep on the floor across the entrance to the tent to protect her  just like you were doing in the village hut last night .         you both feel safe  then .         sure .  and tomorrow  this one guy  a tribune named marcus  is going to take us out to rejoin you .         i think he kind of likes me     said jane  joining in .     from the way he kept looking at me during dinner .         very well .  please contact me in the morning when you can .  i will be out tracking mc   .         you found him .         we have found tracks that match those of mc   and mc   .  i do not know why mc   went to the river where we found the tracks  but they were fresh .  tomorrow i shall resume the search .         all you humaniform robots need a small amount of water  remember .     jane said .     to restore your simulated sweat and saliva  for example .  he may have just needed a drink .         a reasonable conclusion     said hunter .     in any case  the exact reason no longer matters .         we   re signing off     said steve .     it   s time to get some sleep .             wayne found himself back in the darkness of the sphere in room f    .  he was still cold and very hungry  but he knew he would have to concentrate to deal with any robots hunter had assigned to catch him .  stiffly  he opened the door and climbed out into the wonderfully warm room .   one robot was in the room  already walking toward him .      stop and identify yourself     wayne ordered  in as firm a tone as he could muster .      r .  ishihara     said the robot  stopping .      oh  yes .  horatio introduced us before .  i instructed you to help me follow mc governor  didn   t i .         yes .      wayne was immediately encouraged .  ishihara   s responses meant that he had no overriding  general instruction under the second law to ignore wayne   s words to him .     do not contact anyone else from this point on .  now inform me of any and all instructions that pertain to me .         hunter told me to detain and hold you on the basis of the first law danger to the present if you were to return to the past and change it in a significant way .      suddenly wayne remembered that no matter how long hunter was in the past  he could choose to return at the present moment .  wayne rushed to the console that controlled the sphere and threw the main power switch  shutting down the entire system .  then he let out a long breath of relief .      now  then .  ishihara  what other instructions have you received regarding me .         what i have told you summarizes the instructions i received about you .         hunter   s a robot .  his instructions don   t carry the weight of the second law .         no .         you know that mine do .  you will allow my instructions to supersede his .         no .         oh .  why not .         human members of hunter   s team instructed me to obey him .  their orders have the second law behind them .  also  a concern for the first law gives these instructions their true authority with me .         you said the basis for this instruction is a first law problem about changing history .         yes .      wayne paused to think a moment .  he saw a chance to talk ishihara out of following hunter   s orders .     why haven   t you taken me into custody already .         you are in my custody .  you have not tried to leave this room  either by the door or by using the sphere again .  if you return to the sphere and throw the power switch again  i shall forcibly detain you .  if you attempt to pass me to reach the door  i shall do the same .         did you obey me when i told you not to contact anyone else .  or did you transmit a request to security for help .         i obeyed you .         why .         that particular instruction does not contradict any of my other orders .         so at the moment you consider me sufficiently under your control .         yes .      wayne grinned .     i love literal robot logic .  so  that   s why you   re willing to stand there and converse with me .         yes .         so the alleged danger of my changing the past is your primary concern .         it gives the weight of the first law to the orders i received from hunter   s team .         maybe you know that i was in the late cretaceous period .  i didn   t cause any big problems back then  did i .  or when i was in jamaica back in the     s .         i would not know .  only those who travel in time can make that judgment  after they return .  if any changes in the flow of history were made  all those of us who remained within that flow without a break were altered with it .  i would have no way of knowing if the direction of history was any different before you left .         well .  .  . i see .     wayne rubbed his hands to warm them faster .     yes  of course .  but our memories match up pretty well .  so far  you   ve known what i   ve been talking about .  and i understand what you   ve said  too .  right  ishihara .         correct .         so doesn   t that imply that we are still pretty much in an unchanged timestream .         it raises the odds  yes .  of course  you might find substantial changes if you began to follow the news or as your life goes on .         any changes   if they exist at all   seem pretty subtle to me     said wayne .     certainly i don   t have any desire to change history .  after all  ishihara  i want to come back home  too  and find everything the way i knew it to be .  you do understand that  don   t you .         yes .         ishihara  i don   t present any greater danger to the course of history than hunter .  in fact  hunter is back there right now endangering the present .      ishihara said nothing .      do you agree with this conclusion .         i am undecided .         you   re undecided .     wayne sighed .     hunter is a robot  ishihara  that does not mean he is perfect .  and he has humans on his team who are even more imperfect in their reasoning .  if they can go into the past and back without destroying the course of history as we know it  then i can  too .      ishihara remained silent .      you accept this point .         i understand that you have no desire to make changes in history .         and so you understand that i have no more motivation to do that than hunter .  that means that if any of us makes changes  the reason will be a mistake   a misjudgment  an accident  that sort of thing .  right .         yes  that is correct .         logically  then  you also accept that hunter   s party  because it is a larger group  offers more chance of such accidents .  their group threatens to make changes more than i do alone .  you agree with that  too .         yes  that is an inescapably logical conclusion .         so hunter   s instructions to you about grabbing me have no greater weight from the first law than if i ordered you to stop him for the same reason .      ishihara said nothing .   wayne decided to drop that line of argument for a moment and come back to it later .  for now  he was just glad that he seemed to have the robot at a stalemate in the debate .  maybe that meant hunter   s instructions were neutralized .     ishihara  i instruct you to tell me where hunter has taken mc   and mc   .         i do not know for certain .  my own observation of the component robots has been limited to this room .         well .  .  .     wayne thought a moment .  he knew ishihara was now deliberately resisting him by interpreting his instructions in as literal a manner as possible .     look  you may have overheard some conversation or something .  tell me your best estimation of where they are .         mojave center governor   s office .      that struck wayne as a reasonable guess .  since mojave center governor was no longer using it  hunter could have had the office secured without disrupting normal city routine .  however  wayne did not want to risk trying to get there past a security detail of robots .   if he ventured out of the building  he would be moving through a city full of robots .  all of them could be contacted by their communications links in an instant if word went out to apprehend him .  further  he could not possibly debate effectively with each one of them  the way he had managed to do with ishihara so far .  however  if he could just keep ishihara in enough doubt about the authority of hunter   s instructions to control him  he could go back into the past again after mc    where hunter   s team did not have an overwhelming advantage over him .      ishihara  you have agreed with me that hunter   s party is more likely to change the past than i am .  on that basis  the first law no longer supports hunter   s instructions for you to keep me in your custody .  right .         the potential human harm caused by a significant change in history is real .         you   re dodging the question     said wayne .     i repeat  since hunter   s party is a greater danger than i am  hunter   s order for you to grab me but let his group go into the past is irrational and unnecessary .  do you agree .         yes  such an imbalance is not reasonable .         ishihara  being arrested by you or by city security is going to harm me .  right now  i   m extremely hungry and tired and i   m just starting to get warm .  i want to take a nap here and i want you to get me some things .  then i   m going back into the past .  i instruct you to tell me if you will cooperate with me and not reveal to anyone else in any way that i am here .         the first law clearly requires that i help you get food and rest     said ishihara .  he spoke in a monotone that revealed his doubt  but he apparently could not avoid following wayne   s reasoning for the moment .      without giving me away .         yes .         then i want the following .  bring me some hot food and fruit juice to consume now and also a backpack .  in the backpack  i want some general supplies .  i   ll need a large knife  some twine  some rope  a butane lighter  and a mug to drink from .     wayne was not sure exactly what he would need  but these were practical items for a man out in the woods .     also  a small radio  hypnotic sleep courses in latin and ancient german  and some very warm clothes   similar to whatever hunter   s human friends wore .         i shall bring you a small radio disguised as a piece of jewelry  such as hunter used     said ishihara .     he held the opinion that the concept of radio was so far beyond the people of ancient times that finding one was not a great danger .  however  i dare not bring a lighter .         what .  why not .         the people around you certainly understand fire and the desirability of starting one quickly and easily .  any object which causes humans of the past to think along new lines can be the springboard for altering the course of history .         i could be harmed without one  ishihara .  i could freeze to death back there .         you are safe here .  no one is requiring that you return there .  further  warmth is available in some manner back in that time .  the presence of other humans proves that .         all right  all right .  but there must be some kind of compromise  so i don   t have to rub two sticks together out in the woods .  i don   t plan to be around other people and the danger from the cold is real .  old fashioned matches .         i have a suggestion .  i shall bring you a small lighter empty of fluid and a separate container of fluid .  you will keep them separate and only put in enough fluid for each time you must use the lighter .  that way  if you lose them  no one in that time will figure out their combined use by accident .  will you agree to this .         all right .  like i said  i don   t want to mess up our history  either .         these must be paid for .      wayne paused .  he could not authorize payment through his own account without revealing his presence .  on the other hand  he could not return to those wild german mountains without these items .      all right     said wayne slowly  glancing at one of the desks on the far side of the room .     through the computer console  i can authorize you to make payments against my account .  however  i will use my number only .  you are not to mention my name in any way .         acknowledged .         all right .  please don   t waste any time .      ishihara left the room and wayne wondered if his plan was going to work .  the robot   s reliability depended on his interpretations of wayne   s arguments and he might still change his mind .  also  wayne had no way of knowing how thorough hunter had been in setting alarms for wayne   s capture .   it was not impossible that city security had been alerted to watch for any activity in wayne   s account .  in this fully computerized city  which he had designed himself  he knew that all such records would flow through the city computer .  for the moment  wayne could only hope that no such alert had been placed into the system .   despite his worry  he was exhausted .  he stretched out on a couch and closed his eyes  warm enough for the first time since he had left jamaica .  in minutes  he had dozed off .     steve found that the next day dawned just as gray and drizzly as the one before .  marcus hosted jane and steve at breakfast in the governor   s tent .  demetrius served them again  though governor varus was elsewhere in the camp already .  after breakfast  marcus had his groom bring out three horses for them .      i haven   t ridden in a long time     jane whispered to steve .     i hope this goes okay .      steve was looking at the saddles .  they had no stirrups .  he saw that all three were the same .  so were the other saddles he could see  being polished nearby .      this one is for the lady     said marcus  holding the bridle of a bay mare .      i   ll give you a leg up     said steve  holding his hands for jane to brace her lower leg on them .  when she did so  he lowered his voice to a whisper .     i don   t think they   ve invented stirrups .  hang on with your knees the best you can .      steve raised her up and she threw her other leg over the saddle  with her long tunic and all .  she shifted her weight to settle into the saddle .  then marcus handed her the reins .      you all right .     steve asked  stepping back .      i   m fine .     jane nodded reassuringly to marcus .     so far     she added .   the groom gave marcus a leg up the same way .  the tribune swung the reins around and headed for the gate  nodding to jane .  with an uncomfortable glance over her shoulder at steve  she joined him .   steve was left with the third mount .  the groom was walking away  obviously with no intention of giving a leg up to a slave .  steve glanced around but saw nothing he could use to climb up on the horse .   marcus had not bothered to look back for a slave  either .   steve put both hands on the saddle and jumped as high as he could  leaning forward over the saddle .  then he swung his leg over .  at this point  he was half lying crookedly over the horse   s back  but at least he was on it .  he grabbed the reins and shifted to a normal position  then hurried after marcus and jane  grinning self consciously .   the sentries were just swinging open the main gate .  by the time marcus and jane rode out  steve had trotted up right behind them .  without a pause  they left the safety of the roman camp .  jane sneaked another worried glance back over her shoulder and steve winked .   a light rain began to fall as they rode out into the forest .  steve pulled his cloak tighter around him .  it looked like a long  wet day .          in the german village the next morning  hunter and gene joined vicinius around the embers of the bonfire from the night before .  they ate more hot pork stew for breakfast  and vicinius still received congratulations from other villagers for his kill .  hunter looked up from his bowl .      we must not impose on you further     hunter said to vicinius .     we have found mc     s tracks now .  i can follow them today .  you must have business of your own .  and gene is not used to mountains like these .  he can rest in the village today .      vicinius shook his head .     i must take advantage of my good fortune .  yesterday  the gods were with me .  maybe today i can find another boar  or maybe a deer .  i will hunt again today and accompany you .         perhaps you would do better without us     said hunter .     one man can move more quietly than three .         nonsense     said vicinius  grinning broadly .     you brought me my luck .  we shall go together .      hunter could not think of anything else to say .  he wanted to pursue mc   alone because  as a robot  he could go much faster when he was free to use all his speed and strength .  however  he was also reluctant to risk insulting vicinius by rejecting his company .  he merely nodded and finished his breakfast .      i   ll go with you     said gene quietly .     as long as he   s going with you  anyway .  our team has split up into two groups already  that   s plenty .         thank you     said hunter .     that is wise .     vicinius wrapped cooked boar meat in leaves to take with them .  as rain began to fall  they drew their cloaks around them and hefted their spears .  vicinius led the way once again through the forest .   hunter attempted calling steve and jane  but received no answer .  he assumed that their receivers were turned off because they were in the company of romans who might overhear them  so he did not worry about them for now .  they could call him when they had some privacy .   they spent about an hour walking to the spot where they had left the trail of mc   the evening before .  under the lush canopy of trees  the light rain had not yet washed out the tracks .  both vicinius and hunter were able to spot broken twigs and leaves where mc   had passed  which no amount of rain would alter .  gene did not complain  but hunter could see by his movements that he was sore as a result of the long hike during the previous day .   they were still tracking mc   at midday when hunter heard the movements of fourteen other men in the forest nearby .  at first he said nothing  not wanting to reveal the keenness of his hearing to vicinius .  when he saw vicinius watching the movement of birds in the trees in the distance over the location of the strangers  hunter knew that vicinius was also aware of them .      we have company  eh .     hunter said  pointing to some birds suddenly fluttering away from tree branches .      yes     said vicinius .     other hunters  perhaps .         could they be romans .     gene asked .   vicinius shook his head .     the romans always want to march in large numbers when they can .  their small patrols are on horseback and make a lot of noise .  only germans move through the forest as quietly as these people approaching us .         should we speak with them .     hunter asked .     are they from another village .         they must be .     vicinius raised the horn he carried and blew into it  once .  immediately  a similar horn answered him from the other party .  he lowered his horn and smiled .     we do not want them mistaking us for deer .      the strangers appeared soon .  they had the same general physical appearance and clothing as the people of vicinius   s village  being stocky  mostly blond  and dressed in furs .  their leader  a young blond man with a barrel chest and short arms and legs  nodded in greeting without smiling .      hail  vicinius .         hail  julius .         who are these strangers .     julius demanded .      traders from gaul .  hunter and gene .      hunter nodded formally .     i give you greeting .         romans .     julius turned and spat .      not romans     said hunter .     we are gauls .         romans    dogs  then     julius said with a sneer .     vicinius  what are you doing with them .  at a time like this .         we are hunting     vicinius said simply  with no apology in his tone .      we have no interest in what the roman army does     said hunter .     we are traders in silver .         we are also seeking a lost friend of theirs     said vicinius .     a man touched by the gods  lost in the forest .      julius tensed  his face hardening as he glanced again at hunter .  the men with him also looked at hunter and gene with alarm .     some sort of demon came to our village last night .  or a man touched by evil spirits .         what sort of demon .     vicinius asked .      he came at night in the form of a strange man in strange clothes     said julius .     we tied him in the village .  this morning  right before the eyes of some of the villagers  he vanished .         a bad omen     vicinius agreed  his voice low with awe .     has he brought evil to your village .  are people sick or have your animals died .         not yet     said julius grimly .     but i expect they will .  and the omen may mean even more .     he glared suspiciously at hunter again .      what do you mean .     vicinius asked .      this is no business for strangers     said julius .     but you know what i mean .  are you joining us soon  vicinius .  you and the other men of your village .      vicinius hesitated  also looking uncomfortably at hunter and gene .      we are only traders     said hunter .     we have no concern for your private business .         and roman business .     julius demanded  shaking his long blond locks away from his face .      we care nothing for roman business .      julius studied hunter   s face for a moment  then turned back to vicinius .     arminius has sent out the order already today .  i have brought my companions in this direction in search of the demon who escaped our village .  but we will not waste too much time on him .  tell your village the time has come .         i will     said vicinius .   julius nodded and turned away  leading his men into the forest the way they had come .      think it was mc   .     gene asked hunter quietly .      no     said hunter  changing to english .     to my knowledge  the component robots have no ability to trigger the sphere and journey again through time  which would explain this man   s simply vanishing .  it must have been dr .  wayne nystrom .  he probably returned to the institute  where ishihara took custody of him .         oh .  well  that   s good .  we won   t have to worry about him any more .      vicinius was listening with a puzzled expression .     julius seems to believe this evil spirit may be the man you seek .         maybe     said hunter quickly .     this man is no demon  however .  he will not return .         how do you know so much about him .         he is an old adversary of ours     said hunter .     a man  not a demon .         how did he escape that village by simply vanishing .         he   s a trickster     said gene .  hunter turned in surprise .      a trickster .     vicinius asked .      to amuse people around a campfire .  someone who can make jokes and tie knots that come undone again .         this is all .     vicinius still sounded skeptical .      he was no demon  vicinius     said hunter .     but julius seems to think you have more pressing business than hunting today .  do you wish to return to your village .         no     said vicinius slowly .     julius met me by chance .  they will have sent any message that must reach my village by another messenger already .  i will not let julius ruin our hunt .         even concerning roman business .     hunter asked  keeping his tone casual .      prince arminius will tend to that     said vicinius .  then he glanced around again for the trail of mc   .     wayne dozed fitfully until he heard the sound of the door opening .  nervously  he jerked awake and found ishihara returning with a very large  bulging backpack on his back and two sealed containers in his hands .  wayne pushed himself up on the couch and took a couple of deep breaths .      i have what you wish     said ishihara  setting the containers down on the couch next to him .     this is your meal .  but i have been thinking about the extent of my cooperation with you and the fact that hunter   s instructions and yours are in contradiction .     he slipped off the backpack and carefully placed it on the floor by the couch .      yeah .  what of it .     wayne picked up one of the containers and started to open it .      i am no longer accepting hunter   s argument without question  but i cannot accept yours fully  either .      wayne tensed  watching him carefully .     then where do you stand .         i shall offer a compromise .         all right  what is it .         you will take me with you .         what .     wayne was shocked .  this was one possibility he had not considered .      you have raised reasonable doubts about hunter   s arguments concerning you  but i am not entirely convinced that your judgment is sound .  in return for my aiding your journey  you will take me with you into the past so that i can see the situation for myself .      wayne tried to think of an objection  but none came to him .  maybe he was just too tired .  then again  maybe no reasonable objection existed .      all right     wayne said slowly .     with a couple of concessions on your part .  i instruct you to cooperate with me and not to contact hunter for any reason unless i specifically order you to .  as i understand it  your concern is about the first law challenge of changing history  either by hunter or me .         or mc   .         yeah .  him  too .  but if hunter   s instructions carry no first law weight with you  then the second law requires that you obey me  instead .  tell me if you accept this .         at present  yes .         what will change it .         if  upon observation in the past  i come to believe you are making changes in the course of history  then the first law will override your instructions  of course .         of course .     wayne sighed .     all right .  i need more sleep before we go .  i   ll set up the hypnosis courses in latin and ancient german to run while i take a real nap .  while i   m doing that  you access the same language information and arrange clothes for yourself   what did you bring me  anyway .         long woolen tunics and cloaks of the same sort hunter used .  also leather boots and leggings .  the lapel pin communicator i mentioned .         good .  come to think of it  ishihara .  .  .         yes .         while you   re accessing data  pick up a number of other major languages   all you can manage efficiently in your memory .  we may want some others in the future .         agreed .         and leave that sphere and the console shut off while i   m sleeping .     he turned his attention to the food containers again .     what did you bring me .  i   m starved .        by midday  marcus had reached the bank of the river with his guest and her slave .  he had explained to her that a man wandering lost in the forest would seek water .  jane had agreed and so they had ridden to the river .  damp from the light but steady downpour from the gray skies  they had huddled under some trees for a cold noonday meal before riding on .   while they moved down the river  the roman legions were marching deeper into the forest on the governor   s business .  marcus knew their route and roughly how far the legions would go in one day through the rugged mountains .  late in the day  he planned to locate their camp in order to rejoin them .   marcus led jane and her slave downstream  keeping a close lookout for footprints near the water .  he also kept sneaking glances at jane  whom he found extremely attractive  though the hood of her cloak hid her face unless she turned to look directly at him .  if he could find her lost friend  she might be grateful  at the very least  it would make a good impression on her .  he had never known a woman from gaul  however  and conversation with her was difficult .  she was polite  but reluctant to answer questions about her life in gaul .   in the middle of the afternoon  marcus reined in by the bank .     i have a number of footprints here     he said  pointing to the ground .     one set is quite large .  another is very small and barefoot  and two more are of average size .  one is wearing the leather boots of a german warrior .     the edges of the tracks had been blunted and blurred by the rain  but the outlines were still complete .   jane rode up to look .  then she looked back over her shoulder at her slave .     what do you think .      her slave rode up to join them and examined the footprints .  then he pointed to the trail the tracks made back into the forest .     i think the small ones are mc    all right .         so some people are with him     said marcus .     at least one german is among them .         or he   s being followed     said jane  looking pointedly at steve .   marcus did not understand the meaning of that look .      or it   s a coincidence     said steve .     maybe they all just wanted some water .         in any case  we have his trail     said marcus .     we can follow him from here .         good     said jane .     how old do you think the tracks are .         no older than yesterday     said marcus .     otherwise the rain would have washed them out completely by now .      she glanced at her slave again  who nodded agreement .      the horses need a rest and a drink of water .  we   ll rest here before we leave the river .     marcus dismounted and dropped his reins to the ground .  his mount moved to the river and began to drink     all right .     jane brought her mount to a jerky halt .     i could use another break .         may i .     marcus moved to her side and held out his arms .      yes  thank you .      as she dismounted  he caught her gently and eased her to the ground  as he done on their earlier stops .      we have company     said her slave  remaining on horseback .  he nodded toward the forest .   marcus turned to look .  a party of young german warriors was emerging from the trees  led by a young blond man with a barrel chest and short arms and legs  wearing the usual furs of his people .  marcus realized suddenly that he had not been paying adequate attention to the birds in the forest  they would have revealed the presence of people moving toward the river from another direction .  anxiously  he watched the germans approach .   the strangers were merely walking toward them  neither running nor fanning out to trap them against the river .  still  as a precaution  he offered a leg up to jane again  who mounted without a word .  then he took the reins of his own horse again and mounted .      hail  roman     called the leader of the germans in latin .  he stopped  holding up his free hand  and his companions stopped also .      hail  friend     said marcus .     i am called julius in your language .  we are of the cherusci tribe .  who are you .         i am tribune marcus gaius aemilianus .         you are a long way from the roman legions here  tribune     said julius .      yes  we are     said marcus .     are you out on a hunt today .  how has your luck run so far .         we are not hunting so hard today     said julius  with a crooked smile .     we have been visiting with friends in other villages .  maybe tomorrow we shall go hunting in earnest .  but how about yourself .  this is a poor  wet day to go for a ride along the river with a lady .         we are searching for a lost stranger     said marcus .     a small fellow  touched by the gods .      julius frowned .     apparently this is a good day for such a search .     he raised his hand in farewell .     good day  roman .     he turned and led his men back toward the trees .      farewell  julius .     marcus watched them go  puzzled by their visit .      what do you think they wanted .     jane rode up next to him .     they didn   t really say anything .         i don   t know for certain     said marcus .     however  the cherusci do not just go out for long walks without a reason .  if i had to guess  i would say they are watching to see if i am carrying some sort of message .  i think we had better rejoin the legions .  i apologize  but it   s important for your own safety .         of course .      marcus turned his mount to go back the way they had come .  then he reined up in surprise .  steve was nowhere in sight .           steve had felt a surge of alarm at the sight of the armed german warriors .  when they had appeared  he had not yet dismounted and had dutifully remained behind marcus and jane .  even though the germans had not advanced in a threatening manner  he knew that the german rebellion against the romans would be starting at any time .   steve had decided to contact hunter immediately .  that required moving away from marcus and the germans .  while marcus and jane had concentrated all their attention on the strangers  steve had quietly turned his horse on the soft  damp earth and ridden at a walk into the trees .  then he had switched on his lapel communicator .      steve calling hunter     he said quietly  as marcus spoke to the german leader out by the riverbank .     you within hearing  hunter .         i hear you  steve     said hunter immediately .     are you in trouble .         not yet     said steve  keeping his voice low .     but some german warriors are wandering around here .  i think the rebellion is moving right along .  we probably should rejoin you  but we have a roman tribune with us .  i think he may want to go find the rest of the roman army .         where are you .         we   re at the riverbank  right where it looks like you and gene and vicinius found mc     s tracks .  those are your tracks  aren   t they .         yes .  we are on his trail with vicinius .         you getting close .         yes .  his trail is very fresh .  from his course  vicinius believes he has already smelled the woodsmoke from another village of the cherusci  the one where prince arminius lives .  i hope to catch him there .         what do you want to do  hunter .         i know where to look for mc   now .  to reduce risk  we must reunite the team so that i can protect all of you .  if you three follow mc     s tracks away from the river  i can intercept you .         i see jane and marcus mounting up .  i   m sure we   re going to find the roman legions .         vicinius will not go there     said hunter .     nor can i tell him that gene and i are going there .  we must maintain our good relations with vicinius .  however  we shall move toward the river now and come closer to you .  leave the roman and meet us if you can do so without harming your relationship with him .  we should also maintain a good rapport with the romans .         well .  .  . i   ll try     said steve .      hunter out .      steve rode back out of the trees to rejoin jane and marcus .  she looked relieved  but marcus scowled at him with disgust .  steve understood .  the tribune assumed that he had been hiding from the germans out of cowardice .      we   re going to join the governor again     said jane  looking at steve with a puzzled expression .   he tapped his lapel communicator unobtrusively and she nodded slightly .      it   s not safe to stay out here alone among the cherusci     said marcus sternly .     we must ride away immediately .      steve was not sure exactly how a slave would speak to his owner in this time .  he just spoke naturally  picking his words to disguise his meaning from marcus .     other members of our original party are coming this way .  we should rejoin them  especially if danger is coming .         how do you know .     marcus glanced at him  then looked into the forest .     i see no sign of anyone .         i  uh  heard them .      marcus studied his face  obviously unconvinced .     perhaps you heard more germans .         i am willing to wait for them here     said steve  looking at jane pointedly .     if you wish to go on  we can follow your tracks to the camp later .         i strongly recommend that your slave come with us     said marcus .      well .  .  .     jane hesitated .      i suggest that i stay here     said steve  fingering his lapel pin again .      all right .     jane turned to marcus .     he will be fine .  let   s go .      marcus nodded and kicked his mount into a trot .  jane did the same .  watching them go  steve hoped he had made the right move .     hunter stopped on the trail of mc   .     vicinius .         huh .     in the lead  vicinius turned to look back over his shoulder .      i would like to head back toward the river .         you would .  why .     he grinned .     if you are thirsty  open your mouth and look up .  the rain is light  but it keeps falling .     he laughed .     or we could return to the small stream that flows near the village .      hunter smiled politely at the joke .     perhaps we should not just keep following the track of mc   .  he will need water again .  maybe we can intercept him .     he looked at gene  unable to explain his conversation with steve in front of vicinius .      omens     said gene .     the omens suggest it .     he started to grin  but turned away so vicinius would not see him .   hunter knew gene must have guessed that hunter had received a message on his internal receiver .      i see no omens     said vicinius  looking around at the trees .     but i see a very clear  recent track from this man called mc   .  why not just stay on his track .         the omens i have read suggest that we return to the river     said gene .     would you indulge us  vicinius .      vicinius hesitated  looking around .  he was clearly confused  but of course this search was their concern  not his .  finally he shrugged .     as you wish  hunter .  maybe i will find another boar down by the river again .  since mc   has been wandering aimlessly .         thank you .     hunter waited while vicinius changed direction and took the lead once again .     wayne and ishihara arrived well away from the location of the german village where he had been held captive .  both were well bundled in woolen tunics  leggings  and cloaks  their feet in padded leather boots .  ishihara had left the backpack behind in their own time  however  because it was made of synthetic material that did not exist in this time .  instead  he had prepared a leather bag with a shoulder thong in which to carry the supplies wayne had told him to gather .  each of them was prepared to speak in latin and wayne was finally well rested and fed .      monitor all the frequencies on your internal receiver     wayne said to ishihara  looking around at the dense forest .     i don   t have my bearings yet  but we might pick something up between hunter and his team members .      ishihara nodded .      i   m almost back where i started     said wayne  looking around in the forest .     when i first got here i was lost  and now i   m lost again .  the only difference is that i   m not freezing to death and i have your company .         which way do you want to go .         i don   t know .     wayne picked a direction at random and started walking .     let   s try this way .         i have a signal     said ishihara suddenly .      what .  already .         hunter and steve are communicating by radio .         what are they saying .     wayne felt a surge of excitement .     come on .         they have not finished yet     ishihara said blandly .  he turned slowly in a circle .      well .     wayne demanded anxiously .      hunter is that way .     ishihara extended one arm .     steve is that way .     pointing with his other hand  he made an angle roughly ninety degrees .      which one is closer .         steve .         how do you know .         hunter   s communication link is powered by the same solar converters on his skin that drive the rest of his body .  that energy source is far more powerful than the tiny solar collector on steve   s lapel pin .  however  the signal i am receiving from steve is much stronger .         i see .  what else have you learned .         from the content of their conversation  he is apparently near a river .         all right     said wayne  forcing his tone to be light and casual .     can you adjust my lapel communicator to the frequency hunter is using .         yes .         good .  show me .     he unpinned it and handed it to ishihara .   the robot opened the back and made a slow  careful movement with a fingernail .     did you see .         yes .  but when you and i communicate  we should use a different frequency  so they don   t intercept us by chance .  how do we do that .         i suggest one full revolution of this little dial .  that will be sufficiently different to eliminate any accidental reception .  of course  if he suspects the presence of our communicators  he can monitor the full bandwidth  as i did .         right .         here you are .      wayne took his pin back and closed it again .     thanks .  let   s go see steve .         this way  then .     ishihara lowered his arms and began picking his way through the trees and underbrush .   wayne followed him  deeply relieved to have the resources and company of a robot now .  during the first two trips back in time  he had been alone  competing with a team of humans led by a robot .  this time the odds were more balanced .   wayne and ishihara hiked through the forest without speaking for some time .  the rain fell intermittently but wayne was so well bundled up that he no longer cared about the dampness and the brisk air .  they worked their way down a steep slope and soon wayne glimpsed the river through the trees ahead of them under the gray sky .      wait a minute     said wayne quietly .     you think steve is real close .         yes .  he agreed to wait for hunter in the spot where he was during their communication .         i instruct you to find him and point him out to me without alerting him to our presence .         why .         i don   t feel i have to answer that .         i must be convinced that your motives are honest     said ishihara .      incorrect     said wayne .     you must only be convinced that i will not violate the first law in any way .  do you know of any reason i would harm steve .         no .         do you know of any reason that my interaction with steve here  with no germans around  could change the future .         no  but i consider your motives suspect .      wayne fought to control his impatience .     i repeat  ishihara  do you know of any specific reason that my locating steve without his knowledge would violate the first law .         no  i know of no specific reason .         then follow my instructions .         agreed .     ishihara moved forward  now taking the time to go quietly .   wayne followed him at a short distance .  even before ishihara said anything  he heard the clop of horse   s hooves .  then ishihara stopped and pointed through the trees .   steve was walking his horse toward the river  where it lowered its head to drink .      all right     wayne whispered .     leave the shoulder bag  i   ll take it .  now i want you to go in the other direction  where hunter will be coming from .  do not contact him or allow him to become aware of your presence in any way .  will you do as i say .         yes .  you have further instructions  i assume .     ishihara slipped the long thong of the leather bag from his shoulder and lowered it gently to the ground .      i sure do     said wayne .     on the way  look for any sign of mc   .  if you don   t see any  wait for hunter to go by .  see if mc   is with him .  if he is  follow them back this way .  if not  then look for mc     s trail .  track him and apprehend him if you can .  remember  he   s probably the biggest danger to the future under the first law .         agreed .         and don   t call me  or some of the locals might hear you .  when i   m ready  i   ll call you .  but do monitor both hunter   s frequency and ours .  all right .         yes .         then get going .      ishihara quietly crept away through the underbrush .   steve was standing next to his mount at the bank  gazing out across the gray river .  his horse seemed to be thirsty  it was still drinking .  steve glanced at the animal  shifted his weight  and idly gave it a pat on the shoulder .   wayne pulled open the drawstring on the leather bag and took out a small coil of rope .  it was rough  narrow hemp  one centimeter in diameter .  he had to wait until ishihara was out of earshot  because what he planned to do would not pass ishihara   s interpretation of the first law .   while he waited  he unwound the five meters of rope .  he tied a large loop in one end of the rope with a slipknot and carefully coiled the remainder .  then he watched steve in silence .   when the horse had finally had enough river water  it turned toward the trees .  still holding the reins  steve let it walk from the bank to the edge of the forest  a short distance from where wayne squatted in the underbrush .  the horse reached up to munch on some leaves .   steve leaned forward  his back toward wayne  to tie the reins to the trunk of a sapling .   wayne took a good look at him .  steve was considerably younger and certainly in better condition  but he was shorter  lighter  and totally unprepared for wayne .  this was the best chance wayne was likely to get .  his heart pounding  wayne stretched the loop behind his hands and suddenly rose up .  in a half crouch  he ran toward steve through the underbrush .  he dodged a couple of trees  ducked under a branch  and raised his arms as steve whirled around in surprise .   before steve could dodge away  wayne yanked the loop down over his head and shoulders  pinning his arms against his torso  inside his fur cloak .  steve threw himself to the ground in the direction of the river  pulling away from wayne and wriggling to loosen the loop .   wayne grabbed the long end of the rope and jerked on it  tightening the loop .  then  skipping out of the way of steve   s kicking legs  he moved down and quickly wound the rope around his booted ankles .  steve kept thrashing  but wayne pulled the rope tight and quickly looped it around a small tree trunk .  then  with the rope braced there  he tied a half hitch in the rope and leaned against the tree  catching his breath .           steve stopped thrashing around and eyed wayne coldly .     well  dr .  nystrom .  i wondered if we   d see you here .         i don   t hurt people     said wayne  embarrassed .     all i want is the right to examine my own creation .         i don   t have him .         hunter might .         yeah  so .         i   m sure you know the first law of robotics as well as i do .     wayne   s breath was coming back now .      meaning what .         figure it out yourself .      steve hesitated .     so i   m a hostage .  you   re going to trade me for mc   if hunter gets him .      wayne shrugged .  he didn   t like the term  but it was true .  only now that he had steve  he had to figure out how to handle him .      well .     steve demanded .   wayne ignored him .  he checked the knot  which was tight  and moved away into the brush  picking up the leather bag on his way .  when he was out of steve   s hearing  he unpinned his communicator and made sure he was using the frequency that he and ishihara had agreed on .  then he carefully pinned it back on again .      wayne calling ishihara .         ishihara here .         have you found hunter .         yes  i can hear him talking with two other people in the distance .  i am hiding from him in the forest now  as you instructed .  he and his party should pass me soon on their way to meet steve .         do you know if mc   is with him .         according to the discussion i have overheard  they have not located or even seen mc   yet .  however  they feel that his trail is very fresh .      wayne did not want to try convincing ishihara that keeping steve tied up was acceptable under the first law .  it was almost certainly impossible .  that meant he could not let ishihara learn that he was holding steve captive .      follow your previous instructions     said wayne .     avoid hunter and pursue mc   on your own when you can .  i   ll call you again later .  acknowledge .         acknowledged .      wayne shut off his communicator and returned to steve .  he found that steve had rolled and wriggled close to the tree to which the free end of the rope was tied  but he had not been able to get up .  the rope was too tight around his ankles  and of course his arms were still pinned .      now what .     steve demanded .   wayne decided not to answer .  instead  he walked over to the horse  which was still patiently cropping leaves .  wayne untied its reins and led it back to steve .  then he loosened the rope from the tree and unwound steve   s ankles .      you can get up and walk with me after i   m on the horse     said wayne .  holding the free end of the rope in one hand and the reins in the other  he prepared to mount but stopped when he saw no stirrup .      what   s wrong .     steve   s voice had a lilt of amusement .   wayne looked allover the saddle .      something wrong .         what did you do .  where are the stirrups .     wayne turned to look down at him .      it never had any stirrups     said steve .     i don   t think the romans know about them .     he snickered .     kind of a chore to get on board  isn   t it .      wayne still did not want to talk to him any more than necessary .  he was not sure whether to trust him  either .  however  the saddle clearly had no stirrups .      you know  that horse can walk a lot faster than i can .  its legs are too long for me .  i won   t be able to keep up for very long .      wayne suddenly realized that was true .     all right  we   ll ride double .  you mount up first .         i can   t  with my arms pinned like this .      wayne looked around for a moment and then nodded toward a large rock .     get up there .  i   ll help you .  but i   m keeping a good grip on this rope .         so i see .     steve sat up and awkwardly got to his feet .  he walked to the rock and from there  he was high enough to lean on the horse   s back and start swinging his right leg over .   when steve started to slip  wayne steadied his shoulders and made sure he caught his balance .  then wayne mounted behind him  still holding the reins .  the position was very awkward  but it would do .   wayne turned the horse downstream and nudged it into a fast walk .  hunter was probably not too close yet  but wayne wanted to get a good lead on him as soon as possible .  if ishihara could grab mc    then wayne would not need steve  if hunter found mc   first  wayne could trade steve for him .  he smiled as they rode through the cold rain .     as jane rode with marcus  the rain grew heavier .  she remembered that gene had told her this was the rainy season  but she was hoping the clouds might break for at least a short time .  the sky showed nothing but darkening clouds in every direction .   marcus said little  often leading her single file through the dense trees .  they finally reached a narrow road  churned to mud by a combination of constant rain and drizzle and thousands of marching feet and the wagon wheels of the baggage train .  long before she could see the roman army  she could hear the pounding of axes as they chopped trees .  listening to the sound  she realized that calling steve while she was surrounded by romans would be difficult .      marcus .         yes .         i  uh  need a moment in the forest .  in private .         we   re only a short distance from the camp .  the latrine there will be dry .         i   ll only be a minute .     not wanting to argue  she turned her mount away into the trees  bending low to avoid branches .  when marcus was out of hearing  she switched on her communicator .     steve .  jane here .  can you still hear me .      when she received no response  she waited a minute or so and tried again .  she realized that he might have turned off his lapel pin because some local people were around  but she was worried .  when they had separated  she had assumed that hunter would simply join steve soon and then the entire team would meet at the roman fort .  certainly steve   s veiled comments to her and marcus had clearly told her that he wanted to wait there  alone if necessary .  however  if steve had been forced to turn off his communicator  that meant something unforeseen had occurred .   after trying a third time with no response  she turned her communicator off again and rode back to marcus .      don   t worry     said marcus  with a grim smile .     shelter and a warm fire are waiting for us .         i can   t go on     said jane .     i   m worried about steve .  i have to go back for him .         what .     marcus frowned sternly .     i warned you he should come with us .  now i have to report to the governor that a party of cherusci was wandering around looking for trouble .  i should do that without delay .      jane nodded .  she did not want to interfere with marcus   s normal behavior .     i   ll ride back alone .  our track is clear  so i can   t get lost .         no .  you will have to come back to the fort with me .  i do not have time to wait and i cannot allow you to take that risk .  your slave will probably be fine .      she knew that he was being completely reasonable  at least from his own viewpoint .  however  she had already decided that leaving steve had been a mistake .  the more the team separated  the worse everything seemed to get .  without any other argument to offer  she simply turned her mount and kicked him into a canter  back down the muddy road .     ishihara had waited motionlessly as he hid in the forest to one side of mc     s track .  hunter had not been using his communicator  but ishihara had heard his party as they hiked through the forest toward him .  they had not spoken as they had passed .  ishihara had recognized hunter and gene  of course  and had seen that their companion was a local .   as soon as they had passed  he had followed mc     s trail through the forest .   woodsmoke trailed low among the trees in the light rain and reached him about the same time as the sounds of children playing .  he stopped on the outskirts of a village  not sure what to do next .  from another hiding place in the trees and underbrush  he saw the small component robot  wearing a loincloth fashioned of leafy branches and vines  standing in the village gesturing to some laughing villagers .  mc   apparently could not speak their language .   ishihara wanted to confer with wayne  but his instructions had been clear .  he would have to wait until wayne contacted him .  ishihara turned up his hearing  to stay alert for anyone approaching him  and sat down to wait and watch mc   .  at least he finally had mc   in sight .     wayne watched the darkening sky uncomfortably as he rode behind steve .  the rain fell in a light but steady gray haze .  wayne clearly did not have time to get mc   that night  so he would have to spend another night out in the woods in the rain .  this time  at least  he possessed enough clothes and food to be reasonably comfortable .   finally wayne decided he would have to stop and make camp before darkness fell completely .  first  however  he dismounted and carefully tied both the reins and the rope holding steve securely to a tree .  then he moved into the brush  out of steve   s hearing .      don   t mind me     steve shouted derisively after him .     i   ll just wait right here for you .         ishihara .  wayne here     he said quietly .      yes  wayne .         have you made any progress .  and where are you .         yes .  i have located mc   .         where .     wayne   s heart pounded with excitement .     can you grab him .         not yet .  he has gone into a village and pantomimed for help .  the villagers laughed at him  but i think they believe he is crazy or perhaps retarded .  someone tossed him an old tunic to wear and i can see him sitting in the village now .  the children are trying to play with him  but he will not respond .         just go in and snatch him .         i dare not .  i would risk harming humans who i believe would try to defend him .         then go in and claim him as your slave     wayne said urgently .     you speak german and he doesn   t .  they   ll have to take your word for it .         if they are not persuaded  then i shall have revealed my presence for nothing .  that may be unwise .         well  then how do you want to handle it .         for now  i shall observe him further     said ishihara .     i shall act when i am most comfortable under the laws in doing so .         all right .  i can   t argue with that     wayne said reluctantly .     give me some idea of which direction you went .  i   m going to make camp for the night near the river .  you get hold of mc   and we   ll join up tomorrow .         agreed .     ishihara described his route after he had left wayne .      good .  signing off .     wayne suppressed a smile as he switched off his communicator and returned to steve .  if he had had the help of a robot during his first two missions  he might have succeeded then .      have a nice visit with the underbrush .     steve sneered .   wayne was in a better mood now and ignored his tone .  leaving the rope tied to the tree  he moved cautiously to steve   s side .  he saw that the loop still held steve   s upper arms tightly against his torso .     i   ll help you down .         sounds good to me .     steve swung his leg over the horse and jumped to the ground  where wayne steadied him .     all right  now what .         i   m going to see if i can get a fire started for the night  even though everything seems drenched .         good luck     steve said doubtfully .     look  at least untack the horse and hobble him .  he shouldn   t be tied up that way all night .      wayne paused .  he didn   t know if steve could get loose  but he was sure that it was possible somehow unless he was careful .  however  unsaddling the horse would make steve   s escape on horseback less likely  so wayne did not doubt his motive for making this suggestion .      yeah .  that   s true .     wayne looked at the bridle for a moment .  it had an ordinary buckle on the side of the horse   s head .  carefully  he unbuckled it and found that he could slide the bridle easily over the animal   s ears and off its head .  then he studied the strap that ran under the horse   s abdomen to hold the saddle in place .      ignore the wide part     said steve .     that   s the girth .  just loosen the cinch   that narrow leather strap up by the bottom edge of the saddle .      wayne found the strap  which had been threaded in and out of a metal ring .  when he pried the strap loose  the cinch and girth fell to the ground .  then he grabbed the saddle and pulled it off .       all afternoon  while riding with wayne  steve had flexed his arm muscles and unobtrusively strained against the loop that bound his upper arms .  he could actually bend his elbows and move his hands  but that was not enough to loosen the loop now that the rope was soaked through with rain .  hoping to lure wayne into letting down his guard  he had decided to be cooperative until a good opportunity to escape eventually developed .   wayne was not a difficult captor .  after hobbling the horse  he untied the free end of the rope holding steve and let steve have a moment of privacy in the bushes on the long leash  then he tied that end firmly around the base of a tree  where he sat to guard the knot .  steve sat against another tree  but he had a considerable radius in which he could move  either to sit and lie down or even stand up to stretch his legs .  he just couldn   t reach the knot or free his upper arms .  the rain lessened to a light drizzle  and under the heavy forest canopy  they were reasonably well sheltered .   steve sat quietly  watching wayne .  he was especially surprised when wayne opened the leather bag he was carrying on a thong .  wayne took out a lighter and poured a small amount of lighter fluid into it .  then he gathered up the least damp of the dead leaves and twigs around them  those which had been sheltered from the constant rain and drizzle under dense bushes or overhanging rocks .   wayne carefully and slowly lighted a tiny  smoky fire and placed more wet kindling near it to dry off .  steve realized that in some way  wayne had returned to the future .  the rope and the leather bag could have been obtained either in jamaica in the     s or here in this time  but that lighter had been manufactured many centuries in the future .       from the r .  hunter files    the now famous prototype of the highly successful    hunter    class robot first demonstrated his remarkable abilities in the mojave center governor case .  the following images are drawn from the robot city archives of derec avery  the eminent historian on robotics .       mc   and mc   merged .  two of mc governor   s six independent component robots are show here .  after capturing them in the remote past  r .  hunter merged and deactivated the robots temporarily .       the bohung institute .  the famed center for robot studies was founded in this underground university .  shown here is a view of the institute   s well known towers  from which mc governor launched his flight into the past .       room f    of the bohung institute .  this view through a tower window shows the time machine used by r .  hunter and his team to search for mojave center governor robot .       three views of r .  ishihara .  this robot   s versatility made him a difficult opponent for r .  hunter .  originally in the service of the bohung institute  r .  ishihara was tricked into helping dr .  wayne nystrom in his attempts to foil r .  hunter   s mission .       exchanging gifts in the german camp .  r .  hunter   s versatility allows him to blend quickly into diverse cultures and situations .  here  he participates in a ritual exchange of valuables with a germanic tribal leader .       returning with mc   .  in this close up of the time sphere in the bohung institute  r .  hunter and his team can be seen bringing the fugitive robot mc   back to mojave center .  the controls can be operated independently of the time sphere  so no operator is necessary when r .  hunter and his team leave and return from their missions .       robot sizes .  this composite picture shows the comparative sizes of r .  hunter  r .  ishihara  and mc    one of the governor robot   s six component robots .       catching a horse .  r .  hunter carefully picked his supporting team of human experts .  here  steve change  r .  hunter   s wilderness survival expert  lassoes a fleeing mount .           steve spent the evening tied to the tree  fairly comfortable in the heavy furs that vicinius and his father had provided .  wayne slowly and meticulously built up the fire and actually kept them both warm .  he shared some packaged food of a familiar brand with steve  but steve decided not to comment on the fact that wayne had obviously returned to their own time to get it .   steve could not figure out how wayne had managed to do that .  ishihara had been instructed to grab him if he reappeared in room f    .  clearly  however  wayne had returned somehow and had remained free to come back to the forest .   neither one of them talked .  as the evening wore on  steve grew sleepy  he had spent an active day out in the cold rain and the warmth of the fire made him drowsy .  he lay down and closed his eyes  but he listened carefully for the sounds of wayne   s occasionally placing more sticks on the fire .  it hissed and sputtered from rainwater dripping from the trees above  but wayne was still working to keep it going .   after a while  steve became aware that he had not heard wayne feed the fire for some time .  he opened his eyes .  in the small circle of yellowish firelight  he saw that wayne was lying down  using the leather bag as a pillow  breathing slowly .  the fire had shrunk .   steve wriggled slowly toward the fire  carefully stopping whenever he rustled dead leaves or twigs under him .  since the ground was damp  the noises were not very loud .  wayne remained asleep and steve was able to roll up against the glowing embers on the edge of the dying fire .  with the heavy fur cloak protecting his arms  he did not hesitate to move the rope holding him up against one of the red coals .   soon steve could see that the rope was slowly drying out .  then it began to darken and smolder .  at the same time  the stench of singed fur also rose up from the spot .   he turned his face away from the unpleasant smell .  otherwise  he held his position and hoped the burning fur would not awaken wayne .  however  wayne did not stir .   when the rope finally caught fire  it burned very fast .  the loop fell away and steve sat up promptly  away from the fire .  still careful to be quiet  he untied the free end of the rope from the tree .   steve wanted to reverse the situation and tie up wayne .  holding him for hunter would make the rest of their missions much easier .  he also had to get his communicator pin back so he could contact hunter .   walking carefully  he moved around the fire toward wayne  tying a new loop in the end of the rope .  since that had worked to hold him  he knew he could hold wayne the same way .  the problem was getting it over him .      hail  stranger     said a man   s voice in german right behind him .   startled  steve whirled around .  several german warriors were just barely visible in the firelight .  he recognized a couple of them .  they were from vicinius   s village and were armed with spears .      hail     said steve  uncertainly .   suddenly wayne rolled over and scrambled up  grabbing his leather bag .  steve spun toward him again and threw himself at wayne   s legs in a flying tackle  the looped rope hanging around one arm .  he snagged one of wayne   s ankles and they both went down  but wayne kicked free and slipped away .   steve got up and started after him .  two steps into the brush  however  the rope caught on a tree branch  yanking his arm sharply .  he came to a sudden stop .   as steve turned and pulled his arm free  he could hear wayne crashing through the underbrush .  he doubted he could catch up with him  and he was concerned about the german warriors .  with a self conscious grin  he looked up and shrugged .      your name is steve .     the leader of the group tapped his chest .     i have taken the name flavius .     he nodded toward the direction wayne had taken .     we have interrupted something .  he is your enemy .         uh  yeah  he is .         shall we track him for you .  he cannot have gone far .      steve was tempted to accept the offer  but he was afraid these barbarians might be too rough on wayne .  all steve wanted to do was get him into hunter   s custody and back to their own time .     no .  he   s not that important .  but  uh  can you take me back to the village .  i   m sort of lost .      flavius turned and conferred quietly with his companions for a moment .  then he nodded to steve .     of course .  we were on our way down the river tonight when we saw your campfire  but you are the guest of vicinius and our chief  odover .  we will return to the village with you .         thank you .  i   d like that .     steve grinned with relief .     but maybe you could help me find my horse .  he   s hobbled around here somewhere .         of course     said flavius .     night was just falling when vicinius led hunter and gene back to the river .  before they actually left the trees for the river bank  however  vicinius stopped .      i hear horses     he said .     that means romans are present .  i do not wish to speak with them .         no roman will harm you while we are with them     said hunter  firmly .     i am sure of that .  also  i have heard their voices nearby .  jane is riding one of the horses we hear .  we must meet her .         i understand .     vicinius gave an abrupt nod .     i am glad she is well .  i will return to the village now .  you can find it on your own .         yes .         farewell .  i will look for you later in the village .     vicinius slipped away into the woods .   hunter could not worry about him .  in fact  this was good  because he did not want to cause more roman and german contact than they had historically experienced .  he nodded to gene and started down the trail .   jane and a roman officer rode into view out of the trees a moment later .      hail  jane     said hunter .   she laughed .     hail  hunter .  good to see you .  this is marcus  a roman tribune .  marcus  this is the rest of my party  hunter and gene .         hail  tribune .         i give you greeting     said marcus formally .     i am marcus gaius aemilianus .         greetings     said gene .   jane was looking around anxiously .     hunter  steve isn   t with you .         no     said hunter .      something   s wrong .  we left him to meet you and started back for the fort .  then i .  .  . got worried .     jane pointedly tapped her communicator pin .      i understand     said hunter .      i .  .  . turned around and came back  and marcus was good enough to follow me .     jane shrugged helplessly .      she is very strong willed     said marcus .     but i would not let her ride off alone .  i must warn all of you  however  that the mood of the cherusci is hostile .  i suggest that we return to the safety of our camp .         thank you for your concern and dedication     said hunter .     we are glad that jane is safe .         her slave was mounted .  he may well have found his way back to the camp on his own .         where did you leave him .     gene asked     at the riverbank  right behind us just a few yards     said jane .      what about his tracks .     hunter asked .     he must have left tracks in the mud there .         it was too dark to see them when we got here     said marcus .     and now we must return to camp .      hunter knew that he could not argue very hard with marcus without behaving unlike a trader from gaul .  on the other hand  he could not ignore steve   s disappearance .  he was certain that steve must have had a surprise confrontation with some german warriors  or possibly even some romans .  that meant that hunter could not risk calling him on his communicator  for fear the others would overhear him .      thank you  tribune     said hunter .     please take jane and gene back to your camp .         you should come  too .     marcus spoke with the authority of an officer accustomed to obedience .      i shall be fine     said hunter patiently .     we appreciate your concern  tribune .  please see that jane and gene are safe for the night .  i fully expect to rejoin all of you with steve in the morning .         how can you search in this darkness .     marcus demanded .     with these clouds we   ve had all week  no moonlight is going to help you .  searching at night is a waste of time .         we deeply appreciate your hospitality     said hunter .     i shall be fine .         i must insist           let   s go     jane said to marcus .     arguing with him is a waste of time .  he   ll be all right .         you two are much too fond of this slave     said marcus  shaking his head .     come on  then .     he stretched an arm down toward gene  to help him mount .   gene took his arm and tried to jump up behind marcus .  hunter stepped forward and helped lift him all the way up .  when gene was secure  marcus turned his mount and rode away  with jane behind him .   hunter was worried about steve  but at least he was free to stop his masquerade for the benefit of vicinius or marcus .  he moved down the trail and magnified his vision to maximum light reception .  enough moonlight showed through the clouds for him to find his way  and he quickly found the tracks where steve had walked his horse to the river and back .  he also identified the spot where steve had apparently fallen and been dragged into the woods .   from there  the horse   s tracks led downstream .  he followed them until they led him into forest .  under the trees  the forest was simply too dark even for hunter   s considerable light sensitivity .  marcus was right  he could not track steve here in the darkness .   hunter considered his options .  he could still go to the roman camp  arriving a little late  but it was clear from the tracks that steve had not gone in that direction .  the next morning he would be starting the search over again .   he could also spend the night where he was and begin the search from his present location at first light .  as a robot with ample energy stored  he would be safe  especially under the forest canopy .  he could even shut himself down except for his emergency communicator reception .   hunter decided to take his final option  and return to the village of vicinius and odover .  he had stored all of his movements around the forest in his memory  giving him a local map of any area he had seen .  in such poor light  finding his way through the forest would be slow and clumsy  but in the village he could at least maintain his rapport with vicinius .  on the way  he would turn up his hearing for any sign of steve .   he turned to orient himself and began the hike through the forest to the village .     jane was very cold and tired by the time marcus led them into the new roman camp .  it was laid out exactly like the previous one .  the sound of falling axes she had heard was reflected in the new palisade wall surrounding the camp .  the courtyard was lighted by torches placed around the inside of the palisade and she gratefully reined up behind marcus and gene at the stable .  her fur cloak had kept most of her dry  but her leggings and boots had been soaked through with rain by midday and her lower legs and feet ached with the cold .  she dismounted with relief when the groom came to hold her bridle .      to the governor   s tent     marcus said abruptly .  he marched quickly toward it .   gene grinned at jane .     it   s been a long day .      she smiled weakly  nodding .   at the entrance to the governor   s tent  a sentry saluted marcus and drew the flap open for him .  marcus stepped inside and saluted  while jane and gene stopped behind him  still out in the rain .      come in  tribune     said governor varus .     are your companions with you .         yes  governor .     marcus moved out of the way and gestured for them to follow him .   jane slipped inside first and made room for gene .  the tent was lighted with four standing oil lamps  burning brightly in each corner .  governor varus  warmly dressed in heavy woolen tunics  sat in a backless chair and sipped from a goblet of wine while demetrius cleared the dishes from the table .      this is the coldest  foulest night we   ve had yet this year     said governor varus  gesturing to the oil lamps .     please warm yourselves .  demetrius  bring their meals .      jane eased back her hood and shook out her hair  then held her hands near the flames .  gene joined her .  marcus moved to one of the other lamps to do the same .      i   m glad you caught up with us again .  it wasn   t too difficult  i trust .     governor varus looked up at gene .     this must be your lost friend .         no  sir     said marcus .     this man is called gene titus .  he is one of the lady   s party from gaul .  gene  this is governor varus of this province .         pleased to meet you     said gene .      good evening .  come in and get warm .  you are welcome here  of course .         thank you .         but where is your slave .     the governor addressed jane .     tending the horses or something of that sort .  yesterday  he hardly left your side .         he didn   t come back with us .         no .  what happened to him .         her slave is now lost in the forest     said marcus .     for her sake  i hope he is well .         so  tribune     said governor varus .     bad fortune in finding your lost friend  eh .  the one you started searching for in the first place .         worse than that  sir     said marcus  unstrapping his helmet and pulling it off .      eh .         late this afternoon we were confronted by a band of cherusci warriors .      governor varus raised his eyebrows .     go on .         governor  i am certain that trouble is on the way     said marcus .      why are you so sure .         they had no particular business there by the river and frankly  they had nothing to say .     marcus set his helmet down at his feet and continued warming his hands .     foul climate     he muttered .      what did they say .         virtually nothing     said marcus .     but they made a point of coming out of the trees to be seen .      governor varus chuckled and sipped his wine .     that hardly constitutes a rebellion  marcus .         it was a small show of force to a lone tribune out with a civilian .         or perhaps it was a chance meeting in the forest and nothing more .         some kind of trouble is brewing  sir .      demetrius entered with a tray of food and began laying it out on the table .      oh  i doubt it .  after all  that   s rather routine .     governor varus held out his goblet for demetrius to refill .     sit down  please  all of you .  marcus  i shall listen to you as all of you warm up and enjoy your dinner .                 marcus  you simply expect too much from these barbarians     said governor varus .   jane and gene took their seats .  marcus sat down last  sighing wearily .  demetrius moved behind governor varus and stood patiently .      let   s ask our guests .     governor varus turned to jane .     you saw these germans .         yes  sir .         did they threaten you in any way .         no     jane said hesitantly .  she was aching to warn him  to convince him of the disaster he would fall into very soon .  the reason was not that she had a great liking for the romans as a group  but simply because she was uncomfortable knowing that so many romans would soon be walking into a trap .  now that she was actually talking to two of them  they no longer seemed like mere historical figures .  of course  she knew she could not say anything that would even hint that marcus was right .  instead  she would have to remain as neutral as possible  so as not to influence these two romans .      no .  were they armed .         they had spears     said jane .     that   s all i remember .     she picked up her wine goblet  as much to hide behind it as to drink from it .      that   s often all these barbarians have     said governor varus calmly .  he turned to gene .     how about you .  did you see them .         no  governor .  i had not joined them yet .         i see .  then let me ask the two of you another question entirely .         of course     said gene .      perhaps i have been too hard on my tribune     said governor varus .     as i understand it  you have come here from gaul  which means you passed through much of this province .         yes  sir     said gene  watching him carefully .   jane was glad to let him field the questions .  after all  as the historian on the team  he had the best chance to pass as a real trader .  she was too nervous to feel hungry  but she forced herself to eat  in order to keep busy .      so in your travels  how were you received .     governor varus asked .     you must have visited many villages of the cherusci before you got here .         we were welcomed     said gene .     at that time  we had a few modest gifts to present to the village elders .         ah  yes .  they are sometimes like children with new playthings .  did they talk to you about us romans .         not particularly     said gene .  he looked at jane innocently .     do you recall .         no .     she shook her head .   governor varus nodded .      i   m afraid i   m quite ignorant of political matters     said jane .  she was sure that romans of this time would accept that readily from a woman .      german hostility has never died     said marcus  looking up from his plate .     they like to buy our goods  but that   s all .  i suppose they see you traders as their friends  where we soldiers will always be their enemies .         where were you stationed before you came here .     jane asked marcus  hoping to turn the conversation away from the german rebellion .      in rome itself     said marcus .  he caught her eye and grinned at her .     the climate is so much nicer there .  have you ever been to rome .         no .     jane suppressed a smile .  she had been to rome in her own time  but it was not the rome marcus knew .      have you seen the emperor .     gene asked  sounding excited by the prospect .      oh  yes     said marcus .     my cohort marched past him in review several times .  i saw emperor augustus standing and watching us from a balcony .         marcus  i believe you may be making a conquest .     amused  governor varus stood up and slipped a heavy cloak over his shoulders .     please continue your meal at your leisure .  i wish to take a walk .  demetrius  remain here and see to them .     he stepped out of the tent .   jane watched marcus  trying not to laugh at his embarrassment .  to rescue him  she asked     how about gladiators .  did you watch them fight .         oh  yes     said marcus .     it can be quite interesting .  they are often very good  though of course it is not the same as soldiering .         but they must be very good fighters .         in their specialized duels  yes .  for instance  one man will have a long net and a trident .  he fights a man with a sword and a small shield .     he frowned slightly .     the man with the net always seems to win .  those who assign the weapons dictate who lives and dies .         you don   t approve .     gene asked cautiously .      soldiering is an honorable profession     said marcus .     we serve the empire .  it requires discipline  teamwork  and duty .  the gladiators are slaves .      gene said nothing .      you miss rome  don   t you .     jane decided to change the subject .      yes  that is no secret .  but a tribune can   t earn the respect of his troops in rome .  for that  he has to go to the frontier and serve .         the name aemilianus is old and well known     said gene .     you must be well educated  i would guess .         yes .  i learned greek and studied the works of homer and the great philosophers .      jane remained quiet as gene and marcus discussed greek philosophy .  she probably knew a little more about it than most women of gaul in this time  but the less she had to converse with marcus  the better off she would be .  when they had all finished eating  she waited for a moment when she could break into the conversation .      i   m very tired     she said .     i   m afraid i   m not used to so much riding .  i would like to go to sleep .         of course     said marcus .     my tent is yours again .  uh  would you .  .  .     he glanced uncertainly at gene .      our party normally remains together     said jane .      as you wish  of course .      as soon as jane and gene were in their tent  jane called hunter .      jane here .  can you hear me  hunter .         hunter here .  where are you  jane .         gene and i are in the new roman camp .  we don   t know anything about steve  though .         i lost his tracks in the darkness     said hunter .     i am slowly moving back toward vicinius   s village .  i shall resume my search in the morning .  you two are well .         yes  we   re fine .         i am glad .  please call me in the morning when you can .  since you are in the roman camp  i shall not risk calling you .  hunter out .        ishihara spent the early evening outside the village into which mc   had gone .  mc   continued to play with the children  tossing sticks and running through the village with them .  he was clearly trying to establish a rapport with the villagers and the adults were simply ignoring him .   as ishihara observed mc   from the forest  he also carefully watched the village dogs to see if they caught his scent .  they did not .  in part this was because  as a robot  he did not have a normal human scent and partly because the constant rain had driven the dogs into the huts .   he waited patiently as the villagers called their children and carried their dinners into the huts  out of the rain .  two of the children carried a bowl of food to mc    which he accepted  though he stayed a polite distance away from all the huts .  he stood alone in the courtyard of the village  waiting patiently .   eventually the families came out to douse their cookfires and begin chasing the children into the huts .  one of the older children gestured for mc   to come in  too .  mc   looked hesitantly at the father of the child  who nodded offhandedly for him to join them .   ishihara noted which hut mc   entered .  he was not entirely sure of what he would do  but this was his best chance yet to approach mc   without a crowd of humans who might protect him .  ishihara hoped to grab mc   somehow without risking a first law violation by struggling with humans .   the village elders left sentries posted around the village when the rest of the villagers went inside for the night .  for a while  the sentries paced about  talking and looking around under the sputtering torches they each carried .   as the night wore on  however  the sentries sat down around one small fire that remained lighted  feeding it occasionally .  one of them pulled out an earthenware jug and passed it around .  one by one  each sentry gradually leaned back against a tree trunk or stretched out under the overhanging thatched roof of a hut and dozed off .   ishihara suspected that sentries were not normally posted in the village at night .  he  ad overheard some of the conversation held by hunter   s team before they had left for this mission and he knew that trouble between the germans and romans was coming .  that would explain the presence of the sentries .  it also explained their carelessness .   when all the sentries had had time to fall into a fairly deep sleep  ishihara slowly and patiently began moving toward the village .  he was still concerned about the village dogs  too  but the constant spattering of the rain on the trees and the huts and the ground helped disguise the sound of his movements .  in the darkness  with a care that few humans had the patience for  he took one step at a time toward the village .   ishihara spent almost an hour moving thirty yards through the dense forest .  neither the sentries nor the dogs stirred .   now that ishihara was in the muddy clearing in the center of the village  he was more concerned about the excellent hearing of the dogs in the huts .  he paused and magnified his hearing .  the sentries and all the other humans he could hear were breathing deeply and evenly .   the villagers were not likely to be awakened by a slight sound .  the breathing of the village dogs varied much more .  then another sound reached him  the faint crackling and cracking of wood .  it was very faint and came from the back of the hut into which mc   had gone .   certain that mc   was escaping  ishihara abandoned his concern over making noise and ran around the hut .  after the first hard  wet slap of his footsteps  the loud snap of wood breaking came from the back of the hut .  dogs began to bark all over the village and a couple of sentries called to each other in rough  surprised voices .  ishihara heard the sentries    wet  splashing feet as they ran after him .   behind the hut  a flash of one of the torches carried by the lead sentry allowed ishihara to glimpse mc   disappearing into the forest .  a quick glance at the back of the hut told him that mc   had simply broken through a plank in the rear of the hut to escape .  ishihara ran after mc    suddenly realizing that mc   must have turned his own robotic hearing up to maximum in order to detect the slight sounds ishihara had made as he approached the hut .      i am r .  ishihara  a humaniform robot     ishihara radioed to mc   .     i order you to stop under a first law emergency .     he repeated the message  but he could hear that mc   was still crashing through the underbrush ahead .   mc   probably had kept his communicator shut off .  ishihara also shouted the message a couple of times  but mc   did not respond .  he might have shut off his hearing as well .   up ahead  ishihara heard leaves suddenly move just overhead .  the sound of more leaves shaking and some twigs snapping told him that mc   had jumped up to a tree branch and was climbing overhead to escape .  using his hearing more than his sight in the dark forest  ishihara followed mc   up into the trees .   climbing through the dripping trees was slow and difficult  but ishihara quickly heard the german warriors behind him drop back .  they were not eager to pursue a mysterious intruder in the dark .  after shouting angrily into the night  they returned to the village .   mc   was moving from one tree to the next either by jumping and grabbing another branch or by swinging hand over hand between branches .  ishihara followed him by doing the same .  he was taller than mc   and had an advantage in both arm reach and overall strength .  little by little  he gained on his quarry .   ishihara heard mc   suddenly drop in three controlled jumps from branch to branch back to the ground .  caught off guard  ishihara moved back down more carefully  losing ground as he did so .  because he weighed considerably more than mc    fewer branches could bear his weight .   as soon as he was on the ground  mc   darted through the forest on foot .  ishihara finally jumped to the ground and ran after him .  in the darkness  ishihara could see virtually nothing .  he was not specialized for a search  the way hunter was  and lacked the infrared vision which would have allowed him to glimpse mc   by the heat he generated in the cold forest .  he could  however  hear that mc   was also having trouble fleeing in the dark .  neither one of them was moving very quickly .   ishihara heard branches snapping up ahead as mc   crashed into a bush  then a slapping sound as he fell onto the wet ground .  focusing on the noise  ishihara took two more quick strides and blindly threw himself forward .  with one hand  he snagged mc     s ankle and held on .   mc   tripped  got up  and tried to scramble away .  ishihara   s grip was firm  however  and he got to his feet  yanking mc     s foot out from under him at the same time .  mc   fell  with ishihara still holding his ankle .      listen to me     ishihara said aloud .  he repeated the statement through his communication link  but mc   did not respond .  ishihara decided that trying to communicate was a waste of time and energy .  he bent down to grip mc     s right arm and released his ankle .  then he pulled mc   to his feet .   mc   was not resisting now  but he was tense  ready to run again if he thought it was worth the effort .   ishihara did not have the device that triggered the time travel sphere .  wayne had kept it .  ishihara would have to join him with mc   before they could return to their own time .   wayne had told him not to call him .  ishihara turned toward where he had last known wayne to be and began to work his way in that direction .  in his firm hold  mc   walked with him  not struggling .           wayne had plunged through the forest in a panic to escape steve when the german warriors distracted him .  he had slammed his forehead into a low hanging branch and fallen several times .  twice he had crashed into bushes and flailed blindly to get free .  finally  lost in the dark and out of breath  he had realized that no one had chased him .   when wayne heard steve lead his horse away with the germans  he returned to his dying fire .  he built it up slightly and lay awake in the wet forest for a long time  listening for more trouble .  finally  however  he stretched out and went to sleep again .   at dawn  he awoke stiff with cold but somewhat rested .  the sky was gray but the rain had stopped for the moment .  the fire had gone out and starting it again was too much work .  he pulled a strip of commercially prepared beef jerky from his own time out of his pack and munched on it .   wayne did not dare linger any longer .  steve could find hunter and lead him back here .  wayne turned away from the river and began hiking in the general direction ishihara had taken .      i hate this     he muttered out loud to himself .     no matter what i do  something goes wrong .     he reached for his communicator pin to call ishihara .     after a hearty breakfast  marcus rode out of the roman camp with jane by his side and gene riding on the far side of her .  he had agreed to help them search for steve and their other lost friend .  this time  he had taken one precaution .  he had ordered a decury of cavalry  ten legionaries  to ride with them .  marcus did not intend to be caught unprepared again by any german warriors  and with everyone mounted  they would be able to run from a german force of any size .   he sneaked another glance at jane  who had protested earnestly against his ordering the decury to accompany them .      i confess you puzzle me     he said politely .     i should have thought you would be pleased to have a small squadron of cavalry to ride along this morning .         you have been very courteous and considerate     said jane .     but i really don   t want to interfere with your army business .         oh  i think the roman legions can manage their business today without us     marcus said lightly  smiling at her .     they are still on the march today  and ten fewer cavalrymen will not even be missed .      jane smiled tightly and glanced at gene .     maybe gene and i should go out on our own .  i would prefer not to trouble you any more than we have already .         it would not be a problem     gene said .      nonsense     said marcus .     you are no bother at all .  i am happy to accompany you .  with good fortune  we may chance across more german warriors today and learn something of their intentions .         i hope we don   t meet any of them     jane said quietly  exchanging another glance with gene .      we have nothing to fear from a small party     said marcus .     and a large number of germans will not be mounted  so we can ride away from them .  i assure you both that i will see to your safety .         thank you     jane said  with a weak smile .     you   re very .  .  . conscientious .        ishihara had made very little progress during the night .  mc   alternately went limp  tried to wrestle away  or grabbed tree trunks with his free arm or even his legs as ishihara tried to pull him through the dark forest .  ishihara did not have any way to communicate verbally with mc    as long as the component robot kept both his communication link and his hearing shut off  nor would he have had the authority of the second law over mc   in any case .  all he could do was push  drag  and pull the smaller robot with him .   at dawn  ishihara was able to see well enough to avoid colliding with as many bushes and trees as he had been in the darkness .  he located his own trail  leading from where he had left wayne to the german village  and backtracked .  by midmorning  however  he had still made only a little progress .   ishihara considered calling wayne several times  but could not justify it to himself .  the second law required that he obey wayne   s clear instruction not to call him  and ishihara could not yet make a firm interpretation of a first law problem that would require him to violate it .  dragging mc   through the forest was difficult and time consuming  but it did not imply any particular danger to humans that ishihara could see .     steve had been very relieved to return to the german village late at night .  vicinius   s hut was much drier and warmer than the damp ground next to wayne   s campfire had been .  as he shared breakfast with vicinius on yet another gray  chilly morning  hunter walked out of the forest to join them .  after they had all exchanged greetings  hunter politely accepted a bowl of hot gruel .      you have not found your friends     said vicinius .     in fact  since you first came to visit us  you have lost two more of your party .     he grinned .     i have not been much help to you  i can see that .         you have been an excellent host     said hunter .  he turned to steve .     i am glad to see you well .  do you have a suggestion for finding jane and gene today .         well  i might .     steve understood that hunter was speaking in a kind of code because vicinius was with them .  he chose his words carefully in return .     i lost a good luck charm last night .     he patted the spot where he usually wore his communicator pin .      and i was tied up briefly by an old adversary of ours .  he took my .  .  .  charm .         you have an enemy in this forest .     vicinius turned in surprise .     do not fear .  tell us where to find him .  my friends and i will slay him for you .         not a blood enemy     hunter said quickly .     he is  uh  a fellow trader .  we do not want him killed .     he looked at steve .     you do mean dr .  wayne nystrom .         yes .         we would like to tie him up and take him with us  however     hunter added .      why .     vicinius looked back and forth between them .     if he is an enemy  you must kill him .  if he is a friend  you would not talk about him this way .         he might know stuff we want to know     said steve quickly .     we might learn something from him .         ah .  so you want to torture him for information .     vicinius nodded his understanding .      no .     hunter said sharply .     we .  .  . would like to take him back to gaul with us to discuss business .         no  no     said vicinius  now shaking his head .     you gauls are too soft .         maybe we are .     steve laughed and watched hunter to see how he would react .   vicinius caught his look  however .     i will be glad to help you  of course .  this man is your concern  not mine .         maybe flavius can tell you where he and his friends found me last night     said steve .      your tracks will be easy to find     said vicinius .     the rain has let up since yesterday .         i have a roman horse     steve said to hunter .     vicinius and i can ride while you walk .         excellent     said hunter .     when will you be ready .         any time     said steve .      i will get my spear     said vicinius .     by midday  ishihara had not yet reached the spot where he had left wayne .  mc     s resistance had slowed him to less than half of his normal speed .  the day had otherwise been uneventful .  then he picked up the distant sounds of humans moving on foot through the forest behind him .   instantly  he shifted his hearing to maximum .  the humans seemed to be following his trail .  he suspected they were from the village he was fleeing .  if they had started trailing him at dawn  they might have needed all morning to draw this close to him .   this was the rationale ishihara needed to call wayne .  if he lost mc    then their mission to save their own timestream would be endangered again .     ishihara calling wayne nystrom .  do you read  sir .      he was still dragging and half carrying mc   through the brush as he radioed his message repeatedly .  when he finally realized that wayne was not going to answer  he became more concerned  but could do nothing except keep going .  since the humans behind him were slowly gaining ground  he encircled mc     s waist with his arms and lifted the smaller robot off the ground .   mc   still kicked and struggled  but ishihara began carrying him  hoping to leave his pursuers behind .  however  mc   grabbed a tree branch with both hands and hung onto it .  ishihara wrenched him free  but could see that he was not going to be able to move much faster than he had been already .  he turned to look behind him  peering through the trees for a sign of the germans .      help .     mc   shouted suddenly in modern english .     help .  this way .  over here .      ishihara yanked him forward  trying to run .  mc   could not have heard their pursuit with his hearing shut off  but he had surmised their presence by ishihara   s actions .  ishihara pulled and shoved mc    but did not accomplish much .  the smaller robot was as persistent and stubborn as he was  driven by the third law of robotics to protect himself .   shouts rose up from the men behind them .  the german warriors could not have understood mc       exact words  but they understood his panicked tone .  ishihara heard them calling encouragement as they came crashing through the brush toward him .  he recognized the loudest voice as belonging to the warrior who called himself julius .   ishihara ran through his limited options .  he could continue to wrestle with mc   and be surrounded by julius and his warriors .  if he did that  he would have to attempt convincing the germans that he had the right to carry off mc   .  he judged the likelihood of success to be extremely poor .  his other option was to release mc    keep away from the germans himself  and attempt to recapture him later .  this second option would allow him freedom to carry out future plans with wayne nystrom to help .   ishihara let go of mc    who instantly ran back toward the humans pursuing them .   at the same time  ishihara turned and ran as fast as he could through the forest .  without the help of a human who could impose the authority of the three laws of robotics on mc    capturing him again was probably a waste of time .  finding wayne again was his top priority .        ishihara  come in     wayne said quietly  as he hiked through the woods .     you there .         yes  wayne .         let   s keep it short so we don   t get our messages intercepted .  report on mc   .         i had him in custody for most of the night .  when local german warriors approached us  i released him .         what .  why .     wayne was horrified .      they were about to stop us .  mc   has befriended them in some way .  i could not fight them off without risking violation of the first law .  i judged that rejoining you would give us the opportunity to take him into custody again .         well .  .  . i see .  where are you .         i am on my way back to where we separated .         i   m not far from there     said wayne .     i   m working my way toward you .  do you have a reading on my position yet from the radio signal .         i have an approximate one .  without being able to triangulate  i need to monitor your signal continuously for maximum efficiency .         i can   t risk that .  i still don   t want hunter to chance across our signal .  i   ll call you again after a while and let you judge by the strength of the radio signal how much closer we are to each other .         understood .         wayne out .     he indulged in a brief smile  despite the cold and the dampness  and marched on through the forest .   on his first time trip  back to the late cretaceous  he had actually got control of hunter under the second law for a short time .  that had brought him pretty close to gaining control of mc    until hunter   s human team members had interfered .  then on his second trip  back to jamaica in the     s  he had been able to enlist the help of local buccaneers who had actually grabbed mc   for a while .  he just hadn   t been able to take him back to their own time himself .  now he could see that he had been wise to bring ishihara  though it had been ishihara   s idea .  a robot was the best help of all .   if wayne could just avoid having hunter find out that ishihara was here and helping him  he would have a real advantage .  steve could only tell him that wayne was here  he didn   t know about ishihara .  unless they ran across ishihara out in the forest by chance  the only way hunter could learn about ishihara   s presence would be to intercept their radio messages .      hey   am i asleep  or what .  i can listen in  too     wayne said to himself aloud .  he fumbled for the communicator pin he had taken from steve .  it was the same as his own  except that it would already be set for whatever frequency hunter   s team had been using .  he turned it on and pinned it on his shoulder next to his own .  all he heard at first was static  but that would change sooner or later  assuming hunter   s team was in range .     i should have thought of this right away .      wayne hiked for quite a long time .  twice  he called ishihara to check their positions .  they were quickly approaching each other .      hunter  jane here .     her voice came over steve   s communicator pin .   wayne stopped where he was  one leg over a fallen log  to listen .      yes  jane .         gene and i are with marcus  but this morning he ordered an entire decury to ride with us .  i   m afraid we   re really changing some people   s lives here .         where are you now .      we   re riding back down to the spot where we saw you last night .  i told the guys i need another private moment in the bushes  as the only woman here  i don   t have to worry about anyone joining me .  they   re all very protective .         steve and i met again this morning in the village of vicinius and odover     said hunter .     but look out .  wayne is here and he tied up steve for part of last night  till steve got away .         that explains what happened to him .  what about mc   .         all we really know is that wayne did not have him either  as recently as last night .  mc   is still in the area somewhere .         what do you want to do  hunter .  i can   t talk much longer or they   ll worry about me .         we should reunite the team     said hunter .     we shall move in your direction and try to meet you sometime today .      wayne smiled to himself .  hunter was temporarily too distracted even to go after mc   .  he and ishihara had a good shot at getting him first .           jane rejoined marcus  gene  and the cavalry patrol with a cheerful smile and they all rode on .  she had not had time to ask hunter how he felt about the fact that marcus had ordered the patrol to join them .  of course  she realized that the german rebellion was the major event that had to remain unchanged .  this little patrol probably could not prevent that .   marcus had ordered the decurion  the commanding officer of the patrol  to concentrate on the chore of finding their way .  meanwhile  marcus had been talking with jane .  normally  she would have been flattered by his attention  but she was so afraid of saying something she shouldn   t that she did not want to speak .      i have never been to gaul     said marcus .     do you like it there .         yes     said jane .     what   s it like .         well .  .  .     she tried to remember what she could about the climate  but she had only visited france for a short time .     the south of gaul is very warm .         along the mediterranean  yes  it would be .  much like the italian coast  i expect .     marcus looked up at the gray sky .     the drizzle should start again any time  i suppose .  i wish we had the climate of the southern coast here .     he grinned at her .      a lady like yourself should not have to suffer through this constant cold and dampness .      jane smiled politely but said nothing .      i hear gaul has few towns  as we romans would know them  except for the ones we built .      jane glanced uncomfortably at gene .      that   s true     said gene .     gaul is not too unlike germany  except for roman influence .      marcus nodded politely  but turned to jane again .     what sort of family do you come from .  do you have many brothers and sisters .         i   m one of nine     jane said truthfully .     five brothers and three sisters .         ah .  no deaths in childbirth .  and you have all lived to adulthood .         that   s right .     she suppressed a smile of amusement .      you come from strong  healthy stock .     he grinned at her in obvious approval .      yes  i guess so .     she was tempted to reciprocate by asking him about his own family  but she decided against it .  marcus clearly liked her  and she could not encourage his friendship without risking a change in his behavior toward his duties .      so tell me     said marcus .     do you come from a town in gaul .  or a small tribal village .         i   m from a town     said jane .      was your father a trader  also .         oh  no .         tribune     gene interrupted .     we   ve been riding over half a day .  i thought we probably would have seen some german warriors by now .         yes  where are they .     jane glanced at gene gratefully .  he apparently understood her predicament and was still trying to distract marcus for her .      i am sure they have seen us     said marcus .     our horses make enough noise to give them plenty of warning  especially in these numbers .         why haven   t they come out to speak to us .     jane asked  to prevent him from turning the talk to her again .      they don   t want to reveal themselves because today we have too many armed men with us .         wait a minute     said jane  trying to sound as naive as she could .     you mean they   ve been watching us in secret .         indeed they have .         how do you know .      marcus pointed to a flock of birds suddenly fluttering out of the trees into the sky up ahead .     i believe some german scouts are withdrawing ahead of us  simply watching to see what we will do .  the birds give them away sometimes .         maybe we   ll join up with hunter and steve soon     said jane .     then we can stop troubling you .         we should probably go back to gaul     said gene .     and not get in your way .         don   t worry about the germans today     said marcus  with a grim smile .     whatever the germans are planning  i believe it is very big  even if governor varus won   t listen to me .  if the scouts watching us wanted to cause trouble  they would have started already  i think .  and we   re ready for them now .      jane and gene exchanged an uncomfortable glance but said nothing more .   they all rode in silence for a while .  the cold wind rose again  and the gray clouds above them darkened .  drizzle began to fall  blowing directly into their faces .      perhaps someday i can take you to the coast of latium  down the tiber river from rome     marcus said to jane .     it is so much nicer than this on an autumn day .  i would like to show it to you .      just as jane lifted the hood of her cloak and tugged it forward  she heard a chorus of yells from the forest .  in the same instant  a roman bugler behind her sounded an alarm .  when she looked around  she saw german warriors leaping and running out of the trees toward them  hurling spears and shooting arrows .  she recognized the man in the lead as julius  who had confronted marcus the previous day .   jane yanked her reins to move away .  at the same time  the roman patrol moved up to surround her and gene .  their shields deflected the volley of spears and arrows .  marcus shouted orders she could not understand in all the other yelling .   she fumbled for her lapel pin and switched it on  knowing that none of the romans or germans were paying any attention .  before she could speak  a small figure  dressed in rags  caught her attention in the trees behind the line of germans .  mc    who was identical to mc   and mc    was trying to wrestle a spear away from a much larger german warrior .      what   s wrong .     gene yelled .     doesn   t it work .  do you want me to call hunter instead .         hunter .     she kept her eyes on mc   .     it   s jane .  emergency .  hunter .         yes  jane .     hunter   s voice was calm but authoritative .     i am on my way  following your signal .  please explain .  and do not disconnect  as i shall need a continuing signal from you in order to find you as quickly as possible .      jane   s mount was still prancing in the center of the struggling romans .  everyone around her was shouting .  she yanked on the reins  fighting to keep control .     our group is being attacked by a bunch of german warriors           how do the numbers match up on each side .     hunter interrupted .      uh  almost equal .  there are more germans  i think  but not a lot more  and they don   t have horses or armor .  but  hunter   mc   is with the germans .         i am coming     hunter said firmly .     keep your pin switched on .  you do not need to continue speaking  i have enough noise coming through .         did you get him .     gene shouted .  he ducked as an arrow whistled near his head .     what did he say .         he   s coming .     jane leaned down low  not sure of what to do .  between the moving  clashing bodies around them  she could still glimpse mc   in the trees  still trying to interfere with a german warrior .      what should we do .     gene was also down low against his horse   s neck .      just wait .  and hang on .     jane saw mc   again and straightened up in her saddle .     mc   .  stop and move aside .  that   s an order .      mc   did not respond .  she knew he probably had not heard her voice in the shouting of all the fighting men and the clanging of swords against shields .  in any case  he was now responding to the first law in a feeble attempt to minimize the violence occurring in front of him .  a second law instruction would not deter him at the moment .   around her and gene  the outnumbered romans still fought to protect them .     steve was riding double with vicinius  following hunter through the forest  when hunter suddenly whirled around .      i need your horse     said hunter  striding back to them .     i must go .     he tapped his shoulder in the same spot where steve had worn his lapel communicator .      uh   of course     said steve  understanding that hunter had received a call from jane or gene .     but  maybe we should all go together .         no  steve .  i must hurry .  you will remain with vicinius .     hunter reached up to take steve under his arms  the big robot lifted him to the ground as if he were a small child .   taking the hint  vicinius jumped to the ground on his own .      vicinius     said hunter .     i do not have time to explain .  but you will protect steve for me .         of course     said vicinius  clearly puzzled .     of course .         you may follow at your own pace  provided you are very careful .  i shall rejoin you as soon as i can .     hunter mounted quickly and rode away through the forest  leaning low to avoid tree branches .      i heard nothing     said vicinius  with a mystified expression on his face .     i saw nothing .  what is he doing .         i  uh  didn   t hear anything  either     said steve .     and i didn   t see anything .      vicinius turned to look him in the eye .     then i ask you  what is he doing .  what is so important that he must leave us this way .         well .  .  . sometimes hunter reads omens that the rest of us do not notice .         omens .         yeah  i think so .     steve shrugged .     not real often .  but sometimes he just has to  uh  act on them .         your friend is more than a little strange     said vicinius .     i like him  but he is quite strange .         come on     said steve  hoping to change the subject .     we can follow him .  let   s go .        as hunter rode through the heavy forest  he radioed mc   again .  he received no response  which did not surprise him .  jane no longer spoke to him directly  but her communicator was still transmitting .  he heard the shouts of many men  the whinnying of horses  and the clanging of metal .   before he got close enough to hear the sounds of struggle with his own hearing  rather than the communication link  the sounds of struggle coming over the radio stopped as well .  for several moments  he heard only the clopping of horse   s hooves .      they   re gone     jane muttered quietly .     gene and i are okay .  right  gene .         yeah     said gene  his voice sounding distant in the background .      decurion     marcus ordered  his voice even fainter .     give me an injury report .      hunter could hear the decurion respond  but the signal was now too faint even for him to interpret .  he was deeply concerned about harm to any humans who would not have been injured without the presence of his team .  for now  however  all he could do was hurry in their direction as fast as he could .   before hunter drew near the site of the attack  the source of the signal began to move  as jane rode away with the patrol .  now that the sounds of battle no longer covered his voice  he did not dare speak to jane again  nor could she say anything to him directly .  however  she did continue a stream of small talk with gene  which provided him with a clear  strong signal to follow .  the roman patrol had clearly changed direction  hunter guessed that they were returning to the main body of roman legions to avoid further trouble with hostile germans .     steve and vicinius hurried after hunter  but of course they had no chance of catching up until he stopped somewhere .  when hunter   s tracks began to curve in a new direction  steve guessed that jane and gene had begun to move  but he had no idea where they were going .  as his determined strides gradually faltered from weariness  steve decided to take a break .      sorry  vicinius .     he stopped near a fallen log .     i   m not used to this kind of mountain country .  i have to rest for a few minutes .     he sat down .      well .  .  . of course .     vicinius reluctantly joined him on the log .     not too long  eh .  hunter is still gaining ground on us even while we   re walking .         all right .  not too long .     steve was sure that either jane and gene were in trouble or else mc   had been found  nothing else would have taken hunter away like that .  in either case  the imminent german rebellion might have influenced events .     vicinius  do you know of any danger that might be out in the forest today .         the forest always has dangers   an angry wild boar  a mother bear protecting her cubs in the spring .  .  .  in winter  a hungry wolf .     he shrugged .     even a challenge from another warrior  maybe over a woman .         uh   yeah .  well  i meant .  .  .     he trailed off  not sure what to say .      you are wondering what omens hunter saw .         i wish i knew  yeah .     steve grinned .     but that   s not what i meant .  we know the roman legions are marching near here .  i was wondering if trouble is on the way with them .         the romans brought trouble with them a generation ago     said vicinius casually  looking away from steve at nothing in particular .      i guess you know they came to gaul long before that .         so i have heard .         but the gauls are used to the romans now .  many even like the peace and prosperity they have brought .         the gauls are .  .  . not strong enough .  with respect to your masters  of course .  hunter is a fine man .      steve suppressed a grin .     he   s quite a .  .  . specimen  all right .  but i have the feeling that the cherusci tribe are not as tame as the gauls  where romans are concerned .  what do you say .         yes .  yes  we cherusci are becoming impatient .  i will grant you that .     vicinius turned to look directly at steve .     you are not a gaul  but your masters are .  they are my friends  but perhaps they are too fond of romans for my own taste .         trouble is starting  isn   t it .     steve knew it was  of course  but in order to discuss the subject with vicinius  he had to induce vicinius to acknowledge the fact .      prince arminius has been visiting each village for the past week or two     said vicinius .     he has been our leader in dealing with the romans .         and .         he is rousing all the cherusci villages .  the men of my village will be moving soon .  i will join them .     his voice lowered .     i am telling you this as a friend .  maybe you can keep your masters away from trouble when it starts .         i appreciate your trusting me .      vicinius stood up .     i believe i can judge whether to trust a man or not .  let   s go .         good idea .     steve got up and followed him through the forest .           when wayne finally saw ishihara walk around a large tree to meet him  he felt that he had found his only friend in the world .  in this time period  in fact  that was true .  he grinned with relief  but stifled an impulse to slap the robot on the back .      i   m glad to see you     said wayne .      you are well .         yeah  i   m okay .         good .  what are your instructions now .         well  you know who got mc   from you .  where is he now .     wayne sat down against the base of a tree .     i   m worn out from walking all day .         he is with a party of native cherusci warriors led by a young man named julius .  they come from the village of prince arminius  the leader of the cherusci .      wayne tensed .     yeah  i know that village .  they didn   t like me much .         what do you suggest .         hunter   s team is still trying to reunite .  i want to find mc   and take him home while hunter is distracted .         i agree .  however  the only way to find him is to return to the outskirts of their village and wait for them to go home for the night .         why .  can   t we find them out in the forest some .  where  instead .         it is too late in the day now to locate them     said ishihara .     besides  i have no idea of where they would be  except by tracking them .  but we can rely on their need to return home by sundown .         i know roughly where they were not too long ago     wayne said quickly .     maybe we can intercept them .  i don   t want to go anywhere near that village again .      wayne tapped steve   s lapel pin .     i can monitor the radio communication between members of hunter   s team .  a bunch of germans attacked a roman patrol while mc   was with them .  they were over that way .     he pointed .     from the strength of the signal  i don   t think they were too far .         excellent     said ishihara .     after a bout of combat  they will probably have returned early to tend their wounded or dead .  they may be there already .  i suggest we move in the direction of the village of julius and prince arminius  despite your concern .  i shall remain with you  or very close  to protect you under the first law .         well .  .  . i guess if that   s where mc   is  i don   t have much choice .  but i don   t want to be captured by those german warriors again .         i understand     said ishihara .     i shall arrange a small fire and a lean to for your comfort tonight  at a safe distance from the village .  when you are comfortable  i shall attempt to observe mc   in the village this evening .  i shall look for another opportunity to take custody of him  but i shall consult with you before taking any action .         i still have some dried packaged food  but i   ll need water .         in this constant drizzle  i can provide enough water with no problem .         okay .     wayne got up wearily .     i can hardly wait to walk some more .  you know the way .         i do .      wayne gestured for him to lead .     the german warriors had fled from marcus   s patrol as suddenly as they had attacked .  he understood  they were merely letting their presence be known  to intimidate him a little .  the lightly armed germans had done no significant harm to the well armored  mounted romans .   however  more certain than ever that a real rebellion was on the way  marcus had led his patrol away from the site at a canter until the dense forest forced him to slow down .  before long  however  he located the section of muddy road that thousands of roman legionaries had churned to slop on their march .  moving as quickly as the horses could handle the mud  he caught up to the roman army again .  they were just breaking formation  ready to begin making camp for the night .   the roman army was still strung out along the road .  the baggage wagons brought up the rear and drivers struggled to turn the teams of horses and move them off the road .  in front of the baggage train  the infantry units marched away from the road to begin building the camp .  the cavalry units had already moved into the trees .   the three of them rode slowly through the crowd of legionaries and baggage wagons to the front .  there  marcus found the tent of governor varus being raised in what would become the center of the camp .  they were surrounded by legionaries shouting  giving orders  and hustling in different directions .  marcus leaped off his horse  looking around for the governor .      good day  tribune     governor varus called  moving away from a crowd of officers .     you look rather excited  marcus .  have any luck today .         i had a decury of cavalry with me     marcus said quickly .     governor  we were attacked by a small party of cherusci .  i wanted to report right away .         yes .         well .  .  . we were attacked  not too far from the river .  not far from here  really .         how far from here .         an hour   s ride .         by a small party .         yes  sir .         how many did we lose .         none  sir .         none .  how many of them did you get .         i believe we wounded most of them  but they got away .         you lost none and killed none .         i believe that is correct  sir .         marcus  was this a fight or a folk dance .     governor varus smirked .      sir .     marcus stiffened .     this was an attack by poorly armed germans on a trained cavalry patrol  but it was a serious skirmish .         oh  marcus  come on .  how serious could it have been   a battle without one single unfortunate left dead on the ground from either side .         their intent was to test our strength and our resolve     said marcus .     they were serious about that .         these minor tussles  marcus  are merely the burden of the conqueror .  they can be handled .     varus looked up at the sky .     this is the first excuse for a dry day we have had in some time  if you ignore a little drizzle .  i want to take a quick walk among the troops to boost their morale  before that infernal rain starts again .         but  sir  i really believe this skirmish is important .     marcus walked alongside the governor as he began to walk .     it means more than it seems .         marcus  i suggest you use this as a learning experience .  for instance  what do you believe should be done .         i think we should send out a series of patrols right now and also at dawn  to find out if larger bodies of germans have gathered elsewhere in these mountains .      governor varus laughed lightly  shaking his head .     well  you are dedicated  marcus  no one has ever doubted that .  but i don   t want to wear out a bunch of cavalry patrols on a wild goose chase  not after those poor animals slogged through knee deep mud in the road all day .         but  sir           i   ll tell you what  marcus     said the governor .     if you wish  take out a larger patrol and burn a german village in retaliation for their attack on your patrol .         that won   t bring the kind of large scale information i was talking about  sir .         that   s not an order  tribune .  it is merely an option you may wish to exercise .  make your own decision .         but  governor           excuse me  tribune .  i believe i will mingle with the troops alone .  see to your guests  eh .         yes  sir .     marcus stopped  his fists clenched in frustration as governor varus walked away .     jane remained mounted  at first  when marcus cantered up to governor varus .  when the grooms came forward to take their horses  she dismounted and stood with gene  a polite distance away .  when governor varus and marcus began walking away  she and gene remained where they were .      how much could you overhear .     gene asked .      only a little .  but it sounds like varus is so close minded that we don   t have much to worry about .         keep your voice down about that stuff     said gene  glancing nervously at some legionaries marching past them .     we can   t afford to sound like security risks .         sorry .  look  marcus is coming back .      marcus   s face was taut as he strode toward them .  he was as courteous as usual  however .     the governor   s tent is up .  let   s go sit down .      jane and gene followed him into the tent  where demetrius had already set up the furniture .  he was just lighting the oil lamps to provide some light and heat .  marcus gestured for jane and gene to sit and collapsed into a chair himself .      wine  demetrius     said marcus roughly .      yes  sir .  would you like that heated  sir .         yes  yes  of course .     marcus sighed  then slammed his fist down on the table angrily .   jane sat down  loosening her cloak around her  and glanced at gene  who was warming his hands over the fire .      he has no idea     marcus muttered .     look  i have every respect for governor varus .  but i just know he is missing something about these german tribes .      jane nodded  afraid to say anything .   marcus turned to gene .     in many ways  he is a fine man  but he is taking roman power for granted .         we are merely traders     said gene .   demetrius entered with a tray of bread and mulled wine .  he served it to the three of them in silence .  outside the tent  the men working to make camp shouted and called to each other .  marcus waved a hand for demetrius to leave .   jane tasted the wine carefully .  after a day out in the cold  the warmth was welcome .  the bread was not fresh  but it was better than nothing .      i could burn a village     said marcus .     i have the authority to do that .         burn a village .     jane looked up .      this is a normal form of retaliation .     marcus shook his head .     but in this case  it will simply spur greater resistance to us  and tell us nothing .      gene joined the other two at the table  saying nothing as he tore apart a piece of bread .   jane was more uncomfortable than ever .   marcus looked at gene .     maybe you have had a leader who made a mistake at one time or another .  how would you tell hunter  for instance  that he is wrong .         well .  .  . hunter is quite reasonable .  he is open to discussion .      marcus turned to jane .     you feel that way  as well .  how would you speak to him .         hunter can be persuaded  with enough evidence     said jane  over her goblet of wine .   marcus merely nodded and took another piece of bread .     you are fortunate .      they ate and drank in silence for a while .  when the bread and wine were gone  marcus brushed away crumbs and stood up .  jane rose too  waiting to see what he would say .      would you excuse me .  you may remain here  of course  and be comfortable .     marcus waved to demetrius  who was standing outside the tent .     bring them more if they wish .         i   m finished     said jane .      thank you  i   ve had plenty  too .     gene got up and joined jane .      very well     said marcus .     as you wish  of course .  make yourselves comfortable .     he ducked out of the tent and hurried away .      let   s take a little walk     said jane .  she wanted to talk to gene without demetrius listening .      sure .      outside the tent  roman legionaries surrounded them everywhere  but everyone was occupied .  gene and jane walked casually  staying out of the way of the troops and the work crews .  in turn  they were ignored .      do you think we   ve really messed up .     jane asked  pulling her cloak around her .     have we caused marcus to change his behavior significantly .         we have no way of knowing     said gene  pausing to watch another tent being raised .     i never came across marcus   s name in my history  at least that i can remember .  his actions may never have been written down by any historian .         i   m just afraid that the germans only attacked our patrol because marcus took us out today .  anything that the romans or germans do as a result of that skirmish could mean a significant change .      gene nodded .     i know  but look at it the other way .  maybe  even without us  marcus or some other patrol might have gone out today and been in a skirmish with the germans .  maybe it would have happened without us .         since mc   was with that bunch of germans  i suppose they were somehow influenced by his presence  too .         sure  it   s possible .  but we can   t know for sure .  and now we can   t undo it  either .         and what if he goes out to burn a village in retaliation after all .         it doesn   t sound like he really wants to .  but he might have done that without us  too .  after all  it   s a standard tactic in roman intimidation .         jane  gene .     hunter   s voice reached them from behind .   jane turned in surprise .     i   m glad to see you .         you are both well  i see .         we   re all right     said gene .     but we   re both worried about the changes we may have caused .         it   s marcus     said jane anxiously .     he   s trying harder than ever to convince governor varus that the germans are up to something .         because of the attack you told me about .     hunter glanced around the camp .      yes .         i understand .  what more do you know about mc   .  you said he was with the german party .         yes  but he kept trying to interfere with their fighting   to stop them under the first law .  they may not be very happy with him now .         yes  i agree     said hunter .     he would have a hard time explaining his actions to them   even if he could speak their language  which i doubt .  he remained with them after the combat had ended .      jane looked at gene  shrugging .      i couldn   t see  either     said gene .     but i suppose he is still with them .              as the legionaries and work crews continued to raise the camp around them  hunter quickly reviewed his historical data .  it did not contain enough detail to help him .     gene  has the governor so far altered anything because of marcus .         i don   t think so     said gene .     marcus is very angry right now over his failure to convince governor varus that the germans could be a real danger .  that must mean the governor has not changed his orders .         good     said hunter .     if the change has been confined to marcus  then it may not matter .  what about the germans .  are they acting differently .         sorry .     gene shook his head .     i   m afraid i can   t help you there .         no .         the historical records discuss the roman failure to prepare for the ambush in teutoburger forest  and the attack itself     said gene .     they really don   t give much detail about german preparations .  i suppose the roman historians never really knew too much about those details .         i have no idea what influence mc   could have had so far     said jane .     if he can   t speak german  which is probable  he might not have had much at all .  but if he displayed any robotic abilities that the germans considered more than human .  .  .     she shrugged .     anything could have happened .         that   s true     said gene .     the germans might have associated him in some way with their folk religion if he showed them any special abilities .         i understand     said hunter .     in the cases of both the romans and the germans  nothing critically important appears to have happened yet .  the danger is that a small event or two will snowball .         what do you think we should do .     jane asked .      i shall start by talking to marcus     said hunter .     where is he .      jane looked around .     he was here just a minute ago   there .     she pointed .     he   s talking to some people .         thank you .     hunter saw marcus talking to two other roman officers .  he approached them slowly  not wanting to appear to interfere .      i   m only asking you to think about it     marcus was saying to the other officers .      it   s this weather i   m worried about     one of them responded .     all we need is a mudslide or something on these horrible barbaric roads .         after all     said the other .     you   re the governor   s aide  marcus .  if you can   t convince him  i don   t see how the rest of us can .         maybe if we all spoke to him  in a formal meeting       marcus started .      sorry     said one of the other officers .     i have no wish to risk my career on predicting the behavior of these savages .         i would watch my tongue if i were you     said the other .     you don   t want to make the governor doubt your judgment in the future .      the other two officers walked away .  marcus sighed and looked around .  hunter hurried up to him .      good evening  tribune .         ah  hunter .  i wish it was .  i   m glad to see you are well  however .         i could not help but overhear part of your conversation     said hunter .     i know that roman army matters are none of my business  as a traveling trader  but would you like to talk  just between friends .         i could use a friend right now     marcus said grimly .  then he grinned wryly .     no  that   s too strong .  governor varus has been a good mentor .  but he just can   t see what   s right in front of him .         jane and gene told me you had a clash with the germans today .  you feel more is to come .         i   m certain of it .         have they skirmished like this with you before .     hunter asked .     you romans  i mean .         no  not recently .  not since prince arminius and the cherusci tribe were given status with the empire .  that was before i received my assignment here .      hunter nodded  trying to convey concern .     would you have ridden out today  if jane and gene had not enlisted your help in their own search .         no  i don   t think so .  but i was glad to do it .  don   t make any mistake about that .         you have been very kind .     hunter considered what little information he had .  knowing that he could make no more than a poorly educated guess  he estimated that so far  marcus and the germans had engaged in no more than a minor historical change .  he simply had to stop the damage right away .      it   s nothing  hunter .  besides  if i hadn   t taken them out today  i would never have received further evidence of german hostility .         what casualties were sustained .  on either side .         none for us  except for a few scratches and bruises .  i think we made a better showing against them  but they carried their wounded away .         so perhaps no retaliation is really called for .  you already got the best of them .         well .  .  . i guess you could look at it that way .     marcus grinned  finally .      tribune  .  i shall tell my party that we shall not interfere with you any further .  your army duties must come first .  i feel that we are entirely to blame for disrupting your normal routine .  please accept my apologies .         not at all  hunter .  i was glad to help .  but i will respect your wishes  of course .         i do not want to disturb you further     said hunter .     i shall rejoin jane and gene .         as you wish .  you will all be my guests for dinner  of course .     marcus nodded and walked away .   hunter returned to jane and gene  who were standing near the governor   s tent .      what do you think .     jane asked .     have we really made a bad mistake .         i told him we shall not interfere with army routine again     said hunter .     if the german ambush of this army takes place as it should  then we have not caused irreparable harm to the sequence of events .         what do you want us to do now .     gene asked .      i want to reunite the team     said hunter quietly  looking around to make sure none of the romans was close enough to listen .     however  attempting to bring steve here tonight does not seem wise .         do you want us to go with you .     jane tugged her cloak tighter around her .     we   ve had a long day  but if we have to go  then we have to go .         no .  i don   t want to take you two away from the safety of the roman camp for tonight .         are you going to go after him yourself .     gene asked .     that means we split up again .         unwise  also  i think     said hunter .     i cannot reunite the team by shuttling back and forth between you two and steve .  i shall spend the night here .         are you going to explain to him what   s going on .     jane looked out across the darkening forest .     maybe we could make plans to meet tomorrow .         no .  since steve no longer has a communicator pin  calling him is not possible .         then our plan of action begins tomorrow     said gene .      yes     said hunter .     for now  we shall merely accept roman hospitality and safety for the night .        steve returned with vicinius to his village with growing pessimism .  they had basically wasted the day walking in a big circle .  steve was getting tired of wasting so much time looking for mc   .   at least he found dinner hot and plentiful .  that night he accepted a bowl of stew made from chunks of boar meat with a variety of nuts and grains .  steve supposed the latter had been part of the fall harvest .  he sat with vicinius and odover at the fire in the waning sunlight  eating quietly .   the sound of a horse   s hooves caused everyone to turn .  a tall  burly german in furs rode bareback into the village  followed by a large party of german warriors on foot .  he had shoulder length blond hair and a proudly grim expression .  many of the villagers leaped up to greet him .  odover  the village chief  laid down his bowl near the fire and got to his feet slowly  with the dignity of age .      prince arminius     vicinius whispered to steve quickly .     remain here .  lately  he has not been fond of strangers who come from west of the rhine .      steve nodded .  vicinius jumped up and joined his father  walking to meet their new visitors .  all through the village  people were running up to shout greetings to prince arminius  especially the young warriors .   amid all the shouts  steve had difficulty hearing what anyone was saying .  of course  he already knew the purpose of prince arminius   s visit  he had to be gathering warriors for his attack on the romans .  steve was surprised  however  to see that he was not just a loudmouthed rabble rouser .  within several minutes  the villagers were standing quietly as he moved among them  greeting individuals and talking to them one at a time .  steve could see the warriors of the village pushing forward to hear him speak .   from the phrases and snatches of conversation steve could hear  prince arminius was simply encouraging everyone  talking about the pride and strength of the cherusci tribe .  other members of his entourage were doing the same  greeting friends of their own in the village .  the warriors of odover   s village were excited and hoisted their spears in greeting .   vicinius returned to steve  grinning  and sat down with him again .     prince arminius is very popular .  he is a brave warrior and leader .  as the son of odover  i had to greet him with my father .         of course .  don   t worry about me .  if you need to talk to the rest of them  go ahead .         no  i am ready .     he looked at steve carefully .     we must drive the roman soldiers from our country .  a trading party  now  that is different .  you come in friendship .  but i am ready to answer prince arminius   s call .  and now i expect it to come soon .      steve nodded .     i understand .  no one wants to be ruled by others .         vicinius .      vicinius turned and looked up .     hello  julius .         hah .  when we have run these roman dogs out of our land  we will drop these latin names again  eh .     julius glared at steve .     who is this foreigner .         my guest     vicinius said firmly .     he is seeking a lost companion  in fact .  a short  slender man  touched by the gods and wandering in the forest .  if you        julius   s eyes narrowed .     what about him .         you know where he is .     steve stood up suddenly .     i need to find him .         vicinius  who is this man .     julius demanded .      he is steve  the slave of a trader from gaul .     vicinius got up  also  and pushed in front of julius .      a roman spy  more likely .     julius shoved vicinius aside .     and he has heard too much here tonight .         i   m no spy     steve said mildly  figuring that a slave might be rather meek in the face of an angry warrior .     i   ve been separated from my           i say you are .     julius put a large hand against steve   s chest and shoved .      hey .     steve slapped his hand away  stumbling backward from his assailant   s greater weight .      he is my guest .     vicinius grabbed julius   s arm .   as steve regained his balance  he saw julius swivel and punch vicinius in the stomach  catching him by surprise .  while vicinius fell to his knees  doubled forward  julius reached for a large knife in the side of his leather belt .  a few of the other villagers gasped in shock  but most had not yet even noticed the sudden action .   steve knew instantly that he could not fight julius hand to hand once the german warrior was ready .  this was his only moment to strike .  just as julius yanked the knife out  steve launched himself forward in a flying tackle  grabbing julius around the waist .  steve drove him backward and down .   the moment they landed on the cold  soggy ground  steve rolled off and kicked julius   s hand .  the knife rolled free  but did not go very far .  steve scrambled for it  but vicinius snatched it up and stood  holding it in a fighting position as he faced toward julius .      stop .     vicinius ordered .   by now  other villagers had gathered around them .  their shouts of alarm and surprise had stopped as they watched to see what would happen next .  steve stood up and edged around behind vicinius  eyeing julius suspiciously .      you will respect my guest in this village     vicinius said coldly .  he tossed the knife down at julius   s feet .      julius .     prince arminius spoke firmly  striding through the crowd as others made way for him .     save your energy for the romans .  we must go .      steve said nothing as prince arminius turned with a swirl of his fur cloak and strode back toward his horse .  julius angrily grabbed his knife and stomped after him .  most of the crowd of villagers followed them .      you are quick     said vicinius .     i almost tossed you my own knife and just let you fight it out .         really .     steve grinned wryly .     i   m glad you didn   t .  i   m no fighter .         i had to stop him .  julius may not assault any guest of mine .  you are under the protection of my hospitality here .     vicinius gave him a slap on the shoulder that jarred him .      i think he knows something about mc       said steve .     did you see how he reacted .  can we find out .     he started after prince arminius and julius .      no .  not now .     vicinius grasped his arm and held it firmly  stopping him .      can you help .  maybe prince arminius           no     he repeated with finality .     prince arminius is in no mood to talk about anything but war against the romans .  nor will julius speak with you .  remain here .      steve did not resist .  as julius and prince arminius gathered the rest of their party  he looked around in the trees at the edge of the village .  night had fallen  leaving the forest too dark for him to see much  except in the dim  flickering torchlight that reached that far .      i wish hunter was here     steve muttered .   vicinius said nothing  but he released steve   s arm .  together  they watched the visitors leave the village .  even after they had left  the warriors of the village remained gathered  talking excitedly among themselves .      the time for action is coming     said vicinius quietly .     coming soon .      steve nodded .     and mc   is still out there .              wayne spent the early evening watching in a mixture of relief and amazement as ishihara made a small lean to .  ishihara used only fallen logs and dead branches  carefully avoiding damage to any living plants .  when he had finished the shelter  he gathered deadwood and made a small fire .   by the softly crackling fire  wayne ate more of his packaged food and then bundled up under the lean to for the night .  ishihara sat against a tree trunk  ready to tend the fire through the night .  with the fire for warmth and the robot standing guard  wayne slept very well .   in the morning  wayne ate while ishihara carefully took apart the lean to and scattered the pieces around the forest floor .  wayne felt that the precaution was not necessary  but he did not bother to argue .  he was just glad to have ishihara   s help .      what is our plan today .     ishihara asked .      we   re going to hang out by that village again  remember .  and look for mc   .         all right .  as soon as i put out the fire completely  we can go .      wayne got to his feet and looked up at the sky .  it was still gray  of course  but no rain was falling .  if he was lucky  they would grab mc   that day  before the weather turned worse  and they could go home .     at first light  the roman bugler woke the entire roman camp  including gene and jane .  as the legionaries began to bustle with activity  hunter waited outside the tent for gene and jane to rise and dress .  as before  the sky was gray and the air moist and damp  but no rain was falling .  gene joined him  jane left the tent and hurried toward the latrine .  no romans were nearby .      i am going to search for steve alone today  after all     said hunter .      what .     gene looked at him in surprise .     i thought you didn   t want to shuttle back and forth between us and steve anymore .  look  jane and i can be ready to go pretty quickly .  we just need some breakfast and that won   t take long .  we won   t slow you down .         i considered this problem during the night     said hunter .     i feel that both of you will be safest with the romans until shortly before the actual ambush .  you told me you cannot give me the date of the battle  but can you estimate if it is imminent .         well  maybe this will help     said gene slowly .     the german ambush took place when the roman troops were moving through a rugged mountain pass .  it was between the weser river  which is visible down the slope right below us  and the sites of some german cities that don   t exist yet .  i would say we   re getting pretty close to the spot .         that may help .     hunter reviewed the terrain he had seen the previous day in the direction that the romans would travel after breaking camp .     i do not believe any mountain passes are within today   s marching distance .         then it won   t happen today .         all right .  that is good .  i shall go straight to vicinius   s village this morning  since i left him with steve out in the forest yesterday .         what should we do .  we can meet you out there someplace if you want .         no  we shall lose track of each other again     said hunter .     i shall bring him back to the roman army for tonight  meeting you wherever i can on the march .  tomorrow morning  when we are all together again  we can leave the romans in time to avoid the battle .         okay .     gene shrugged .      tell jane the current plan     said hunter .     i should begin my journey .         got it .      hunter did not bother requesting a horse  since that might cause another minor historical change  his team had risked enough of those .  besides  he could reach the village on foot soon enough for his purpose .  the question of whether marcus would still decide to burn a village because of hunter   s team had sharpened his concern over small changes starting larger ones .   the sentries at the gate opened it for hunter as he approached .  he merely nodded his thanks and slipped out into the forest again .  if he could reach steve by midday  as he expected  then he could at least have his team together again by night .  as the battle approached  he was determined to have his team together where he could keep them safe .  mc   could wait until they were reunited .     marcus arranged for gene and jane to ride with him at the head of the roman column with governor varus .  this was a little unusual for guests  but the governor said nothing about it .  marcus had come to feel responsible for them .  on the march  he rode on the governor   s right  with jane and gene to the right of him .   advance patrols were riding out  as usual  to check the road .  marcus had asked them to take special pains in looking for signs of hostility  but he had not succeeded in convincing them that the governor was overconfident  either .  besides  as an aide to the governor  he had prestige but no direct authority in their chain of command .   when the column halted for its midday meal and a rest  marcus reined in and looked out across the country ahead before dismounting .     well  it could be worse  i guess .         what do you see .     jane asked .   marcus pointed into the distance .     for the rest of today  the road skirts the edge of this mountain  high upon the slope .  and the ground above us is fairly clear   it only has some scrub trees and open meadows .  no one can hide up there to attack us .  if they come across that area from somewhere else  we   ll have plenty of warning .      governor varus had already dismounted and handed his reins to a groom  but he looked up with a weary smile .     tribune  i   m glad you feel safer now than you did this morning .     shaking his head  he walked away .   marcus sighed and dismounted as well .  then he saw one of the advance patrols returning to the column  where they would report to the centurion who was their immediate superior .     excuse me a moment  will you .         of course     said jane  jumping to the ground .     i   ll take a little walk .         i   ll just relax right here     said gene .     and try not to get in the way .      marcus picked his way through the crowd of legionaries and horses to the advance patrol .  they had dismounted and were holding their horses impatiently  anxious to be dismissed .  the commander of the patrol  a man named adrianus  was breathlessly giving his report .  marcus approached them to listen .       .  .  . so many villages in the area that are empty     adrianus was saying .      what .     marcus interrupted .     excuse me  centurion  but i want to hear this  too .  adrianus  you say that some german villages are completely empty .      the centurion  a man named fabius albinus  waited patiently .  marcus was glad  the centurion would be within his rights to tell the governor   s aide to go away .  of course  at some point in the future  he could find that annoying the governor   s aide unnecessarily had been a mistake .      uh   no  sir  i didn   t mean they were totally empty     said adrianus .     i just meant  they   re empty of all their fighting men .         how many villages .         every village we passed  sir .  all day .         but the women  children  and old men were still there .     marcus asked .      yes  sir .         did you ask them where the men were .         yes  sir .  they said  out in the fields or out hunting .     adrianus glanced at his men  behind him  some of whom nodded agreement .      did you go past their fields .         of course we did .  the harvest is past .  all the fields are deserted .         you don   t think they   re hunting  tribune .     fabius looked at marcus .     game has been plentiful  it would tempt a man to go out after it .         too many men are missing all at once just to be hunting     said marcus .     game has been plentiful  a major hunt with many men at one time is unnecessary .         excuse me  sir   we saw some of the men     said adrianus .     here and there .         where .     marcus demanded .     doing what .         avoiding us  mostly .  they slipped away into the woods pretty fast when they saw us .  but they were generally headed that way .     he pointed up ahead .      on our line of march .     marcus asked  looking where he was pointing .      well   not along the road .     adrianus frowned thoughtfully .     from what we could see  they were going overland .  but their route could intersect ours  i guess .         they   re traveling overland through the forest to avoid being seen if possible     said marcus .     and even though you spotted some of them  i doubt you saw any more than the smallest fraction .  adrianus  what do you make of it .         uh .  .  .     adrianus glanced uncomfortably at his immediate superior  aware that the army   s formal position was that no danger was present .      speak freely     said marcus  eyeing the centurion pointedly .     i want to hear your opinion .         well  something is up  sir .  looks to me like they   re planning a fight .         i think so  too     said marcus .     arminius is making his move .     he turned and strode away  leaving adrianus to complete his report to fabius .   the real danger now  marcus told himself  was not from the germans .  they were poorly armed  poorly armored  and generally undisciplined on the battlefield .  the danger was in the attitude of governor varus  who was being reckless enough to invite disaster despite the many advantages that the roman army possessed .   this time  marcus did not simply want to run up to the governor like a panicked new recruit .  he had apparently lost some of governor varus   s respect already over this matter .  instead  he would have to maintain his dignity and try to approach the subject casually .   marcus joined governor varus at his cookfire  where demetrius had prepared their noonday meal .  jane and gene were just sitting down on a couple of large rocks there as well  accepting plates of beans fried in bacon grease .  it was normal marching fare  quick and easy to prepare .      i don   t like the look of those foul clouds     said governor varus  glancing up .     or the way the wind is coming up .  we   ve had a short reprieve these last few days from the infernal rain .  now i would say we   ll get another downpour tonight or tomorrow .  what do you think  marcus .      marcus took his plate from demetrius and looked up .     yes  governor .  i think a storm is building .  the winds through these mountains are unpredictable  though .  i would say  it will hit us tomorrow .      governor varus nodded  chewing  then swallowed .     gene  what do you think .         uh   we don   t have mountains like this where i   m from     said gene .     but it looks like rain again soon .      governor varus nodded .     marcus  i hope i have not been too hard on you about these germans .         well  sir   i know i haven   t been here as long as you have .  one of our patrols returned just now with some information  however .         mm .     the governor   s mouth was full .      they found that the fighting men have left the villages .     instead of pressing his argument  marcus paused to eat for a moment .   jane and gene looked at each other .      i wouldn   t worry     governor varus said to them .     they   re probably out hunting .         our patrol spotted some of them     said marcus .     they were sneaking through the forest overland  off the road  moving up ahead of us .         maybe they have good hunting grounds that way     said jane .  her voice was quiet  oddly timid .      oh  i suppose there may be some troublemakers among them     said governor varus .     all of rome   s many subject peoples get restless from time to time .  that doesn   t mean they can mount a serious rebellion .         it might be worth checking out     said marcus  looking at the governor hopefully .      our patrols should be sufficient     said governor varus .     after all  they brought back this information .  they can handle it .         it wouldn   t hurt       marcus began .     no  no .  you see  this province is virtually an extension of gaul .     the governor turned to gene .     how long has gaul been conquered  now .         about half a century     said gene .      and have you seen any objection to roman rule there in your lifetime .         well  no .  i haven   t .     he smiled slightly .      the germans are also subjugated     said governor varus .     i expect in a few years we will be ready to press eastward  to conquer the land beyond the elbe river .     he shrugged  and continued eating .      may i have the commander of the patrol report directly to you  sir .     marcus asked .     maybe if           no .     governor varus tossed aside his empty plate and stood up .     tribune  i have tired of this subject .  do not bring me any officer .  do not argue with me any further .  you are expressly forbidden from discussing any changes in marching orders with regular officers or interfering with existing army directives of any kind in any way .  and if you have any questions for the germans  you may ask them tonight .  the matter is closed .     he waved a hand in dismissal .   marcus stood up  his appetite gone .  as demetrius began cleaning up  marcus turned to gene and jane .     what do you think .  based on what you heard .         uh       caught off guard  gene looked at jane and shrugged .     well .  .  . i   m a trader  not a soldier .         i   m not asking you as a soldier     said marcus .      just as someone who has overheard what i told the governor .  what do you think .         i think     jane said slowly     that the governor should respect your opinions more .      marcus was startled .     well   thank you .  but do you think i   m being reckless .         did the men in the advance patrol share your opinion .     gene asked .      yes  at least their field commander did .  his superior didn   t .         i   m sure you know your business     gene said carefully .     i   m sorry you can   t get the governor to listen to you .         me  too     said jane  with a tight little smile .   marcus nodded .     well .  .  . thank you for the thought .   it   s time to mount up .         what did he mean about asking the germans questions tonight .     jane asked .   marcus took his reins from the groom .     it means that we are feasting with some of their leaders tonight  in camp .  probably prince arminius himself  among others .     he shook his head in disgust and mounted .           when steve rose the next morning  he kept close to vicinius and said very little .  the village was in a warlike mood  even early in the morning  the warriors sat by the cookfires tending their weapons  scraping the shafts of their spears smooth and sharpening their knives and their few swords on rocks .  steve could do nothing at this stage but wait for hunter to come back for him .   as the morning wore on  steve still sat by the fire near vicinius   s hut  watching the groups of warriors .  after steve finished eating  he still did not want to risk doing anything that would attract attention to himself .  chief odover walked among the warriors  talking quietly and nodding approval when they showed him their weapons .   vicinius spoke to them for a while  but then returned to his fire .  he sat down with steve and he used a small stone to sharpen his spear point .  no one else came near them .      are you going to war today .     steve asked quietly  watching vicinius patiently slide the stone across the metal with a regular  steady motion .      today or tonight  i think     said vicinius .     my father told me a little while ago that prince arminius will send someone to get us .  he is feasting with the romans tonight .         he is .         you may remain here  of course .  it is not your fight .      suddenly a chorus of shouts arose from the far side of the village .  when steve looked up  he saw the warriors crowding around hunter as he emerged from the trees  his head and shoulders visible over the shorter germans .  the warriors were shouting angrily at him .      hey .     vicinius leaped up and ran toward them .     hunter is my guest here  remember .      steve hesitated  watching the others .  then he decided that staying close to hunter was a good idea .  he walked forward slowly  following vicinius .   the warriors were dragging hunter forward now  shouting at him .  steve knew that hunter could pull away from them if he wanted  but he would not leave steve alone in a hostile atmosphere .  finally the warriors shoved hunter toward vicinius .      your friends are spies .     one of the warriors pointed angrily at vicinius .      watch your tongue  sigismund     said vicinius  standing with hunter in front of steve .      he came from the direction of the roman camp .     sigismund jabbed his spear point into the ground .     some of us were out looking for more branches to use as spear shafts  and we saw him coming .      most of the warriors began yelling again  but odover approached them and stood quietly between vicinius and sigismund .  everyone quieted  waiting to see what the village chief would say .  he turned to hunter .      the question is a good one     said odover patiently .     tell us where you spent the night .  were you with the romans .         i was     said hunter .   the warriors began yelling again  but odover held up his hand for silence .  he got it .      you have been our guest here .  what have you told the romans of us .         i told them i am still searching for all the members of my party     said hunter .     i wish to return home to safety with them  nothing more .         he lies     sigismund growled .      test him     steve said suddenly .     see what he   ll tell you about them  instead .     since the germans were clearly about to mount their attack  and were supposed to defeat the romans anyway  steve figured that helping them a little would be acceptable .  besides  hunter could be trusted to judge for himself what to reveal .      speak  hunter     odover said quietly .      tell us their line of march     said sigismund  glaring at hunter .      they march along the road that overlooks the weser river     said hunter .     today  it will take them high on the shoulder of a mountain overlooking the river  with open country above it .  tomorrow the country becomes more rugged  and they will have to choose between a couple of different passes through the mountains .         that is right     said sigismund slowly .     from what i have heard .         prince arminius knows his business     said hunter .     all we ask is to go in peace and gather our party together .         keep them here     said sigismund .     until the action has begun .         no     said vicinius .     they will not be prisoners here .  i brought them here as my guests and they will go in peace .     he turned to hunter and nodded .      steve .     hunter inclined his head toward the forest and began to walk that way .   steve glanced at vicinius  who was shifting his position to remain between sigismund and hunter .  then steve trotted toward the edge of the village  paralleling hunter so he would not have to pass any of the hostile warriors .  as soon as he reached the trees  he slowed down to pick his way through the underbrush to hunter .   suddenly shouts rose up behind him .  when he turned to look  he saw sigismund shove vicinius aside and lead the warriors after hunter and him  shaking their weapons .  steve took off at a run  crashing through the bushes and dodging around trees .      this way  steve     hunter called .  he angled behind steve  cutting off the warriors .     run .         like i didn   t know better     steve muttered  pausing to yank his cloak free of a branch .   the warriors were yelling at the edge of the village  but that was all they were doing .  they were not throwing their spears or shooting arrows .  steve decided  as he shoved between a couple of large bushes  that they were merely helping their visitors on their way .   after a few minutes  steve stopped to catch his breath .  the village was already out of sight .  hunter joined him .      you are well .     hunter asked .      yeah  i   m fine .  now what .         we shall spend the night with jane and gene in the roman camp .  tomorrow  i believe  the attack will take place .  we shall leave the romans tomorrow morning and avoid the violence .         sounds good to me .     steve looked up at the sky .  through the canopy of trees and the dark clouds  he could see only a hint of the sun   s position .     but it   s only late morning now  isn   t it .  we have the rest of the day .  you want to go back to the romans already .         we must not let them get too far from us     said hunter .     because of the heavy wagons in their baggage train  and the time they require to prepare in the morning and to make camp at night  they will move more slowly than we shall .  however  since we are both on foot  our advantage is not too great .         from everything i   ve heard  mc   may be over at a neighboring village .  at least  they know something about him .  i think we ought to take a look .         i agree     said hunter .     we should try to avoid both german warriors who may be moving and also any roman patrols .  at this stage  both sides are becoming wary of strangers .         it   s okay with me .  but  i don   t know if i can find this other village .         there are many trails through the forest .  i know which general direction to take .  we shall find it .      steve had little to say as hunter chose a direction and led him through the trees .  asking him how he was making his choices would invite an answer that was more complicated than it was worth .  between the data about the terrain and the forest that hunter had stored continuously since arriving  and his enhanced hearing  hunter was using too much information that he would have to explain at length .  steve decided just to keep walking .   hunter located a trail fairly quickly but they left it periodically to avoid germans hunter heard coming .  some were warriors walking with a quiet determination .  others were old men simply out gathering firewood .  when the germans had passed  hunter returned to the trail .   on several occasions  he mentioned to steve that he could hear small groups of horses in the distance .  they were almost certainly roman patrols  but they never drew near enough to alter hunter   s direction .  hunter and steve spent several hours moving through the forest  sometimes retracing their steps and moving from one trail to another .     wayne spent much of the day hiding outside the village of prince arminius .  ishihara was adept at moving them to remain upwind of the village dogs and to avoid the war parties that kept arriving in the village .  prince arminius received each war party enthusiastically .  then he sent them on their way  always in the same direction .  julius remained near him  and mc   stayed close to julius .      julius must have said something to him about helping him or not straying too far     said wayne .     mc   has to be responding to a second law instruction to behave so consistently .         very likely     said ishihara .      when they found me here  they tied me up .  yet they seem to have adopted him .         perhaps his willingness to cooperate under the second law made him seem like a friend     said ishihara .      yeah  maybe .  he must have shown up as a kind of lost crazy man .  but it   s all going to make getting him away harder .  if he won   t leave julius   s side  we   ll have to hope julius and mc   go take a few minutes away from everyone else .         i have observed julius   s trip to the latrine in the hope that they would be alone     said ishihara .     however  with so many visiting warriors  that has not been the case .         you have any suggestions .     wayne asked sourly .      only to wait for our opportunity     said ishihara .     impatience would be a mistake .         i was afraid you   d say that .        marcus did not speak to the governor as they rode side by side at the head of the army during the afternoon .  occasionally he made a few friendly observations to jane about the weather or the scenery .  actually  however  he was carefully eyeing the muddy road ahead as they topped every rise and rounded every curve .   he did not expect german warriors to appear unannounced on the open slopes that the army was crossing that day .  what he was looking for was rugged  difficult terrain in the distance that they would have to cross the next day or the day after that .  late in the afternoon  when the army halted to make camp  he remained mounted and examined the winding route that lay in front of them .      what is it  marcus .     jane looked from the road back to him .     you see something .         nothing dangerous at this moment     said marcus .     but do you see how the road forks  down this slope in the distance .      jane paused  looking .  finally she nodded .     oh  i see it  now .  the army will reach that fork in the first hour of marching tomorrow .         i   m not sure which way we   re going .  but the fork on the left leads into some very rugged country .      governor varus dismounted and glanced up at him .     something wrong  tribune .         no  sir .  uh   i thought i might take our guests on a brief ride back along the troops for a moment  though  if they   re interested in seeing the sights .         you haven   t had enough riding for the day .     governor varus shook his head  handed his reins to a groom  and wearily walked away .      would you come with me for a moment .     marcus asked  looking at jane and gene .      sure .     gene shrugged .      lead on     said jane .   marcus steered them around to the side of the column  which was dispersing to build the camp .  he rode back to fabius albinus  the centurion in command of the advance patrols .  fabius had just dismounted  and was dismissing one of the patrols that had just returned and reported .      centurion     said marcus  looking down at him .     have your patrols reported whether any german villages are close by .         yes  sir  they have .  several are close .         i have a favor to ask  fabius .     marcus made his tone more casual  since he had no direct authority to give fabius an order .     i   d like to see a few of them myself  but i don   t dare go without a large escort .         i can send a couple of decuries with you .  almost all the patrols have rejoined us now .         i had more in mind  fabius .  would you ride out with me   and bring your entire troop .         the entire century .         would you mind .  perhaps for an hour  no more .         the men have been riding all day .  they   re ready to stand down     fabius said slowly .   marcus merely waited  as fabius studied his face .  they both knew the time would come when marcus could return the favor .      all right  marcus .  i   ll take them out with you .         thank you  fabius .  i won   t forget it .      as fabius mounted again and called out his orders  jane moved up next to marcus and leaned close to him .      marcus .  are you going to get into trouble over this with the governor .      surprised that she would question his decision  he almost ordered her to back away .  her tone of genuine concern stopped him  however .  next to her  gene also was watching him .  after all  they had heard the governor tell him earlier not to interfere with existing marching orders or army directives .      it may be a problem     marcus said quietly .     but if i can learn something that will convince the governor to stop a disaster  then this will be worth the risk .         please don   t     said jane .      i   ll be fine .  but i must ask you two to remain in camp with demetrius .  i will be back soon .              fabius had his century of cavalry mounted and in formation in only moments .  he nodded to marcus  who drew up next to him at the head of the column .  then fabius spurred his mount to lead them out .      halt .  halt  i say .      marcus clenched his teeth at the sound of governor varus   s voice .  he forced himself to remain calm  however .  on his left  the governor angrily strode across the mud toward him .  behind governor varus  jane and gene had dismounted but were watching .      centurion  dismiss your troop     said the governor .     return to your normal duties .         governor varus       fabius began .      don   t waste your breath     governor varus growled .     the tribune doesn   t need any excuses from you .      fabius turned and began a quick stream of orders to his century .      get down  marcus     ordered the governor .     governor  we need to know what the local villages           or you may lose your position  tribune .  dismount .      marcus jumped to the ground .      i have already heard all of your arguments .  i will not listen to them again .  prince arminius will be joining us at any time  with some members of his own party .  i suggest you remain at my tent with your guests .  alert me the moment prince arminius arrives .     governor varus turned and hurried away .   marcus sighed .  at least he was still a tribune .  he took the reins of his horse and walked toward the governor   s tent  which had been raised already .     jane stood silently with gene as marcus led his horse past them and handed his reins to a groom .  when marcus had moved out of hearing  she turned to gene and shrugged .  they had heard the entire exchange between the governor and marcus .  around them  the new camp was slowly going up .      it was kind of a dirty trick  wasn   t it .     jane drew her cloak tighter around her .      we had no choice     said gene .     we had to point out marcus   s intentions to the governor .  there was no other way to stop him and he might have discovered tomorrow   s ambush if he had ridden out right now in strength .         you   re sure now that it   s coming tomorrow .         yeah .     gene nodded  looking at her grimly .     the governor said that prince arminius is coming tonight .  the german entourage feasts with the romans tonight that means the attack is tomorrow .         then hunter had better get back here tonight and get us away from the romans  as he planned .         exactly .         late in the day hunter and steve were hidden in the forest outside the village .  they had watched mc   following julius around in the village as other warriors came and went .  then prince arminius had led a group of warriors out of the village  but julius  mc    and most of the warriors from this village had remained .   when prince arminius had left  hunter had raised his hearing to maximum sensitivity as a safety measure .  immediately after doing so  he had detected the presence of two figures also hidden in the brush nearby .  he turned to steve .      we are not alone in observing this village .  two others are doing the same  roughly a hundred yards to our left  completely out of sight .         romans .         i doubt it .  they have been relying on cavalry patrols for this kind of work .         then who is it .         i suspect that one is wayne and the other probably a german warrior whom wayne has somehow convinced to help him .  judging by their position and their lack of movement  they have not yet noticed our presence .         maybe we should grab wayne     whispered steve .     get him out of our way once and for all .         doing so now would cause a disturbance     said hunter .     it would reveal our presence and thereby our interest in observing this village .         hold it   you mean you   re just going to let wayne stay right here with his eye on mc   and leave him here .  hunter  that   s crazy   even worse  irrational .         i disagree .  i see no way in which wayne can rush into the village and grab mc   .  we know that mc   is surrounded by too many germans  all of whom are looking for a fight .      steve shook his head in disbelief .     well  we still have to decide what we   re going to do for the night .  it   s getting late now  anyway .  if we   re going to find the roman camp tonight  we have to get moving .  it   s a long walk from here .         getting mc   now would endanger too many humans     said hunter .      he will resist and they will defend him .  with that many opponents  i would not be able to get him away without harming them .         at the very least  let   s go sneak up on wayne and get a good look at him   at least a positive identification .  that way we   ll know for sure .         yes  that is wise .  i can make this approach more efficiently alone  however .  please remain here .         yeah  okay .      hunter started to move when he received a signal on his internal receiver .     hunter  jane calling .         yes  jane     hunter radioed .      the romans are making camp again for the night     she said quietly .     we found out that prince arminius is bringing a party of germans here for a feast .  gene says that means the attack will start tomorrow .         are you in danger now .         no .  we   re fine .  but i can   t talk long .  we   re in the middle of camp .  gene and i are huddled together pretending to talk to each other .         does gene anticipate danger tonight .         i   m here  hunter     said gene .     no  i don   t .  we just wanted to make sure you were kept up to date .         hunter .     steve looked at him .     something wrong .         i have a call from jane and gene     hunter said aloud .     please wait .         should we still follow the original plan .     gene asked .     are you rejoining us here tonight or should we try to meet you somewhere .         steve is with me now     said hunter .     remain where you are .  we shall come back to the roman camp tonight and reunite the team  as planned .  hunter out .      steve was still watching hunter curiously .      we shall go to the new roman camp now     said hunter .     the attack will begin tomorrow .         wait a minute .     steve   s eyes widened .     you mean we   re going to leave mc   right here .  we almost have him .  we could grab him and take him back to our time   then come back for jane and gene .         i do not dare take the risk     said hunter .     i still feel that we are not very close to apprehending mc   .  the fact that we have been able to see him does not imply that we can simply grab him and run .         but he   s the entire reason we   re here .  isn   t taking the opportunity worth the risk .         i must balance the risk to harm of our future with the danger of harm to the individual warriors and to you .  remember  some of the germans in the village may play an important role in the battle .  if i injure them  i could also alter our future .  nor can i risk harm to you unnecessarily .         well .  .  .     steve shook his head .     i can   t think of an argument against that .  but i hate walking away from mc   when he   s so close .         i believe that julius will join the attack and that mc   will go with him .  we will know where to find him .         yeah  all right .  i guess .     steve shrugged .      in any case  if we get mc   in custody while the team is together  we can leave immediately .  that is the most desirable plan of action .         you   re the boss .      hunter listened carefully for signs of movement in the two strangers but heard nothing .  the wind had not changed  so they were still upwind of the village dogs .  he turned and slipped through the trees once more  with steve behind him .     steve was exhausted by the time they reached the new roman camp .  night had fallen  but the sky over the palisade fence was brightly lighted by the flickering glow of many fires .  the sentries saw them coming and when hunter merely waved  they opened the front gate .   inside  steve saw why the sentries were in a friendly mood .  a feast was well under way  with boars and deer roasting on spits all over the camp .  the soldiers were talking and drinking  around some of the fires  groups were singing .   outside the governor   s tent  a tight ring of torches on tall posts surrounded the main party .  they were seated on logs around a boar roasting over a roaring fire .  in the light thrown by the fire  steve could see governor varus  some soldiers he guessed were top officers of the army  and a large group of bearded german guests dressed in heavy furs .      do you see jane and gene anywhere .     steve asked .     or marcus .         yes     said hunter .     marcus is seated behind the governor .  jane and gene are sitting with him .  we should walk around the outside of the circle to the far side .         whatever you say .      steve followed hunter on a long route through the crowds of festive legionaries .  jane saw them coming first and waved .  marcus and gene greeted them when they arrived  but the tribune did not bother to tell the governor about their arrival .   hunter and steve sat next to gene  on the far side from marcus .  in the row ahead of them  steve could see prince arminius sitting next to governor varus .  the german on the other side of prince arminius was a little shorter  an older man with long steel gray hair and a lined face .      gene .     steve leaned close to him .     any idea who the old guy is .  all the other germans here are of warrior age .         i know who he is  all right .  his name is segestes .  he   s prince arminius   s father .         really .     hunter asked .     why is he not the prince of the cherusci  then .         arminius was elected chief of the cherusci     said gene .     he commanded a troop of german auxiliaries in the roman army a few years ago and was elected chief after he quit that position .  and segestes has had considerable friction with his son .     gene glanced over at them to make sure no one outside the team  including marcus  was listening .      what is wrong .     hunter asked .   gene lowered his voice .     sometime tonight  segestes will get varus alone and betray arminius   s plan to rebel tomorrow .  but he can   t convince the governor any more than marcus has been able to .         it   s hard to believe governor varus is so hardheaded     jane whispered .     he has all these warnings and all the evidence around him  if he only would look at it .         we must be glad he does not change his mind     hunter reminded her .      history is full of people who were blind like that     said gene .     many historical figures seem incredibly blind  ignorant  or stupid in their actions  but of course we have the advantage of hindsight .         yeah  he   s overconfident     said steve .     i guess when you look at how well armed and organized the romans are  and then look at the furs and the few weapons the germans have  it   s understandable .         discontinue this line of talk     said hunter .     we are taking a reckless chance of being overheard .  save it for when we are alone  preferably back home .      soon the boar on the spit in front of the governor was fully roasted  at least on the outside .  roman slaves carved off chunks of it  demetrius served them with plenty of wine and freshly baked bread .  meanwhile  the remainder of the boar still roasted over the fire .   steve eagerly accepted his dinner .  the meat was tough and greasy  but he was too hungry to care .  conversation stopped while the team ate .   after a while  marcus set his plate down on the ground  with food still on it .  he picked up his wine goblet and stood up  studying the germans in the front row by the fire .  jane looked up at him curiously .      i think i will mingle with our guests     he said grimly .  then  forcing a tight smile  he moved up to the front row of seats and began talking to some of the visitors .      i am reconsidering our plan     said hunter .      huh .     gene looked up .     you don   t want to stay with the romans for the battle tomorrow  do you .         not at all     said hunter .     now that we are together  i think perhaps we should leave the camp tonight .  i can make camp somewhere not too far from here and stand guard over you while you sleep .         why the change in plans .     steve asked .     why don   t we just take off tomorrow morning .         marcus may force us to remain with him tomorrow for our own safety .  i do not want to risk that .         i don   t think marcus will be too happy about our going tonight  either     said gene .     he   ll think it   s too dangerous to leave now  too .         we shall not discuss it with marcus or anyone else     said hunter .     for now  we shall participate in the feast as guests .  maybe when the germans leave  we shall be able to slip out in the confusion .  if not  i shall look for another opportunity later tonight .      steve turned away .  in front of him  prince arminius was raising his goblet to governor varus .  curious  steve leaned forward slightly to listen .      you have been a great help to me     said governor varus  clanking his goblet against his companion   s .     you warned me that this expedition was necessary to keep the tribes docile .  and without your advice about the necessity of gathering winter provisions  i would never have sent so many troops out to different parts of the province to prepare for winter .         i   m glad to be of service  governor .     prince arminius took a drink of his wine .      i will tell you plainly  i look forward to returning to our forts on the rhine .  this rainy season of yours is very cold and gray .         perhaps i can help you in this matter  as well  governor varus .         eh .  how so .         the road you follow takes a long route through the mountains .  i can direct you through some mountain passes that will shorten the distance you will have to travel .         really .     governor varus sipped his wine again .     on which day we will reach these passes .         tomorrow     said prince arminius .     before we leave you this evening for our own camp  i will tell you how to go .         ah .  i thank you again  arminius .      steve glanced over at marcus .  the tribune was gazing into the fire  too far away to have overheard the conversation .  then steve turned to hunter  who simply nodded with satisfaction .           late that night  the fires finally died down .  most of the legionaries had gone to sleep when steve watched the governor and his party  including marcus  escort their german guests to the gate of the camp .  this elite party of germans  unlike the bulk of german warriors  was mounted  and they rode out into the night with torches to light their way .   hunter stood up and casually walked away from the fire .  steve saw that jane and gene followed him and hurried after them .  no one else took any notice of them .  hunter stopped by a deserted spot against the back wall of the palisade  where they would not be overheard by any of the romans .      most of the camp will be asleep soon     said hunter .     when only the sentries are awake  we shall leave the camp .  i want to discuss the plan with you now  so we shall not have to talk very much when the time comes .         are we going to sneak out the gate .     steve asked .     those sentries probably had some wine  too .  maybe they   ll doze off in a little while .         i believe that is too risky     said hunter .     since it is their duty to remain on guard  i do not wish to count on their failing to do so .  maybe they will remain alert .  opening the main gate will make some noise and  of course  torches are lighting the area .  if they do interrupt us  i cannot risk harming them  as you know  to facilitate our escape .         okay  okay     muttered steve .     what about creating a diversion .  we could let a small fire spread or let some of the horses loose in a spot where the sentries will have to deal with the problem .  then we could sneak out .         i fear a move such as that could get out of hand     said hunter .      what are we going to do  then .     jane asked .      we shall have to go over the wall .  for now  please follow your normal evening routine .  go into the tent as though you are retiring for the night  but remain dressed .  i shall walk around the camp and find the right place to go .  when i come for you  we shall leave .        wayne huddled in the forest  stiff with the cold  as he and ishihara kept watch outside the village of prince arminius .  he could not build a fire this close to the village  of course  without being noticed .  yet hardly anyone in the village had gone to sleep there either .      these german war parties were arriving all evening     said ishihara .     but now we have not seen a new one for several hours .  i believe that all the parties who are coming have probably passed through this village by now .         they must have come from villages all over the area     said wayne .     i wonder where they   re going .         julius is still here with his companions     said ishihara .     so mc   is still here  too .         look  if they do go to sleep  can you sneak into the village to grab mc   again .  now that i   m here  you don   t have to run away with him .  all you have to do is come back out here to me and i   ll take us back home again .         once the villagers are asleep  i can make another attempt     said ishihara .     however  i must inform you that i believe mc   will be even more alert than ever to the sound of my approach .  his hearing will be highly sensitized for my footsteps .  combined with the presence of his friends  we may find that apprehending him the same way           hey  now what .     wayne pointed through the brush toward the village .     look .      the last group of warriors  the men of this village  were finally moving out .  julius was leading the way  with mc   right behind him .  many of them carried torches that revealed their direction as they slipped into the forest on the far side of the village .      they must be joining the others     said ishihara .     i suggest we follow mc   as best we can  from a safe distance .  what is your instruction .         yeah  good idea .     wayne sighed .  maybe the activity would warm him up .     you lead .        hunter walked quietly through the camp after the rest of the team went into their tent .  he wanted to leave the camp without attracting the notice of the romans .  occasionally  when he became aware that a sentry or slave on cleanup duty had noticed him  he would pause by one of the spits to taste another piece of roasted meat or to warm his hands by the dying embers .  gradually  they lost interest in him as they performed their duties .  almost everyone in the camp was asleep now .   finally  near the horse corral  hunter found a spot in the palisade wall that suited his purpose .  the baggage wagons were lined up in precise rows near the corral .  the wagons blocked the view of the grooms  who were sleeping around a fire close by  so they could not see him if they awoke .  the horses obstructed the view of the sentries at the main gate .  even better  a few of the horses were awake  snorting and walking around to take a look at him .   the sounds the horses made would help disguise any noise the team made getting over the wall .  hunter saw that the ropes used with the horses were carefully coiled nearby .  he would need to borrow some ropes  but he would return them .  this was the place for them to go over the wall unnoticed .   hunter patiently picked his way back to the tent where the human members of his team were waiting  still stopping occasionally to look up at the starless sky or at a dwindling fire .  no one challenged him .  at the entrance of the tent  he merely leaned inside .      are you ready .     hunter asked quietly .   without a word  steve  gene  and jane got up and followed him .  once again  he played the little game of wandering  stopping  and idly looking around .  he did see one of the sentries at the gate watching them for few moments  but then the sentry yawned and gazed in another direction for a while .  hunter   s companions followed his lead in silence .   when they were finally out of sight near the corral  hunter uncoiled a rope and gauged its length .  the palisade wall was about ten feet high  constructed of hastily cut tree trunks stripped of branches .  all had been sunk into the wet ground and then tightly lashed together by just a few ropes near the top .  it was not meant as a long term defense  of course  but merely as a barrier to help protect the army for the night .  even the tops of the posts were cut roughly  not honed to a sharp point .   hunter tied a slipknot in one end of a rope and tossed it up high .  the loop caught over the top of a post  held in place by the stub of a pruned branch .  hunter climbed up the rope hand over hand and sat on the top of the fence  balancing on the ends of a couple of posts .  the perch was extremely precarious  but it would not damage him .  he doubted that any of the humans could sit there for long without minor injury .   from this position  hunter could not see the sentries  but he could see most of the grooms and legionaries sleeping nearby .  none of them had noticed him up in this unexpected location .  he untied the slipknot in the rope and replaced it with a large loop held by a fixed knot that would not tighten .  then he dropped it to steve  who caught it .   no words were necessary .  jane stepped carefully into the loop and grabbed the rope at her shoulder level .  then hunter carefully lifted her hand over hand to the top of the palisade .  he helped her climb over it and then lowered her gently on the rope the same way .  gene came next and steve last .  when all three were standing safely on the ground outside the wall  hunter untied the loop  coiled the rope neatly  and tossed it back down by the other ropes  where the grooms would find it in the morning .  then he jumped down to join the others .      where are we going now .     jane asked .      we must find the site of the upcoming battle     said hunter .     cautiously  of course .         what .     she looked at him in surprise .     i thought you   d want to avoid it completely .         no .  we must avoid being with the romans .  however  steve and i last saw mc   closely following julius .  they will be at the battle .  we must not allow mc   to interfere with its outcome in any way .         you really think he can .     steve shook his head .     we   re talking about one unarmed robot in the middle of a battle with  how many  thousands of armed men .     he turned to gene for confirmation .      thousands     gene agreed .      i doubt he can change the course of this battle     said hunter .     it was an overwhelming victory for one side .  however  i must consider the possibility .  if i can somehow apprehend mc   before or during the battle  i must do so .  to keep you three from harm  i ask you to stay as safe as you can .         well  let   s get going  then     said steve .   hunter reviewed his internal map  to which he had been adding information constantly during the time he had been here .  he had seen which way the road went on the anticipated line of march  but even now that was too dangerous for them to take .  he selected a route through the forest  partly on narrow forest trails that he had already seen .  it would bring them to a slope that overlooked the valley where the ambush would take place .      come     said hunter .   for the first hour or so  hunter led his team alone through the darkness .  the going was very slow even on the trails  since the overcast sky and the forest canopy allowed little moonlight to reach them .  however  he saw flickering torchlight ahead shortly after the hour mark .   knowing the torches were carried by german warriors  hunter followed them at a safe distance and saw more torches as time passed .  soon the way to the site of the ambush was obvious .  hunter merely followed the german warriors who were still on their way to their rendezvous .  in the darkness  humans were only shadowed figures  individually unrecognizable .  any of the german warriors who saw hunter and his team assumed they were more germans and did not bother to speak .   hunter considered the stress he would experience during the battle .  on their previous mission  to jamaica in the     s  he had participated in shipboard attacks by pirates .  he had avoided interfering with the course of history  but he had felt extreme pressure from the first law to stop humans from harming each other .  only his concentrated focus on the long term harm that would result from altering history had kept him from making a serious mistake .   if he could not apprehend mc   before the actual attack began  then he would once again have to withstand thousands of first law imperatives on all sides .  of course  mc   would also experience these imperatives .  he could probably not stop enough german warriors to save the romans  but that was another reason for hunter to find the component robot before governor varus led his legionaries into disaster .      gene     jane said quietly  as they walked .     do you know anything about what happened to marcus in the battle .  or afterward .         no .         not at all .         i   m afraid not     said gene .     i suppose it   s possible that if i went back to the primary sources  i might find some slight reference to the governor   s personal aide  but i doubt it .  one young tribune just wasn   t all that important in the large picture .         did any of the romans survive .         yes  a very few .         you are fond of the tribune .     hunter asked .      well .  .  . he   s been very nice     said jane .     and very concerned about us .         he   s still a roman conqueror     steve grimly .     he thinks it   s right just to march out here and kill people to take over their country just because the roman empire has enough military power to do it .         coming here has made all these people seem real to me     said gene .     that   s the difference .         our last historian said something like that  too     said jane .     i can feel it myself .         it   s tough to think of marcus falling in battle tomorrow     said gene .     he   s been very conscientious .  and he   s tried so hard to wake up governor varus to what   s happening .         i just hate to think of him having to die so young because the governor is an arrogant  overconfident idiot     said jane .     it   s so sad .         he could make it     said gene .     a very small number escape the battle and eventually reach the safety of the rhine .  but i can   t swear to you that marcus is among them .         i understand your concern     said hunter .     please remember that none of us can act on it .  marcus must not be warned or aided in any way .         he   s on his own     steve agreed .   hunter followed the german warriors as they hiked along the side of an uneven slope .  finally  they all reached their places for the ambush .  hunter stopped to get his bearings as well as he could .   in the darkness  he was not able to see how far down the slope the valley floor lay  but he could hear the german warriors who were hidden allover the slope .  some talked quietly  but most breathed with the even rhythms of sleep .  hunter did not want to remain very close to any of them  since the arrival of daylight would reveal the presence of strangers among them .  he changed direction and began to lead his team over the rocks and brush down the slope .   when hunter   s hearing told him that no german warriors were below him on the slope  he stopped and picked up a pebble .  it was too small to harm any human if he tossed it lightly .  he threw it forward  underhand  in a long  high arc .  then he waited for the sound of its landing .   the pebble struck faintly about forty four meters away .  hunter picked up another pebble and threw it farther .  this one landed approximately fifty two meters away  but not much farther down than the first one .  he picked up four more pebbles and threw them into the darkness  as well .  hunter was not able to reach a precise conclusion about the position of the valley floor from the places where they landed  but he estimated that the slope was leveling quickly .      we shall find hiding places here     he said quietly .     since the germans have built no fires  we cannot either .  bundle up in your cloaks and rest as much as you can .         then what .     jane came up next to him .     what are we going to do next .         we shall rise at dawn  to make sure we are prepared when the romans march down the road .  when i can see where we are in relation to the road and the germans  i shall devise a more specific plan .  it will take the romans some time to form their march and actually arrive here .         good enough     said steve .  he elbowed hunter playfully .     say  hunter .  when we started hunting these component robots  i was the one arguing for improvisation all the time .  you   re doing more of it all the time .         i am learning     said hunter .     as you have indicated in the past  some situational challenges simply offer too many unpredictable variables to allow for rigid advance planning .      steve laughed .     i don   t think i phrased it exactly that way  but   yeah  that   s right .      as the humans found comfortable spots to recline on the damp soil  hunter stood over them  listening for any sound indicating that german warriors were coming toward them .  he heard nothing .  while they slept  however  he sat down and remained alert .           wayne lay huddled on the slope  excited and also scared .  he and ishihara had followed julius  mc    and their war party through the forest to the ambush site .  as soon as julius had selected a spot for the night  far down the slope toward the road  his party had doused their torches .      let   s get him now     said wayne .      the risk to you is too great     said ishihara .     we are surrounded by thousands of german warriors at this moment .  our best chance to apprehend mc   is during the confusion of battle .  he will be distracted by the many first law imperatives around him .         so will you     said wayne .      the germans will be even more distracted once the action begins     said ishihara .     neither they nor mc   will anticipate our approach from behind .  that will give us the advantage we have lacked up to now .         all right  all right .  i don   t want to get hurt  myself .  in fact  i instruct you once again to focus on the necessity of getting me out of here safely once we grab mc   .  we don   t have to go anywhere with him  i   ll trigger my remote control right away and we   ll take him right back to our own time  straight from the battlefield .         i shall maintain this focus to the best of my ability     said ishihara .     steve used the leather bag as a pillow and dozed on the hard ground  waking frequently .  his fur cloak and tunic kept him warm enough  but he could not get comfortable .  the first light of morning woke him even before hunter shook jane and gene gently .   stiff from the poor rest  steve pushed himself up and shivered when the cold wind whipped under his cloak .  the early sunlight revealed heavy  dark clouds moving quickly .  he could smell rain .   the road along the valley floor was close  about twenty five meters down the slope .  steve looked around and saw thousands of german warriors all over the slope  among the boulders and trees  and even more across the narrow valley on the opposite slope .  others would be hidden from view .  of course  they were just waking  when the first sign of the roman advance arrived  they would all slip out of sight .   to his relief  he did not see anyone from vicinius   s village nearby .  since everyone in hunter   s team was wearing german cloaks  they would not stand out to any of the other germans .  steve relaxed a little .   hunter was looking around the slopes  as well .     gene  how does the battle proceed .         uh   didn   t we talk about this  already .  it   s a total rout for the germans  who have brought a bunch of different tribes here   not just the cherusci .  the romans were slaughtered and driven back to the rhine forever .  in fact  the roman authorities thought the germans might even invade gaul .         i have that in my data     hunter said patiently .     what i mean is  what is the sequence of detailed events .         oh   sorry .     gene shook his head .     it   s hardly a battle at all .  the romans are trapped down on the road below us .  just as the attack begins  a huge thunderstorm hits .         it   s building already     said jane  holding her cloak tight around her as she looked up at the sky .      the well disciplined romans keep their position today and make camp for the night  totally surrounded .  then at sunrise tomorrow           i understand     said hunter .     that is what i need for now .         what do you want us to do .     jane asked .      steve  do you still have some cold food in your bag .     hunter asked .      yeah .         distribute it .  i want all of you to be as well fed as possible .  you must hide and remain together when the action begins .      steve pulled open the bag and took out some of the roasted meat that was still wrapped in leaves .  in the cold weather  it was still good .  he passed some to jane and gene .     we don   t have any water .  when it starts to rain  open your mouth and look up .         i am going to walk a little bit     said hunter .     i shall find mc   if i can .     he turned and picked his way across the slope .      it   s better than nothing     said steve  biting into a chunk of roasted wild boar .     hunter was very careful to keep his head down and his cloak wrapped around him as he moved among the german warriors .  even among the cherusci tribe alone  there were so many different villages that the warriors did not all know each other .  with other tribes present as well  all he needed to do to avoid trouble was avoid the warriors from the village of vicinius and odover  who might still accuse him of being a roman spy .   he stopped frequently and used his vision on maximum magnification to study both the slope on which he stood and the one across the valley .  simultaneously  he turned up his hearing in the hope of hearing julius   s voice  but the sheer number of germans moving and talking quietly around him made the search difficult .  they were preparing spears and swords if they had them .  some were loosening boulders they planned to roll down the slopes and were directing their comrades to move out of the way .   hunter moved quietly and patiently  not attracting any particular attention .  at one point  seeing other germans hurrying across the valley from one slope to another  he crossed to the other side .  he did not find julius or mc   there either  however .   almost two hours after first light  hunter saw that the germans around him were looking up the road in the direction from which the romans would come .  he turned and saw other warriors waving their arms to their comrades farther away from the entrance to the valley .  this silent signal sent all the germans scurrying to hiding places .   hunter was a long way from where he had left his team .  immediately  he headed back toward them .  before he reached them  he saw the first advance patrol of roman cavalry riding up the road below .  he ducked down out of sight and continued to move across the slope  but his progress was much slower now .  after all the care he had previously taken not to change history  he certainly did not want to expose the ambush prematurely by letting himself be seen .   the germans were barbarians by roman standards  but they were sufficiently disciplined to allow the advance patrol to ride through the valley without revealing themselves .  soon the head of the column appeared  led by governor varus .  hunter could see marcus riding at his side .  prince arminius  who must certainly have been hidden somewhere on the slopes  still did not give the signal to attack .   hunter had almost reached his team by the time the column had marched well into the valley .  he had to move by wriggling prone on the rough ground to avoid being seen .  the advance patrol was out of sight around a far curve and governor varus had taken the head of the column almost to the same curve .  the wagons in the baggage train at the end of the column entered the valley last of all .   suddenly hunter heard a distant shout from high over his head  up the slope to his rear .  it was the voice of prince arminius  but it was instantly drowned out by a huge roar of angry voices from both slopes  echoing up and down the valley .  on all sides  the german warriors rose up  some rolling rocks and boulders down the slope  others flinging their spears .  archers shot their arrows and still more charged down on the marching column .   in response  roman officers began to shout and signal to their troops .  roman buglers blew commands .  the legionaries swung up their shields and turned outward to face their attackers on each side of the road .   hunter felt a sudden rush of imperative from the first law  telling him to stop these people if he could .  he forced himself to focus on the welfare of the future  which meant finding mc   .  now that all the german warriors were exposed to view  he stood up and quickly scanned the slopes and the valley again .   the clouds darkened over the valley .  lightning flashed and thunder rolled through the mountains  making the ground vibrate .  a slashing  cold rain began to fall .  hunter felt the wind lift his cloak to flutter out behind him  but ignored it .  another cheer rose up from the germans  who seemed to take the storm as a good omen for them .   hunter   s new scan of the slopes seemed to take a long time because of the tension and danger to the humans all around him .  however  he finally spotted julius leading a band of screaming warriors down the slope not too far away  with mc   running right behind him .  the little component robot was easily the most agile of the group .  actually  less than a minute had passed since hunter had begun his scan .   hunter changed direction in order to angle down the mountainside after mc   .  he also looked sideways for his team members .  the place where he had left them was not far away  but he could not see them  he expected they had ducked down low to keep themselves safe .  certainly in the shouts and clashing of weapons all around him  he could not possibly hear them .   many of the boulders had rolled down into the roman column  smashing into the legionaries who  trapped against their comrades  could not dodge out of the way .  most of the romans had now formed a shield wall  and were clashing hand to hand with the first wave of german attackers .  more warriors rushed down the slope past hunter in the pouring rain .   hunter paused to let some germans dart past him  and looked down to find his footing .  rivulets of water were running down the slope already .  the rain had already saturated the rocky ground  which had been damp before the storm .   when hunter looked up again to find mc    he saw that julius had reached the crowd of passing germans pressing forward against the romans .  he was not able to reach his enemies yet because of the crowd .  mc   was right behind him .   suddenly hunter recognized wayne nystrom and ishihara pressing forward through the crowd of germans coming up behind mc   .  he did not understand ishihara   s presence  but he would worry about why he was here later .  hunter knew he could no longer afford to work his way gradually toward mc   .  he leaped forward and ran down the slope  with the germans around him on the muddy soil and slippery rocks .      ishihara  this is hunter     he radioed .     you must stop .  you are interfering with the future of human history .         unaccepted     ishihara responded .     i  too  shall prevent mc   from altering the outcome of this battle .         aiding wayne nystrom may cause harm to people in our own time     hunter added anxiously  as he collided shoulder to shoulder with a shouting german warrior .      unproved .  as such  i must obey wayne   s instructions under the second law .     ishihara said nothing else  as he continued to push and shove his way forward .   through the cold  wind driven rain  hunter saw that wayne was now hanging back  letting ishihara move up toward mc   .  ishihara was fighting his way through the press of germans  all of whom were anxious to reach their foes .  hunter lengthened his stride  using his precise coordination to maintain his balance on the uneven  slippery slope .   at the bottom of the slope  hunter grabbed the shoulders of german warriors from behind and yanked them out of the way  hoping he was not altering which ones would sustain casualties or cause them among the romans .  mc   was still out of reach  but hunter was coming up behind ishihara .   suddenly ishihara stretched out his arms to snatch mc   from behind .  hunter hurled himself forward and leveled ishihara in a flying tackle .  they thumped to the ground  ishihara struggling to rise and hunter trying to get past him to mc   .      stop .     wayne shouted from behind them  his voice nearly lost in the shouts and other sounds of battle .     hunter  i order you to stop .      hunter ignored him  driven by the first law .  though ishihara was smaller than hunter  he was strong enough to rise  forcing hunter to shove him down to the ground again .  so far  none of the germans seemed to care about the minor struggle behind the line of battle  but hunter could not risk disabling ishihara in a permanent way  such as tearing off one of his legs  for fear the germans would see from the internal damage that he was not human .   ishihara rolled over  grappling with hunter and trying to rise .  they fell sideways  splashing into a puddle of cold rainwater .  lightning flashed overhead and thunder crashed almost immediately .   suddenly hunter saw wayne scramble past them and jump on mc     s back .  with one arm around the component robot   s neck  wayne flailed for the control unit at his belt .  hunter flung ishihara   s arms away from him and tried to move forward  but the deep mud under his feet gave way and he fell to his hands and knees .   from the crowd of german warriors pressing to reach the romans  steve flung himself through the air on top of wayne and mc   .  he reached out and knocked wayne   s arm away from his belt as all three of them splashed to the ground  smearing mud as they slid .      stop moving .     first steve yelled at mc    then he stared at ishihara in sudden recognition .     you .  ishihara  stop fighting with hunter .  you gotta stop .      mc   still seemed to have his hearing shut down  since he continued to struggle with steve .  wayne yanked himself free and scurried away into the crowd .  steve got up  slipped his arms around mc     s waist  and lifted the robot off the ground  grimacing with the effort .      ishihara  what are you doing here .     jane had come running up behind steve .  gene was right behind her .     and what   s wrong with you .  grab wayne .         no     hunter ordered .  he finally had ishihara pinned to the ground .     jane  please countermand that instruction .  help steve hold mc   .  i must have information from ishihara .         all right  listen to him .  do what he says .         ishihara  you must tell me exactly when you left our own time with wayne .  this is a critical first law problem  i cannot afford to return before you left .  that would create incalculable paradoxes and potential harm to uncountable numbers of humans .      as ishihara gave him the exact time he and wayne had departed  hunter got up and pulled ishihara to his feet .  he held the other robot   s upper arm firmly in one hand and rested his other on his control unit .   gene had joined steve and jane in holding onto mc   .  the german warriors around them were still shoving toward the romans  screaming angrily and waving their weapons .  if any of them had noticed ishihara and mc   being held  hunter surmised that they believed the two had been wounded .      bring him close .  everyone stand together .     hunter was ready to trigger his control unit .  ishihara  his arm still in hunter   s grasp  was no longer struggling .  hunter was anxious  surrounded by humans killing and wounding each other .  he had to get his team out as fast as possible .      okay     said steve  as he  jane  and gene shuffled on the muddy ground to bring mc   over to hunter .     let   s get out of here .         wait     said jane  raising her head to look back toward the struggling roman column .     hunter  have you seen marcus .  what   s happened to him so far .         marcus is at the head of the column with governor varus     hunter said quickly .     he is out of sight from this spot .  and we cannot help him  anyway .         i .  .  . know .      just as hunter activated the control unit  ishihara wrenched free and flung himself away .     the instant that hunter found himself back in the darkness of the time travel sphere  he listened for the breathing of his companions .  his team was with him  as was mc   .  ishihara had escaped  not so much by physical strength as by surprising hunter when his attention had been focused on removing his team and mc   safely from the battlefield .   hunter opened the sphere and helped everyone out .  he held mc     s arm firmly .  the component robot would not lull him into carelessness the same way ishihara had .      ishihara escaped .     gene looked around  easing off his rain soaked  filthy fur cloak .     jane  didn   t you tell him to obey hunter .         yes     said jane .  her drenched brown hair was plastered against her head .  she wiped some of it from her face .  her voice came in an unhappy monotone  but she was too professional not to explain what she could .     however  in our hurry  neither of us actually told him to stay with us .  and i would say that he was driven by the first law to help wayne  so that would have superseded any second law orders  anyway .     she sighed  staring at the floor as she slipped off her soggy fur cloak .      i was careless     said hunter .     i was so focused on the first law imperatives to return all of you and mc   safely that i failed to be sufficiently watchful of ishihara .         how did he get there  anyhow .     steve asked  also shucking his fur cloak .   everyone looked at jane .   she looked up belatedly .     oh   wayne must have used some sort of first law argument to persuade him to disobey our orders .         we shall have to consider that on our next mission     said hunter .     for now  please change your clothes .  i shall call horatio  the security robot  to take us to mc governor   s office .         i   d like to be dry for a change     said steve .     good idea .      while the humans took turns changing in the other room  hunter reviewed the data in the control console  still gripping mc   firmly .  mc   was passive  however  and did not cause a problem .  hunter began to monitor the news  to learn of any alterations in current events since they had started their last mission .   by the time the team members had finished changing  horatio had arrived outside the building with a security vehicle .  the trip to mc governor   s office was uneventful .  when they reached the small room  hunter instructed horatio to resume his security duty outside .   jane moved in front of mc    where he could see her .  mouthing the words clearly  so he could not avoid reading her lips  she said     activate all your senses .         can you hear me .     hunter spoke aloud instead of using his communication link .      yes     said mc   .      jane  have him merge with the first two .         mc    merge with mc   and mc   .      hunter noticed that jane   s voice still reflected disappointment and sadness .   mc   obediently walked over to the spot where mc   and mc   stood entwined like a complex piece of abstract sculpture .  he moved close and then seemed to wind around the first two in a flexible  almost fluid motion .  when he stopped  the three component robots had formed half of mc governor .      mc    shut down     jane ordered .      three down  three to go     said steve cheerfully .      i think i understand why mc   was drawn to that time period     said jane .     if you remember  his specialty within mojave center was security .  i believe he was drawn to northern germany in part because it has been a center of historical turmoil in many eras .  when he found himself at full size once again  he was drawn to the source of ultimate stability  meaning prince arminius .         wait a minute     said gene .     prince arminius was the source of rebellion .         his victory stabilized the border for centuries     said jane .     i believe mc   knew that .         yeah  i see .         thank you for your professionalism  gene     said hunter .     your fee will be automatically transferred to your account .  you were extremely helpful .         and easy to get along with     steve added .     not everybody who joined us has been .         it was a wonderful experience for me  to have seen those people and to have experienced those situations     said gene .     but right now i want to dry off and get a hot shower .  i know you have more missions to worry about .  i   ll leave you to it .         gene     said jane quickly .     i remember what you said about history not mentioning marcus .  but if you can find anything that might suggest whether he survived the battle or not  will you let me know .         it   s not very likely but of course i will .         thank you .     jane gave him a quick hug .   when everyone had said good bye  gene departed .  hunter closed the door again  turning to jane and steve grimly .   hunter looked carefully at jane .     are you all right .         uh   yeah .     she shrugged .      it   s funny     said steve .     no matter how long marcus lived  he   s now been dead for over two thousand years .         yeah .     jane smiled wistfully .     even though we just saw him a short time ago .         you really okay .     steve asked .      yes .  i   m okay .      steve turned to hunter .     i suppose you   ve monitored the news again already .  what   s the situation .         our third mission succeeded  of course     said hunter .     no explosion took place in germany .  however  another explosion of nuclear force has taken place in the russian republic .         in russia .     jane looked at him .     it   s a big place .  was it out in siberia  by any chance .         no .  moscow  with its historic kremlin and churches and museums  is gone .         wow     steve whispered .      most importantly to me  in regard to the first law  millions of russians are gone  too .         did you find out what year we   re going to visit next .         yes     said hunter .     the information was in the console that controls the sphere .  our next mission will take us to moscow in the winter of       during the battle of moscow between nazi germany and soviet russia .
