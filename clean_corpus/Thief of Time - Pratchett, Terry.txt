reading     according to the first scroll of wen the eternally surprised  wen stepped out of the cave where he had received enlightenment and into the dawning light of the first day of the rest of his life .  he stared at the rising sun for some time  because he had never seen it before .   he prodded with a sandal the dozing form of clodpool the apprentice  and said     i have seen .  now i understand .      then he stopped and looked at the thing next to clodpool .      what is that amazing thing .     he said .      er   er   it   s a tree  master     said clodpool  still not quite awake .     remember .  it was there yesterday .         there was no yesterday .         er   er   i think there was  master     said clodpool  struggling to his feet .     remember .  we came up here  and i cooked a meal  and had the rind off your sklang because you didn   t want it .         i remember yesterday     said wen  thoughtfully .     but the memory is in my head now .  was yesterday real .  or is it only the memory that is real .  truly  yesterday i was not born .      clodpool   s face became a mask of agonized incomprehension .      dear stupid clodpool  i have learned everything     said wen .     in the cup of the hand there is no past  no future .  there is only now .  there is no time but the present .  we have a great deal to do .      clodpool hesitated .  there was something new about his master .  there was a glow in his eyes and  when he moved  there were strange silvery blue lights in the air  like reflections from liquid mirrors .      she has told me everything     wen went on .     i know that time was made for men  not the other way around .  i have learned how to shape it and bend it .  i know how to make a moment last forever  because it already has .  and i can teach these skills even to you  clodpool .  i have heard the heartbeat of the universe .  i know the answers to many questions .  ask me .      the apprentice gave him a bleary look .  it was too early in the morning for it to be early in the morning .  that was the only thing that he currently knew for sure .      er   what does master want for breakfast .     he said .   wen looked down from their camp  and across the snowfields and purple mountains to the golden daylight creating the world  and mused upon certain aspects of humanity .      ah     he said .     one of the difficult ones .         for something to exist  it has to be observed .   for something to exist  it has to have a position in time and space .   and this explains why nine tenths of the mass of the universe is unaccounted for .   nine tenths of the universe is the knowledge of the position and direction of everything in the other tenth .  every atom has its biography  every star its file  every chemical exchange its equivalent of the inspector with a clipboard .  it is unaccounted for because it is doing the accounting for the rest of it  and you cannot see the back of your own head .    nine tenths of the universe  in fact  is the paperwork .   and if you want the story  then remember that a story does not unwind .  it weaves .  events that start in different places and different times all bear down on that one tiny point in space time  which is the perfect moment .   suppose an emperor was persuaded to wear a new suit of clothes whose material was so fine that  to the common eye  the clothes weren   t there .  and suppose a little boy pointed out this fact in a loud clear voice     then you have the story of the emperor who had no clothes .   but if you knew a bit more  it would be the story of the boy who got a well deserved thrashing from his dad for being rude to royalty  and was locked up .   or the story of the whole crowd that was rounded up by the guards and told    this didn   t happen  okay .  does anyone want to argue .      or it could be a story of how a whole kingdom suddenly saw the benefits of the    new clothes     and developed an enthusiasm for healthy sports  in a lively and refreshing atmosphere that gets many new adherents every year  which led to a recession caused by the collapse of the conventional clothing industry .   it could even be a story about the great pneumonia epidemic of       .   it all depends on how much you know .   suppose you   d watched the slow accretion of snow over thousands of years as it was compressed and pushed over the deep rock until the glacier calved its icebergs into the sea  and you watched an iceberg drift out through the chilly waters  and you got to know its cargo of happy polar bears and seals as they looked forward to a brave new life in the other hemisphere where they say the ice floes are lined with crunchy penguins  and then wham   tragedy loomed in the shape of thousands of tons of unaccountably floating iron and an exciting soundtrack        you   d want to know the whole story .   and this one starts with desks .   this is the desk of a professional .  it is clear that their job is their life .  there are   human touches  but they are the human touches that strict usage allows in a chilly world of duty and routine .   mostly they   re on the only piece of real color in this picture of blacks and grays .  it   s a coffee mug .  someone somewhere wanted to make it a jolly mug .  it bears a rather unconvincing picture of a teddy bear  and the legend    to the world   s greatest grandad     and the slight change in the style of lettering on the word    grandad    makes it clear that this has come from one of those stalls that have hundreds of mugs like these  declaring that they   re for the world   s greatest grandad dad mum granny uncle aunt blank .  only someone whose life contains very little else  one feels  would treasure a piece of gimcrackery like this .   it currently holds tea  with a slice of lemon .   the bleak desktop also contains a paper knife in the shape of a scythe  and a number of hourglasses .   death picks up the mug in a skeletal hand      and took a sip  pausing only to look again at the wording he   d seen thousands of times before  and then put it down .   very well  he said  in tones of funeral bells .  show me .   the last item on the desktop was a mechanical contrivance .     contrivance    was exactly the right kind of word for it .  most of it was two discs .  one was horizontal  and contained a circlet of very small squares of what would prove to be carpet .  the other was set vertically  and had a large number of arms  each one of which held a very small slice of buttered toast .  each slice was set so that it could spin freely as the turning of the wheel brought it down toward the carpet disc .   i believe i am beginning to get the idea  said death .   the small figure by the machine saluted smartly and beamed  if a rat skull could beam .  it pulled a pair of goggles over its eye sockets  hitched up its robe  and clambered into the machine .   death was never quite sure why he allowed the death of rats to have an independent existence .  after all  being death meant being the death of everything  including rodents of all descriptions .  but perhaps everyone needs a tiny part of themselves that can  metaphorically  be allowed to run naked in the rain   to think the unthinkable thoughts  to hide in corners and spy on the world  to do the forbidden but enjoyable deeds .   slowly  the death of rats pushed the treadles .  the wheels began to spin .      exciting  eh .     said a hoarse voice by death   s ear .  it belonged to quoth  the raven  who had attached himself to the household as the death of rats    personal transport and crony .  he was  he always said  only in it for the eyeballs .   the carpets began to turn .  the tiny toasties slapped down  sometimes with a buttery squelch  sometimes without .  quoth watched carefully  in case any eyeballs were involved .   death saw that some time and effort had been spent devising a mechanism to rebutter each returning slice .  an even more complex one measured the number of buttered carpets .   after a couple of complete turns the lever of the buttered carpet ratio device had moved to    percent  and the wheels stopped .   well .  said death .  this proves nothing .  if you did it again  it could well be that     the death of rats shifted a gear lever  and began to pedal again .   squeak  it commanded .  death obediently leaned closer .   this time the needle went only as high as    percent .   death leaned closer still .   the eight pieces of toast that had been buttered this time were  in their entirety  the pieces that had been missed first time around .   spidery cogwheels whirred in the machine .  a sign emerged  rather shakily  on springs  with an effect that was the visual equivalent of the word    boing .      a moment later two sparklers spluttered fitfully into life and sizzled away on either side of the word malignity .   death nodded .  it was just as he   d suspected .   he crossed his study  the death of rats scampering ahead of him  and reached a full length mirror .  it was dark  like the bottom of a well .  there was a pattern of skulls and bones around the frame  for the sake of appearances  death could not look himself in the skull in a mirror with cherubs and roses around it .   the death of rats climbed the frame in a scrabble of claws and looked at death expectantly from the top .  quoth fluttered over  and pecked briefly at his own reflection  on the basis that anything was worth a try .   show me  said death .  show me   my thoughts .   a chessboard appeared  but it was triangular and so big that only the nearest point could be seen .  right on this point was the world   turtle  elephants  the little orbiting sun and all .  it was the discworld  which existed only just this side of total improbability and  therefore  in border country .  in border country  the border gets crossed and sometimes things creep into the universe that have rather more on their minds than a better life for their children and a wonderful future in the fruit picking and domestic service industries .   on every other black and white triangle of the chessboard  all the way to infinity  was a small gray shape  rather like an empty hooded robe .   why now .  thought death .   he recognized them .  they were not life forms .  they were   nonlife forms .  they were the observers of the operation of the universe  its clerks  its auditors .  they saw to it that things spun and rocks fell .   and they believed that for a thing to exist it had to have a position in time and space .  humanity had arrived as a nasty shock .  humanity practically was things that didn   t have a position in time and space  such as imagination  pity  hope  history  and belief .  take those away and all you had was an ape that fell out of trees a lot .   intelligent life was  therefore  an anomaly .  it made the filing untidy .  the auditors hated things like that .  periodically  they tried to tidy things up a little .   a year ago astronomers across the discworld had been puzzled to see the stars gently wheel across the sky as the world turtle executed a roll .  the thickness of the world never allowed them to see why  but great a   tuin   s ancient head had snaked out and down and had snapped right out of the sky the speeding asteroid that would  had it hit  have meant that no one would ever have needed to buy a diary ever again .   no  the world could take care of obvious threats like that .  so now the gray robes preferred more subtle  cowardly skirmishes  in their endless desire for a universe where nothing happened that was not completely predictable .   the buttered side   down effect was only a trivial but telling indicator .  it showed an increase in activity .  give up  was their eternal message .  go back to being blobs in the ocean .  blobs were easy .   but the great game went on at many levels  death knew .  and often it was hardly possible to know who was playing .   every cause has its effect  he said aloud .  so every effect has its cause .   he nodded at the death of rats .   show me  said death .  show me   a beginning .       tick  it was a bitter winter   s night .  the man hammered on the back door  sending snow sliding off the roof .   the girl  who had been admiring her new hat in the mirror  tweaked the already low neckline of her dress for slightly more exposure  just in case the caller was male  and went and opened the door .   a figure was outlined against the freezing starlight .  flakes were already building up on his cloak .      mrs .  ogg .  the midwife .     he said .      it   s miss  actually     she said proudly .     and witch  too  o   course .     she indicated her new  black  pointy hat .  she was still at the stage of wearing it in the house .      you must come at once .  it   s very urgent .      the girl looked suddenly panic stricken .     is it mrs .  weaver .  i didn   t reckon she was due for another couple of we           i have come a long way     said the figure .     they say you are the best in the world .         what .  me .  i   ve only delivered one .     said miss ogg  now looking hunted .     biddy spective is a lot more experienced than me .  and old minnie forthwright .  mrs .  weaver was going to be my first solo     cos she   s built like a wardro           i do beg your pardon .  i will not trespass further on your time .      the stranger retreated into the flake speckled shadows .      hello .     said miss ogg .     hello .      but there was nothing there  except footprints .  which stopped in the middle of the snow covered path         tick  there was a hammering on the door .  mrs .  ogg put down the child that had been sitting on her knee  and went and raised the latch .   a dark figure stood outlined against the warm summer evening sky  and there was something strange about its shoulders .      mrs .  ogg .  you are married now .         yep .  twice     said mrs .  ogg  cheerfully .     what can i do for y           you must come at once .  it   s very urgent .         i didn   t know anyone was           i have come a long way     said the figure .   mrs .  ogg paused .  there was something in the way he had pronounced long .  and now she could see that the whiteness on the cloak was snow  melting fast .  faint memory stirred .      well  now     she said  because she   d learned a lot in the last twenty years or so     that   s as may be  and i   ll always do the best i can  ask anyone .  but i wouldn   t say i   m the best .  always learnin    something new  that   s me .         oh .  in that case  i will call at a more convenient   moment .         why   ve you got snow on    .      but  without ever quite vanishing  the stranger was no longer present         tick  there was a hammering on the door .  nanny ogg carefully put down her brandy nightcap  and stared at the wall for a moment .  now a lifetime of edge witchery  had honed senses that most people never really knew they had  and something in her head went    click .      on the hob  the kettle for her hot water bottle was just coming to the boil .   she laid down her pipe  got up  and opened the door on this springtime midnight .      you   ve come a long way  i   m thinking     she said  showing no surprise at the dark figure .      that is true  mrs .  ogg .         everyone who knows me calls me nanny .      she looked down at the melting snow dripping off the cloak .  it hadn   t snowed up here for a month .      and it   s urgent  i expect .     she said  as memory unrolled .      indeed .         and now you got to say    you must come at once .            you must come at once .         well  now     she said .     i   d say  yes  i   m a pretty good midwife  though i do say it myself .  i   ve seen hundreds into the world .  even trolls  which is no errand for the inexperienced .  i know birthing backward and forward and damn near sideways at times .  always been ready to learn something new  though .     she looked down modestly .     i wouldn   t say i   m the best     she said     but i can   t think of anyone better  i have to say .         you must leave with me now .         oh  i must  must i .     said nanny ogg .      yes .      an edge witch thinks fast  because edges can shift so quickly .  and she learns to tell when a mythology is unfolding  and when the best you can do is put yourself in its path and run to keep up .      right o .  i   ll just go and get           there is no time .         but i can   t just walk right out and           now .      nanny reached behind the door for her birthing bag  always kept there for just such occasions as this  full of the things she knew she   d want and a few of the things she always prayed she   d never need .      right     she said .   she left .       tick  the kettle was just boiling when nanny walked back into her kitchen .  she stared at it for a moment  and then moved it off the fire .   there was still a drop of brandy left in the glass by her chair .  she drained that  then refilled the glass to the brim from the bottle .   she picked up her pipe .  the bowl was still warm .  she pulled on it  and the coals crackled .   then she took something out of her bag  which was now a good deal emptier and  brandy glass in her hand  sat down to look at it .      well     she said at last     that was   very unusual            tick  death watched the image fade .  a few flakes of snow that had blown out of the mirror had already melted on the floor  but there was still a whiff of pipe smoke in the air .   ah yes  i see  he said .  a birthing  in strange circumstances .  but is that what the problem was or was that what the solution will be .   squeak  said the death of rats .   quite so  said death .  you may very well be right .  i do know that the midwife will never tell me .   the death of rats looked surprised .   squeak .   death smiled .  death .  asking after the life of a child .  no .  she would not .         scuse me     said the raven     but how come miss ogg became mrs .  ogg .  sounds a bit of a rural arrangement  if you catch my meaning .      witches are matrilineal  said death .  they find it much easier to change men than to change names .   he went back to his desk and opened a drawer .   there was a thick book there  bound in night .  on the cover  where a book like this might otherwise say    our wedding    or    acme photo album    it said memories .   death turned the heavy pages carefully .  some of the memories escaped as he did so  forming brief pictures in the air before the page turned  and then went flying and fading into the distant  dark corners of the room .  there were snatches of sound  too  of laughter  tears  screams  and  for some reason  a brief burst of xylophone music that caused him to pause for a moment .   an immortal has a great deal to remember .  sometimes it   s better to put things where they will be safe .   one ancient memory  brown and cracking around the edges  lingered in the air over the desk .  it showed five figures  four on horseback  one in a chariot  all apparently riding out of a thunderstorm .  the horses were at a full gallop .  there was a lot of smoke and flame and general excitement .   ah  the old days  said death  before there was this fashion for having a solo career .   squeak .  the death of rats inquired .   oh  yes  said death .  once there were five of us .  five horsemen .  but you know how things are .  there   s always a row .  creative disagreements  rooms being trashed  that sort of thing .  he sighed .  and things said that perhaps should not have been said .   he turned a few more pages and sighed again .  when you needed an ally  and you were death  on whom could you absolutely rely .   his thoughtful gaze fell on the teddy bear mug .   of course  there was always family .  yes .  he   d promised not to do this again  but he   d never got the hang of promises .   he got up and went back to the mirror .  there was not a lot of time .  things in the mirror were closer than they appeared .   there was slithering noise  a breathless moment of silence  and a crash like a bag of skittles being dropped .   the death of rats winced .  the raven took off hurriedly .   help me up  please  said a voice from the shadows .  and then please clean up the damn butter .       tick  this desk was a field of galaxies .   things twinkled .  there were complex wheels and spirals  brilliant against the blackness     jeremy always liked the moment when he had a clock in pieces  with every wheel and spring carefully laid out on the black velvet cloth in front of him .  it was like looking at time  dismantled  controllable  every part of it understood     he wished his life was like that .  it would be nice to reduce it to bits  spread them all out on the table  clean and oil them properly  and put them together so that they coiled and spun as they ought to .  but sometimes it seemed that the life of jeremy had been assembled by a not very competent craftsman who had allowed a number of small but important things to go ping into the corners of the room .   he wished he liked people more  but somehow he could never get on with them .  he never knew what to say .  if life was a party  he wasn   t even in the kitchen .  he envied the people who made it as far as the kitchen .  there would probably be the remains of the dip to eat  and a bottle or two of cheap wine that someone had brought along that   d probably be okay if you took out the drowned cigarette stubs .  there might even be a girl in the kitchen  perhaps  although jeremy knew the limits of his imagination .   but jeremy never even got an invitation .   clocks  now   clocks were different .  he knew what made clocks tick .   his full name was jeremy clockson  and that was no accident .  he   d been a member of the guild of clockmakers since he was a few days old  and everyone knew what that meant .  it meant his life had begun in a basket  on a doorstep .  everyone knew how it worked .  all the guilds took in the foundlings that arrived with the morning milk .  it was an ancient form of charity  and there were far worse fates .  the orphans got a life  and an upbringing of a sort  and a trade  and a future  and a name .  many a fine lady or master craftsman or city dignitary had telltale surnames like ludd or doughy or pune or clockson .  they   d been named after trade heroes or patron deities  and this turned them into a kind of family .  the older ones remembered where they came from  and at hogswatch they were liberal with donations of food and clothing to the various younger brothers and sisters of the basket .  it wasn   t perfect  but then  what is .   so jeremy had grown up healthy  and rather strange  and with a gift for his adoptive craft that almost made up for every other personal endowment that he did not possess .   the shop bell rang .  he sighed and put down his eyeglass .  he didn   t rush  though .  there was a lot to look at in the shop .  sometimes he even had to cough to attract the customer   s attention .  that being said  sometimes jeremy had to cough to attract the attention of his reflection when he was shaving .   jeremy tried to be an interesting person .  the trouble was that he was the kind of person who  having decided to be an interesting person  would first of all try to find a book called how to be an interesting person and then see whether there were any courses available .  he was puzzled that people seemed to think he was a boring conversationalist .  why  he could talk about all kinds of clocks .  mechanical clocks  magical clocks  water clocks  fire clocks  floral clocks  candle clocks  sand clocks  cuckoo clocks  the rare hershebian beetle clocks   but for some reason he always ran out of listeners before he ran out of clocks .   he stepped out into his shop and stopped .      oh   i   m so sorry to have kept you     he said .  it was a woman .  and two trolls had taken up positions just inside the door .  their dark glasses and huge ill fitting black suits put them down as people who put people down .  one of them cracked his knuckles when he saw jeremy looking at him .   the woman was wrapped in an enormous and expensive white fur coat  which may have explained the trolls .  long black hair cascaded over her shoulders  and her face was made up so pale that it was almost the shade of the coat .  she was   quite attractive  thought jeremy  who was admittedly no judge whatsoever  but it was a monochromatic beauty .  he wondered if she was a zombie .  there were quite a few in the city now  and the prudent ones had taken it with them when they died and probably could afford a coat like that .      a beetle clock .     she said .  she had turned away from the glass dome .      oh  er  yes   the hershebian lawyer beetle has a very consistent daily routine     said jeremy .     i  er  only keep it for  um  interest .         how very   organic     said the woman .  she extended a black gloved hand  palm down .     we are myria lejean .  lady myria lejean .      jeremy obediently held out a hand .  patient men at the clockmakers    guild had spent a long time teaching him how to relate to people before giving it up in despair  but some things had stuck .   her ladyship looked at the waiting hand .  finally  one of the trolls lumbered over .      der lady does not shake hands     it said  in a reverberating whisper .     she are not a tactile kinda person .         oh .     said jeremy .      but enough of this  perhaps     said lady lejean  stepping back .     you make clocks  and we        there was a jingling noise from jeremy   s shirt pocket .  he pulled out a large watch .      if that was chiming the hour  you are fast     said the woman .      er   um   no   you might find it a good idea to  um  put your hands over your ears        it was three o   clock .  and every clock struck it at once .  cuckoos cuckoo   d  the hour pins fell out of the candle clock  the water clocks gurgled and seesawed back as the buckets emptied  bells clanged  gongs banged  chimes tinkled  and the ephebian lawyer beetle turned a somersault .   the trolls had clapped their huge hands over their ears  but lady lejean merely stood with her hands on her hips  head on one side  until the last echo died away .      all correct  we see     she said .      what .     said jeremy .  he   d been thinking  perhaps a vampire  then .      you keep all your clocks at the right time     said lady lejean .     you   re very particular about that  mr .  jeremy .         a clock that doesn   t tell the right time is   wrong     said jeremy .  now he was wishing she   d go away .  her eyes were worrying him .  he   d heard about people having gray eyes  and her eyes were gray  like the eyes of a blind person  but she was clearly looking at him and through him .      yes  there was a little bit of trouble over that  wasn   t there .     said lady lejean .      i   i don   t   i don   t   don   t know what you   re           at the clockmakers    guild .  williamson  who kept his clock five minutes fast .  and you           i am much better now     said jeremy stiffly .     i have medicine .  the guild was very kind .  now please go away .         mr .  jeremy  we want you to build us a clock that is accurate .         all my clocks are accurate     said jeremy  staring at his feet .  he wasn   t due to take his medicine for another five hours and seventeen minutes  but he was feeling the need for it now .     and now i must ask           how accurate are your clocks .         better than a second in eleven months     said jeremy promptly .      that is very good .         yes .     it had been very good .  that was why the guild had been so understanding .  genius is always allowed some leeway  once the hammer has been pried from its hands and the blood has been cleaned up .      we want much better accuracy than that .         it can   t be done .         oh .  you mean that you can   t do it .         no  i can   t .  and if i can   t  then nor can any other clockmaker in the city .  i   d know about it if they could .         so proud .  are you sure .         i   d know .     and he would .  he   d know for certain .  the candle clocks and the water clocks   they were toys  which he kept out of a sort of respect for the early days of timekeeping  and even then he   d spent weeks experimenting with waxes and buckets and had turned out primitive clocks that you could  well  very nearly set your watch by .  it was okay that they couldn   t be that accurate .  they were simple  organic things  parodies of time .  they didn   t grind across his nerves .  but a real clock   well  that was a mechanism  a thing of numbers  and numbers had to be perfect .   she put her head on one side again .     how do you test to that accuracy .     she said .   they   d often asked him that in the guild  once his talent had revealed itself .  he hadn   t been able to answer the question then  either  because it didn   t make sense .  you built a clock to be accurate .  a portrait painter painted a picture .  if it looked like the subject  then it was an accurate picture .  if you built the clock right  it would be accurate .  you didn   t have to test it .  you   d know .      i   d know     he said .      we want you to build a clock that is very accurate .         how accurate .         accurate .         but i can only build to the limit of my materials     said jeremy .     i have   developed certain techniques  but there are things like   the vibration of the traffic in the street  little changes in temperature  that sort of thing .      lady lejean was now inspecting a range of fat imppowered watches .  she picked one up and opened the back .  there was the tiny saddle  and the pedals  but they were forlorn and empty .      no imps .     she said .      i keep them for historical interest     said jeremy .     they were barely accurate to a few seconds a minute  and they   d stop completely overnight .  they were only any good if your idea of accuracy was    around two ish .        he grimaced when he used the term .  it felt like fingernails on a blackboard .      how about invar .     said the lady  still apparently inspecting the museum of clocks .   jeremy looked shocked .     the alloy .  i didn   t think anyone outside the guild knew about that .  and it is very expensive .  worth a lot more than its weight in gold .      lady lejean straightened up .      money is no object     she said .     would invar allow you to reach total accuracy .         no .  i already use it .  it   s true that it is not affected by temperature  but there are always   barriers .  smaller and smaller interferences become bigger and bigger problems .  it   s xeno   s paradox .         ah  yes .  he was the ephebian philosopher who said you couldn   t hit a running man with an arrow  wasn   t he .     said the lady .      in theory  because           but xeno came up with four paradoxes  i believe     said lady lejean .     they involved the idea that there is such a thing as the smallest possible unit of time .  and it must exist  mustn   t it .  consider the present .  it must have a length  because one end of it is connected to the past and the other is connected to the future  and if it didn   t have a length then the present couldn   t exist at all .  there would be no time for it to be the present in .      jeremy was suddenly in love .  he hadn   t felt like this since he   d taken the back off the nursery clock when he was fourteen months old .      then you   re talking about   the fabled    tick of the universe        he said .     and no gear cutter could possibly make gears that small           it depends on what you would call a gear .  have you read this .      lady lejean waved a hand at one of the trolls  who lumbered over and dropped an oblong package on jeremy   s counter .  he undid it .  it contained a small book .      grim fairy tales .     he said .      read the story about the glass clock of bad sch  schein     said lady lejean .      children   s stories .     said jeremy .     what can they tell me .         who knows .  we will call again tomorrow     said lady lejean     to hear about your plans .  in the meantime  here is a little token of our good faith .      the troll laid a large leather bag on the counter .  it clinked with the heavy  rich clink of gold .  jeremy didn   t pay it a great deal of attention .  he had quite a lot of gold .  even skilled clockmakers came to buy his clocks .  gold was useful because it gave him the time to work on more clocks .  these earned him more gold .  gold was  more or less  something that occupied the space between clocks .      i can also obtain invar for you  in large quantities     she said .     that will be part of your payment  although i agree that even invar will not serve your purpose .  mr .  jeremy  both you and i know that your payment for making the first truly accurate clock will be the opportunity to make the first truly accurate clock  yes .      he smiled  nervously .     it would be   wonderful  if it could be done     he said .     really  it would   be the end of clockmaking .         yes     said lady lejean .     no one would ever have to make a clock again .          tick  this desk is neat .   there is a pile of books on it  and a ruler .   there is also  at the moment  a clock made out of cardboard .   miss susan picked it up .   the other teachers in the school were known as stephanie and joan and so on  but to her class she was very strictly miss susan .     strict     in fact  was a word that seemed to cover everything about miss susan and  in the classroom  she insisted on the miss in the same way that a king insists upon your majesty  and for pretty much the same reason .   miss susan wore black  which the headmistress disapproved of but could do nothing about because black was  well  a respectable color .  she was young  but with an indefinable air of age about her .  she wore her hair  which was blond white with one black streak  in a tight bun  the headmistress disapproved of that  too   it suggested an archaic image of teaching  she said  with the assurance of someone who could pronounce a capital letter .  but she didn   t ever dare disapprove of the way miss susan moved  because miss susan moved like a tiger .   it was always very hard to disapprove of miss susan in her presence  because if you did  she gave you a look .  it was not in any way a threatening look .  it was cool and calm .  you just didn   t want to see it again .   the look worked in the classroom  too .  take homework  another archaic practice the headmistress was ineffectively against .  no dog ever ate the homework of one of miss susan   s students  because there was something about miss susan that went home with them  the dog brought them a pen and watched imploringly while they finished it  instead .  miss susan seemed to have an unerring instinct for spotting laziness  and effort  too .  contrary to the headmistress   s instructions  miss susan did not let the children do what they liked .  she let them do what she liked .  it had turned out to be a lot more interesting for everyone .   miss susan held up the cardboard clock and said      who can tell me what this is .      a forest of hands shot up .      yes  miranda .         it   s a clock  miss .      miss susan smiled  carefully avoided the hand that was being waved by a boy called vincent who was also making frantically keen    ooo  ooo  ooo    noises  and chose the boy behind him .      nearly right     she said .     yes  samuel .         it   s all cardboard made to look like a clock     said the boy .      correct .  always see what   s really there .  and i   m supposed to teach you to tell the time with this .     miss susan gave it a sneer and tossed it away .      shall we try a different way .     she said and snapped her fingers .      yes .     the class chorused  and then it went    aah .     as the walls  floor  and ceiling dropped away and the desks were all hovering high over the city .   a few feet away was the huge cracked face of the tower clock of unseen university .   the children nudged one another excitedly .  the fact that their boots were over one hundred feet of fresh air didn   t seem to bother them .  oddly  too  they did not seem surprised .  this was just an interesting thing .  they acted like connoisseurs who had seen other interesting things .  you did  when you were in miss susan   s class .      now  melanie     said miss susan  as a pigeon landed on her desk .     the big hand is on the twelve and the enormous hand is nearly on the ten  so it   s        vincent   s hand shot up .        ooo  miss  ooo  ooo           nearly twelve o   clock     melanie managed .      well done .  but here        the air blurred .  now the desks  still in perfect formation  were firmly on the cobbles of a plaza in a different city .  so was the classroom .  there were the cupboards  and the nature table  and the blackboard .  but the walls had vanished .   no one in the plaza paid the visitors any attention but  oddly  no one tried to walk into them either .  the air was warmer  and smelled of sea and swamp .      anyone know where this is .     said miss susan .      ooo  me  miss  ooo  ooo       vincent could only stretch his body taller if his feet left the ground .      how about you  penelope .     said miss susan .      oh  miss     said a deflated vincent .   penelope  who was beautiful  docile  and  frankly  dim  looked around at the thronged square and the whitewashed  awning hung buildings with an expression close to panic .      we came here in geography last week     said miss susan .     city surrounded by swamps .  on the vieux river .  famous cookery .  lots of seafood    .      penelope   s exquisite brow creased .  the pigeon on miss susan   s desk fluttered down and joined the other pigeons prospecting for scraps among the flagstones  cooing very gently to them in pidgin pigeon .   aware that a lot could happen while people waited for penelope to complete a thought process  miss susan waved at a clock on a shop across the square and said     and who can tell me the time here in genua  please .         ooo  miss  miss  ooo        a boy called gordon cautiously admitted that it might be three o   clock  to the audible disappointment of the inflatable vincent .      that   s right     said miss susan .     can anyone tell me why it   s three o   clock in genua while it   s twelve o   clock in ankh morpork .      there was no avoiding it this time .  if vincent   s hand had gone up any faster it would have fried by air friction .     yes  vincent .         ooo miss speed of light miss it goes at six hundred miles an hour and at the moment the sun   s rising on the rim near genua so twelve o   clock takes three hours to get to us miss .      miss susan sighed .      very good  vincent     she said and stood up .  every eye in the room watched her as she crossed over to the stationery cupboard .  it seemed to have traveled with them and now  if there had been anyone to note such things  they might have seen faint lines in the air that denoted walls and windows and doors .  and if they were intelligent observers  they   d have said  so   this classroom is in some way still in ankh morpork and also in genua  is it .  is this a trick .  is this real .  is it imagination .  or is it that  to this particular teacher  there is not much of a difference .   the inside of the cupboard was also present  and it was in that shadowy  paper smelling recess that she kept the stars .   there were gold stars and silver stars .  one gold star was worth three silver ones .   the headmistress disapproved of those  as well .  she said they encouraged competitiveness .  miss susan said that was the point  and the headmistress scuttled away before she got the look .   silver stars weren   t awarded frequently  and gold stars happened less than once a fortnight  and were vied for accordingly .  right now miss susan selected a silver star .  pretty soon vincent the keen would have a galaxy of his very own .  to give him his due  he was quite disinterested in which kind of star he got .  quantity  that was what he liked .  miss susan had privately marked him down as boy most likely to be killed one day by his wife .   she walked back to her desk and laid the star  tantalizingly  in front of her .      and an extra special question     she said  with a hint of malice .     does that mean it   s    then    there when it   s    now    here .      the hand slowed halfway in its rise .      ooo       vincent began and then stopped .     doesn   t make sense  miss           questions don   t have to make sense  vincent     said miss susan .     but answers do .      there was a kind of sigh from penelope .  to miss susan   s surprise  the face that one day would surely cause her father to have to hire bodyguards was emerging from its normal happy daydream and wrapping itself around an answer .  her alabaster hand was rising  too .   the class watched expectantly .      yes  penelope .         it   s           yes .         it   s always    now    everywhere  miss .         exactly right .  well done .  all right  vincent  you can have the silver star .  and for you  penelope        miss susan went back to the cupboard of stars .  getting penelope to step off her cloud long enough even to answer a question was worth a star  but a deep philosophical statement had to make it a gold one .      i want you all to open your notebooks and write down what penelope just told us     she said brightly as she sat down .   and then she saw the inkwell on her desk beginning to rise like penelope   s hand .  it was a ceramic pot  made to drop neatly into a round hole in the woodwork .  it came up smoothly and turned out to be balanced on the cheerful skull of the death of rats .   it winked one blue glowing eye socket at miss susan .   with quick little movements  not even looking down  she whisked the inkwell aside with one hand and reached for a thick volume of stories with the other .  she brought it down so hard on the hole that blue black ink splashed from the inkwell onto the cobbles .   then she raised the desk lid and peeped inside .   there was  of course  nothing there .  at least  nothing macabre .      unless you counted the piece of chocolate half gnawed by rat teeth and a note in heavy gothic lettering saying      see me  and signed by a very familiar alpha and omega symbol and the word      grandfather .   susan picked up the note and screwed it into a ball  aware that she was trembling with rage .  how dare he .  and to send the rat  too .   she tossed the ball into the wastepaper basket .  she never missed .  sometimes the basket moved in order to ensure that this was the case .      and now we   ll go and see what the time is in klatch     she told the watching children .   on the desk  the book had fallen open at a certain page .  and  later on  it would be story time .  and miss susan would wonder  too late  why the book had been on her desk when she had never even seen it before .   and a splash of blue black ink would stay on the cobbles of the square in genua  until the evening rainstorm washed it away .       tick  the first words read by seekers of enlightenment in the secret  gong banging  yeti haunted valleys near the hub of the world are read when they look into the life of wen the eternally surprised .   the first question they ask is     why was he eternally surprised .      and they are told     wen considered the nature of time and understood that the universe is  instant by instant  re created anew .  therefore  he understood  there is  in truth  no past  only a memory of the past .  blink your eyes  and the world you see next did not exist when you closed them .  therefore  he said  the only appropriate state of the mind is surprise .  the only appropriate state of the heart is joy .  the sky you see now  you have never seen before .  the perfect moment is now .  be glad of it .      the first words read by the young lu tze when he sought perplexity in the dark  teeming  rain soaked city of ankh morpork were    rooms for rent  very reasonable .     and he was glad of it .       tick  where there is suitable country for grain  people farm .  they know the taste of good soil .  they grow grain .   where there is good steel country  furnaces turn the sky to sunset red all night .  the hammers never stop .  they make steel .   there is coal country  and beef country  and grass country .  the world is full of countries where one thing shapes the land and the people .  and up here in the high valleys around the hub of the world  where the snow is never far away  this is enlightenment country .   here are people that know that there is no steel  only the idea of steel .   they give names to new things  and things that don   t exist .  they seek the essence of being and the nature of the soul .  they make wisdom .   temples command every glacier headed valley  where there are particles of ice in the wind  even at the height of summer .   there are the listening monks  seeking to discern within the hubbub of the world the faint echoes of the sounds that set the universe in motion .   there are the brothers of cool  a reserved and secretive sect  which believes that only through ultimate coolness can the universe be comprehended  and that black works with everything  and that chrome will never truly go out of style .   in their vertiginous temple criss crossed with tightropes  the balancing monks test the tension of the world and then set out on long  perilous journeys to restore its equilibrium .  the results may be seen on high mountains and isolated islets .  they are small brass weights  none of them bigger than a fist .  they work .  well  obviously they work .  the world has not tipped up yet .   and in the highest  greenest  airiest valley of all  where apricots are grown and the streams have floating ice in them even on the hottest day  is the monastery of oi dong and the fighting monks    order of wen .  the other sects call them the history monks .  not much is known about what they do  although some have remarked on the strange fact that it is always a wonderful spring day in the little valley and the cherry trees are always in bloom .   the rumor is that the monks have some kind of duty to see that tomorrow happens according to some mystic plan devised by some man who kept on being surprised .   in fact  for some time now  and it would be impossible and ridiculous to say how long  the truth has been stranger and more dangerous .   the job of the history monks is to see that tomorrow happens at all .   the master of novices met with rinpo  chief acolyte to the abbot .  at the moment  at least  the position of chief acolyte was a very important post .  in his current condition  the abbot needed many things done for him and his attention span was low .  in circumstances like this  there is always someone willing to carry the load .  there are rinpos everywhere .      it   s ludd again     said the master of novices .      oh  dear .  surely one naughty child can   t trouble you .         one ordinary naughty child  no .  where is this one from .         master soto sent him .  you know .  of our ankh morpork section .  he found him in the city .  the boy has a natural talent  i understand     said rinpo .   the master of novices looked shocked .      talent .  he is a wicked thief .  he   d been apprenticed to the guild of thieves .     he said .      well .  children sometimes steal .  beat them a little  and they stop stealing .  basic education     said rinpo .      ah .  there is a problem .         yes .         he is very  very fast .  around him  things go missing .  little things .  unimportant things .  but even when he is watched closely  he is never seen to take them .         then perhaps he does not .         he walks through a room and things vanish .     said the master of novices .      he   s that fast .  it   s just as well soto did find him  then .  but a thief is           they turn up later  in odd places     said the master of novices  apparently grudging the admission .     he does it out of mischief  i   m sure .      the breeze blew the scent of cherry blossom across the terrace .      look  i am used to disobedience     said the master of novices .     that is part of a novice   s life .  but he is also tardy .         tardy .         he turns up late for his lessons .         how can a pupil be tardy here .         mr .  ludd doesn   t seem to care .  mr .  ludd seems to think he can do as he pleases .  he is also   smart .      the acolyte nodded .  ah .  smart .  the word had a very specific meaning  here in the valley .  a smart boy thought he knew more than his tutors  and answered back  and interrupted .  a smart boy was worse than a stupid one .      he does not accept discipline .     said the acolyte .      yesterday  when i was lecturing the class for temporal theory in the stone room  i caught him just staring at the wall .  clearly not paying attention .  but when i called out to him to solve the problem i   d chalked on the blackboard  knowing full well that he could not  he did so .  instantly .  and correctly .         well .  you did say he was a smart boy .      the master of novices looked embarrassed .     except   it was not the right problem .  i had been instructing the fifth djim field agents earlier and had left part of the test on the board .  an extremely complex phase space problem involving residual harmonics in n histories .  none of them got it right .  to be honest  even i had to look up the answer .         so  i take it  you punished him for not answering the right question .         obviously .  but that sort of behavior is disruptive .  most of the time i think he   s not all there .  he never pays attention  he always knows the answers  and he can never tell you how he knows .  we can   t keep thrashing him .  he is a bad example to the other pupils .  there   s no educating a smart boy .      the acolyte thoughtfully watched a flight of white doves circle the monastery roofs .     we cannot send him away now     he said at last .     soto said he saw him perform the stance of the coyote .  that   s how he was found .  can you imagine that .  he   d had no training at all .  can you imagine what would happen if someone with that kind of skill ran around loose .  thank goodness soto was alert .         but he has turned him into my problem .  the boy disrupts tranquillity .      rinpo sighed .  the master of novices was a good and conscientious man  he knew  but it had been a long time since he   d been out in the world .  people like soto spent every day in the world of time .  they learned flexibility  because if you were stiff out there  you were dead .  people like soto   now  there was an idea     he looked toward the other end of the terrace  where a couple of servants were sweeping up the fallen cherry blossom .      i see a harmonious solution     he said .      oh  yes .         an unusually talented boy like ludd needs a master  not the discipline of the schoolroom .         possibly  but        the master of novices followed rinpo   s gaze .      oh     he said  and he smiled in a way that was not entirely nice .  this smile contained a certain anticipatory element  a hint that trouble might be in store for someone who  in his opinion  richly deserved it .      a name occurs     said rinpo .      to me also     said the master of novices .      a name i   ve heard too often     rinpo went on .      i suppose that either he will break the boy  or the boy will break him  or it is always possible that they will break each other       the master mused .      so  in the patois of the world     said rinpo     there is no actual downside .         would the abbot approve  though .     said the master  testing a welcome idea for any weak points .     he has always had a certain rather tiresome regard for   the sweeper .         the abbot is a dear kind man but at the moment his teeth are giving him trouble and he is not walking at all well     said rinpo .     and these are difficult times .  i   m sure he will be pleased to accept our joint recommendation .  why  it   s practically a minor matter of day to day affairs .      and thus the future was decided .   they were not bad men .  they had worked hard on behalf of the valley for hundreds of years .  but it is possible  after a while  to develop certain dangerous habits of thought .  one is that  while all important enterprises need careful organization  it is the organization that needs organizing  rather than the enterprise .  and another is that tranquillity is always a good thing .       tick  there was a row of alarm clocks on the table by jeremy   s bed .  he did not need them  because he woke up when he wanted to .  they were there for testing .  he set them for seven  and woke up at      to check that they went off on time .   tonight he went to bed early  with a drink of water and the grim fairy tales .   he had never been interested in stories  at any age  and had never quite understood the basic concept .  he   d never read a work of fiction all the way through .  he did remember  as a small boy  being really annoyed at the depiction of hickory dickory dock in a rag book of nursery rhymes because the clock in the drawing was completely wrong for the period .   he tried to read grim fairy tales .  they had titles like    how the wicked queen danced in red hot shoes .     and    the old lady in the oven .     there was simply no mention of clocks of any sort in any of them .  their authors seemed to have a thing about not mentioning clocks .      the glass clock of bad sch  schein     on the other hand  did have a clock .  of a sort .  and it was   odd .  a wicked man   readers could see he was wicked because it said he was wicked  right there on the page   built a clock of glass in which he captured time herself  but things went wrong because there was one part of the clock  a spring  that he couldn   t make out of glass  and it broke under the strain  and time was set free  and the man aged ten thousand years in a second and crumbled to dust and   not surprisingly  in jeremy   s opinion   was never seen again .  the story ended with a moral  large enterprises depend upon small details .  jeremy couldn   t see why it couldn   t have just as well been  it   s wrong to trap nonexistent women in clocks  or  it would have worked with a glass spring .   but even to jeremy   s inexperienced eye  there was something wrong with the whole story .  it read as though the writer was trying to make sense of something he   d seen  or been told  and had misunderstood things .  and   hah .    although it was set hundreds of years ago when even in uberwald there were only natural cuckoo clocks  the artist had drawn a long case clock of the sort that wasn   t around even fifteen years ago .  the stupidity of some people .  you   d laugh if it wasn   t so tragic .   he put the book aside and spent the rest of the evening doing a little design work for the guild .  they paid him handsomely for this  provided he promised never to turn up in person .   then he put the work on the bedside table by the clocks .  he blew out the candle .  he went to sleep .  he dreamed .   the glass clock ticked .  it stood in the middle of the workshop   s wooden floor  giving off a silvery light .  jeremy walked around it  or perhaps it spun gently around him .   it was taller than a man .  within the transparent case red and blue lights twinkled like stars .  the air smelled of acid .   now his point of view dived into the thing  the crystalline thing  plunging down through the layers of glass and quartz .  they rose past him  their smoothness becoming walls hundreds of miles high  and still he fell between slabs that were becoming rough  grainy        full of holes .  the blue and red lights were here too  pouring past him .   and only now was there sound .  it came from the darkness ahead  a slow beat that was ridiculously familiar  a heartbeat magnified a million times        tchum   tchum      each beat slower than mountains and bigger than worlds  dark and blood red .  he heard a few beats and then his fall slowed  stopped  and he began to soar back up through the sleeting light until a brightness ahead became a room .   he had to remember all this .  it was all so clear  once you saw it .  so simple .  so easy .  he could see every part  how they interlocked  how they were made     and now it began to fade .   of course  it was only a dream .  he told himself that and was comforted by it .  but he had gone to some lengths with this one  he had to admit .  for example  there was a mug of tea steaming on the nearby workbench  and the sound of voices on the other side of the door     there was a knocking at the door .  jeremy wondered if the dream would end when the door was opened  and then the door disappeared and the knocking went on .  it was coming from downstairs .   the time was      .  jeremy glanced at the alarm clocks to make sure they were right  then pulled his dressing gown around him and hurried downstairs .  he opened the front door a crack .  there was no one there .      nah  dahn    ere  mister .      someone lower down was a dwarf .      name of clockson .     it said .      yes    .      a clipboard was thrust through the gap .      sign    ere  where it says    sign    ere .     thank you .  okay  lads        behind him  a couple of trolls tipped up a handcart .  a large wooden crate crashed onto the cobbles .      what is this .     said jeremy .      express package     said the dwarf  taking the clipboard .     come all the way from uberwald .  must   ve cost someone a packet .  look at all them seals and stickers on it .         can   t you bring it in       jeremy began  but the cart was already moving off  with the merry jingle and tinkle of fragile items .   it started to rain .  jeremy peered at the label on the crate .  it was certainly addressed to him  in a neat round hand  and just above it was the seal with the double headed bat of uberwald .  there was no other marking anywhere except  near the bottom  the words  .   then the crate started to swear .  it was muffled  and in a foreign language  but all swearing has a certain international content .      er   hello .     said jeremy .   the crate rocked and landed on one of the long sides  with extra cursing .  there was some thumping from inside  some louder swearing  and the crate teetered upright again with the alleged top the right way up .   a piece of board slid aside and a crowbar dropped out and onto the street with a clang .  the voice that had lately been swearing said     if you would be tho good .      jeremy inserted the bar into a likely looking crack  and pulled .   the crate sprang apart .  he dropped the bar .  there was a   a creature inside .      i don   t know     it said  pulling bits of packing material off itself     eight bloody dayth with no problemth  and thothe idiotth get it wrong on the doorthtep .     it nodded at jeremy .     good morning  thur .  i thuppothe you are mithter jeremy .         yes  but           my name ith igor  thur .  my credentialth  thur .      a hand like an industrial accident held together with stitches thrust a sheaf of papers toward jeremy .  he recoiled instinctively  and then felt embarrassed and took them .      i think there has been a mistake     he said .      no  no mithtake     said igor  pulling a carpetbag out of the ruins of the crate .     you need an athithtant .  and when it cometh to athithtanth  you cannot go wrong with an igor .  everyone knowth that .  could we go in out of the rain  thur .  it maketh my kneeth rutht .         but i don   t need an assist       jeremy began  but that was wrong  wasn   t it .  he just couldn   t keep assistants .  they always left within a week .      morning  sir .     said a cheery voice .   another cart had pulled up .  this one was painted a gleaming  hygienic white  and was full of milk churns  and had r .  soak  dairyman painted on the side .  distracted  jeremy looked up at the beaming face of mr .  soak  who was holding a bottle of milk in each hand .      one pint  squire  as per usual .  and perhaps another one if you   ve got company .         er  er  er   yes  thank you .         and the yogurt is particularly fine this week  squire     said mr .  soak encouragingly .      er  er  i think not  mr .  soak .         need any eggs  cream  butter  buttermilk  or cheese .         not as such  mr .  soak .         right you are  then     said mr .  soak  unabashed .     see you tomorrow  then .         er  yes     said jeremy  as the cart moved on .  mr .  soak was a friend  which in jeremy   s limited social vocabulary meant    someone i speak to once or twice a week .     he approved of the milkman  because he was regular and punctual and had the bottles at the doorstep every morning on the stroke of   a . m .     er  er   goodbye     he said .   he turned to igor .      how did you know i needed       he tried .  but the strange man had gone indoors  and a frantic jeremy tracked him down in the workshop .      oh yeth  very nice     said igor  who was taking it all in with the air of a connoisseur .     that   s a turnball mk  micro lathe  ithn   t it .  i thaw it in their catalogue .  very nithe indee           i didn   t ask anyone for an assistant .     said jeremy .     who sent you .         we are igorth  thur .         yes  you said .  look  i don   t           no  thur .     we r igorth     thur .  the organithathion  thur .         what organization .         for plathementh  thur .  you thee  thur  the thing ith   an igor often findth himthelf between marthterth through no fault of hith own  you thee .  and on the other hand              you have two thumbs       breathed jeremy  who had just noticed and couldn   t stop himself .     two on each hand .         oh  yeth  thur  very handy     said igor  not even glancing down     on the other hand there ith no thortage of people wanting an igor .  so my aunt igorina runth our thelect little agenthy .         for   lots of igors .     said jeremy .      oh  there   th a fair number of uth .  we   re a big family .     igor handed jeremy a card .   he read                we r igors    a spare hand when needed    the old rathaus  bad sch  schein  c mail  yethmarthter uberwald               jeremy stared at the semaphore address .  his normal ignorance of anything that wasn   t to do with clocks did not apply here .  he   d been quite interested in the new cross continent semaphore system after hearing that it made quite a lot of use of clockwork mechanisms to speed up the message flow .  so you could send a clacks message to hire an igor .  well  that explained the speed  at least .      rathaus     he said .     that means something like a council hall  doesn   t it .         normally  thur   normally     said igor reassuringly .      do you really have semaphore addresses in uberwald .         oh  yeth .  we are ready to grathp the future with both handth  thur .            and four thumbs           yeth  thur .  we can grathp like anything .         and then you mailed yourself here .         thertainly  thur .  we igors are no thtrangers to dithcomfort .      jeremy looked down at the paperwork he   d been handed  and a name caught his eye .   the top paper was signed .  in a way  at least .  there was a message in neat capitals  as neat as printing  and a name at the end .       he will be useful  lejean    he remembered .     oh  lady lejean is behind this .  she had you sent to me .         that   th correct  thur .      feeling that igor was expecting more of him  jeremy made a show of reading through the rest of what turned out to be references .  some of them were written in what he could only hope was dried brown ink  one was in crayon  and several were singed around the edges .  they were all fulsome .  after a while  though  a certain tendency could be noted among the signatories .      this one is signed by someone called mad doctor scoop     he said .      oh  he wathn   t actually named mad  thur .  it wath more like a nickname  ath it were .         was he mad  then .         who can thay  thur     said igor calmly .      and crazed baron haha .  it says under reason for leaving that he was crushed by a burning windmill .         cathe of mithtaken identity  thur .         really .         yeth  thur .  i underthtand the mob mithtook him for thcreaming doctor berthserk  thur .         oh .  ah  yes .     jeremy glanced down .     who you also worked for  i see .         yeth  thur .         and who died of blood poisoning .         yeth  thur .  cauthed by a dirty pitchfork .         and   nipsie the impaler .         er   would you believe he ran a kebab thhop  thur .         did he .         not conventionally tho  thur .         you mean he was mad  too .         ah .  well  he did have hith little wayth  i mutht admit  but an igor never patheth judgment on hith marthter or mithtreth  thur .  that ith the code of the igorth  thur     he added patiently .     it would be a funny old world if we were all alike  thur .      jeremy was completely baffled as to his next move .  he   d never been very good at talking to people  and this  apart from lady lejean and a wrangle with mr .  soak over an unwanted cheese  was the longest conversation he   d had for a year .  perhaps it was because it was hard to think of igor as coming under the heading of people .  up until now  jeremy   s definition of    people    had not included anyone with more stitches than a handbag .      i   m not sure i   ve got any work for you  though     he said .     i   ve got a new commission  but i   m not sure how   anyway  i   m not insane .         that   th not compulthory  thur .         i   ve actually got a piece of paper that says i   m not  you know .         well done  thur .         not many people have one of those .         very true  thur .         i take medicine  you know .         well done  thur     said igor .     i   ll jutht go and make thome breakfatht  thall i .  while you get drethed   marthter .      jeremy clutched at his damp dressing gown .      i will be down shortly     he said  and hurried up the stairs .   igor   s gaze took in the racks of tools .  there was not a speck of dust on them  the files  hammers  and pliers were ranged according to size  and the items on the workbench were positioned with geometrical exactitude .   he pulled open a drawer .  screws were laid in perfect rows .   he looked around at the walls .  they were bare  except for the shelves of clocks .  this was surprising   even dribbling doctor vibes had a calendar on the wall  which added a splash of color .  admittedly  it was from the acid bath and restraint co .   in ugli  and the color it splashed was mostly red  but at least it showed some recognition of a world outside the four walls .   igor was puzzled .  igor had never worked for a sane person before .  he   d worked for a number of   well  the world called them madmen  and he   d worked for several normal people  in that they only indulged in minor and socially acceptable insanities  but he couldn   t recall ever working for a completely sane person .   obviously  he reasoned  if sticking screws up your nose was madness  then numbering them and keeping them in careful compartments was sanity  which was the opposite     ah .  no .  it wasn   t  was it     he smiled .  he was beginning to feel quite at home already .       tick  lu tze the sweeper was in his garden of five surprises  carefully cultivating his mountains .  his broom leaned against the hedge .   above him  looming over the temple gardens  the big stone statue of wen the eternally surprised sat with its face locked in a permanent wide eyed expression of  yes  pleasant surprise .   as a hobby  mountains appeal to those people who in normal circumstances are said to have a great deal of time on their hands .  lu tze had no time at all .  time was something that largely happened to other people  he viewed it in the same way that people on the shore viewed the sea .  it was big and it was out there  and sometimes it was an invigorating thing to dip a toe into  but you couldn   t live in it all the time .  besides  it always made his skin wrinkle .   at the moment  in the never ending  ever re created moment of this peaceful  sunlit little valley  he was fiddling with the little mirrors and shovels and morphic resonators and even stranger devices required to make a mountain grow to no more than six inches high .   the cherry trees were still in bloom .  they always were in bloom  here .  a gong rang  somewhere back in the temple .  a flock of white doves took off from the monastery roof .   a shadow fell over the mountain .   lu tze glanced at the person who had entered the garden .  he made the perfunctory symbol of servitude to the rather annoyed looking boy in the novice   s robe .      yes  master .     he said .      i am looking for the one they call lu tze     said the boy .     personally  i don   t think he really exists .         i   ve got glaciation     said lu tze  ignoring this .     at last .  see  master .  it   s only an inch long  but already it   s carving its own little valley .  magnificent  isn   t it .         yes  yes  very good     said the novice  being kind to an underling .     isn   t this the garden of lu tze .         you mean  lu tze who is famous for his bonsai mountains .      the novice looked from the line of plates to the little wrinkled smiling man .      you are lu tze .  but you   re just a sweeper .  i   ve seen you cleaning out the dormitories .  i   ve seen people kick you .      lu tze  apparently not hearing this  picked up a plate about a foot across on which a small cinder cone was smoking .      what do you think of this  master .     he said .     volcanic .  and it is bloody hard to do  excuse my klatchian .      the novice took a step forward  and leaned down and looked directly into the sweeper   s eyes .   lu tze was not often disconcerted  but he was now .      you are lu tze .         yes  lad .  i am lu tze .      the novice took a deep breath and thrust out a skinny arm .  it was holding a small scroll .      from the abbot   er  venerable one .      the scroll wobbled in the nervous hand .      most people call me lu tze  lad .  or sweeper .  until they get to know me better  some call me    get out the way        said lu tze  carefully wrapping up his tools .     i   ve never been very venerable  except in cases of bad spelling .      he looked around the saucers for the miniature shovel he used for glacial work  and couldn   t see it anywhere .  surely he   d put it down just a moment ago .   the acolyte was watching him with an expression of awe mixed with residual suspicion .  a reputation like lu tze   s got around .  this was the man who had   well  who had done practically everything  if you listened to all the rumors .  but he didn   t look as though he had .  he was just a little bald man with a wispy beard and a faint  amiable smile .   lu tze patted the young man on the shoulder in an effort to put him at his ease .      let us see what the abbot wants     he said  unrolling the rice paper .     oh .  you are to take me to see him  it says here .      a look of panic froze the novice   s face .     what .  how can i do that .  novices aren   t allowed inside the inner temple .         really .  in that case  let me take you  to take me  to see him     said lu tze .      you are allowed into the inner temple .     said the novice  and then put his hand over his mouth .     but you   re just a swe   oh           that   s right .  not even a proper monk  let alone a dong     said the sweeper cheerfully .     amazing  isn   t it .         but people talk about you as if you were as high as the abbot .         oh  dear me  no     said lu tze .     i   m nothing like as holy .  never really got a grip on the cosmic harmony .         but you   ve done all those incredible           oh  i didn   t say i   m not good at what i do     said lu tze  as he ambled with his broom over his shoulder .     just not holy .  shall we go .         er   lu tze .     said the novice  following him along the ancient brick path .      yes .         why is this called garden of five surprises .         what was your name back in the world  hasty young man .     said lu tze .      newgate .  newgate ludd  ven        lu tze held up a warning finger .     ah .         sweeper  i mean .         ludd  eh .  ankh morpork lad .         yes  sweeper     said the boy .  the sudden dejected tones suggested he knew what was coming next .      raised by the thieves    guild .  one of    ludd   s lads    .      the boy formerly known as newgate looked the old man in the eye and  when he replied  it was in the singsong voice of someone who   d answered the question too many times .     yes  sweeper .  yes  i was a foundling .  yes  we get called ludd   s lads and lasses after one of the founders of the guild .  yes  that   s my adopted surname .  yes  it was a good life and sometimes i wish i still had it .      lu tze appeared not to hear this .     who sent you here .         a monk called soto discovered me .  he said i had talent .         marco .  the one with all the hair .         that   s right .  only i thought the rule was that all monks were shaved .         oh  soto says he is bald under the hair     said lu tze .     he says the hair is a separate creature that just happens to live on him .  they gave him a field posting really quickly after he came up with that one .  hardworking fellow  mark you  and friendly as anything provided you don   t touch his hair .  important lesson there  you don   t survive in the field by obeying all the rules  including those relating to mental processes .  and what name were you given when you were enrolled .         lobsang  ven   uh  sweeper .         lobsang ludd .         er   yes  sweeper .         amazing .  so  lobsang ludd  you tried to count my surprises  did you .  everybody does .  surprise is the nature of time  and five is the number of surprise .         yes  sweeper .  i found the little bridge that tilts and throws you in the carp pool           good .  good .            and i have found the bronze sculpture of a butterfly that flaps its wings when you breathe on it           that   s two .         there   s the surprising way those little daisies spray you with venomous pollen           ah  yes .  many people find them extremely surprising .         and i believe the fourth surprise is the yodeling stick insect .         well done     said lu tze  beaming .     it   s very good  isn   t it .         but i can   t find the fifth surprise .         really .  let me know when you find it     said lu tze .   lobsang ludd thought about this as he trailed after the sweeper .      the garden of five surprises is a test     he said  at last .      oh  yes .  nearly everything is .      lobsang nodded .  it was like the garden of the four elements .  every novice found the bronze symbols of three of them   in the carp pond  under a rock  painted on a kite   but none of lobsang   s classmates found fire .  there didn   t appear to be a fire anywhere in the garden .   after a while lobsang had reasoned thus  there were  in fact  five elements  as they had been taught .  four made up the universe  and the fifth  surprise  allowed it to keep on happening .  no one had said that the four in the garden were the material four  so the fourth element in the garden could be surprise at the fact that fire wasn   t there .  besides  fire was not generally found in a garden  and the other signs were  truly  in their element .  so he   d gone down to the bakeries and opened one of the ovens and there  glowing red hot below the loaves  was the symbol of fire .      then   i expect that the fifth surprise is  there is no fifth surprise     he said .      nice try  but no cylindrical smoking thing     said lu tze .     and is it not written    oo  you are so sharp you   ll cut yourself one of these days    .         um   i haven   t read that in the sacred texts yet  sweeper     said lobsang uncertainly .      no  you wouldn   t have     said lu tze .   they stepped out of the brittle sunlight into the deep cold of the temple  and walked on through ancient halls and down stairways cut into the rock .  the sound of distant chanting followed them .  lu tze  who was not holy and therefore could think unholy thoughts  occasionally wondered whether the chanting monks were chanting anything  or were just going    aahaaahahah .     you could never tell with all that echo .   he turned off the main passage and reached for the handles of a pair of large  red lacquered doors .  then he looked behind him .  lobsang had stopped dead  some yards away .      coming .         but not even dongs are allowed in there .     said lobsang .     you have to be a third djim ting at least .         yeah  right .  it   s a shortcut .  come on  it   s drafty out here .      with extreme reluctance  expecting at any moment the outraged scream of authority  lobsang trailed after the sweeper .   and he was just a sweeper .  one of the people who swept the floors and washed the clothes and cleaned the privies .  no one had ever mentioned it .  novices heard about lu tze from their very first day   how he   d gone into some of the most tangled knots of time and unraveled them  how he   d constantly dodged the traffic on the crossroads of history  how he could divert time with a word and used this to develop the most subtle arts of battle        and here was a little skinny man who was sort of generically ethnic  so that he looked as though he could have come from anywhere  in a robe than had once been white before it fell to all those stains and patches  and the sandals repaired with string .  and the friendly grin  as if he was constantly waiting for something amusing to happen .  and no belt at all  just another piece of string to hold his robe closed .  even some novices got to the level of gray dong in their first year .   the dojo was busy with senior monks at practice .  lobsang had to dodge aside as a pair of fighters whirled past  arms and legs blurring as each sought an opening  paring time into thinner and thinner slivers        you .  sweeper .      he looked around  but the shout had been directed at lu tze .  a ting  only just elevated to the third djim by the fresh look of his belt  was advancing on the little man  his face red with fury .      what for are you coming in here  cleaner of filth .  this is forbidden .      lu tze   s little smile didn   t change .  but he reached in his robe and brought out a small bag .         s a shortcut     he said .  he pulled a pinch of tobacco and  while the ting loomed over him  began to roll a cigarette .     and there   s dirt everywhere  too .  i   ll certainly have a word with the man who does this floor .         how dare you insult .     screamed the monk .     back to the kitchens with you  sweeper .      cowering behind lu tze  lobsang realized that the entire dojo had stopped to watch this .  one or two of the monks were whispering to one another .  the man in the brown robe of the dojo master was watching impassively from his chair  with his chin on his hand .   with great patience and infuriating delicacy  like a samurai arranging flowers  lu tze marshaled the shreds of tobacco in the flimsy cigarette paper .      no  i reckon i   ll go out of that door over there  if you don   t mind     he said .      impudence .  then you are ready to fight  enemy of dust .     the man leapt back and raised his hands to form the combat of the hake .  he spun around and planted a kick on a heavy leather sack  hitting it so hard that its supporting chain broke .  then he was back to face lu tze  hands now held in the advancement of the snake .      ai .  shao .  hai eee       he began .   the dojo master stood up .      hold .     he commanded .     do you not want to know the name of the man you are about to destroy .      the fighter held his stance  glaring at lu tze .      i don   t need to know name of sweeper     he said .   lu tze rolled the cigarette into a skinny cylinder and winked at the angry man  which only stoked the anger .      it is always wise to know the name of a sweeper  boy     said the dojo master .     and my question was not addressed to you .          tick  jeremy stared at his bedsheets .   they were covered in writing .  his own handwriting .   it trailed across the pillow and onto the wall .  there were sketches  too  scored deeply into the plaster .   he found his pencil under the bed .  he   d even sharpened it .  in his sleep  he   d sharpened a pencil .  and by the look of it  he   d been writing and drawing for hours .   trying to draw a dream .   with  down one side of his eiderdown  a list of parts .   it had all made absolute sense when he   d seen it  like a hammer or a stick or wheelbright   s gravity escapement .  it had been like meeting an old friend .  and now   he stared at the scrawled lines .  he   d been writing so fast he   d ignored punctuation and some of the letters  too .  but he could see some sense in there .   he   d heard of this sort of thing .  great inventions sometimes did arise from dreams and daydreams .  didn   t hepzibah whitlow have the idea of the adjustable pendulum clock as a result of his work as the public hangman .  didn   t wilframe balderton always say that the idea for the fish tail escapement came after he   d eaten too much lobster .   yes  it had all been so clear in the dream .  by daylight  it needed a bit more work .   there was a clatter of dishes from the little kitchen behind his workshop .  he hurried down  dragging the sheet behind him .      i usually have       he began .         toatht  thur     said igor  turning away from the range .     lightly browned  i thuthpect .         how did you know that .         an igor learnth to antithipate  thur     said igor .     what a wonderful little kitchen  thur .  i   ve never theen a drawer marked    thpoonth    which jutht hath thpoonth in it .         are you any good at working with glass  igor .     said jeremy  ignoring this .      no  thur     said igor  buttering the toast .      you   re not .         no  thur .  i am bloody amathing at it  thur .  many of my marthterth had needed   thpethial apparatuth not readily obtainable elthwhere  thur .  what wath it you wanted .         how would we go about building this .      jeremy spread the sheet on the table .   the slice of toast dropped from igor   s black nailed fingers .      is there something wrong .     said jeremy .      i thought thomeone wath walking over my grave  thur     said igor  still looking shocked .      er   you haven   t actually ever had a grave  have you .     said jeremy .      jutht a figure of thpeech  thur  jutht a figure of thpeech     said igor  looking hurt .      this is an idea i   ve   i   ve had for a clock           the glath clock     said igor .     yeth .  i know about it .  my grandfather igor helped build the firtht one .         the first one .  but it   s just a story for children .  and i dreamed about it  and           grandfather igor alwayth thed there wath thomething very thtrange about all that     said igor .     the explothion and everything .         it exploded .  because of the metal spring .         not exactly an explothion     said igor .     we   re no thtrangerth to explothionth  uth igorth .  it wath   very odd .  and we   re no thtrangerth to odd  either .         are you telling me it really existed .      igor seemed embarrassed about this .      yeth     he said     and then again  no .         things either exist or they don   t     said jeremy .     i am very clear about that .  i have medicine .         it exithted     said igor     and then  after it did  it never had .  thith ith what my grandfather told me  and he built that clock with thethe very handth .      jeremy looked down .  igor   s hands were gnarled  and  now he came to look at them  had a lot of scar tissue around the wrists .      we really believe in heirloomth in our family     said igor  catching his gaze .      sort of   hand me downs  ahahaha     said jeremy .  he wondered where his medicine was .      very droll  thur     said igor .     but grandfather igor alwayth thaid that afterward it wath like   a dream  thur .         a dream           the workthop wath different .  the clock wathn   t there .  demented doctor wingle  that wath hith marthter at the time  wathn   t working on the glath clock at all but on a way of extracting thunthine from orangeth .  thingth were different and they alwayth had been  thur .  like it never happened .         but it turned up in a book for children .         yeth  thur .  bit of a conundrum  thur .      jeremy stared at the sheet with its burden of scribbles .  an accurate clock .  that   s all it was .  a clock that   d make all other clocks unnecessary  lady lejean had said .  building a clock like that would mean the clockmaker went down in timekeeping history .  true  the book had said that time had got trapped in the clock  but jeremy had no interest whatsoever in things that were made up .  anyway  a clock measured .  distance didn   t get tangled up in a tape measure .  all a clock did was count teeth on a wheel .  or   light     light with teeth .  he   d seen that in the dream .  light not as something bright in the sky  but as an excited line  going up and down like a wave        could you   build something like this .     he said .   igor looked at the drawings again .      yeth     he said  nodding .  then he pointed to several large glass containers around the drawing of the central column of the clock .     and i know what thethe are     he said .      in my dr   i mean  i imagined them as fizzing     said jeremy .      very  very thecret knowledge  thothe jarth     said igor .     can you get copper rodth here  thur .         in ankh morpork .  easily .         and thinc .         lots of it  yes .         thulphuric athid .         by the carboy  yes .         i mutht have died and gone to heaven     said igor .     jutht put me near enough copper and thinc and athid  thur     he said     and then we thall thee thparkth .          tick     my name     said lu tze  leaning on his broom as the irate ting raised a hand     is lu tze .      the dojo went silent .  the attacker paused in midbellow .         ai .  hao   gng .  gnh .  ohsheeeeeeohsheeeeeee        the man did not move but seemed instead to turn in on himself  sagging from the martial stance into a kind of horrified  penitent crouch .   lu tze bent over and struck a match on his unprotesting chin .      what   s your name  lad .     he said  lighting his ragged cigarette .      his name is mud  lu tze     said the dojo master  striding forward .  he gave the unmoving challenger a kick .     well  mud  you know the rules .  face the man you have challenged  or give up the belt .      the figure remained very still for a moment  and then cautiously  in a manner almost theatrically designed not to give offense  started to fumble with his belt .      no  no  we don   t need that     said lu tze kindly .     it was a good challenge .  a decent    ai .     and a very passable    hai eee .      i thought .  good martial gibberish all around  such as you don   t often hear these days .  and we would not want his trousers falling down at a time like this  would we .     he sniffed and added     especially at a time like this .      he patted the shrinking man on the shoulder .     just you recall the rule your teacher here taught you on day one  eh .  and   why don   t you go and clean yourself up .  i mean  some of us have to tidy up in here .      then he turned and nodded to the dojo master .      while i am here  master  i should like to show young lobsang the device of erratic balls .      the dojo master bowed deeply .     it is yours  lu tze the sweeper .      as lobsang followed the ambling lu tze  he heard the dojo master  who like all teachers never missed an opportunity to drive home a lesson  say     dojo .  what is rule one .      even the cowering challenger mumbled along with the chorus      do not act incautiously when confronting a little bald wrinkly smiling man .         good rule  rule one     said lu tze  leading his new acolyte into the next room .     i have met many people who could have heeded it to good advantage .      he stopped without looking at lobsang ludd  and held out his hand .      and now  if you please  you will return the little shovel you stole from me when first we met .         but i came nowhere near you  master .      lu tze   s smile did not flicker .     oh .  yes .  that is true .  my apologies .  the ramblings of an old man .  is it not written    i   d forget my own head if it wasn   t nailed on .     let us proceed .      the floor in here was wood  but the walls were high and padded .  there were reddish brown stains here and there .      er   we have one of these in the novices    dojo  sweeper     said lobsang .      but the balls in that are made of soft leather  yes .     said the old man  approaching a tall wooden cube .  a row of holes was halfway up the side that faced down the length of the room .     and they travel quite slowly  i recall .         er   yes     said lobsang  watching him pull on a very large lever .  down below there was the sound of metal on metal  and then the urgent gushing water .  air began to wheeze from joints in the box .      these are wooden     said lu tze calmly .     catch one .      something touched lobsang   s ear and behind him the padding shook as a ball buried itself deeply and then dropped to the floor .      perhaps a shade slower       said lu tze  turning a knob .   after fifteen random balls  lobsang caught one in his stomach .  lu tze sighed and pushed the big lever back .      well done     he said .      sweeper  i   m not used to       said the boy  picking himself up .      oh  i knew you wouldn   t catch one     said lu tze .     even our boisterous friend out there in the dojo wouldn   t catch one at that speed .         but you said you had slowed it down .         only so that it wouldn   t kill you .  just a test  see .  everything   s a test .  let   s go  lad .  can   t keep the abbot waiting .      trailing cigarette smoke  lu tze ambled away .   lobsang followed  getting more and more nervous .  this was lu tze  the dojo had proved that .  and he knew it  anyway .  he   d looked at the little round face as it gazed amicably at the angry fighter and known it .  but   just a sweeper .  no insignia .  no status .  well  obviously status  because the dojo master couldn   t have bowed lower for the abbot .  but     and now he was following the man along passages where even a monk was not allowed to go  on pain of death .  sooner or later  there was surely going to be trouble .      sweeper  i really ought to be back at my duties in the kitchens       he began .      oh  yes .  kitchen duties     said lu tze .     to teach you the virtues of obedience and hard work  right .         yes  sweeper .         are they working .         oh   yes .         really .         well   no .         they   re not all they   re cracked up to be  i have to tell you     said lu tze .     whereas  my lad  what we have here     he stepped through an archway     is an education .      it was the biggest room lobsang had ever seen .  shafts of light speared down from glazed holes in the roof .  and below  more than a hundred yards across and tended by senior monks who walked above it on delicate wire walkways     lobsang had heard about the mandala .   it was as if someone had taken tons of colored sands and thrown them across the floor in a great swirl of colored chaos .  but there was order fighting for survival in the chaos  rising and falling and spreading .  millions of randomly tumbling sand grains would nevertheless make a piece of pattern  which would replicate and spread across the circle  rebounding or merging with other patterns and eventually dissolving into the general disorder .  it happened again and again  turning the mandala into a silent raging war of color .   lu tze stepped out onto a frail looking wood and rope bridge .      well .     he said .     what d   you think .      lobsang took a deep breath .  he felt that if he fell off the bridge he   d drop into the surging colors and never  ever hit the floor .  he blinked and rubbed his forehead .      it   s   evil     he said .      really .     said lu tze .     not many people say that the first time .  they use words like    wonderful .            it   s going wrong .         what .      lobsang clutched the rope railing .      the patterns       he began .      history repeating     said lu tze .     they   re always there .         no  they   re       lobsang tried to take it all in .  there were patterns under the pattern  disguised as part of the chaos .     i mean   the other patterns        he slumped forward .      the air was cold  the world was spinning  and the ground rushed up to enfold him .   and stopped a few inches away .   the air around him sizzled  as though it was being gently fried .      newgate ludd .         lu tze .     he said .     the mandala is        but where were the colors  why was the air wet and smelling of the city .    and then the ghost memories faded away .  as they disappeared  they said  how can we be memories  when we have yet to happen .  surely what you remember is climbing all the way up onto the roof of the bakers    guild and finding that someone had loosened all the capping stones  because that just happened .   and a last dying memory said  hey  that happened months ago        no  we   re not lu tze  mysterious falling kid     said the voice that had addressed him .     can you turn around .      newgate managed  with great difficulty  to move his head .  it felt as though he was stuck in tar .   a heavy young man in a grubby yellow robe was sitting on an upturned box a few feet away .  he looked a bit like a monk  except for his hair  because his hair looked a bit like an entirely separate organism .  to say that it was black and bound up in a ponytail is to miss the opportunity of using the term    elephantine .     it was hair with personality .      mostly my name   s soto    said the man underneath .     marco soto .  i won   t bother memorizing yours until we know if you   re going to live or not  eh .  so tell me   have you ever considered the rewards of the spiritual life .         right now .  certainly .     said   yes  newgate  he thought  that   s my name  yes .  so why do i remember lobsang .     er   i was thinking about the possibility of taking up a new line of work .         good career move     said soto .      is this some kind of magic .     newgate tried to move but hung  turning gently  in the air just above the waiting ground .      not exactly .  you seem to have shaped time .         me .  how did i do that .         you don   t know .         no .         hah  will you listen to him .     said soto  as if talking to a genial companion .     there   s probably the spin time of a whole procrastinator being used up to prevent your little trick causing untold harm to the entire world  and you don   t know how you did it .         no .         then we will train you .  it is a good life  and offers excellent prospects .  at least     soto added  sniffing     better than those that confront you now .      newgate strained to turn his head further .      train me in what  exactly .      the man sighed .     still asking questions  kid .  are you coming or not .         how           look  i   m offering you the opportunity of a lifetime  do you understand .         why is it the opportunity of a lifetime  mr .  soto .         no  you misunderstand me .  you  that is newgate ludd  are being offered  that is by me  the opportunity of having a lifetime .  which is more than you will have shortly .      newgate hesitated .  he was aware of a tingling in his body .  in a sense  it was still falling .  he didn   t know how he knew this  but the knowledge was as real as the cobbles just below him .  if he made the wrong choice  the fall would simply continue .  it had been easy so far .  the last few inches would be terminally hard .      i must admit  i don   t like the way my life is going at the moment     he said .     it may be advantageous to find a new direction .         good .     the behaired man pulled something out of his robe .  it looked like a folded abacus  but when he opened it up  parts of it vanished with little flashes of light  as if they   d moved somewhere where they could not be seen .      what are you doing .         do you know what kinetic energy is .         no .         it   s what you have far too much of .     soto   s fingers danced on the beads  sometimes disappearing and reappearing .     i imagine you weigh about a hundred and ten pounds   yes .      he pocketed the little device and strolled off to a nearby cart .  he did something that newgate couldn   t see  and came back .      in a few seconds you will complete your fall     he said  reaching under him to place something on the ground .     try to think of it as a new start in life .      newgate fell .  he hit the ground .  the air flashed purple  and the laden cart across the street jerked a foot into the air and collapsed heavily .  one wheel bounced away .   soto leaned down and shook newgate   s unresisting hand .      how do you do     he said .     any bruises .         it does hurt a bit       said the shaken newgate .      maybe you   re a bit heavier than you look .  allow me        soto grabbed newgate under the shoulders and began to tug him off into the mists .      can i go and           no .         but the guild           you don   t exist at the guild .         that   s stupid  i   m in the guild records           no  you   re not .  we   ll see to that .         how .  you can   t rewrite history .         bet you a dollar .         what have i joined .         we   re the most secret society that you can imagine .         really .  who are you  then .         the monks of history .         huh .  i   ve never heard of you .         see .  that   s how good we are .      and that was how good they were .   and then the time has just flown past .   and now the present came back .         are you all right  lad .      lobsang opened his eyes .  his arm felt as though it was being wrenched out of his body .   he looked up along the length of the arm of lu tze  who was lying flat on the swaying bridge  holding him .      what happened .         i think maybe you were overcome with the excitement  lad .  or vertigo  maybe .  just don   t look down .      there was a roaring below lobsang  like a swarm of very angry bees .  automatically  he began to turn his head .      i said  don   t look down .  just relax .      lu tze got to his feet .  he raised lobsang at arm   s length  as though he was a feather  until the boy   s sandals were over the wood of the bridge .  below  monks were running along the walkways and shouting .      now  keep your eyes shut   don   t look down .    and i   ll just walk us both to the far side  all right .         i   er   i remembered   back in the city  when soto found me   i remembered       said lobsang weakly  tottering along behind the monk .      only to be expected     said lu tze     in the circumstances .         but   but i remember that back then i remembered about being here .  you and the mandala .         is it not written in the sacred text     there   s a lot goes on we don   t know about  in my opinion    .     said lu tze .      i   have not yet come across that one  either  sweeper     said lobsang .  he felt cooler air around him  which suggested they had reached the rock tunnel on the far side of the room .      sadly  in the writings they have here you probably won   t     said lu tze .     ah   you can open your eyes now .      they walked on  with lobsang rubbing his head to take away the strangeness of his thoughts .   behind them  the livid swirls in the wheel of color  that had centered on the spot where lobsang would have fallen  gradually faded and healed .      according to the first scroll of wen the eternally surprised  wen and clodpool reached the green valley between the towering mountains and wen said     this is the place .  here there will be a temple dedicated to the folding and unfolding of time .  i can see it .         i can   t  master     said clodpool .   wen said     it   s over there .     he pointed  and his arm vanished .      ah     said clodpool .     over there .      a few cherry blossom petals drifted down onto wen   s head from one of the trees that grew wild along the streamlets .      and this perfect day will last forever     he said .     the air is crisp  the sun is bright  there is ice in the streams   every day in this valley will be this perfect day .         could get a bit repetitive  master     said clodpool .      that is because you don   t yet know how to deal with time     said wen .     but i will teach you to deal with time as you would deal with a coat  to be worn when necessary and discarded when not .         will i have to wash it .     said clodpool .   wen gave him a long  slow look .      that was either a very complex piece of thinking on your part  clodpool  or you were just trying to overextend a metaphor in a rather stupid way .  which  do you think  it was .      clodpool looked at his feet .  then he looked at the sky .  then he looked at wen .      i think i am stupid  master .         good     said wen .     it is fortuitous that you are my apprentice at this time  because if i can teach you  clodpool  i can teach anyone .      clodpool looked relieved  and bowed .     you do me too much honor  master .         and there is a second part to my plan     said wen .      ah     said clodpool  with an expression that he thought made him look wise  although in reality it made him look like someone remembering a painful bowel movement .     a plan with a second part is always a good plan  master .         find me sands of all colors and a flat rock .  i will show you a way to make the currents of time visible .         oh  right .         and there is a third part to my plan .         a third part  eh .         i can teach a gifted few to control their time  to slow it and speed it up  and store it and direct it like the water in these streams .  but most people will not  i fear  let themselves become able to do this .  we have to help them .  we will have to build   devices that will store and release time to where it is needed  because men cannot progress if they are carried like leaves on a stream .  people need to be able to waste time  make time  lose time  and buy time .  this will be our major task .      clodpool   s face twisted with the effort of understanding .  then he slowly raised a hand .   wen sighed .      you   re going to ask what happened to the coat  aren   t you     he said .   clodpool nodded .      forget about the coat  clodpool .  the coat is not important .  just remember that you are the blank paper on which i will write       wen held up a hand as clodpool opened his mouth .     just another metaphor  just another metaphor .  and now  please make some lunch .         metaphorically or really  master .         both .      a flight of white birds burst out of the trees and wheeled overhead before swooping off across the valley .      there will be doves     said wen  as clodpool hurried off to light a fire .     every day  there will be doves .         lu tze left the novice in the anteroom .  it may have surprised those who disliked him that he took a moment to straighten his robe before he entered the presence of the abbot  but lu tze at least cared for people even if he did not care for rules .  he pinched out his cigarette and stuck it behind his ear  too .  he had known the abbot for almost six hundred years  and respected him .  there weren   t many people lu tze respected .  mostly  they just got tolerated .   usually  the sweeper got on with people in inverse proportion to their local importance  and the reverse was true .  the senior monks   well  there could be no such thing as bad thoughts among people so enlightened  but it is true that the sight of lu tze ambling insolently through the temple did tarnish a few karmas .  to a certain type of thinker the sweeper was a personal insult  with his lack of any formal education or official status  and his silly little way  and his incredible successes .  so it was surprising that the abbot liked him  because never had there been an inhabitant of the valley so unlike the sweeper  so learned  so impractical  and so frail .  but then  surprise is the nature of the universe .   lu tze nodded to the minor acolytes who opened the big varnished doors .      how is his reverence today .     he said .      the teeth are still giving him trouble  lu tze  but he is maintaining continuity and has just taken his first steps in a very satisfactory manner .         yes  i thought i heard the gongs .      the group of monks clustered in the center of the room stepped aside as lu tze approached the playpen .  it was  unfortunately  necessary .  the abbot had never mastered the arts of circular aging .  he had  therefore  been forced to achieve longevity in a more traditional way  via serial reincarnation .      ah  sweeper     he burbled  awkwardly tossing aside a yellow ball and brightening up .     and how are the mountains .  wanna bikkit wanna bikkit .         i   m definitely getting vulcanism  reverend one .  it   s very encouraging .         and you are in persistent good health .     said the abbot  while his pudgy little hand banged a wooden giraffe against the bars .      yes  your reverence .  it   s good to see you up and about again .         only for a few steps so far  alas bikkit bikkit wanna bikkit .  unfortunately  young bodies have a mind of their own bikkit .         you sent me a message  your reverence .  it said    put this one to the test .            and what did you think of our want bikkit want bikkit want bikkit now young lobsang ludd .     an acolyte hurried forward with a plate of rusks .     would you care for a rusk  by the way .     the abbot added .     mmmn nicey bikkit .         no  reverend one  i have already eaten     said the sweeper .      ludd is a puzzle  is he not .  his tutors have nicey bikkit mmm mmm bikkit told me he is very talented but somehow not all there .  but you had never met him and don   t know his history and so mmm bikkit i would value your uninfluenced observations mmm bikkit .         he is beyond fast     said lu tze .     i think he may begin to react to things before they happen .         how can anyone tell that .  want teddy want teddy wanna wanna teddy .         i put him in front of the machine of erratic balls in the senior dojo and he was moving toward the right hole fractionally before the ball came out .         some kind of gurgle telepathy  then .         if a simple machine has a mind of its own  i think we   re in really big trouble     said lu tze .  he took a deep breath .     and in the hall of the mandala he saw the patterns in the chaos .         you let a neophyte see the mandala .     said chief acolyte rinpo  horrified .      if you want to see if someone can swim  push him in the river     said lu tze  shrugging .     what other way is there .         but to look at it without the proper training           he saw the patterns     said lu tze .     and reacted to the mandala .     he did not add  and the mandala reacted to him .  he wanted to think about that .  when you look into the abyss  it   s not supposed to wave back .      it was teddyteddyteddywahwah strictly forbidden  even so     said the abbot .  clumsily  he fumbled among the toys on his mat and picked up a large wooden brick with a jolly blue elephant printed on it and hurled it awkwardly at rinpo .     sometimes you presume too much  sweeper lookit    lefant .      there was some applause from the acolytes at the prowess in animal recognition .      he saw the patterns .  he knows what is happening .  he just doesn   t know what he knows     said lu tze doggedly .     and within a few seconds of meeting me he stole a small object of value  and i   m still wondering how he did it .  can he really be as fast as that without training .  who is this boy .          tick  who is this girl .   madam frout  headmistress of the frout academy and pioneer of the frout method of learning through fun  often found herself thinking that when she had to interview miss susan .  of course  the girl was an employee  but   well  madam frout wasn   t very good at discipline  which was possibly why she   d invented the method  which didn   t require any .  she generally relied on talking to people in a jolly tone of voice until they gave in out of sheer embarrassment on her behalf .   miss susan didn   t appear ever to be embarrassed about anything .      the reason i   ve called you here  susan  that is  er  the reason is       madam frout faltered .      there have been complaints .     said miss susan .      er  no   er   although miss smith has told me that the children coming up from your class are  er  restless .  their reading ability is  she says  rather unfortunately advanced           miss smith thinks a good book is about a boy and his dog chasing a big red ball     said miss susan .     my children have learned to expect a plot .  no wonder they get impatient .  we   re reading grim fairy tales at the moment .         that is rather rude of you  susan .         no  madam .  that is rather polite of me .  it would have been rude of me to say that there is a circle of hell reserved for teachers like miss smith .         but that   s a dreadf       madam frout stopped and began again .     you should not be teaching them to read at all yet .     she snapped .  but it was the snap of a soggy twig .  madam frout cringed back in her chair when miss susan looked up .  the girl had this terrible ability to give you her full attention .  you had to be a better person than madam frout to survive the intensity of that attention .  it inspected your soul  putting little red circles around the bits it didn   t like .  when miss susan looked at you  it was as if she was giving you marks .      i mean     the headmistress mumbled     childhood is a time for play and           learning     said miss susan .      learning through play     said madam frout  grateful to find familiar territory .     after all  kittens and puppies              grow up to be cats and dogs  which are even less interesting     said miss susan     whereas children should grow up to be adults .      madam frout sighed .  there was no way she was going to make any progress .  it was always like this .  she knew she was powerless .  news about miss susan had got around .  worried parents who   d turned to learning through play because they despaired of their offspring ever learning by paying attention to what anyone said were finding them coming home a little quieter  a little more thoughtful  and with a pile of homework which  amazingly  they did without prompting and even with the dog helping them .  and they came home with stories about miss susan .   miss susan spoke all languages .  miss susan knew everything about everything .  miss susan had wonderful ideas for school trips        and that was particularly puzzling  because as far as madam frout knew  none had been officially organized .  there was invariably a busy silence from miss susan   s classroom when she went past .  this annoyed her .  it harked back to the bad old days when children were regimented in classrooms that were no better than torture chambers for little minds .  but other teachers said that there were noises .  sometimes there was the faint sound of waves  or a jungle .  just once  madam frout could have sworn  if she was the sort to swear  that as she passed  there was a full scale battle going on .  this had often been the case with learning through play  but this time the addition of the trumpets  the swish of arrows  and the screams of the fallen seemed to be going too far .   she   d thrown open the door  and felt something hiss through the air above her head .  miss susan had been sitting on a stool  reading from a book  with the class cross legged in a quiet and fascinated semicircle around her .  it was the sort of old fashioned image madam frout hated  as if the children were supplicants around some sort of altar of knowledge .   no one had said anything .  all the watching children and miss susan made it clear in polite silence that they were waiting for her to go away .   she   d flounced back into the corridor and the door clicked shut behind her .  then she noticed the long  crude arrow that was still vibrating in the opposite wall of the corridor .   madam frout had looked back at the door  with its familiar green paint  and then back at the arrow .   which was gone .   she transferred jason to miss susan   s class .  it had been a cruel thing to do  but madam frout considered that there was now some kind of undeclared war going on .   if children were weapons  jason would have been banned by international treaty .  jason had doting parents and an attention span of minus several seconds  except when it came to inventive cruelty to small furry animals  when he could be quite patient .  jason kicked  punched  bit  and spat .  his artwork had even frightened the life out of miss smith  who could generally find something nice to say about any child .  he was definitely a boy with special needs .  in the view of the staff  they began with an exorcism .   madam frout had stooped to listening at the keyhole .  she had heard jason   s first tantrum of the day  and then silence .  she couldn   t quite make out what miss susan said next .   when she found an excuse to venture into the classroom half an hour later  jason was helping two little girls make a cardboard rabbit .   later his parents said they were amazed at the change  although apparently now he would only go to sleep with the light on .   madam frout tried to question her newest teacher .  glowing references were all very well  but she was an employee  after all .  the trouble was  susan had a way of saying things to her  madam frout had found  so that she went away feeling quite satisfied and only realized that she hadn   t really had a proper answer at all when she was back in her office  by which time it was always too late .   and it continued to be too late because suddenly the school had a waiting list .  parents were fighting to get their children enrolled in miss susan   s class .  as for some of the stories they brought home   well  everyone knew children had such vivid imaginations  didn   t they .   even so  there was this essay by richenda higgs .  madam frout fumbled for her glasses  which she was too vain to wear all the time and kept on a string around her neck  and looked at it again .  in its entirety  it read         a man with all bones came to talk to us he was not scarey at all  he had a big white hors .  we pated the hors .  he had a sighyve .  he told us interesting things and to be careful when crosing the road .        madam frout handed the paper across the desk to miss susan  who looked at it gravely .  she pulled out a red pencil  made a few little alterations  then handed it back .      well .     said madam frout .      yes  she   s not very good at punctuation  i   m afraid .  a good attempt at    scythe     though .         who   what   s this about a big white horse in the classroom .     madam frout managed .   miss susan looked at her pityingly and said     madam  who could possibly bring a horse into a classroom .  we   re up two flights of stairs here .      madam frout was not going to be deterred this time .  she held up another short essay .          today we were talked at by mr .  slumph who he is a bogeyman but he is nice now .  he tole us what to do abot the other kind .  you can put the blanket ove your head but it is bettr if you put it ove the bogeymans head then he think he do not exist and he is vanishs .  he tole us lots of stores abot people he jump out on and he said sins miss is our teachr he think no bogeymen will be in our houses bcos one thing a bogey dos not like is miss finding him .           bogeymen  susan .     said miss frout .      what imaginations children have     said miss susan with a straight face .      are you introducing young children to the occult .     said madam frout suspiciously .  this sort of thing caused a lot of trouble with parents  she was well aware .      oh yes .         what .  why .         so that it doesn   t come as a shock     said miss susan calmly .      but mrs .  robertson told me that her emma was going around the house looking for monsters in the cupboards .  and up until now she   s always been afraid of them .         did she have a stick .     said susan .      she   d got her father   s sword .         good for her .         look  susan   i think i see what you   re trying to do     said madam frout  who didn   t really     but parents do not understand this sort of thing .         yes     said miss susan .     sometimes i really think people ought to have to pass a proper exam before they   re allowed to be parents .  not just the practical  i mean .         nevertheless  we must respect their views     said madam frout  but rather weakly because occasionally she   d thought the same thing .   there had been the matter of parents    evening .  madam had been too tense to pay much attention to what her newest teacher was doing .  all she   d been aware of was miss susan sitting and talking quietly to the couples  right up to the point where jason   s mother picked up her chair and chased jason   s father out of the room .  next day a huge bunch of flowers had arrived for susan from jason   s mother  and an even bigger bunch from jason   s father .   quite a few other couples had also come away from miss susan   s desk looking worried or harassed .  certainly madam frout  when the time came to pay next term   s fees  had never known people cough up so readily .   and there it was again .  madam frout the headmistress  who had to worry about reputations and costs and fees  just occasionally heard the distant voice of miss frout who had been quite a good if rather shy teacher  and it was whistling and cheering susan on .   susan looked concerned .      you are not satisfied with my work  madam .      madam frout was stuck .  no  she wasn   t satisfied  but for all the wrong reasons .  and it was dawning on her as this interview progressed that she didn   t dare sack miss susan or  worse  let her leave of her own accord .  if she set up a school and news got around  the learning through play school would simply hemorrhage pupils and  importantly  fees .      well  of course   no  not   inmanyways       shebegan  and became aware that miss susan was staring past her .   there was   madam frout groped for her glasses  and found their string had got tangled with the buttons of her blouse .  she peered at the mantelpiece and tried to make sense of the blur .      why  it looks like a   a white rat  in a little black robe     she said .     and walking on its hind legs  too .  can you see it .         i can   t imagine how a rat could wear a robe     said miss susan .  then she sighed and snapped her fingers .  the finger snapping wasn   t essential  but time stopped .   at least  stopped for everyone but miss susan .   and the rat on the mantelpiece .   which was  in fact  the skeleton of a rat  although this was not preventing it from trying to steal madam frout   s jar of boiled sweets for good children .   susan strode over and grasped the collar of the tiny robe .   squeak .  said the death of rats .      i thought it was you .     snapped susan .     how dare you come here again .  i thought you   d got the message the other day .  and don   t think i didn   t see you when you turned up to collect henry the hamster last month .  do you know how hard it is to teach geography when you can see someone kicking the poo out of a treadmill .      the rat sniggered  snh .  snh .  snh .      and you   re eating a sweet .  put it in the bin right now .      susan dropped the rat onto the desk in front of the temporally frozen madam frout  and paused .   she   d always tried to be good about this sort of thing  but sometimes you just had to acknowledge who you were .  so she pulled open the bottom drawer to check the level in the bottle which was madam   s shield and comforter in the wonderful world that was education  and was pleased to see that the old girl was going a bit easier on the stuff these days .  most people have some means of filling up the gap between perception and reality  and  after all  in those circumstances there are far worse things than gin .   she also spent a little while going through madam   s private papers  and this has to be said about susan  it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong about this  although she   d quite understand that it was probably wrong if you weren   t susan sto helit  of course .  the papers were in quite a good safe that would have occupied a competent thief for at least twenty minutes .  the fact that the door swung open at her touch suggested that special rules applied here .   no door was closed to miss susan .  it ran in the family .  some genetics are passed on via the soul .   when she   d brought herself up to date on the school   s affairs  mostly to indicate to the rat that she wasn   t just someone who could be summoned at a moment   s notice  she stood up .      all right     she said .     you   re just going to pester me  aren   t you     she said wearily .     forever and ever and ever .      the death of rats looked at her with its skull on one side .   squeak  it said winsomely .      well  yes  i like him     she said .     in a way .  but  i mean  you know  it   s not right .  why does he need me .  he   s death .  he   s not exactly powerless .  i   m just human .      the rat squeaked again  jumped down onto the floor  and ran through the closed door .  it reappeared for a moment  and beckoned to her        oh  all right     said susan to herself .     make that mostly human .          tick  and who is this lu tze .   sooner or later every novice had to ask this rather complex question .  sometimes it would be years before they found out that the little man who swept their floors  and uncomplainingly carted away the contents of the dormitory cesspit  and occasionally came out with outlandish foreign sayings was the legendary hero they   d been told they would meet one day .  and then  when they   d confronted him  the brightest of them confronted themselves .   mostly sweepers came from the villages in the valley .  they were part of the staff of the monastery but they had no status .  they did all the tedious  unregarded jobs .  they were   figures in the background  pruning the cherry trees  washing the floors  cleaning out the carp pools  and always sweeping .  they had no names .  that is  a thoughtful novice would understand that the sweepers must have names  some form by which they were known to other sweepers  but within the temple grounds at least they had no names  only instructions .  no one knew where they went at night .  they were just sweepers .  but so was lu tze .   one day a group of senior novices  for mischief  kicked over the little shrine that lu tze kept beside his sleeping mat .   next morning  no sweepers turned up for work .  they stayed in their huts  with the doors barred .  after making inquiries  the abbot  who at that time was fifty years old again  summoned the three novices to his room .  there were three brooms leaning against the wall .  he spoke as follows      you know that the dreadful battle of five cities did not happen because the messenger got there in time .      they did .  you learned this early in your studies .  and they bowed nervously  because this was the abbot  after all .      and you know then that when the messenger   s horse threw a shoe he espied a man trudging beside the road carrying a small portable forge and pushing an anvil on a barrow .      they knew .      and you know that man was lu tze .      they did .      you surely know that janda trapp  grand master of okidoki  toro fu  and chang fu  has only ever yielded to one man .      they knew .      and you know that man is lu tze .      they did .      you know the little shrine you kicked over last night .      they knew .      you know it had an owner .      there was silence .  then the brightest of the novices looked up at the abbot in horror  swallowed  picked up one of the three brooms  and walked out of the room .   the other two were slower of brain and had to follow the story all the way through to the end .   then one of them said     but it was only a sweeper   s shrine .         you will take up the brooms and sweep     said the abbot     and you will sweep every day  and you will sweep until the day you find lu tze and dare to say    sweeper  it was i who knocked over and scattered your shrine and now i will in humility accompany you to the dojo of the tenth djim  in order to learn the right way .     only then  if you are still able  may you resume your studies here .  understood .       older monks sometimes complained  but someone would always say     remember that lu tze   s way is not our way .  remember he learned everything by sweeping unheeded while students were being educated .  remember  he has been everywhere and done many things .  perhaps he is a little   strange  but remember that he walked into a citadel full of armed men and traps and nevertheless saw to it that the pash of muntab choked innocently on a fish bone .  no monk is better than lu tze at finding the time and the place .      some  who did not know  would say     what is this way that gives him so much power .      and they were told     it is the way of mrs .  marietta cosmopilite    quirm street  ankh morpork  rooms to rent very reasonable .  no  we don   t understand it  either .  some subsendential rubbish  apparently .          tick  lu tze listened to the senior monks  while leaning on his broom .  listening was an art he had developed over the years  having learned that if you listened hard and long enough people would tell you more than they thought they knew .      soto is a good field operative     he said at last .     weird  but good .         the fall even showed up on the mandala     said rinpo .     the boy knew none of the appropriate actions .  soto said he   d done it reflexively .  he said he thought the boy was as close to null as he has ever witnessed .  he had him put on a cart for the mountains within the hour .  he then spent three whole days performing the closing of the flower at the guild of thieves  where the boy had apparently been left as a baby .         the closure was successful .         we authorized the run time of two procrastinators .  perhaps a few people will have faint memories  but the guild is a large and busy place .         no brothers  no sisters .  no love of parents .  just the brotherhood of thieves     said lu tze sadly .      he was  however  a good thief .         i   ll bet .  how old is he .         sixteen or seventeen  it appears .         too old to teach  then .      the senior monks exchanged glances .      we cannot teach him anything     said the master of novices .     he        lu tze held up a skinny hand .     let me guess .  he knows it already .         it   s as though he   s being told something that had momentarily slipped his memory     said rinpo .     and then he gets bored and angry .  he   s not all there  in my opinion .      lu tze scratched in his stained beard .      mystery boy     he said thoughtfully .     naturally talented .         and we ask ourselves wanna potty wanna potty poo why now  why at this time .     said the abbot  chewing the foot of a toy yak .      ah  but is it not said    there is a time and place for everything    .     said lu tze .     anyway  reverend sirs  you have taught pupils for hundreds of years .  i am but a sweeper .     absent mindedly  he stuck out his hand just as the yak left the fumbling fingers of the abbot  and caught it in midair .      lu tze     said the master of novices     to be brief  we were unable to teach you .  remember .         but then i found my way     said lu tze .      will you teach him .     said the abbot .     the boy needs to mmm brmmm find himself .         is it not written     i have only one pair of hands    .     said lu tze .   rinpo looked at the master of novices .     i don   t know     he said .     none of us ever see this stuff you quote .      still looking thoughtful  as if his mind were busy elsewhere  lu tze said     it could only be here and now .  for it is written     it never rains but it pours .         rinpo looked puzzled  and then enlightenment dawned .     a jug     he said  looking pleased .     a jug never rains  but it pours .      lu tze shook his head sadly .     and the sound of one hand clapping is a    cl        he said .      very well  your reverence .  i help him find a way .  will there be anything else  reverend sirs .          tick  lobsang stood up when lu tze returned to the anteroom  but he did it hesitantly  embarrassed at appearing to show respect .      okay  here are the rules     said lu tze  walking straight past .     word one is  you don   t call me    master    and i don   t name you after some damn insect .  it   s not my job to discipline you  it   s yours .  for it is written     i can   t be having with that kind of a thing .     do what i tell you and we   ll get along fine .  all right .         what .  you want me as an apprentice .     said lobsang  running to keep up .      no  i don   t want you as an apprentice  not at my age  but you   re going to be so we   d both better make the best of it  okay .         and you will teach me everything .         i don   t know about    everything .     i mean  i don   t know much forensic mineralogy .  but i will teach you all that i know which is useful for you to know  yes .         when .         it is getting late           at dawn tomorrow .         oh  before dawn .  i will wake you .          tick  some distance away from madam frout   s academy  in esoteric street  were a number of gentlemen   s clubs .  it would be far too cynical to say that here the term    gentleman    was simply defined as    someone who can afford five hundred dollars a year     they also had to be approved of by a great many other gentlemen who could afford the same fee .   and they didn   t much like the company of ladies .  this was not to say that they were that kind of gentlemen  who had their own  rather better decorated clubs in another part of town  where there was generally a lot more going on .  these gentlemen were gentlemen of a class who were  on the whole  bullied by ladies from an early age .  their lives were steered by nurses  governesses  matrons  mothers  and wives  and after four or five decades of that the average mild mannered gentleman gave up and escaped as politely as possible to one of these clubs  where he could snooze the afternoon away in a leather armchair with the top button of his trousers undone .    the most select of these clubs was fidgett   s  and it operated like this  susan didn   t need to make herself invisible  because she knew that the members of fidgett   s would simply not see her  or believe that she really existed even if they did .  women weren   t allowed in the club at all except under rule thirty four b  which grudgingly allowed for female members of the family or respectable married ladies over thirty to be entertained to tea in the green drawing room between      and      p . m .   provided at least one member of staff was present at all times .  this had been the case for so long that many members now interpreted it as being the only seventy five minutes in the day when women were actually allowed to exist and  therefore  any women seen in the club at any other time were a figment of their imagination .   in the case of susan  in her rather strict black school teaching outfit and button boots that somehow appeared to have higher heels when she was being death   s granddaughter  this might well have been true .   the boots echoed on the marble floor as she made her way to the library .   it was a mystery to her why death had started using the place .  of course  he did have many of the qualities of a gentleman  he had a place in the country   a far  dark country   was unfailingly punctual  was courteous to all those he met   and sooner or later he met everyone   was well if soberly dressed  at home in any company  and  proverbially  a good horseman .   the fact that he was the grim reaper was the only bit that didn   t quite fit .   most of the overstuffed chairs in the library were occupied by contented lunchers dozing happily under tented copies of the ankh morpork times .  susan looked around until she found the copy from which projected the bottom half of a black robe and two bony feet .  there was also a scythe leaning against the back of the armchair .  she raised the paper .   good afternoon  said death .  have you had lunch .  it was jam roly poly .      why do you do this  grandfather .  you know you don   t sleep .      i find it restful .  are you well .      i was until the rat arrived .      your career progresses .  you know i care for you .      thank you     said susan shortly .     now  why did        would a little small talk hurt .   susan sighed .  she knew what was behind that  and it wasn   t a happy thought .  it was a small  sad  and wobbly little thought  and it ran  each of them had no one else but the other .  there .  it was a thought that sobbed into its own handkerchief  but it was true .   oh  death had his manservant  albert  and of course there was the death of rats  if you could call that company     and as far as susan was concerned     well  she was partly immortal  and that was all there was to it .  she could see things that were really there   she could put time on and take it off like an overcoat .  rules that applied to everyone else  like gravity  applied to her only when she let them .  and  however hard you tried  this sort of thing did tend to get in the way of relationships .  it was hard to deal with people when a tiny part of you saw them as a temporary collection of atoms that would not be around in another few decades .   and there she met the tiny part of death which found it hard to deal with people when it thought of them as real .   not a day went past that she didn   t regret her curious ancestry .  and then she   d wonder what it could possibly be like to walk the world unaware at every step of the rocks beneath your feet and the stars overhead  to have a mere five senses  to be almost blind and nearly deaf     the children are well .  i liked their paintings of me .      yes .  how is albert .      he is well .      and not really have any small talk  susan added to herself .  there wasn   t room for small talk in a big universe .   the world is coming to an end .   well  that was big talk .     when .      next wednesday .      why .      the auditors are back  said death .      those evil little things .      yes .      i hate them .      i  of course  do not have any emotions  said death  poker faced as only a skull can be .      what are they up to this time .      i cannot say .      i thought you could remember the future .      yes .  but something has changed .  after wednesday  there is no future .      there must be something  even if it   s only debris .      no .  after one o   clock next wednesday there is nothing .  just one o   clock next wednesday  forever and ever .  no one will live .  no one will die .  that is what i now see .  the future has changed .  do you understand .      and what has this got to do with me .     susan knew this would sound stupid to anyone else .   i would have thought the end of the world is everyone   s responsibility  wouldn   t you .      you know what i mean .      i believe this has to do with the nature of time  which is both immortal and human .  there have been certain   ripples .      they   re going to do something to time .  i thought they weren   t allowed to do things like that .      no .  but humans can .  it has been done once before .      no one would be that stu        susan stopped .  of course someone would be that stupid .  some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it .  if you put a large switch in some cave somewhere  with a sign on it saying    end of the world switch .  please do not touch     the paint wouldn   t even have time to dry .   she thought some more .  death was watching her intently .   then she said     funnily enough  there is this book i   ve been reading to the class .  i found it on my desk one day .  it   s called grim fairy tales        ah  happy tales for little folk  said death without a trace of irony .         which is mostly about wicked people dying in horrible ways .  it   s strange  really .  the children seem quite happy with the idea .  it doesn   t seem to worry them .      death said nothing .      except in the case of the glass clock of bad sch  schein     said susan  watching his skull .     they found that quite upsetting  even though it   s got a kind of happy ending .      it may be because the story is true .   susan had known death long enough not to argue .      i think i understand     she said .     you made sure the book was there .      yes .  oh  the rubbish about the handsome prince and so on is an obvious addition .  the auditors did not invent the clock  of course .  that was the work of a madman .  but they are good at adapting .  they cannot create  but they can adapt .  and the clock is being rebuilt .      was time really stopped .      trapped .  only for a moment  but the results still lie all around us .  history was shattered  fragmented .  pasts were no longer linked to futures .  the history monks had to rebuild it practically from scratch .   susan did not waste breath saying things like    that   s impossible    at a time like this .  only people who believed that they lived in the real world said things like that .      that must have taken some   time     she said .   time  of course  was not the issue .  they use a form of years based on the human pulse rate .  of those years  it took about five hundred .      but if history was shattered  where did they get        death steepled his fingers .   think temporally  susan .  i believe they stole some time from some earlier age of the world  where it was being wasted on a lot of reptiles .  what is time to a big lizard  after all .  have you seen those procrastinators the monks use .  wonderful things .  they can move time  store it  stretch it   quite ingenious .  as for when this happened  the question also makes no sense .  when the bottle is broken  does it matter where the glass was hit .  the shards of the event itself no longer exist in this rebuilt history  in any case .      hold on  hold on   how can you take a piece of  oh  some old century  and stitch it into a modern one .  wouldn   t people notice that       susan flailed a bit     oh  that people have got the wrong armor and the buildings are all wrong  and they   re still in the middle of wars that happened centuries ago .      in my experience  susan  within their heads too many humans spend a lot of time in the middle of wars that happened centuries ago .      very insightful  but what i meant was        you must not confuse the content with the container .  death sighed .  you are mostly human .  you need a metaphor .  an object lesson is clearly in order .  come .   he stood up and stalked into the dining room across the hall .  there were still a few late lunchers frozen in their work  napkins tucked under their chin  in an atmosphere of happy carbohydrates .   death walked up to a table that had been set for dinner  and gripped a corner of the tablecloth .   time is the cloth  he said .  the cutlery and plates are the events that take place within time     there was a drum roll .  susan glanced down .  the death of rats was seated in front of a tiny drum kit .   observe .   death pulled the cloth away .  there was a rattle of cutlery and a moment of uncertainty regarding a vase of flowers  but almost all the tableware remained in place .      i see     said susan .   the table remains set  but the cloth can now be used for another meal .      however  you knocked the salt over     said susan .   the technique is not perfect .      and there are stains on the cloth from the previous meal  grandfather .      death beamed .  yes  he said .  as metaphors go it is rather good  don   t you think .      people would notice .      really .  humans are the most unobservant creatures in the universe .  oh  there are lots of anomalies  of course  a certain amount of spilled salt  but historians explain them away .  they are so very useful in that respect .   there was something called the rules  susan knew .  they weren   t written down  in the same way that mountains weren   t written down .  they were far more fundamental to the operation of the universe than mere mechanical things like gravity .  the auditors might hate the untidiness caused by the emergence of life  but the rules did not allow them to do anything about it .  the ascent of mankind must have been a boon to them .  at last there was a species that could be persuaded to shoot itself in the foot .      i don   t know what you expect me to do about it     she said .   everything that you can  said death .  i  by custom and practice  have other duties at this time .      such as .      important matters .      that you can   t tell me about .      that i do not intend to tell you about .  but they are important .  in any case  your insight is valuable .  you have ways of thinking that will be useful .  you can go where i cannot .  i have only seen the future .  but you can change it .      where is this clock being rebuilt .      i cannot tell .  i have done well to deduce what i have .  the issue is clouded from me .      why .      because things have been hidden .  someone is involved   who is not subject to me .  death looked awkward .      an immortal .      someone subject to   someone else .      you   re going to have to be a lot clearer than that .      susan   you know that i adopted and raised your mother  and found a suitable husband for her        yes  yes     snapped susan .     how could i forget .  i look in my mirror every day .      this is   difficult for me .  the truth is  i was not the only one to involve myself like that .  why look surprised .  is it not well known that gods do this sort of thing all the time .      gods  yes  but people like you        people like us are still like people     susan did an unusual thing and listened .  that   s not an easy task for a teacher .   susan  you will know that we who are   outside of humanity        i   m not outside humanity     said susan sharply .     i just have a few   extra talents .      i did not mean you  of course .  i meant the others who are not human and yet part of its universe   war  and destiny  and pestilence  and the rest of us   we are envisaged as human by humans and thus  in various fashions  we take on some aspects of humanity .  it can be no other way  even our very body shape forces upon our minds a certain way of observing the universe .  we pick up human traits   curiosity  anger  restlessness        this is basic stuff  grandfather .      yes .  and you know  therefore  that some of us   take an interest in humanity .      i know .  i am one of the results .      yes .  er   and some of us take an interest which is  er  more        interesting .       personal .  and you have heard me speak of the   personification of time        you didn   t tell me much .  she lives in a palace of glass  you once said .     susan felt a small  shameful  and yet curiously satisfying sensation in seeing death discomforted .  he looked like someone who was being forced to reveal a skeleton in the closet .   yes .  er   she fell in love with a human        how very romantick     said susan  inserting the k .  now she was being childishly perverse  she knew  but life as death   s granddaughter was not easy and just occasionally she had the irresistible urge to annoy .   ah .  a pun  or play on words  said death wearily  although i suspect you were merely trying to be tiresome .      well  that sort of thing used to happen a lot in antiquity  didn   t it .     said susan .     poets were always falling in love with moonlight  or hyacinths  or something  and goddesses were forever        but this was real  said death .      how real do you mean .      time had a son .      how could        time had a son .  someone mostly mortal .  someone like you .       tick  a member of the clockmakers    guild called on jeremy once a week .  it was nothing formal .  in any case there was often some work for him to do  or some results to be collected  because whatever else you might say about him  the boy had a genius for clocks .   informally  the visit was also a delicate way to make sure that the lad was taking his medicine and wasn   t noticeably crazy .   the clockmakers were well aware that the intricate mechanisms of the human brain could occasionally throw a screw .  the guild   s members tended to be meticulous people  always in pursuit of an inhuman accuracy  and this took its toll .  it could cause problems .  springs were not the only things that got wound up .  the guild committee were  by and large  kind and understanding men .  they were not  on the whole  men accustomed to guile .   dr .  hopkins  the guild   s secretary  was surprised when the door of the shop was opened by a man who appeared to have survived a very serious accident .      er   i   m here to see mr .  jeremy     he managed .      yeth  sir .  the marthter ith in  thur .         and you  mm  are    .         igor  thur .  mr .  jeremy wath kind enough to take me on  thur .         you work for him .     said dr .  hopkins  looking igor up and down .      yeth  thur .         mm   have you been standing too close to any dangerous machinery .         no  thur .  he is in the workshop  thur .         mr .  igor .     said dr .  hopkins  as he was ushered into the shop     you do know that mr .  jeremy has to take medicine  don   t you .         yeth  thur .  he mentionth it often .         and he  mm  his general health is    .         good  thur .  he ith enthuthiathtic for hith work  thur .  bright eyed and buthy tailed .         buthy tailed  eh .     said dr .  hopkins weakly .     mm   mr .  jeremy doesn   t usually keep servants .  i   m afraid he threw a clock at the head of the last assistant he had .         really  thur .         mm  he hasn   t thrown a clock at your head  has he .         no  thur .  he acth quite normally     said igor  a man with four thumbs and stitches all around his neck .  he opened the door into the workshop .     dr .  hopkinth  mr .  jeremy .  i will make thome tea  thur .      jeremy was sitting bolt upright at the table  his eyes gleaming .      ah  doctor     he said .     how kind of you to come .      dr .  hopkins took in the workshop .   there had been changes .  quite a large piece of lathe and plaster wall  covered in penciled sketches  had been removed from somewhere and stood on an easel on one side of the room .  the benches  usually the resting places of clocks in various stages of assembly  were covered with lumps of crystal and slabs of glass .  and there was a strong smell of acid .      mm   something new .     dr .  hopkins ventured .      yes  doctor .  i   ve been examining the properties of certain superdense crystals     said jeremy .   dr .  hopkins took a deep breath of relief .     ah  geology .  a wonderful hobby .  i   m so glad .  it   s not good to think about clocks all the time  you know .     he added  jovially  and with a soup  on of hope .   jeremy   s brow wrinkled  as if the brain behind it was trying to fit around an unfamiliar concept .      yes     he said at last .     did you know  doctor  that copper octirate vibrates exactly two million  four hundred thousand and seventy eight times a second .         as much as that  eh .     said dr .  hopkins .     my word .         indeed .  and light shone through a natural prism of octivium quartz splits into only three colors .         fascinating     said dr .  hopkins  reflecting that it could be worse .     mm   is it me  or is there a rather   sharp smell in the air .         drains     said jeremy .     we   ve been cleaning them .  with acid .  which is what we needed the acid for .  for cleaning the drains .         drains  eh .     dr .  hopkins blinked .  he wasn   t at home in the world of drains .  there was a crackling sound and blue light flickered under the door of the kitchen .      your  mm  man  igor     he said .     all right  is he .         yes  thank you  doctor .  he   s from uberwald  you know .         oh .  very   big  uberwald .  very big country .     that was one of only two things dr .  hopkins knew about uberwald .  he coughed nervously and mentioned the other one .     people there can be a bit strange  i   ve heard .         igor says he   s never had anything to do with that kind of person     said jeremy calmly .      good .  good .  that is good     said the doctor .  jeremy   s fixed smile was beginning to unnerve him .     he  mm  seems to have a lot of scars and stitches .         yes .  it   s cultural .         cultural  is it .     dr .  hopkins looked relieved .  he was a man who tried to see the best in everybody  but the city had got rather complicated since he was a boy  with dwarfs  and trolls  and golems  and even zombies .  he wasn   t sure he liked everything that was happening  but a lot of it was    cultural     apparently  and you couldn   t object to that  so he didn   t .     cultural    sort of solved problems by explaining that they weren   t really there .   the light under the door went out .  a moment later igor came in with two cups of tea on a tray .   it was good tea  the doctor had to admit  but the acid in the air was making his eyes water .      so  mm  how is the work on the new navigation tables going .     he said .      ginger bithcuit  thur .     said igor  by his ear .      oh  er  yes   oh  i say  these are rather good  mister igor .         take two  thur .         thank you .     now dr .  hopkins sprayed crumbs as he spoke .     the navigation tables       he repeated .      i am afraid i have not been able to make very much progress     said jeremy .     i have been engaged on the properties of crystals .         oh .  yes .  you said .  well  of course we are very grateful for any time that you feel you can spare     said dr .  hopkins .     and if i may say so  mm  it is good to see you with a new interest .  too much concentration on one thing is  mm  conducive to ill humors of the brain .         i have medicine     said jeremy .      yes  of course .  er   as a matter of fact  since i happened to be going past the apothecary today       dr .  hopkins pulled a large  paper wrapped bottle out of his pocket .      thank you .     jeremy indicated the shelf behind him .     as you can see  i have nearly run out .         yes  i thought you might     said dr .  hopkins  as if the level of the bottle on jeremy   s shelf wasn   t something the clockmakers kept a very careful eye on .     well  i shall be going  then .  well done with the crystals .  i used to collect butterflies when i was a boy .  wonderful things  hobbies .  give me a killing jar and a net and i was as happy as a little lark .      jeremy still smiled at him .  there was something glassy about the smile .   dr .  hopkins swallowed the remainder of his tea and put the cup back in the saucer .      and now i really must be on my way     he mumbled .     so much to do .  don   t wish to keep you from your work .  crystals  eh .  wonderful things .  so pretty .         are they .     said jeremy .  he hesitated  as though he was trying to solve a minor problem .     oh  yes .  patterns of light .         twinkly     said dr .  hopkins .   igor was waiting by the street door when dr .  hopkins reached it .  he nodded .      mm   you are sure about the medicine .     he said quietly .      oh yeth  thur .  every day i watch him pour out a thpoonful .         oh  good .  he can be a little  er   sometimes he doesn   t get on well with people .         yeth  thur .         very  um  very particular about accuracy           yeth  thur .            which is a good thing  of course .  wonderful thing  accuracy     said dr .  hopkins and sniffed .     up to a point  of course .  well  good day to you .         good day  thur .      when igor returned to the workshop jeremy was carefully pouring the blue medicine into a spoon .  when the spoon was exactly full  he tipped it into the sink .      they check  you know     he said .     they think i don   t notice .         i   m thure they mean well  thur .         i   m afraid i can   t think so well when i take the medicine     he said .     in fact i think i   m getting on a lot better without it  don   t you .  it slows me down .      igor took refuge in silence .  in his experience  many of the world   s greatest discoveries were made by men who would be considered mad by conventional standards .  insanity depended on your point of view  he always said  and if it was the view through your own underpants then everything looked fine .   but young master jeremy was beginning to worry him .  he never laughed  and igor liked a good maniacal laugh .  you could trust it .   since giving up the medicine jeremy had not  as igor had expected  begun to gibber and shout things like    mad .  they said i was mad .  but i shall show them all .  ahahahaha .     he   d simply become more   focused .   then there was that smile .  igor was not easily frightened  because otherwise he wouldn   t be able to look in a mirror  but he was becoming a little troubled .      now  where were we       said jeremy .     oh  yes   give me a hand here .      together they moved the table aside .  under it  dozens of glass jars hissed .      not enough power     said igor .     altho we have not got the mirrorth right yet  thur .      jeremy pulled the cloth off the device on the workbench .  glass and crystal glittered  and in some cases glittered very strangely .  as jeremy had remarked yesterday  in the clarity that was returning now that he was carefully pouring one spoonful of his medicine down the sink twice a day  some of the angles looked wrong .  one crystal had disappeared when he   d locked it into place  but it was clearly still there because he could see the light reflecting off it .      and we   ve thtill got too much metal in it  thur     igor grumbled .     it wath the thpring that did for the latht one .         we will find a way     said jeremy .      homemade lightning ith never ath good ath the real thort     said igor .      good enough to test the principle     said jeremy .      tetht the printhiple  tetht the printhiple     muttered igor .     thorry  thur  but igorth do not    tetht the printhiple .     thtrap it to the bench and put a good thick bolt of lightning  that   th our motto .  that   th how you tetht thomething .         you seem ill at ease  igor .         well  i   m thorry  thur     said igor .     it   th the climate dithagreeing with me .  i   m uthed to regular thunderthtormth .         i   ve heard that some people really seem to come alive in thunderstorms     said jeremy  carefully adjusting the angle of a crystal .      ah  that wath when i worked for baron finklethtein     said igor .   jeremy stood back .  this wasn   t the clock  of course .  there was still a lot more work to do  but he could see it in front of him  if he closed his eyes  before they had a clock .  this was just an essay  to see if he was on the right lines .   he was on the right lines .  he knew it .       tick  susan walked back through the motionless streets  sat down in madam frout   s office  and let herself sink back into the stream of time .   she had never found out how this worked .  it just did .  time didn   t stop for the rest of the world  and it didn   t stop for her   it was just that she entered a kind of loop of time  and everything else stayed exactly as it was until she   d finished what she needed to do .  it was another inherited family trait .  it worked best if you didn   t think about it  just like tightrope walking .  anyway  now she had other things to think about .   madam frout turned her gaze back from the rat free mantelpiece .      oh     she said .     it seems to have gone .         it was probably a trick of the light  madam     said susan .  mostly mortal .  someone like me  she thought .      yes  er  of course       madam frout managed to get her glasses on  despite the fact that the string was still tangled with the button .  it meant that she   d moored herself to her own chest  but she was damned if she was going to do anything about it now .   susan could unnerve a glacier .  all she had to do was sit quietly  looking polite and alert .      what precisely was it you wanted  madam .     she said .     it   s only that i   ve left the class doing algebra  and they get restless when they   ve finished .         algebra .     said madam frout  perforce staring at her own bosom  which no one else had ever done .     but that   s far too difficult for seven year olds .         yes  but i didn   t tell them that and so far they haven   t found out     said susan .  it was time to move things along .     i expect you wanted to see me about my letter  madam .     she said .   madam frout looked blank .     wh       she began .   susan sighed and snapped her fingers .   she walked around and opened a drawer by the motionless madam frout  removed a sheet of paper  and spent some time carefully writing a letter .  she let the ink dry  rustled the paper a bit to make it look slightly secondhand  and then put it just under the top of the pile of paperwork beside madam frout  with enough of it peeking out so that it would be easy to see .   she returned to her seat .  she snapped her fingers again .         at letter .     said madam frout .  and then she looked down at her desk .     oh .      it was a cruel thing to do  susan knew .  but while madam frout was not by any means a bad person and was quite kind to children  in a haphazard way  she was silly .  and susan did not have a lot of time for silly .      yes  i asked if i might have a few days    leave     said susan .     pressing family matters  i am afraid .  i have prepared some work for the children to get on with  of course .      madam frout hesitated .  susan didn   t have time for this  either .  she snapped her fingers .      my goodness  that    d be a relief     she said in a voice whose harmonics went all the way into the subconscious .     if we don   t slow her down we   ll run out of things to teach them .  she has been performing small miracles on a daily basis and deserves a raise .      then she sat back  snapped her fingers again  and watched the words settle into the forefront of madam frout   s mind .  the woman   s lips actually moved .      why  yes  of course     she murmured at last .     you have been working very hard   and   and       and there are some things even a voice of eldritch command can   t achieve and one of them is to get extra money out of a head teacher     we shall have to think about a little increment for you one of these days .      susan returned to the classroom and spent the rest of the day performing small miracles  which included removing the glue from richenda   s hair  emptying the wee out of billy   s shoes  and treating the class to a short visit to the continent of fourecks .   when their parents came to pick them up  they were all waving crayoned pictures of kangaroos  and susan had to hope that the red dust on their shoes   red mud in the case of billy   s  whose sense of timing had not improved   would pass unnoticed .  it probably would .  fidgett   s was not the only place where adults didn   t see what couldn   t possibly be true .   now she sat back .   there was something pleasant about an empty classroom .  of course  as any teacher would point out  one nice thing was that there were no children in it  and particularly no jason .   but the tables and shelves around the room showed evidence of a term well spent .  paintings lined the walls and showed good use of perspective and color .  the class had built a full size white horse out of cardboard boxes  during which time they   d learned a lot about horses and susan learned about jason   s remarkably accurate powers of observation .  she   d had to take the cardboard tube away from him and explain that this was a polite horse .   it had been a long day .  she raised the lid of her desk and took out grim fairy tales .  this dislodged some paperwork  which in turn revealed a small cardboard box decorated in black and gold .   it had been a little present from vincent   s parents .   she stared at the box .   every day she had to go through this .  it was ridiculous .  it wasn   t even as if higgs   meakins did good chocolates .  they were just butter and sugar and     she scrabbled among the sad little scraps of brown paper inside the box and pulled out a chocolate .  no one could be expected not to have just one chocolate  after all .   she put it in her mouth .   damndamndamndamn .  it was nougat inside .  her one chocolate today and it was damn artificial damn pink and white damn sickly damn stupid nougat .   well  no one could be expected to believe that counted .   she was entitled to another     the teacher part of her  which had eyes in the back of its head  caught the blur of movement .  she spun around .      no running with scythes .      the death of rats stopped jogging along the nature table and gave her a guilty look .   squeak .      and no going into the stationery cupboard  either     said susan automatically .  she slammed the desk lid shut .   squeak .      yes  you were .  i could hear you thinking about it .     it was possible to deal with the death of rats provided you thought of him as a very small jason .   the stationery cupboard .  that was one of the great battlegrounds of classroom history  that and the playhouse .  but the ownership of the playhouse usually sorted itself out without susan   s intervention  so that all she had to do was be ready with ointment  a nose blow  and mild sympathy for the losers  whereas the stationery cupboard was a war of attrition .  it contained pots of powder paint  and reams of paper  and boxes of crayons  and more idiosyncratic items like a spare pair of pants for billy  who did his best .  it also contained the scissors  which under classroom rules were treated as some kind of doomsday machine  and  of course  the boxes of stars .  the only people allowed in the cupboard were susan and  usually  vincent .  despite everything susan had tried  short of actual deception  he was always the official    best at everything    and won the coveted honor every day  which was to go into the stationery cupboard and fetch the pencils and hand them out .  for the rest of the class  and especially jason  the stationery cupboard was some mystic magic realm to be entered whenever possible .   honestly  thought susan  once you learned the arts of defending the stationery cupboard  outwitting jason  and keeping the class pet alive until the end of term  you   ve mastered at least half of teaching .   she signed the register  watered the sad plants on the windowsill  went and fetched some fresh privet from the hedge for the stick insects that were the successors to henry the hamster  chosen on the basis that it was quite hard to tell when they were dead   tidied a few errant crayons away  and looked around the classroom at all those little chairs .  it sometimes worried her that nearly everyone she knew well was three feet high .   she was never certain that she trusted her grandfather at times like this .  it was all to do with the rules .  he couldn   t interfere  but he knew her weaknesses and he could wind her up and send her out into the world     someone like me .  yes  he   d known how to engage her interest .   someone like me .  suddenly there   s some dangerous clock somewhere in the world  and suddenly i   m told that there   s someone like me .   someone like me .  except not like me .  at least i knew my parents .  and she   d listened to death   s account of the tall dark woman wandering from room to room in the endless castle of glass  weeping for the child she   d given birth to and could see every day but could never touch     where do i even begin .       tick  lobsang learned a lot .  he learned that every room had at least four corners .  he learned that the sweepers started work when the sky was light enough to see the dust  and continued until sunset .   as a master  lu tze was kind enough .  he would always point out those bits that lobsang had not done properly .   after the initial anger  and the taunting of his former classmates  lobsang found that the work had a certain charm .  days drifted past under his broom        until  almost with an audible click in his brain  he decided that enough was enough .  he finished his section of passageway  and found lu tze dreamily pushing his brush along a terrace .      sweeper .         yes  lad .         what is it you are trying to tell me .         i   m sorry .         i didn   t expect to become a   a sweeper .  you   re lu tze .  i expected to be apprentice to   well  to the hero .         you did .     lu tze scratched his beard .     oh  dear .  damn .  yes  i can see the problem .  you should   ve said .  why didn   t you say .  i don   t really do that sort of thing anymore .         you don   t .         all that playing with history  running about  unsettling people   no  not really .  i was never quite certain we should be doing it  to be honest .  no  sweeping is good enough for me .  there   s something   real about a nice clean floor .         this is a test  isn   t it     said lobsang coldly .      oh  yes .         i mean  i understand how it works .  the master makes the pupil do all the menial jobs  and then it turns out that really the pupil is learning things of great value   and i don   t think i   m learning anything  really  except that people are pretty messy and inconsiderate .         not a bad lesson  all the same     said lu tze .     is it not written     hard work never did anybody any harm    .         where is this written  lu tze .     said lobsang  thoroughly exasperated .   the sweeper brightened up .      ah     he said .     perhaps the pupil is ready to learn .  then you don   t wish to know the way of the sweeper  you wish to learn instead the way of mrs .  cosmopilite .         who .         we have swept well .  let   s go to the gardens .  for is it not written     it does you good to get out in the fresh air    .         is it .     said lobsang  still bewildered .   lu tze pulled a small tattered notebook out of his pocket .      in here  it is     he said .     i should know .          tick  lu tze patiently adjusted a tiny mirror to redirect sunlight more favorably on one of the bonsai mountains .  he hummed tunelessly under his breath .   lobsang  sitting cross legged on the stones  carefully turned the yellowing pages of the ancient notebook on which was written  in faded ink  the way of mrs .  cosmopilite .      well .     said lu tze .      the way has an answer for everything  does it .         yes .         then       lobsang nodded at the little volcano  which was gently smoking        how does that work .  it is on a saucer .      lu tze stared straight ahead  his lips moving .      page seventy six  i think     he said .   lobsang turned to the page .         because        he read .      good answer     said lu tze  gently caressing a minute crag with a camel hair brush .      just    because     master .  no reason .         reason .  what reason can a mountain have .  and  as you accumulate years  you will learn that most answers boil down  eventually  to    because .         lobsang said nothing .  the book of the way was giving him problems .  what he wanted to say was this  lu tze  this reads like a book of the sayings of an old lady .  it   s the sort of thing old ladies say .  what kind of koan is     it won   t get better if you pick at it     or    eat it up  it   ll make your hair curly     or    everything comes to he who waits    .  this is stuff you get in hogswatch crackers .      really .     said lu tze  still apparently engrossed in a mountain .      i didn   t say anything .         oh .  i thought you did .  do you miss ankh morpork .         yes .  i didn   t have to sweep floors there .         were you a good thief .         i was a fantastic thief .      a breeze blew a scent of cherry blossom .  just once  thought lu tze  it would be nice to pick cherries .      i have been to ankh morpork     he said  straightening up and moving on to the next mountain .     you have seen the visitors we get here .         yes     said lobsang .     everyone laughs at them .         really .     lu tze raised his eyebrows .     when they have trekked thousands of miles seeking the truth .         but did not wen say that if the truth is anywhere  it is everywhere .     said lobsang .      well done .  i see you   ve learned something  at least .  but one day it seemed to me that everyone else had decided that wisdom can only be found a long way off .  so i went to ankh morpork .  they were all coming here  so it seemed only fair .         seeking enlightenment .         no .  the wise man does not seek enlightenment  he waits for it .  so while i was waiting  it occurred to me that seeking perplexity might be more fun     said lu tze .     after all  enlightenment begins where perplexity ends .  and i found perplexity .  and a kind of enlightenment  too .  i had not been there five minutes  for example  when some men in an alley tried to enlighten me of what little i possessed  giving me a valuable lesson in the ridiculousness of material things .         but why ankh morpork .     said lobsang .      look in the back of the book     said lu tze .   there was a yellow  crackling scrap of paper tucked in there .  the boy unfolded it .      oh  this is just a bit of the almanack     he said .     it   s very popular there .         yes .  a seeker after wisdom left it here .         er   it   s just got the phases of the moon on this page           other side     said the sweeper .   lobsang turned the paper over .      it   s just an advert from the ankh morpork guild of merchants     said lobsang .        ankh morpork has everything .         he stared at the smiling lu tze .     and   you thought that           ah  i am old and simple and understand     said the sweeper .     whereas you are young and complicated .  didn   t wen see portents in the swirl of gruel in his bowl  and the flight of birds .  this was actually written .  i mean  flights of birds are quite complex  but these were words .  and i saw the opening of the way .  my way .         and you went all the way to ankh morpork       said lobsang weakly .      and i fetched up  calm of mind but empty of pocket  in quirm street     said the sweeper  smiling serenely at the recollection     and espied a sign in a window saying    rooms to rent .     thus i met mrs .  cosmopilite  who opened the door when i knocked and then when i hesitated  not being sure of the language  she said     i haven   t got all day  you know .     almost to a word  one of the sayings of wen .  instantly i knew that i had found what i was seeking .  during the days i washed dishes in an eating house for twenty pence a day and all the scraps i could take away  and in the evenings i helped mrs .  cosmopilite clean the house and listened carefully to her conversation .  she was a natural sweeper with a good rhythmical motion and had bottomless wisdom .  within the first two days she uttered to me the actual words said by wen upon understanding the true nature of time .  it was when i asked for a reduced rate because  of course  i did not sleep in a bed  and she said     i was not born yesterday  mr .  tze .     astonishing .  and she could never have seen the sacred texts .      lobsang   s face was a carefully drawn picture .         i was not born yesterday    .     he said .      ah  yes  of course  as a novice you would not have got that far     said lu tze .     it was when he fell asleep in a cave and in a dream saw time appear to him and show him that the universe is re created from second to second  endlessly .   and he stepped out from the cave into the truly new world and said     i was not born   yesterday .            oh  yes     said lobsang .     but           ah  mrs .  cosmopilite     said lu tze  his eyes misting over .     what a woman for keeping things clean .  if she was a sweeper here  no one would be allowed to walk on the floor .  her house .  so amazing .  a palace .  new sheets every other week .  and cook .  just to taste her beans baked upon the toast a man would give up a cycle of the universe .         um     said lobsang .      i stayed for three months  sweeping her house as is fitting for the pupil  and then i returned here  my way clear before me .         and   er   these stories about you           oh  all true .  most of them .  a bit of exaggeration  but mostly true .         the one about the citadel in muntab and the pash and the fish bone .         oh  yes .         but how did you get in where half a dozen trained and armed men couldn   t even           i   m a little man and i carry a broom     said lu tze simply .     everyone has some mess that needs clearing up .  what harm is a man with a broom .         what .  and that was it .         well  the rest was a matter of cookery  really .  the pash was not a good man  but he was a glutton for his fish pie .         no martial arts .     said lobsang .      oh  always a last resort .  history needs shepherds  not butchers .         do you know okidoki .         just a lot of bunny hops .         shiitake .         if i wanted to thrust my hand into hot sand i would go to the seaside .         upsidazi .         a waste of good bricks .         no kando .         you made that one up .         tung pi .         bad tempered flower arranging .         deja fu .     that got a reaction .  lu tze   s eyebrows raised .      deja fu .  you heard that rumor .  time as a weapon .     he said .     ha .  none of the monks here knows deja fu .  i   d soon hear about it if they did .  look  boy  violence is the resort of the violent .  in most tight corners a broomstick suffices .         only most  eh .     said lobsang  not trying to hide the sarcasm .      oh  i see .  you wish to face me in the dojo .  for it   s a very old truth  when the pupil can beat the master  there is nothing the master cannot tell him  because the apprenticeship is ended .  you want to learn .         ah .  i knew there was something to learn .      lu tze stood up .     why you .     he said .     why here .  why now .     there is a time and a place for everything .     why this time and this place .  if i take you to the dojo  you will return what you stole from me .  now .      he looked down at the teak table where he worked on his mountains .   the little shovel was there .   a few cherry blossom petals fluttered to the ground .      i see     he said .     you are that fast .  i did not see you .      lobsang said nothing .      it is a small and worthless thing     said lu tze .     why did you take it  please .         to see if i could .  i was bored .         ah .  we shall see if we can make life more interesting for you  then .  no wonder you are bored  when you can already slice time like that .      lu tze turned the little shovel over and over in his hand .      very fast     he said .  he leaned down and blew the petals away from a tiny glacier .     you slice time as fast as a tenth djim .  and as yet barely trained .  you must have been a great thief .  and now   oh dear   i shall have to face you in the dojo           no  there is no need .     said lobsang  because now lu tze looked frightened and humiliated and  somehow  small and brittle boned .      i insist     said the old man .     let us get it done now .  for it is written     there is no time like the present     which is mrs .  cosmopilite   s most profound understanding .     he sighed  and looked up at the giant statue of wen  which loomed over the terrace .      look at him     he said .     he was a lad  eh .  completely blissed out on the universe .  saw the past and future as one living person  and wrote the books of history to tell how the story should go .  we can   t imagine what those eyes saw .  and he never raised a hand to any man in his life .         look  i really didn   t want to           and you   ve looked at the other statues .     said lu tze  as if he   d completely forgotten about the dojo .   distractedly  lobsang followed his gaze .  up on the raised stone platform that ran the whole length of the gardens were hundreds of smaller statues  mostly carved of wood  all of them painted in garish colors .  figures with more eyes than legs  more tails than teeth  monstrous amalgamations of fish and squid and tiger and parsnip  things put together as if the creator of the universe had tipped out his box of spare parts and stuck them together  things painted pink and orange and purple and gold  looked down over the valley .      oh  the dlang       lobsang began .      demons .  that   s one word for them     said the sweeper .     the abbot called them the enemies of mind .  wen wrote a scroll about them  you know .  and he said that was the worst .      he pointed to a little hooded gray shape  which looked out of place among the festival of wild extremities .      doesn   t look very dangerous     said lobsang .     look  sweeper  i don   t want to           they can be very dangerous  things that don   t look dangerous     said lu tze .     not looking dangerous is what makes them dangerous .  for it is written     you can   t tell a book by its cover .            lu tze  i really don   t want to fight you           oh  your tutors will tell you that the discipline of a martial art enables you to slice time  and that   s true as far as it goes     said lu tze  apparently not listening .     but so can sweeping  as perhaps you have found .  always find the perfect moment  wen said .  people just seem so keen on using it to kick other people on the back of the neck .         but it wasn   t a challenge  i just wanted you to show me           and i shall .  come on .  i made a bargain .  i must keep it  old fool that i am .      the nearest dojo was the dojo of the tenth djim .  it was empty except for two monks blurring as they danced across the mat and wrapped time around themselves .   lu tze had been right  lobsang knew .  time was a resource .  you could learn to let it move fast or slow  so that a monk could walk easily through a crowd and yet be moving so fast that no one could see him .  or he could stand still for a few seconds  and watch the sun and moon chase one another across a flickering sky .  he could meditate for a day in a minute .  here  in the valley  a day lasted forever .   the blurred fighters became a couple of hesitant monks when they saw lu tze .  he bowed .      i beg the use of this dojo for a short period while my apprentice teaches me the folly of old age     he said .      i really didn   t mean       lobsang began  but lu tze elbowed him in the ribs .  the monks gave the old man a nervous look .      it   s yours  lu tze     said one of them .  they hurried out  almost tripping over their own feet as they kept looking back .      time and its control is what we should teach here     said lu tze  watching them go .     the martial arts are an aid .  that is all they are .  at least  that   s all they were meant to be .  even out in the world a well trained person may perceive  in the fray  how flexible time may be .  here  we can build on that .  compress time .  stretch time .  hold the moment .  punching people   s kidneys out through their nose is only a foolish byproduct .      lu tze took down a razor edged pika sword from the rack and handed it to the shocked boy .      you   ve seen one of these before .  they   re not really for novices  but you show promise .         yes  sweeper  but           know how to use it .         i   m good at the practice ones  but they   re just made of           take it  then  and attack me .      there was a rustling noise above them .  lobsang looked up  and saw monks pouring into the observation gallery above the dojo .  there were some very senior ones among them .  news gets around quickly in a little world .      rule two     said lu tze     is  never refuse a weapon .     he took a few steps back .     in your own time  boy .      lobsang wielded the curved sword uncertainly .      well .     said lu tze .      i can   t just           is this the dojo of the tenth djim .     said lu tze .     why  mercy me  i do believe it is .  that means there are no rules  doesn   t it .  any weapon  any strategy   anything is allowed .  do you understand .  are you stupid .         but i can   t kill someone just because they   ve asked me to .         why not .  what happened to mr .  manners .         but           you are holding a deadly weapon .  you are facing an unarmed man in a pose of submission .  are you frightened .         yes .  yes  i am .         good .  that   s rule three     said lu tze quietly .     see how much you   re learning already .  wiped the smile off your face  have i .  all right  put the sword on the rack and take   yes  take a dakka stick .  the most you can do with that is bruise my old bones .         i would prefer if you wore the protective padding           you   re that good with the stick  are you .         i   m very fast           then if you don   t fight right now i shall wrest it from you and break it over your head     said lu tze  drawing back .     ready .  the only defense is to attack well  i   m told .      lobsang raised the stick in reluctant salute .   lu tze folded his hands and  as lobsang danced toward him  closed his eyes and smiled to himself .   lobsang raised the stick .   and hesitated .   lu tze was grinning .   rule two  rule three   what had been rule one .   always remember rule one        lu tze .      the abbot   s chief acolyte arrived panting in the doorway  waving urgently .   lu tze opened one eye  and then the other one  and then winked at lobsang .      narrow escape there  eh .     he said .  he turned to the acolyte .     yes  exalted sir .         you must come immediately .  and all monks who are cleared for a tour in the world .  to the mandala hall .  now .      there was a scuffling in the gallery and several monks pushed their way out through the crowd .      ah  excitement     said lu tze  taking the stick from lobsang   s unresisting hands and putting it back into the rack .  the hall was emptying fast .  around the whole of oi dong  gongs were being banged frantically .      what   s happening .     said lobsang  as the last of the monks surged past .      i daresay we shall soon be told     said lu tze  starting to roll himself a cigarette .      hadn   t we better hurry .  everyone   s going .     the sound of flapping sandals died away in the distance .      nothing seems to be on fire     said lu tze calmly .     besides  if we wait a little then by the time we get there everyone will have stopped shouting and perhaps they will be making some sense .  let us take the clock path .  the display is particularly fine at this time of day .         but   but           it is written     you   ve got to learn to walk before you can run        said lu tze  putting his broom over his shoulder .      mrs .  cosmopilite again .         amazing woman .  dusted like a demon  too .      the clock path wound out from the main complex  up through the terraced gardens  and then rejoined the wider path as it tunneled into the cliff wall .  novices always asked why it was called the clock path  since there was no sign of a clock anywhere .   more gongs started to bang  but they were muffled by the greenery .  lobsang heard more running feet up on the main path .  down here  hummingbirds flickered from flower to flower  oblivious to any excitement .      i wonder was time it is .     said lu tze  who was walking ahead .   everything is a test .  lobsang glanced around at the flower bed .      a quarter past nine     he said .      oh .  and how do you know that .         the field marigold is open  the red sandwort is opening  the purple bindweed is closed  and the yellow goat   s beard is closing     said lobsang .      you worked out the floral clock all by yourself .         yes .  it   s obvious .         really .  what time is it when the white waterlily opens .         six in the morning .         you came to look .         yes .  you planted this garden  did you .         one of my little   efforts .         it   s beautiful .         it   s not very accurate in the small hours .  there aren   t too many night blooming plants that grow well up here .  they open for the moths  you know           it   s how time wants to be measured     said lobsang .      really .  of course i   m not an expert     said lu tze .  he pinched out the end of his cigarette and stuck it behind his ear .     oh well  let   s keep going .  everyone may have stopped arguing at cross purposes by now .  how do you feel about going through the mandala hall again .         oh  i   ll be fine  i   d just   forgotten about it  that   s all .         really .  and you   d never seen it before  too .  but time plays funny tricks on us all .  why  i once       lu tze stopped  and stared at the apprentice .      are you all right .     he said .     you   ve gone pale .      lobsang grimaced and shook his head .      something   felt odd     he said .  he vaguely waved a hand in the direction of the lowlands  spread out in a blue and gray pattern on the horizon .     something   over there        the glass clock .  the great glass house and here  where it shouldn   t be  the glass clock .  it was barely here  it showed up as shimmering lines in the air  as if it was possible to capture the sparkle of light off a shiny surface without the surface itself .   everything here was transparent   delicate chairs  tables  vases of flowers .  and now he realized that glass was not a word to use here .  crystal might be better  or ice   the thin  flawless ice you sometimes got after a sharp frost .  everything was visible only by its edges .   he could make out staircases through distant walls .  above and below and to every side  the glass rooms went on forever .   and yet it was all familiar .  it felt like home .   sound filled the glass rooms .  it streamed away in clear sharp notes  like the tones made by a wet finger around a wineglass rim .  there was movement  too   a haze in the air beyond the transparent walls  shifting and wavering and   watching him        how can it come from over there .  and how do you mean  odd .     said the voice of lu tze .   lobsang blinked .  this was the odd place  the one right here  the rigid and unbending world     and then the feeling passed and faded .      just   odd .  for a moment     he mumbled .  there was dampness on his cheek .  he raised his hand  and touched wetness .      it   s that rancid yak butter they put in the tea  i   ve always said so     said lu tze .     mrs .  cosmopilite never   now that is unusual     he said  looking up .      what .  what .     said lobsang  looking blankly at his wet fingertips and then up at the cloudless sky .      a procrastinator going overspeed .     he shifted position .     can   t you feel it .         i can   t hear anything .     said lobsang     not hear  feel .  coming up through your sandals .  oops  there goes another one   and another one .  you can   t feel it .  that one   s   that   s old sixty six  they   ve never got it properly balanced .  we   ll hear them in a minute   oh  dear .  look at the flowers .  do look at the flowers .      lobsang turned .   the ice plants were opening .  the field sowthistle was closing .      time leak     said lu tze .     hark at that .  you can hear them now  eh .  they   re dumping time randomly .  come on .         according to the second scroll of wen the eternally surprised  wen the eternally surprised sawed the first procrastinator from the trunk of a wamwam tree  carved certain symbols on it  fitted it with a bronze spindle  and summoned the apprentice  clodpool .      ah .  very nice  master     said clodpool .     a prayer wheel  yes .         no  this is nothing like as complex     said wen .     it merely stores and moves time .         that simple  eh .         and now i shall test it     said wen .  he gave it a half turn with his hand .      ah .  very nice  master     said clodpool .     a prayer wheel  yes .         no  this is nothing like as complex     said wen .     it merely stores and moves time .         that simple  eh .         and now i shall test it     said wen .  he moved it a little less this time .      that simple  eh .         and now i shall test it     said wen .  this time he twisted it gently to and fro .      that si si si   that simple ple  eh eheh simple  eh .     said clodpool .      and i have tested it     said wen .      it worked  master .             yes  i think so .     wen stood up .     give me the rope that you used to carry the firewood .  and   yes  a pit from one of those cherries that you picked yesterday .      he wound the frayed rope around the cylinder and tossed the pit onto a patch of mud .  clodpool jumped out of the way .      see those mountains .     said wen  tugging the rope .  the cylinder spun and balanced there  humming gently .      oh yes  master     said clodpool obediently .  there was practically nothing up here but mountains  there were so many that sometimes they were impossible to see  because they got in the way .      how much time does stone need .     said wen .     or the deep sea .  we shall move it     he placed his left hand just above the spinning blur     to where it is needed .      he looked down at the cherry pit .  his lips moved silently  as though he was working through some complex puzzle .  then he pointed his right hand at the pit .      stand back     he said and gently let a finger touch the cylinder .   there was no sound except the crack of the air as it moved aside  and a hiss of steam from the mud .   wen looked up at the new tree  and smiled .      i did say you should stand back     he said .      i  er  i shall get down now  then  shall i .     said a voice among the blossom laden branches .      but carefully     said wen  and sighed as clodpool crashed down in a shower of petals .      there will always be cherry blossom here     he said .      lu tze hitched up his robe and scurried back down the path .  lobsang ran after him .  a high pitched whine seemed to be coming out of the rocks themselves .  the sweeper skidded at the carp pond now erupting in strange waves  and headed down a shady track alongside a stream .  red ibises erupted into flight     he stopped and threw himself flat on the paving slabs .      get down now .      but lobsang was already headlong .  he heard something pass overhead with a plangent sound .  he looked back and saw the last ibis tumbling in the air  shedding feathers  and shrinking as it flew .  it squawked and vanished with a    pop .      not vanished entirely .  an egg followed the same trajectory for a few seconds  and then smashed on the stones .      random time .  come on  come on .     shouted lu tze .  he scrambled to his feet again  headed toward an ornamental grill in the cliff face ahead of them  and with surprising strength wrenched it out of the wall .      it   s a bit of a drop but if you roll when you land you   ll be okay     he said  lowering himself into the hole .      where does it go to .         the procrastinators  of course .         but novices aren   t allowed in there under pain of death .         that   s a coincidence     said lu tze  lowering himself to the tips of his fingers .     because death is what awaits you if you stay out there  too .      he dropped into the darkness .  a moment later there was an unenlightened curse from below .   lobsang climbed in  hung by his fingertips  dropped  and rolled when he hit the floor below .      well done     said lu tze in the gloom .     when in doubt  choose to live .  this way .      the passageway opened into a wide corridor .  the noise here was shattering .  something mechanical was in agony .   there was a    crump    and  a few moments after  a babble of voices .   several dozen monks  wearing thick cork hats as well as their traditional robes  came running around the corner .  most of them were yelling .  a few of the brighter ones were saving their breath in order to cover the ground more quickly .  lu tze grabbed one of them  who tried to struggle free .      let me go .         what   s happening .         just get out of here before they all go .      the monk shook himself free and sped after the rest of them .   lu tze bent down  picked up a fallen cork helmet  and solemnly handed it to lobsang .      health and safety at work     he said .     very important .         will it protect me .     said lobsang  putting it on .      not really .  but when they find your head  it may be recognizable .  when we get into the hall  don   t touch anything .      lobsang had been expecting some vaulted  magnificent structure .  people talked about the procrastinator hall as if it was some kind of huge cathedral .  but what there was  at the end of the passage  was a haze of blue smoke .  it was only when his eyes got accustomed to the swirling gloom that he saw the nearest cylinder .   it was a squat pillar of rock  about three yards across and six yards high .  it was spinning so fast that it was a blur .  around it the air flickered with slivers of silver blue light .      see .  they   re dumping .  over here .  quick .      he ran after lu tze  and saw there were hundreds  no  thousands of the cylinders  some of them reaching all the way to the cavern roof     there were still monks in here .  some of them were running to and from the wells with buckets of water  which flashed into steam when they threw it over the smoking stone bearings at the base of the cylinders .      idiots     the sweeper muttered .  he cupped his hands and shouted     where is the overseer .      lobsang pointed down  to the edge of a wooden podium built onto the wall of the hall .   there was a rotting cork hat there  and a pair of ancient sandals .  in between was a pile of gray dust .      poor fellow     said lu tze .     a full fifty thousand years in one jolt  i   d say .     he glared at the scurrying monks again .     will you lot stop and come here .  i ain   t going to ask you twice .      several of them swept the sweat out of their eyes and trotted toward the podium  relieved to hear any kind of order  while behind them the procrastinators screamed .      right .     said lu tze  as they were joined by more and more .     now listen to me .  this is just a surge cascade .  you   ve all heard of them .  we can deal with it .  we just have to cross link futures and pasts  fastest ones first           poor mr .  shoblang already tried that     said a monk .  he nodded at the sad pile .      then i want two teams       lu tze stopped .     no  we haven   t got time .  we   ll do it by the soles of our feet  like we used to do .  one man to a spinner  just smack the bars when i say .  ready to go when i call the numbers .      lu tze climbed onto the podium and ran his eye over a board covered with wooden bobbins .  a red or blue nimbus hovered over each one .      what a mess     he said .     what a mess .         what do they mean .     said lobsang .   lu tze hands hovered over the bobbins .      okay .  the red tinted ones are winding time out  speeding it up     he said .     the blue tinted ones  they   re winding time in  slowing it down .  brightness of the color  that   s how fast they   re doing it .  except that now they   re all freewheeling because the surge cut them loose  understand .         loose from what .         from the load .  from the world .  see up there .     he waved a hand toward two long racks that ran all the way along the cavern wall .  each one held a row of swiveling shutters  one line blue  one line dark red .      the more shutters showing a color  the more time winding or unwinding .         good lad .  got to keep it balanced .  and the way we get through this is  we couple the spinners up in twos  so that they wind and unwind one another .  cancel themselves out .  poor old shoblang was trying to put them back into service  i reckon .  can   t be done  not during a cascade .  you   ve got to let it all fall over  and then pick up the pieces when it   s nice and quiet .     he glanced at the bobbins  and then at the crowd of monks .     right .  you   one hundred to seventeen  and then forty five to eighty nine .  off you go .  and you   five hundred and ninety six to  let   s see   yes  four hundred and two           seven hundred and ninety     shouted lobsang  pointing to a bobbin .      you what .         seven hundred and ninety .         don   t be daft .  that   s still unwinding  lad .  four hundred and two is our man  right here .         seven hundred and ninety is about to start winding time again .         it   s still bright blue .         it   s going to unwind .  i know it .  because       the novice   s finger moved over the lines of bobbins  hesitated  and pointed to a bobbin on the other side of the board        it   s matching speeds with this one        lu tze peered .      it is written     well  i   ll go to the foot of our stairs .        he said .     they   re forming a natural inversion .     he squinted at lobsang .     you   re not the reincarnation of someone  are you .  that happens a lot in these parts .         i don   t think so .  it   s just   obvious .         a moment ago you didn   t know anything about these .         yes  yes  but when you see them   it   s obvious .         is it .  is it .  all right .  then the board   s yours  wonder boy .     lu tze stood back .      mine .  but i           get on with it .  that is an order .      for a moment there was a suggestion of blue light around lobsang .  lu tze wondered how much time he   d folded around himself in that second .  time enough to think  certainly .   then the boy called out half a dozen pairs of numbers .  lu tze turned to the monks .      jump to it  boys .  mr .  lobsang has the board .  you boys just watch those bearings .         but he   s a novice       one of the monks began  and stopped and backed away when he saw lu tze   s expression .     all right  sweeper   all right        a moment later there was the sound of jumpers slamming into place .   lobsang called out another set of numbers .   while the monks dashed to and fro to the butter pits for grease  lu tze looked up at the nearest column .  it was still spinning fast  but he was sure he could see the carvings .   lobsang ran his eye over the board again  and stared up at the rumbling cylinders  and then back to the lines of shutters .   there wasn   t anything written down about all this  lu tze knew .  you couldn   t teach it in a classroom  although they tried .  a good spin driver learned it through the soles of his feet  for all the theory that they taught you these days .  he   d learn to feel the flows  to see the rows of procrastinators as wells or fountains of time .  old shoblang had been so good that he   d been able to pull a couple of hours of wasted time off a classroom of bored pupils without them even noticing  and dump it into a busy workshop a thousand miles away as neat as you pleased .   and then there was that trick he used to do with an apple to amaze the apprentices .  he   d put it on a pillar next to them  and then flick time at it off one of the small spindles .  in an instant it   d be a collection of small  spindly trees before crumbling to dust .  that   s what   ll happen to you if you get things wrong  he   d said .   lu tze glanced down at the piles of gray dust under the disintegrating hat as he hurried past .  well  maybe it was the way he   d wanted to go     a scream of tormented stone made him look up .      keep those bearings greased  you lazy devils     he yelled  running on down the rows .     and watch those rails .  hands off the splines .  we   re doing fine .      as he ran he kept his eyes on the columns .  they weren   t turning randomly now .  now  they had purpose .      i think you   re winning  lad .     he shouted to the figure on the podium .      yes  but i can   t balance it .  there   s too much time wound up and nowhere to put it .         how much .         almost forty years .      lu tze glanced at the shutters .  forty years looked about right  but surely        how much .     he said .      forty .  i   m sorry .  there   s nothing to take it up .         no problem .  steal it .  shed load .  we can always pull it back later .  dump it .         where to .         find a big patch of sea .     the sweeper pointed to a crude map of the world painted on the wall .     do you know how to   can you see how to give it the right spin and direction .      once again  there was the blueness in the air .      yes .  i think so .         yes  i imagine you do .  in your own time  then .      lu tze shook his head .  forty years .  he was worried about forty years .  forty years was nothing .  apprentice drivers had dumped fifty thousand years before now .  that was the thing about the sea .  it just stayed big and wet .  it always had been big and wet  it always would be big and wet .  oh  maybe fishermen would start to dredge up strange whiskery fish that they   d only ever seen before as fossils  but who cared what happened to a bunch of codfish .   the sound changed .      what are you doing .     he shouted .      i   ve found space on number four hundred twenty two .  it can take another forty years .  no sense in wasting time .  i   m pulling it back now .      there was another change of tone .      got it .  i   m sure i   ve got it .      some of the bigger cylinders were already slowing to a halt .  lobsang was moving pegs around the board now faster than the bewildered lu tze could follow .  and  overhead  the shutters were slamming back  one after another  showing age blackened wood instead of color .   no one could be that accurate  could they .      you   re down to months now  lad  months .     he shouted .     keep it up .  no   blimey  you   re down to days   days .  keep an eye on me .      the sweeper ran toward the end of the hall  to where the procrastinators were smaller .  time was fine tuned here  on cylinders of chalk and wood and other short lived materials .  to his amazement  some of them were already slowing .   he raced down an aisle of oak columns a few feet high .  but even the procrastinators that could wind time in hours and minutes were falling silent .   there was a squeaking noise .   beside him  one final little chalk cylinder at the end of a row rattled around on its bearing like a spinning top .   lu tze crept toward it  staring at it intently  one hand raised .  the squeaking was the only sound now  apart from the occasional clink of cooling bearings .      nearly there     he called out .     slowing down now   wait for it  wait   for   it        the chalk procrastinator  no bigger than a reel of cotton  slowed  spun   stopped .   on the racks  the last two shutters closed .   lu tze   s hand fell .      now .  kill the board .  no one touch nothing .      for a moment there was dead silence in the hall .  the monks watched  holding their breath .   this was a timeless moment of perfect balance .       tick  and in that timeless moment the ghost of mr .  shoblang  to whom the scene was hazy and fuzzy as a thought seen through gauze  said     this is just impossible .  did you see that .      see what .  said a dark figure behind him .  shoblang turned .      oh     he said  and added with sudden certainty     you   re death  right .      yes .  i am sorry that i am late .   the spirit formerly known as shoblang looked down at the pile of dust that represented his worldly habitation for the previous six hundred years .      so am i     he said .  he nudged death in the ribs .   excuse me .      i said    i   m sorry i   m late .     badabingbadaboom .      i beg your pardon .      er   you know   sorry i   m late .  like   dead .      death nodded .  oh  i see .  it was the badabingbadaboom i did not understand .      er   that was to show it was a joke     said shoblang .   ah  yes .  i can see how that would be necessary .  in fact  mr .  shoblang  while you are late  you are also early .  badabing badaboom .      pardon .      you have died before your time .      well  yes  i should think so .      do you have any idea why .  it   s very unusual .      all i know is that spinners went wild and i must   ve copped a load when one of    em went overspeed     said shoblang .     but  hey  what about that kid  eh .  look at the way he   s making the buggers dance .  i wish i   d had him training under me .  what am i saying .  he could give me a few tips .      death looked around .   to whom do you refer .      that boy up on the podium  see him .      no  i   m afraid i see no one there .      what .  look  he   s right there .  plain as the nose on your fa   well  obviously not on your face        i see the colored pegs moving        well  who do you think is moving them .  i mean  you are death  right .  i thought you could see everyone .      death stared at the dancing bobbins .   everyone   that i should see  he said .  he continued to stare .      ahem     said shoblang .   oh  yes .  where were we .      look  if i   m  er  too early  then can   t you        everything that happens  stays happened .      what kind of philosophy is that .      the only one that works .  death took out an hourglass and consulted it .  i see that because of this problem you are not due to reincarnate for seventy nine years .  do you have anywhere to stay .      stay .  i   m dead .  it   s not like locking yourself out of your own house .     said shoblang  who was beginning to fade .   perhaps you could be bumped up to an earlier birth .   shoblang vanished .   in the timeless moment  death turned back to stare at the hall of spinners         tick  the chalk cylinder started to spin up again  squeaking gently .   one by one  the oak procrastinators began to revolve  picking up the rising load .  this time there was no scream of bearings .  they twirled slowly  like old ballerinas  this way and that  gradually taking up the strain as millions of humans in the world outside bent time around themselves .  the creaking sounded like a tea clipper rounding cape wrath on a gentle breeze .   then the big stone cylinders groaned as they picked up the time their smaller brethren couldn   t handle .  a rumbling underlaid the creaking now  but it was still gentle  controlled     lu tze lowered his hand gently and straightened up .      a nice clean pick up     he said .     well done  everyone .     he turned to the astonished  panting monks and beckoned the most senior toward him .   lu tze pulled a ragged cigarette end out of its lodging behind his ear and said     well now  rambut handisides  what d   you think happened just now  eh .         er   well  there was a surge  which blew out           nah  nah  after that     said lu tze  striking a match on the sole of his sandal .     see  what i don   t think happened was that you boys ran around like a lot of headless chickens and a novice got up on the platform and did the sweetest  smoothest bit of rebalancing that i   ve ever seen .  that couldn   t have happened  because that sort of thing does not happen .  am i right .      the monks of the procrastinator floor were not among the temple   s great political thinkers .  their job was to tend and grease and strip down and rebuild and follow the directions of the man on the platform .  rambut handisides   s brow wrinkled .   lu tze sighed .     see  what i think happened     he said helpfully     was that you lads rose to the occasion  right  and left myself and the young man there aghast at the practical skills you all showed .  the abbot will be impressed and blow happy bubbles .  you could be looking at some extra momos in your thugpa come dinnertime  if you get my drift .      handisides ran this up his mental flagpole and it did indeed send prayers to heaven .  he began to smile .      however     said lu tze  stepping closer and lowering his voice     i   ll probably be around again soon  this place looks as though it could do with a good sweeping  and if i don   t find you boys pin sharp and prodding buttock inside a week  you and me will have a   talk .      the smile vanished .      yes  sweeper .         you   ve got to test them all and see to those bearings           yes  sweeper .         and someone clean up mr .  shoblang .         yes  sweeper .         fair play to you  then .  me and young lobsang here will be going .  you   ve done a lot for his education .      he took the unresisting lobsang by the hand and led him out of the hall  past the long lines of turning  humming procrastinators .  a pall of blue smoke still hung under the high ceiling .      truly it is written     you could knock me down with a feather        he muttered  as they headed up the sloping passage .     you spotted that inversion before it happened .  i   d have blown us into next week .  at least .         sorry  sweeper .         sorry .  you don   t have to be sorry .  i don   t know what you are  son .  you   re too quick .  you   re taking to this place like a duck to water .  you don   t have to learn stuff that takes other people years to get the hang of .  old shoblang  may he be reincarnated somewhere nice and warm  even he couldn   t balance the load down to a second .  i mean  a second .  over a whole damn world .     he shuddered .     here   s a tip .  don   t let it show .  people can be funny about that sort of thing .         yes  sweeper .         and another thing     said lu tze  leading the way out into the light .     what was all that fuss just before the procrastinators cut loose .  you felt something .         i don   t know .  i just felt   everything went wrong for a moment .         ever happened before .         no oo .  it was a bit like what happened in the mandala hall .         well  don   t talk about it to anyone else .  most of the high ups these days probably don   t even know how the spinners work .  no one cares about them anymore .  no one notices something that works too well .  of course  in the old days you weren   t even allowed to become a monk until you   d spent six months in the hall  greasing  and cleaning  and fetching .  and we were better for it .  these days it   s all about learning obedience and cosmic harmony .  well  you learned that in the halls  in the old days .  you learned if you didn   t jump out of the way when someone yelled    she   s dumping .      you got a couple of years where it hurt  and that there   s no harmony better than all the spinners turning sweetly .      the passage rose into the main temple complex .  people were still scurrying around as they headed for the mandala hall .      you   re sure you can look at it again .     said lu tze .      yes  sweeper .         okay .  you know best .      the balconies overlooking the hall were crowded with monks  but lu tze worked his way forward by polite yet firm use of his broom .  the senior monks were clustered at the edge .   rinpo caught sight of him .      ah  sweeper     he said .     some dust delayed you .         spinners cut free and went overspeed     muttered lu tze .      yes  but you were summoned by the abbot     said the acolyte reproachfully .      upon a time     said lu tze     every man jack of us would have legged it down to the hall when the gongs went .         yes  but           brrrrbrrrrbrrrr     said the abbot  and lobsang saw now that he was being carried in a sling on the acolyte   s back  with an embroidered pixie hood on his head to keep the chill off .     lu tze always was very keen on the practical approach brrrbrrr .     he blew milky suds into the acolyte   s ear .     i am glad matters have been resolved  lu tze .      the sweeper bowed  while the abbot started to beat the acolyte gently over the head with a wooden bear .      history has repeated  lu tze dumdumbbbrrrr           glass clock .     said lu tze .   the senior monks gasped .      how could you possibly know that .     said the chief acolyte .     we haven   t rerun the mandala yet .         it is written     i   ve got a feeling in my water        said lu tze .     and that was the only other time i ever heard of when all the spinners went wild like that .  they all cut loose .  time slip .  someone   s building a glass clock again .         that is quite impossible     said the acolyte .     we removed every trace .         hah .  it is written     i   m not as green as i   m cabbage looking    .     snapped lu tze .     something like that you can   t kill .  it leaks back .  stories .  dreams .  paintings on cave walls  whatever        lobsang looked down at the mandala floor .  monks were clustered around a group of tall cylinders at the far end of the hall .  they looked like procrastinators  but only one small one was spinning slowly .  the others were motionless  showing the mass of symbols that were carved into them from top to bottom .   pattern storage .  the thought arrived in his head .  that is where the mandala   s patterns are kept  so they can be replayed .  today   s patterns on the little one  long term storage on the big ones .   below him  the mandala rippled  blotches of color and scraps of pattern drifting across its surface .  one of the distant monks called out something  and the small cylinder stopped .   the rolling sand grains were stilled .      this is how it looked twenty minutes ago     said rinpo .     see the blue white dot there .  and then it spreads           i know what i   m looking at     said lu tze grimly .     i was there when it happened  remember .  your reverence  get them to run the old glass clock sequence .  we haven   t got a lot of time .         i really think we       the acolyte began but was interrupted by a blow from a rubber brick .      wannapottywanna if lu tze is right  then we must not waste time  gentlemen  and if he is wrong  then we have time to spare  is this not so .  pottynowwannawanna .         thank you     said the sweeper .  he cupped his hands .     oi .  you lot .  spindle two  fourth bhing  round about the nineteenth gupa .  and jump to it .         i really must respectfully protest  your reverence     said the acolyte .     we have practiced for just such an emergency as           yeah  i know all about practicing procedures for emergencies     said lu tze .     and there   s always something missing .         ridiculous .  we take great pains to           you always leave out the damn emergency     lu tze turned back to the hall and the apprehensive workers .     ready .  good .  put it on the floor now .  or i shall have to come down there .  and i don   t want to have to come down there .      there was some frantic activity by men around the cylinders  and a new pattern replaced the one below the balcony .  the lines and colors were in different places  but a blue white circle occupied the center .      there     said lu tze .     that was less than ten days before the clock struck .      there was silence from the monks .  lu tze smiled grimly .      and ten days later           time stopped     said lobsang .      that   s one way of putting it     said lu tze .  he   d gone red in the face .   one of the monks put a hand on his shoulder .      it   s all right  sweeper     he said soothingly .     we know you couldn   t have got there in time .         being in time is supposed to be what we do     said lu tze .     i was nearly at the damn door  charlie .  too many castles  not enough time        behind him  the mandala returned to its slow metering of the present .      it wasn   t your fault     said the monk .   lu tze shook the hand free  and turned to face the abbot over the shoulder of the chief acolyte .      i want permission to track this one down right now  reverend sir .     he said .  he tapped his nose .     i   ve got the smell of it .  i   ve been waiting for this all these years .  you won   t find me wanting this time .      in the silence  the abbot blew a bubble .      it   ll be in uberwald again     said lu tze  a hint of pleading in his voice .     that   s where they mess around with the electrick .  i know every inch of that place .  give me a couple of men and we can nip this right in the bud .         bababababa   this needs discussion  lu tze  but we thank you for your offer babababa     said the abbot .     rinpo  i want all bdumbdumbdum senior field monks in the room of silence within five bababa minutes .  are the spinners working bdumbdum harmoniously .      one of the monks looked up from a scroll he   d been handed .      it appears so  your reverence .         my congratulations to the board master bikkit .         but shoblang is dead     murmured lu tze .   the abbot stopped blowing bubbles .      that is sad news .  and he was a friend of yours  i understand .         shouldn   t   ve happened like that     the sweeper muttered .     shouldn   t   ve happened like that .         compose yourself  lu tze .  i will talk to you shortly .  bikkit .     the chief acolyte  spurred on by a blow across the ear with a rubber monkey  hurried away .   the press of monks began to thin out as they went about their duties .  lu tze and lobsang were left on the balcony  looking down at the rippling mandala .   lu tze cleared his throat .      see them spinners at the end .     he said .     the little one records the patterns for a day  and then anything interesting is stored in the big ones .         i just premembered you were going to say that .         good word .  good word .  the lad has talent .     lu tze lowered his voice .     anyone watching us .      lobsang looked around .      there   s a few people still here .      lu tze raised his voice again .      you been taught anything about the big crash .         only rumors  sweeper .         yeah  there were a lot of rumors .     the day time stood still     all that sort of thing .     lu tze sighed .     y   know  most of what you get taught is lies .  it has to be .  sometimes if you get the truth all at once  you can   t understand it .  you knew ankh morpork pretty well  did you .  ever go to the opera house .         only for pickpocket practice  sweeper .         ever wonder about it .  ever look at that little theater just over the road .  called the dysk  i think .         oh  yes .  we got penny tickets and sat on the ground and threw nuts at the stage .         and it didn   t make you think .  big opera house  all plush and gilt and big orchestras  and then there   s this little thatched theater  all bare wood and no seats  and one bloke playing a crumhorn for musical accompaniment .      lobsang shrugged .     well  no .  that   s just how things are .      lu tze almost smiled .      very flexible things  human minds     he said .     it   s amazing what they can stretch to fit .  we did a fine job there           lu tze .      one of the lesser acolytes was waiting respectfully .      the abbot will see you now     he said .      ah  right     said the sweeper .  he nudged lobsang and whispered     we   re going to ankh morpork  lad .         what .  but you said you wanted to be sent to        lu tze winkled .        cos it is written    them as asks  don   t get     see .  there   s more than one way of choking a dangdang than stuffing it with pling  lad .         is there .         oh yes  if you   ve got enough pling .  now let   s see the abbot  shall we .  it   ll be time for his feed now .  solids  thank goodness .  at least he   s done with the wet nurse .  it was so embarrassing for him and the young lady  honestly  you didn   t know where to put your face and neither did he .  i mean  mentally he   s nine hundred years old           that must make him very wise .         pretty wise  pretty wise .  but age and wisdom don   t necessarily go together  i   ve always found     said lu tze  as they approached the abbot   s rooms .     some people just become stupid with more authority .  not his reverence  of course .      the abbot was in his high chair  and had recently flicked a spoonful of nourishing pap all over the chief acolyte  who was smiling like a man whose job depended on looking happy that parsnip and gooseberry custard was dribbling down his forehead .   it occurred to lobsang  not for the first time  that the abbot was a little bit more than purely random in his attacks on the man .  the acolyte was  indeed  the kind of mildly objectionable person who engendered an irresistible urge by any right thinking person to pour goo into his hair and hit him with a rubber yak  and the abbot was old enough to listen to his inner child .      you sent for me  your reverence     said lu tze  bowing .   the abbot upturned his bowl down the chief acolyte   s robe .      wahahaahaha ah  yes   lu tze .  how old are you now .         eight hundred  your reverence .  but that   s no age at all .         nevertheless  you have spent a lot of time in the world .  i understood you were looking to retire and cultivate your gardens .         yes  but           but     the abbot smiled angelically     like an old warhorse  you say    haha .     at the sound of trumpets  yes .         i don   t think so     said lu tze .     there   s nothing funny about trumpets  really .         i meant that you long to be out in the field again .  but you have been helping to train world operatives for many years  haven   t you .  these gentlemen .      on one side of the room  a number of burly and muscular monks were sitting .  they were kitted out for travel  with rolled sleeping mats on their backs  and they were dressed in loose black clothing .  they nodded sheepishly at lu tze  and their eyes above their half masks looked embarrassed .      i did my best     said lu tze .     of course  others trained them .  i just tried to undo the damage .  i never taught them to be ninjas .     he nudged lobsang .     that  apprentice  is agatean for    the passing wind        he said in a stage whisper .      i am proposing to send them out immediately wah .     the abbot hit his high chair with his spoon .     that is my order  lu tze .  you are a legend   but you have been a legend for a long time .  why not trust in the future .  bikkit .         i see     said lu tze sadly .     oh  well  it had to happen sometime .  thank you for your consideration  your reverence .         brrmbrrm   lu tze  i have known you a long time .  you will not go within a hundred miles of uberwald  will you .         not at all  your reverence .         that is an order .         i understand  of course .         you   ve disobeyed my baababa orders before  though .  in omnia  i remember .         tactical decision made by the man on the spot  your reverence .  it was more what you might call an interpretation of your order     said lu tze .      you mean  going where you had distinctly been told not to go and doing what you were absolutely forbidden to do .         yes  your reverence .  sometimes you have to move the seesaw by pushing the other end .  when i did what shouldn   t be done in a place where i shouldn   t have been  i achieved what needed to be done in the place where it should have happened .      the abbot gave lu tze a long hard stare  the kind that babies are good at giving .      lu tze  you are not nmnmnbooboo to go to uberwald or anywhere near uberwald  understand .     he said .      i do  your reverence .  you are right  of course .  but  in my dotage  may i travel another path  of wisdom rather than violence .  i wish to show this young man   the way .      there was laughter from the other monks .      the way of the washerwoman .     said rinpo .      mrs .  cosmopilite is a dressmaker     said lu tze calmly .      whose wisdom is in sayings like    it won   t get better if you pick it    .     said rinpo  winking at the rest of the monks .      few things get better if you pick at them     said lu tze  and now his calmness was a lake of tranquillity .     it may be a mean little way but  small and unworthy though it is   it is my way .     he turned to the abbot .     that was how it used to be  your reverence .  you recall .  master and pupil go out into the world  where the pupil may pick up practical instruction by precept and example  and then the pupil finds his own way and at the end of his way              he finds himself bdum     said the abbot .      first  he finds a teacher     said lu tze .      he is lucky that you will bdumbdum be that teacher .         reverend sir     said lu tze     it is in the nature of ways that none can be sure who the teacher may be .  all i can do is show him a path .         which will be in the direction of bdum the city     said the abbot .      yes     said lu tze .     and ankh morpork is a long way from uberwald .  you won   t send me to uberwald because i am an old man .  so  in all respect  i beg you to humor an old man .         i have no choice  when you put it like that     said the abbot .      reverend sir       began rinpo  who felt that he did .   the spoon was banged on the tray again .     lu tze is a man of high reputation .     the abbot shouted .     i trust him implicitly to do the correct action .  i just wish i could blumblum trust him to do what i blumblum want .  i have forbidden him to go to uberwald .  now do you wish me to forbid him not to go to uberwald .  bikkit .  i have spoken .  and now  will all you gentlemen be so good as to leave .  i have urgent business to attend to .      lu tze bowed and grabbed lobsang   s arm .     come on  lad .     he whispered .     let   s bugger off quick before anyone works it out .      on the way out they passed a lesser acolyte carrying a small potty with a pattern of bunny rabbits around it .      it   s not easy  reincarnating     said lu tze  running down the corridor .     now we   ve got to be out of here before someone gets any funny ideas  lad .  grab your bag and bedroll .         but no one would countermand the abbot   s orders  would they .     said lobsang  as they skidded around a corner .      ha .  it   ll be his nap in ten minutes and if they give him a new toy when he wakes up he might end up being so busy banging square green pegs into round blue holes that he   ll forget what he said     said lu tze .     politics  lad .  too many idiots will start saying what they   re sure the abbot would have meant .  off you go  now .  i   ll see you in the garden of five surprises in one minute .      when lobsang arrived  lu tze was carefully tying one of the bonsai mountains into a bamboo framework .  he fastened the last knot and placed it in a bag over one shoulder .      won   t it get damaged .     said lobsang .      it   s a mountain .  how can it get damaged .     lu tze picked up his broom .     and we   ll just drop in and have a chat with an old mate of mine before we leave  though .  maybe we   ll pick up some stuff .         what   s going on  sweeper .     said lobsang  trailing after him .      well  it   s like this  lad .  me and the abbot and the bloke we   re going to see  we go back a long way .  things are a bit different now .  the abbot can   t just say    lu tze  you are an old rogue  it was you that put the idea of uberwald into everyone   s heads in the first place  but i see you   re onto something so off you go and follow your nose .            but i thought he was the supreme ruler .         exactly .  and it   s very hard to get things done when you   re a supreme ruler .  there   s too many people in the way  mucking things up .  this way  the new lads can have fun running around uberwald going    hai .     and we  my lad  will be heading for ankh morpork .  the abbot knows that .  almost knows that .         how do you know the new clock is being built in ankh morpork .     said lobsang trailing behind lu tze as he took a mossy  sunken path that led through rhododendron thickets to the monastery wall .      i know .  i   ll tell you  the day someone pulls the plug out of the bottom of the universe  the chain will lead all the way to ankh morpork and some bugger saying    i just wanted to see what would happen .     all roads lead to ankh morpork .         i thought all roads led away from ankh morpork .         not the way we   re going .  ah  here we are        lu tze knocked at the door of a rough but large shed built right up against the wall .  at the same moment there was an explosion within and someone   lobsang corrected himself   half of someone tumbled very fast out of the unglazed window beside it and hit the path with bone cracking force .  only when it stopped rolling did he realize that it was a wooden dummy in a monk   s robe .      qu   s having fun  i see     said lu tze .  he hadn   t moved as the dummy had sailed past his ear .   the door burst open and a plump old monk looked out excitedly .      did you see that .  did you see that .     he said .     and that was with just one spoonful .     he nodded at them .     oh  hello  lu tze .  i was expecting you .  i   ve got some things ready .         got what .     said lobsang .      who   s the boy .     said qu  ushering them in .      the untutored child is called lobsang     said lu tze  looking around the shed .  there was a smoking circle on the stone floor  with drifts of blackened sand around it .     new toys  qu .         exploding mandala     said qu happily  bustling forward .     just sprinkle the special sand in a simple design anywhere you like  and the first enemy to walk on it   bang  instant karma .  don   t touch that .      lu tze reached across and snatched from lobsang   s inquisitive hands the begging bowl that he had just picked up from a table .      remember rule one     he said and hurled the bowl across the room .  hidden blades slid out as it spun  and the bowl buried itself in a beam .      that would take a man   s head right off .     said lobsang .  and then they heard the faint ticking .         three  four  five       said qu .     everybody duck   now .      lu tze pushed lobsang to the floor a moment before the bowl exploded .  metal fragments scythed overhead .      i added just a little something extra since you last saw it     said qu proudly  as they got to their feet again .     a very versatile device .  plus  of course  you can use it to eat rice out of .  oh  and have you seen this .      he picked up a prayer drum .  both lu tze and lobsang took a step back .   qu twirled the drum a few times  and the weighted cords pattered against the skins .      the cord can be instantly removed for a handy garotte     he said     and the drum itself can be removed   like so   to reveal this useful dagger .         plus  of course  you can use it to pray with .     said lobsang .      well spotted     said qu .     quick boy .  a prayer is always useful in the last resort .  in fact we   ve been working on a very promising mantra incorporating sonic tones that have a particular effect on the human nervous syst           i don   t think we need any of this stuff  qu     said lu tze .   qu sighed .     at least you could let us turn your broom into a secret weapon  lu tze .  i   ve shown you the plans           it is a secret weapon     said lu tze .     it   s a broom .         how about the new yaks we   ve been breeding .  at the touch of a rein  their horns will instantly           we want the spinners  qu .      the monk suddenly looked guilty .      spinners .  what spinners .      lu tze walked across the room and pressed a hand against part of the wall  which slid aside .      these spinners  qu .  don   t muck me about  we haven   t got time .      lobsang saw what looked very much like two small procrastinators  each one within a metal framework mounted on a board .  there was a harness attached to each board .      you haven   t told the abbot about them yet  have you     said lu tze  unhooking one of the things .     he   d put a stop to them if you did  you know that .         i didn   t think anyone knew .     said qu .     how did you        lu tze grinned .     no one notices a sweeper     he said .      they   re still very experimental .     said qu  close to panic .     i was going to tell the abbot  of course  but i was waiting until i had something to demonstrate .  and it would be terrible if they fell into the wrong hands .         then we   ll see to it that they don   t     said lu tze  examining the straps .     how   re they powered now .         weights and ratchets were too unreliable     said qu .     i   m afraid i had to resort to   clockwork .      lu tze stiffened  and he glared at the monk .     clockwork .         only as a motive force  only as a motive force .     qu protested .     there   s really no other choice .         too late now  it   ll have to do     said lu tze  unhooking the other board and passing it across to lobsang .     there you go  lad .  with a bit of sacking round it it   ll look just like a backpack .         what is it .      qu sighed .     they   re portable procrastinators .  try not to break them  please .         what will we need them for .         i hope you don   t have to find out     said lu tze .     thanks  qu .         are you sure you wouldn   t prefer some time bombs .     said qu hopefully .     drop one on the floor and time will slow for           thanks  but no .         the other monks were fully equipped     said qu .      but we   re traveling light     said lu tze firmly .     we   ll go out the back way  qu  okay .      the back way led to a very narrow path and a small gate in the wall .  dismembered wooden dummies and patches of scorched rock indicated that qu and his assistants often came this way .  and then there was another path  beside one of the many icy streamlets .      qu means well     said lu tze  walking fast .     but if you listen to him you end up clanking when you walk and exploding when you sit down .      lobsang ran to keep up .      it   ll take weeks to walk to ankh morpork  sweeper .         we   ll slice our way there     said lu tze  and he stopped and turned .     you think you can do that .         i   ve done it hundreds of times       lobsang began .      back in oi dong  yes     said lu tze .     but there   s all kinds of checks and safeguards in the valley .  oh  didn   t you know that .  slicing in oi dong is easy  lad .  it   s different out here .  the air tries to get in the way .  do it wrong and the air is a rock .  you have to shape the slice around you so that you move like a fish in water .  know how to do that .         we learned a bit of the theory but           soto said you stopped time for yourself back in the city .  the stance of the coyote  it   s called .  very hard to do  and i don   t reckon they teach it in the thieves    guild  eh .         i suppose i was lucky  sweeper .         good .  keep it up .  we   ll have plenty of time for you to practice before we leave the snow .  get it right before you tread on grass  or kiss your feet goodbye .      they called it slicing time     there is a way of playing certain musical instruments that is called    circular breathing     devised to allow people to play the didgeridoo or the bagpipes without actually imploding or being sucked down the tube .     slicing time    was very much the same  except time was substituted for air and it was a lot quieter .  a trained monk could stretch a second further than an hour     but that wasn   t enough .  he   d be moving in a rigid world .  he   d have to learn to see by echo light and hear by ghost sound and let time leach into his immediate universe .  it wasn   t hard  once he found the confidence  the sliced world could almost seem normal  apart from the colors     it was like walking in sunsets  although the sun was fixed high in the sky and barely moved .  the world ahead shaded toward violet and the world behind  when lobsang looked around  was the shade of old blood .  and it was lonely .  but the worst of it  lobsang realized  was the silence .  there was noise  of a sort  but it was just a deep sizzle at the edge of hearing .  his footsteps sounded strange and muffled  and the sound arrived in his ears out of sync with the tread of his feet .   they reached the edge of the valley and stepped out of the perpetual springtime into the real world of the snows .  now the cold crept in  slowly  like a sadist   s knife .   lu tze strode on ahead  seemingly oblivious to it .   of course  that was one of the stories about him .  lu tze  it was said  would walk for miles during weather when the clouds themselves would freeze and crash out of the sky .  cold did not affect him  they said .   and yet     in the stories lu tze had been bigger  stronger   not a skinny little bald man who preferred not to fight        sweeper .      lu tze stopped and turned .  his outline blurred slightly  and lobsang unwrapped himself from time .  color came back into the world  and while the cold ceased to have the force of a drill it still struck hard .      yes  lad .         you   re going to teach me  right .         if there   s anything left that you don   t know  wonder boy     said lu tze drily .     you   re slicing well  i can see that .         i don   t know how you can stand this cold .         ah   you don   t know the secret .         is it the way of mrs .  cosmopilite that gives you such power .      lu tze hitched up his robe and did a little dance in the snow  revealing skinny legs encased in thick  yellowing tubes .      very good  very good     he said .     she still sends me these double knit combinations  silk on the inside  then three layers of wool  reinforced gussets  and a couple of handy trapdoors .  very reasonably priced at six dollars a pair because i   m an old customer .  for it is written     wrap up warm or you   ll catch your death .            it   s just a trick .      lu tze looked surprised .      what .     he said .      well   i mean   it   s all tricks  isn   t it .  everyone thinks you   re a great hero and   you don   t fight  and they think you possess all kinds of strange knowledge and   and it   s just   tricking people .  isn   t it .  even the abbot .  i thought you   d teach me   things worth knowing           i   ve got her address  if that   s what you want .  if you mention my name   oh .  i see you don   t mean that  right .         i don   t want to be ungrateful  i just thought           you thought i should use mysterious powers derived from a lifetime of study just to keep my legs warm .  eh .         well           debase the sacred teachings for the sake of my knees  you think .         if you put it like that        then something made lobsang look down .   he was standing in six inches of snow .  lu tze was not .  his sandals were standing in two puddles .  the ice was melting away around his toes .  his pink  warm toes .      toes  now  that   s another matter     said the sweeper .     mrs .  cosmopilite is a wizard with longjohns  but she can   t turn a heel worth a damn .     lobsang looked up into a wink .     always remember rule one  eh .      lu tze patted the shaken boy on the arm .     but you   re doing well     he said .     let   s have a quiet sit down and a brew up .     he pointed to some rocks  that at least offered some protection from the wind  snow had piled up against them in big white mounds .      lu tze .         yes  lad .         i   ve got a question .  can you give me a straight answer .        i   ll try  of course .        what the hell is going on .      lu tze brushed the snow off a rock .     oh     he said .     one of the difficult questions .          tick  igor had to admit it .  when it came to getting weird things done  sane beat mad hands down .   he   d been used to masters who  despite doing wonderful handstands on the edge of the mental catastrophe curve  couldn   t put their own trousers on without a map .  like all igors  he   d learned how to deal with them .  in truth  it wasn   t a difficult job  although sometimes you had to work the graveyard shift   and once you got them settled into their routine you could get on with your own work and they wouldn   t bother you until the lightning rod needed raising .   it wasn   t like that with jeremy .  he was truly a man you could set your watch by .  igor had never seen a life so organized  so slimmed down  so timed .  he found himself thinking of his new master as the tick tock man .   one of igor   s former masters had made a tick tock man  all levers and gearwheels and cranks and clockwork .  instead of a brain  it had a long tape punched with holes .  instead of a heart  it had a big spring .  provided everything in the kitchen was very carefully positioned  the thing could sweep the floor and make a passable cup of tea .  if it wasn   t carefully positioned  or if the ticking  clicking thing hit an unexpected bump  then it   d strip the plaster off the walls and make a furious cup of cat .   then his master had conceived the idea of making the thing live  so that it could punch its own tapes and wind its own spring .  igor  who knew exactly when to follow instructions to the letter  dutifully rigged up the classic rising table and lightning rod arrangement on the evening of a really good storm .  he didn   t see exactly what happened thereafter  because he wasn   t there when the lightning hit the clockwork .  no  igor was at a dead run halfway down the hill to the village  with all his possessions in a carpetbag .  even so  a white hot cogwheel had whirred over his head and buried itself in a tree trunk .   loyalty to a master was very important  but it took second place to loyalty to igordom .  if the world was going to be full of lurching servants  then they were damn well going to be called igor .   it seemed to this igor that if you could make a tick tock man live  he   d be like jeremy .  and jeremy was ticking faster as the clock neared completion .   igor didn   t much like the clock .  he was a people person .  he preferred things that bled .  and as the clock grew  with its shimmering crystal parts that didn   t seem entirely all here  so jeremy grew more absorbed and igor grew more tense .  there was definitely something new happening here  and igors were avid to learn new things .  but there were limits .  igors did not believe in    forbidden knowledge    and    things man was not meant to know    but obviously there were some things a man was not meant to know  such as what it felt like to have every single particle of your body sucked into a little hole  and that seemed to be one of the options available in the immediate future .   and then there was lady lejean .  she gave igor the willies  and he was a man not usually subject to even the smallest willy .  she wasn   t a zombie and she wasn   t a vampire  because she didn   t smell like one .  she didn   t smell like anything .  in igor   s experience  everything smelled like something .   and there was the other matter .      her feet don   t touch the ground  thur     he said .      of course they do     said jeremy  buffing up part of the mechanism with his sleeve .     she   ll be here again in a minute and seventeen seconds .  and i   m sure her feet will be touching the ground .         oh  thometimeth they do  thur .  but you watch when thhe goeth up or down a thtep  thur .  thhe doethn   t get it exactly right  thur .  you can jutht thee the thadow under her thoeth .         thoeth .         on her feet  thur     sighed igor .  the lisp could be a problem  and in truth any igor could easily fix it  but it was part of being an igor .  you might as well stop limping .      go and get ready by the door     said jeremy .     floating in the air doesn   t make you a bad person .      igor shrugged .  he was entertaining the idea that it didn   t mean you were a person at all and  incidentally  he was rather worried that jeremy seemed to have dressed himself with a little more care this morning .   he   d decided in these circumstances not to broach the subject of his hiring  but he had been working that one out .  he   d been hired before his ladyship had engaged jeremy to do this work .  well  all that showed was that she knew her man .  but she   d hired him in bad sch  schein  herself .  and he   d got himself onto the mail coach that very day .  and it turned out that lady lejean had visited jeremy on that day  too .   the only thing faster than the mail coach between uberwald and ankh morpork was magic  unless someone had found a way to travel by semaphore .  and lejean hardly looked like a witch .   the shop   s clocks were putting up a barrage of noise to signal the passing of seven o   clock when igor opened the front door .  it always did  to anticipate the knock .  that was another part of the code of the igors .   he wrenched it open .      two pints  sir  lovely and fresh     said mr .  soak  handing him the bottles .     and a day like this just says fresh cream  doesn   t it .      igor glared at him but took the bottles .      i prefer it when it   th going green     he said haughtily .     good day to you  mr .  thoak .      he shut the door .      it wasn   t her .     said jeremy  when he arrived back in the workshop .      it wath the milkman  thur .         she   s twenty five seconds late .     said jeremy  looking concerned .     do you think anything could have happened to her .         real ladieth are often fathionably late  thur     said igor  putting the milk away .  it was icy cold under his fingers .      well  i   m sure her ladyship is a real lady .         i wouldn   t know about that  thur     said igor  who in fact had the aforesaid very strong doubts in that area .  he walked back into the shop and got ready with his hand on the handle just as the knock came .   lady lejean swept past igor .  the two trolls ignored him and took up their positions just inside the workshop .  igor put them down as hired rock  anyone   s for two dollars a day plus walking around money .   her ladyship was impressed .   the big clock was nearing completion .  it wasn   t the squat  blocky thing that igor   s grandfather had told him about .  jeremy had  much to igor   s surprise   for there wasn   t a scrap of decoration anywhere in the house   gone for the impressive look .      your grandfather helped to make the first one     jeremy had said .     so let   s build a grandfather   s clock  eh .     and there it stood   a slim  long case clock in crystal and spun glass  reflecting the light in worrying ways .   igor had spent a fortune in the street of cunning artificers .  for enough money  you could buy anything in ankh morpork  and that included people .  he   d made sure that no crystal cutter or glass worker had done enough of the work to give them any sort of clue about the finished clock  but he   d worried needlessly about that .  money could buy a lot of disinterest .  besides  who would believe you could measure time with crystals .  only in the workshop did it all come together .   igor bustled around  polishing things  listening carefully as jeremy showed off his creation .         no need for any metal parts     he was saying .     we   ve come up with a way of making the tamed lightning flow across glass  and we   ve found a workman who can make glass that bends slightly           we     igor noticed .  well  that was always the way of it .     we    discovering things meant the master asking for them and igor thinking them up .  anyway  the flow of lightning was a family passion .  with sand and chemicals and a few secrets  you could make lightning sit up and beg .   lady lejean reached out with a gloved hand and touched the side of the clock .      this is the divider mechanism       jeremy began  picking up a crystalline array from the workbench .   but her ladyship was still staring up at the clock .      you   ve given it a face and hands     she said .     why .         oh  it will function very well in the measurement of traditional time     said jeremy .     glass gears throughout  of course .  in theory it will never need adjusting .  it will take its time from the universal tick .         ah .  you found it  then .         the time it takes the smallest possible thing that can happen to happen .  i know it exists .      she looked almost impressed .     but the clock is still unfinished .         there is a certain amount of trial and error     said jeremy .     but we will do it .  igor says there will be a big storm on monday .  that should provide the power  he says .  and then     jeremy   s face lit up with a smile     i see no reason why every clock in the world shouldn   t say precisely the same time .      lady lejean glanced at igor  who bustled with renewed haste .      the servant is satisfactory .         oh  he grumbles a bit .  but he has got a good heart .  and a spare  apparently .  he is amazingly skilled in all crafts  too .         yes  igors generally are     said the lady distantly .     they seem to have mastered the art of inheriting talents .     she snapped her fingers  and one of the trolls stepped forward and produced a couple of bags .      gold and invar     she said .     as promised .         hah  but invar will be worthless when we   ve finished the clock     said jeremy .      we   re sorry .  you want more gold .         no  no .  you have been very generous .      right  thought igor  dusting the workbench vigorously .      until next time  then     said lady lejean .  the trolls were already turning toward the door .      you   ll be here for the start .     said jeremy  as igor hurried into the hall to get the front door open because  whatever he thought about her ladyship  there was such a thing as tradition .      possibly .  but we have every confidence in you  jeremy .         um    .      igor stiffened .  he hadn   t heard that tone in jeremy   s voice .  in the voice of a master  it was a bad tone .   jeremy took a deep  nervous breath  as if contemplating some minute and difficult piece of clockwork that would  without tremendous care  unwind catastrophically and spray cogwheels across the floor .      um   i was wondering  um  your ladyship  um   perhaps  um  you would like to take dinner with me  um  tonight  um        jeremy smiled .  igor had seen better smiles on a corpse .   lady lejean   s expression flickered .  it really did .  it seemed to igor to go from one expression to another as if they were a series of still pictures  with no perceptible movement of the features between each one .  it went from her usual blankness to sudden thoughtfulness and then all the way to amazement .  and then  to igor   s own astonishment  it began to blush .      why  mr .  jeremy  i   i don   t know what to say     her ladyship stammered  her icy composure turning into a warm puddle .     i really   i don   t know   perhaps some other time .  i do have an important engagement  so glad to have met you  i must be going .  goodbye .      igor stood stiffly to attention  as upright as the average igor could manage  and almost shut the door behind her ladyship as she hurried out of the building and down the steps .   she ended up  just for a moment  half an inch above the street .  it was only for a moment  and then she drifted downward .  no one except igor  glaring balefully through the crack between door and frame  could possibly have noticed .   he darted back into the workshop .  jeremy still stood transfixed  blushing as pinkly as her ladyship had done .      i   ll jutht be nipping out to get that new glathwork for the multiplier  thur     igor said quickly .     it thould be done by now .  yeth .      jeremy spun on his heel and marched very quickly over to the workbench .      you do that  igor .  thank you     he said  his voice slightly muffled .   lady lejean   s party was down the street when igor slipped out and moved quickly into the shadows .   at the crossroads her ladyship waved one hand vaguely and the trolls headed off by themselves .  igor stayed with her .  for all the trademark limp  igors could move fast when they had to .  they often had to  when the mob hit the windmill .    out in the open  he could see more wrong things .  she didn   t move quite right .  it was as though she was controlling her body  rather than letting it control itself as normal humans do .  even zombies got the hang of things after a while .  the effect was subtle  but igors had very good eyesight .  she moved like someone unused to wearing skin .   the quarry headed down a narrow street  and igor half hoped that some of the thieves    guild were around .  he   d very much like to see what happened if one of them gave her the tap on the noggin that was their prelude to negotiations .  one had tried it with igor yesterday  and if the man had been surprised at the metallic clang he   d been astonished to have his arm grabbed and broken with anatomical exactitude .   in fact  she turned into an alleyway between a couple of the buildings .   igor hesitated .  letting yourself be outlined in the daylight at the mouth of an alley was item one on the local checklist of death .  but  on the other hand  he wasn   t actually doing anything wrong  was he .  and she didn   t look armed .   there was no sound of footsteps in the alley .  he waited a moment and stuck his head around the corner .   there was no sign of lady lejean .  there was also no way out of the alley   it was a dead end  full of rubbish .   but there was a fading gray shape in the air that vanished even as he stared .  it was a hooded robe  gray as fog .  it merged into the general gloom and disappeared .   she turned into an alleyway  and then she   s turned into   something else .   igor felt his hands twitch .   individual igors might have their particular specialities  but all of them were expert surgeons and had an inbuilt desire not to see anybody wasted .  up in the mountains  where most of the employment was for woodchoppers and miners  having an igor living locally was considered very fortunate .  there was always the risk of an ax bouncing or a sawblade running wild  and then a man was glad to have an igor around who could lend a hand   or even an entire arm  if you were lucky .   and while they practiced their skills freely and generously in the community  the igors were even more careful to use it among themselves .  magnificent eyesight  a stout pair of lungs  a wonderful digestive system   it was terrible to think of such exquisite workmanship going to the worms .  so they made sure it didn   t .  they kept it in the family .   igor really did have his grandfather   s hands .  and now they were bunching into fists  all by themselves .       tick  a very small kettle burned on a fire of wood shavings and dried yak dung .      it was   a long time ago     said lu tze .     exactly when doesn   t matter     cos of what happened .  in fact  asking exactly    when    doesn   t make any sense anymore .  it depends where you are .  in some places it was hundreds of years ago .  some other places   well  maybe it hasn   t happened yet .  there was this man in uberwald .  invented a clock .  an amazing clock .  it measured the tick of the universe .  know what that is .         no .         me neither .  the abbot   s your man for that kind of stuff .  lemme see   okay   think of the smallest amount of time that you can .  really small .  so tiny that a second would be like a billion years .  got that .  well  the cosmic quantum tick   that   s what the abbot calls it   the cosmic quantum tick is much smaller than that .  it   s the time it takes to go from now to then .  the time it takes an atom to think of wobbling .  it   s           it   s the time it takes for the smallest thing that   s possible to happen to happen .     said lobsang .      exactly .  well done     said lu tze .  he took a deep breath .     it   s also the time it takes for the whole universe to be destroyed in the past and rebuilt in the future .  don   t look at me like that  that   s what the abbot said .         has it been happening while we   ve been talking .     said lobsang .      millions of times .  an oodleplex of times  probably .         how many   s that .         it   s one of the abbot   s words .  it means more numbers than you can imagine in a yonk .         what   s a yonk .         a very long time .         and we don   t feel it .  the universe is destroyed  and we don   t feel it .         they say not .  the first time it was explained to me i got a bit jumpy  but it   s far too quick for us to notice .      lobsang stared at the snow for a while .  then he said     all right .  go on .         someone in uberwald built this clock out of glass .  powered by lightning  as i recall .  it somehow got down to a level where it could tick with the universe .         why did he want to do that .         listen  he lived in a big old castle on a crag in uberwald .  people like that don   t need a reason apart from    because i can .     they have a nightmare and try to make it happen .         but  look   you can   t make a clock like that  because it   s inside the universe  so it   ll   get rebuilt when the universe does  right .      lu tze looked impressed  and said so .     i   m impressed     he said .      it   d be like opening a box with the crowbar that   s inside .         the abbot believes part of the clock was outside  though .         you can   t have something outside the           tell that to a man who has been working on the problem for nine lifetimes     said lu tze .     you want to hear the rest of the story .         yes  sweeper .         so    we were spread pretty thin in those days  but there was this young sweeper           you     said lobsang .     this is going to be you  right .         yes  yes     said lu tze testily .     i was sent to uberwald .  history hadn   t diverged much in those days  and we knew something big was going to happen around bad sch  schein .  i must have spent weeks looking .  you know how many remote castles there are along the gorges .  you can   t move for remote castles .         that   s why you didn   t find the right one in time     said lobsang .     i remember what you told the abbot .         i was just down in the valley when the lightning struck the tower     said lu tze .     you know  it is written     big events always cast their shadows .     but i couldn   t detect where it was happening until too late .  half a mile sprint uphill faster than a lightning bolt   no one could do that .  nearly made it  though   i was actually through the door when it all went to hell .         no point in blaming yourself  then .         yes  but you know how it is   you keep thinking     if only i   d got up earlier  or had gone a different way          said lu tze .      and the clock struck     said lobsang .      no .  it stuck .  i told you part of it was outside the universe .  it wouldn   t go with the flow .  it was trying to count the tick  not move with it .         but the universe is huge .  it can   t be stopped by a piece of clockwork .      lu tze flicked the end of his cigarette into the fire .      the abbot says the size wouldn   t make any difference at all     he said .     look  it   s taken him nine lifetimes to know what he knows  so it   s not our fault if we can   t understand it  is it .  history shattered .  it was the only thing that could give .  very strange event .  there were cracks left all over the place .  the   oh  i can   t remember the words   the fastenings  which tell bits of the past which bits of the present they belong to  they were flapping all over the place .  some got lost forever .     lu tze stared into the dying flames .     we stitched it up as best we could     he added .     up and down history .  filling up holes with bits of time taken from somewhere else .  it   s a patchwork  really .         didn   t people notice .         why should they .  once we   d done it  it had always been like that .  you   d be amazed what we got away with .  f   r instance           i   m sure they spot it somehow .      lu tze gave lobsang one of his sidelong glances .     funny you should say that .  i   ve always wondered about it .  people say things like    where did the time go .     and    it seems like only yesterday .     we had to do it  anyway .  and it   s healed up very nicely .         but   people would look in the history books and see           words  lad .  that   s all .  anyway  people have been messing around with time ever since they were people .  wasting it  killing it  sparing it  making it up .  and they do it .  people   s heads were made to play with time .  just like we do  except we   re better trained and have a few extra skills .  and we   ve spent centuries working to bring it all back in line .  you watch the procrastinators even on a quiet day .  moving time  stretching it here  compressing it there   it   s a big job .  i   m not going to see it smashed a second time .  a second time  there won   t be enough left to repair .      he stared at the embers .      funny thing     he said .     wen himself had some very funny ideas about time  come the finish .  wrote some very strange stuff .  he reckoned time was alive .  he said it acted like a living thing  anyway .  very strange ideas indeed .  he said he   d met time  and she was a woman .  to him  anyway .  everyone says that was just a very complicated metaphor  and maybe i was just hit on the head or something  but on that day i looked at the glass clock just as it exploded and        he stood up and grabbed his broom .      best foot forward  lad .  another two or three seconds and we   ll be down in bong phut .         what were you going to say .     said lobsang  hurrying to his feet .      oh  just an old man rambling     said lu tze .     the mind wanders a bit when you get over seven hundred .  let   s get moving .         sweeper .         yes  lad .         why are we carrying spinners on our backs .         all in good time  lad .  i hope .         we   re carrying time  right .  if time stops  we can keep going .  like   divers .         full marks .         and    .         another question .         time is a    she    .  none of the teachers have mentioned it and i don   t recall anything in the scrolls .         don   t you think about that .  wen wrote   well  the secret scroll  it   s called .  they keep it in a locked room .  only the abbots and the most senior monks ever get to see it .      lobsang couldn   t let that one pass .      so how did you    .     he began .      well  you wouldn   t expect men like that to do the sweeping up in there  would you .     said lu tze .     terribly dusty  it got .         what was it about .         i didn   t read much of it .  didn   t feel it was right     said lu tze .      you .  what was it about  then .         it was a love poem .  and it was a good one        lu tze   s image blurred  as he sliced time .  then it faded and vanished .  a line of footprints appeared across the snowfield .   lobsang wrapped time around himself  and followed .  and a memory came from nowhere at all  wen was right .       tick  there were lots of places like the warehouse .  there always are  in every old city  no matter how valuable the building land is .  sometimes  space just gets lost .   a workshop is built  and then another beside it .  factories and storerooms and sheds and temporary lean tos crawl toward one another  meet  and merge .  spaces between outside walls are roofed with tar paper .  odd shaped bits of ground are colonized by someone   s nailing up a bit of wall and cutting a doorway .  old doorways are masked by piles of lumber or new tool racks .  the old men who knew what was where move on and die  just like the flies who punctuate the thick cobwebs on the grubby windows .  young men  in this noisome world of whirring lathes and paint shops and cluttered workbenches  don   t have time to explore .   and so there are spaces like this  a small warehouse with a crusted skylight that no fewer than four factory owners think is owned by one of the other three  when they think about it at all .  in fact  each of them own one wall  and certainly no one now recalls who roofed the space .  beyond the walls on all four sides men and dwarfs bend iron  saw planks  make string  and turn screws .  but in here is a silence known only to rats .   the air moved  for the first time in years .  dust balls rolled across the floor .  little motes sparkled and spun in the light that forced its way down from the roof .  in the surrounding area  invisible and subtle  matter began to move .  it came from workmen   s sandwiches and gutter dirt and pigeon feathers  an atom here  a molecule there  and streamed  unheeded  into the center of the space .   it spiraled .  eventually it became  after passing through some strange  ancient  and horrible shapes  lady lejean .   she staggered but managed to stay upright .   other auditors also appeared and  as they did so  it seemed for the first time that they had never really not been there .  the dead grayness of the light merely took on shapes  they emerged like ships from a fog .  you stare at the fog  and suddenly part of the fog is hull which has been there all along  and now there is nothing for it but the race for the lifeboats     lady lejean said     i cannot keep doing this .  it is too painful .      one said  ah   can you tell us what pain is like .  we have often wondered .      no .  no  i don   t think i can .  it is   a body thing .  it is not pleasant .  from now on  i will retain the body .      one said  that could be dangerous .   lady lejean shrugged .      we have been through that before .  it   s only a matter of appearance     she said .     and it is remarkable how much easier it is to deal with humans in this form .      one said  you shrugged .  and you are talking with your mouth .  a hole for food and air .      yes .  it is remarkable  isn   t it .     lady lejean   s body found an old crate  pulled it over  and sat on it .  she hardly had to think about muscle movements at all .   one said  you aren   t eating  are you .      as yet  no .      one said  as yet .  that raises the whole dreadful subject of   orifices .   one said  and how did you learn to shrug .      it comes with the body     said her ladyship .     we never realized this  did we .  most of the things it does it appears to do automatically .  standing upright takes no effort whatsover .  the whole business gets easier every time .      the body shifted position slightly and crossed its legs .  amazing  she thought .  it did it to be comfortable .  i didn   t have to think about it at all .  we never guessed .   one said  there will be questions .   the auditors hated questions .  they hated them almost as much as they hated decisions  and they hated decisions almost as much as they hated the idea of the individual personality .  but what they hated most was things moving around randomly .      believe me  everything will be fine     said lady lejean .     we will not be breaking any of the rules  after all .  all that will happen is that time will stop .  everything thereafter will be neat .  alive  but not moving .  tidy .      one said  and we can get the filing finished .      exactly     said lady lejean .     and he wants to do it .  that is the strange thing .  he hardly thinks about the consequences .      one said  splendid .   there was one of those pauses when no one is quite ready to speak yet .  and then     one said  tell us   what is it like .      what is what like .      one said  being insane .  being human .      strange .  disorganized .  several levels of thinking go on at once .  there are   things we have no word for .  for example  the idea of eating seems now to have a   an attraction .  the body tells me this .      one said  attraction .  as in gravity .      ye es .  one is drawn toward food .      one said  food in large masses .      even in small amounts .      one said  but eating is simply a function .  what is the   attraction of performing a function .  surely the knowledge that it is necessary for continued survival is sufficient .      i cannot say     said lady lejean .   one auditor said  you persist in using a personal pronoun .   and one added  and you have not died .  to be an individual is to live  and to live is to die .      yes .  i know .  but it is essential for humans to use the personal pronoun .  it divides the universe into two parts .  the darkness behind the eyes  where the little voice is  and everything else .  it is   a horrible feeling .  it is like being   questioned  all the time .      one said  what is the little voice .      sometimes thinking is like talking to another person  but that person is also you .      she could tell this disturbed the other auditors .     i do not wish to continue in this way any longer than necessary     she added .  and realized that she had lied .   one said  we do not blame you .   lady lejean nodded .   the auditors could see into human minds .  they could see the pop and sizzle of the thoughts .  but they could not read them .  they could see the energies flow from node to node  they could see the brain glittering like a hogswatch decoration .  what they couldn   t see was what was happening .   so they   d built one .   it was the logical thing to do .  they   d used human agents before  because early on they   d worked out that there were many  many humans who would do anything for sufficient gold .  this was puzzling  because gold did not seem to the auditors to hold any significant value for a human body   it needed iron and copper and zinc  but only the most minute traces of gold .  therefore  they   d reasoned  this was further evidence that the humans that required it were flawed  and this was why attempts to make use of them were doomed .  but why were they flawed .   building a human being was easy  the auditors knew exactly how to move matter around .  the trouble was that the result didn   t do anything but lie there and  eventually  decompose .  this was annoying  since clearly human beings  without any special training or education  seemed to be able to make working replicas quite easily .   then they learned that they could make a human body  which worked if an auditor was inside it .   there were  of course  huge risks .  death was one of them .   the auditors avoided death by never going so far as to get a life .  they strove to be as indistinguishable as hydrogen atoms  and with none of the latter   s joie de vivre .  some luckless auditor might be risking death by    operating    the body .  but lengthy consultation decided that if the driver took care  and liaised at all times with the rest of the auditors  this was minimal and worth taking  considering the goal .   they built a woman .  it was a logical choice .  after all  while men wielded more obvious power than women  they often did so at the expense of personal danger  and no auditor liked the prospect of personal danger .  beautiful women often achieved great things  on the other hand  merely by smiling at powerful men .   the whole subject of    beauty    caused the auditors a lot of difficulty .  it made no sense at a molecular level .  but research turned up the fact that the woman in the picture woman holding ferret by leonard of quirm was considered the epitome of beauty  and so they   d based lady lejean on that .  they had made changes  of course .  the face in the picture was asymmetrical and full of minor flaws  which they had carefully removed .   the result would have been successful beyond the auditors    wildest dreams  if they   d ever dreamed .  now that they had their stalking horse  their reliable human  anything was possible .  they were learning fast  or at least collecting data  which they considered to be the same as learning .   so was lady lejean .  she had been a human for two weeks  two astonishing  shocking weeks .  whoever would have guessed that a brain operated like this .  or that colors had a meaning that went way  way beyond spectral analysis .  how could she even begin to describe the blueness of blue .  or how much thinking the brain did all by itself .  it was terrifying .  half the time her thoughts seemed not to be her own .   she had been quite surprised to find that she did not want to tell the other auditors this .  she did not want to tell them a lot of things .  and she didn   t have to .   she had power .  oh  over jeremy  that was not in question and was now  she had to admit  rather worrying .  it was causing her body to do things by itself  like blush .  but she had power over the other auditors  too .  she made them nervous .   of course she wanted the project to work .  it was their goal .  a tidy and predictable universe  where everything stayed in its place .  if auditors dreamed  this would be another dream .   except   except     the young man had smiled at her in a nervous  worrying way  and the universe was turning out to be a lot more chaotic than even the auditors had ever suspected .   a lot of the chaos was happening inside lady lejean   s head .       tick  lu tze and lobsang passed through bong phut and long nap like ghosts in twilight .  people and animals were bluish statues and were not  said lu tze  to be touched in any circumstances .   lu tze stocked his travel bag with more food from some of the houses  making sure to leave little copper tokens in their place .      it means we   re obliged to them     he said  filling lobsang   s bag as well .     the next monk through here might have to give someone a minute or two .         a minute or two isn   t much .         for a dying woman to say goodbye to her children  it   s a lifetime     said lu tze .     is it not written     every second counts    .  let   s go .         i   m tired  sweeper .         i did say every second counts .         but everybody has to sleep .         yes  but not yet     lu tze insisted .     we can rest in the caves down at songset .  can   t fold time while you   re asleep  see .         can   t we use these spinners .         in theory  yes .         in theory .  they could wind out time for us .  we   d only sleep for a few seconds           they   re for emergencies only     said lu tze bluntly .      how do you define an emergency  sweeper .         an emergency is when i decide it   s time to use a clockwork spinner designed by qu  wonder boy .  a lifebelt   s for saving your life .  that   s when i   ll trust an uncalibrated  un blessed spinner powered by springs .  when i have to .  i know qu says        lobsang blinked and shook his head .  lu tze grabbed his arm .      you felt something again .         ugh   like having a tooth out in my brain     said lobsang  rubbing his head .  he pointed .     it came from over there .         a pain came from over there .     said lu tze .  he glared at the boy .     but we   ve never found a way of detecting which way        he stopped  and rummaged in his sack .  then he used the sack to sweep snow off a flat boulder .      we   ll see what        glass house .   this time lobsang could concentrate on the tones that filled the air .  wet finger on a wineglass .  well  you could start there .  but the finger would have to be finger of a god  on the glass of some celestial sphere .  and the wonderful  complex  shifting tones did not simply fill the air  they were the air .   the moving blur beyond the walls was getting closer now .   it was just beyond the closest wall  then found the open doorway   and vanished .   something was behind lobsang .   he turned .  there was nothing there that he could see  but he felt movement and  for just a moment  something warm brushed his cheek           the sand says     said lu tze  tipping a small bag onto the rock .   the colored grains bounced and spread .  they did not have the sensitivity of the mandala itself  but there was a blue bloom in the chaos .   he gave lobsang a sharp look .      it   s been proved that no one can do what you just did     he said .     we   ve never found any way of detecting where a disturbance in time is actually being caused .         er   sorry .     lobsang raised a hand to his cheek .  it was damp .     er   what did i do .         it takes a huge       lu tze stopped .     ankh morpork   s that way     he said .     did you know that .         no .  anyway  you said you had a feeling things would happen in ankh morpork .         yes  but i   ve had a lifetime of experience and cynicism .     lu tze scooped the sand back into its bag .     you   re just gifted .  come on .      four more seconds  sliced thinly  took them below the snowline  into scree slopes that slid under their feet and then through alder forests not much taller than themselves .  and it was there they met the hunters  gathered around in a wide circle .   the men did not pay them much attention .  monks were commonplace in these parts .  the leader  or at least the one who was shouting  and this is usually the leader  did look up and waved them past .   lu tze stopped  though  and looked amiably at the thing in the center of the circle .  it looked back at him .      good catch     he said .     what   re you going to do now  boys .         is it any business of yours .     said the leader .      no  no  just asking     said lu tze .     you boys up from the lowlands  yes .         yeah .  you   d be amazed at what you can get for catching one of these .         yes     said lu tze .     you would be amazed .     lobsang looked at the hunters .  there was more than a dozen of them  all heavily armed and watching lu tze carefully .      nine hundred dollars for a good pelt and another thousand for the feet     said their leader .      that much  eh .     said lu tze .     that   s a lot of money for a pair of feet .         that   s    cos they   re big feet     said the hunter .     and you know what they say about men with big feet  eh .         they need bigger shoes .         yeah  right     said the hunter  grinning .     load of nonsense  really  but there   s rich old boys with young wives over on the counterweight continent who   ll pay a fortune for a powdered yeti foot .         and there was me thinking they   re a protected species     said lu tze  leaning his broom against a tree .      they   re only a kind of troll .  who   s going to protect them out here .     said the hunter .  behind him  the local guides  who did know rule one  turned and ran .      me     said lu tze .      oh .     said the hunter  and this time the grin was nasty .     you don   t even have a weapon .     he turned to look at the fleeing guides .     you   re one of the weird monks from up in the valleys  aren   t you .         that   s right     said lu tze .     small  grinning  weird monk .  totally unarmed .         and there   s fifteen of us     said the hunter .     well armed  as you can see .         it   s very important that you are all heavily armed     said lu tze  pulling his sleeves out of the way .     it makes it fairer .      he rubbed his hands together .  no one seemed inclined to retreat .      er   any of you boys heard of any rules .     he said after a while .      rules .     said one of the hunters .     what rules .         oh  you know     said lu tze .     rules like   rule two  say  or rule twenty seven .  any kind of rules of that sort of description .      the leading hunter frowned .      what in damnation are you talking about  mister .         er   not so much a    mister    as a small  rather knowing  elderly  entirely unarmed  weird monk     said lu tze .     i   m just wondering if there is anything about this situation that makes you  you know   slightly nervous .         you mean  us being well armed and outnumbering you  and you backing away like that .     said one of the hunters .      ah .  yes     said lu tze .     perhaps we   re up against a cultural thing here .  i know  how about   this .     he stood on one leg  wobbling a little  and raised both hands .     ai .  hai eee .  ho .  ye hi .  no .  anyone .      there was a certain amount of bewilderment among the hunters .      is it a book .     said one who was slightly intellectual .     how many words .         what i   m trying to find out here     said lu tze     is whether you have any idea what happens when a lot of big armed men try to attack a small  elderly  unarmed monk    .         to the best of my knowledge     said the intellectual of the group     he turns out to be a very unlucky monk .      lu tze shrugged .      oh  well     he said     then we   ll just have to try it the hard way .      a blur in the air hit the intellectual on the back of the neck .  the leader stirred to step forward  and learned too late that his bootlaces were tied together .  men reached for knives that were no longer in sheathes  for swords that were inexplicably leaning against a tree on the far side of the clearing .  legs were swept from underneath them  invisible elbows connected with soft parts of their bodies .  blows rained out of empty air .  those who fell down learned to stay that way .  a raised head hurt .   the group was reduced to men lying humbly on the ground  groaning gently .  it was then that they heard a low  rhythmic sound .   the yeti was clapping .  it had to be a slow handclap  because of the creature   s long arms .  but when the hands met  they   d come a long way and were glad to see one another .  they echoed around the mountains .   lu tze reached down and raised the leader   s chin .      if you have enjoyed this afternoon  please tell your friends     he said .     tell them to remember rule one .      he let the chin go  and walked across to the yeti  and bowed .      shall i release you  sir  or would you like to do it yourself .     he said .   the yeti stood up  looked down at the cruel iron trap around one leg  and concentrated for a moment .   at the end of the moment  the yeti was a little way from the trap  which was still set and almost hidden in leaves .      well done     said lu tze .     methodical .  and very smooth .  headed down to the lowlands .      the yeti had to bend double to bring its long face close to lu tze .      yass     it said .      what do you want to do with these people .      the yeti looked around at the cowering hunters .      it bein    daark soon     it said .     no guides noaw .         they   ve got torches     said lu tze .      ha .  ha     said the yeti  and it said it  rather than laughed .     dat   s good .  torches show up aat night .         hah .  yes .  can you give us a lift .  it   s really important .         you and daat whizzin    kid i seein    there .      a patch of gray air at the edge of the clearing became lobsang  out of breath .  he dropped the broken branch he   d been holding .      the lad is called lobsang .  i   m training him up     said lu tze .      looks like you gotta hurry before you runnin    out of things he don   t knoow     said the yeti .     ha .  ha .         sweeper  what were you       lobsang began  hurrying forward .  lu tze put his finger to his lips .     not in front of our fallen friends     he said .     i   m looking for rule one to become a lot better respected in these parts as a result of this day   s work .         but i had to do all the           we must be going     said lu tze  waving him into silence .     i reckon we can snooze quite happily while our friend here carries us .      lobsang glanced up at the yeti and then back to lu tze .  and then back to the yeti .  it was tall .  in some ways it was like the trolls he   d met in the city  but rolled out thin .  it was more than twice as high as he was  and most of the extra height was skinny legs and arms .  the body was a ball of fur  and the feet were indeed huge .      if he could   ve got out of the trap at any       he began .      you are the apprentice  right .     said lu tze .     me  i   m the master .  i   m sure i wrote that down somewhere           but you said you weren   t going to say any of those know it all           remember rule one .  oh  and pick up one of those swords .  we   ll need it in a minute .  okay  y   honor        the yeti picked them up gently and firmly  cradled them in the crook of each arm  and strode away through the snow and trees .      snug  eh .     said lu tze after a while .     their wool is spun out of rock in some way  but it   s pretty comfy .      there was no answer from the other arm .      i spent some time with the yetis     said lu tze .     amazing people .  they taught me a thing or two .  valuable stuff .  for is it not written     we live and learn    .      silence  a kind of sullen  deliberate silence  reigned .      i   d think myself lucky if i was a boy your age actually being carried by an actual yeti .  a lot of people back in the valley have never even seen one .  mind you  they don   t come that close to settlements anymore .  not since that rumor about their feet got around .      lu tze got the feeling that he was taking part in a dialogue of one .      something you want to say  is there .     he said .      well  as a matter of fact  yes there is  actually     said lobsang .     you let me do all the work back there .  you weren   t going to do anything .         i was making sure i had their full attention     said lu tze smoothly .      why .         so that you didn   t have their full attention .  i had every confidence in you  of course .  a good master gives the pupil an opportunity to demonstrate his skills .         and what would you have done if i hadn   t been here  pray .         yes  probably     said lu tze .      what .         but i expect i would have found some way to use their stupidity against them     said lu tze .     there generally is .  is there a problem here .         well  i just   i thought   well  i just thought you   d be teaching me more  that   s all .         i   m teaching you things all the time     said lu tze .     you might not be learning them  of course .         oh  i see     said lobsang .     very smug .  are you going to try to teach me about this yeti  then  and why you made me bring a sword .         you   ll need the sword to learn about yetis     said lu tze .      how .         in a few minutes we   ll find a nice place to stop and you can cut his head off .  is that all right by you  sir .         yass .  sure     said the yeti .      in the second scroll of wen the eternally surprised  a story is written concerning one day when the apprentice clodpool  in a rebellious mood  approached wen and spake thusly      master  what is the difference between a humanistic  monastic system of belief in which wisdom in sought by means of an apparently nonsensical system of questions and answers  and a lot of mystic gibberish made up on the spur of the moment .      wen considered this for some time  and at last said     a fish .      and clodpool went away  satisfied .       tick  the code of the igors was very strict .   never contradict .  it was no part of an igor   s job to say things like    no  thur  that   th an artery .     the marthter was always right .   never complain .  an igor would never say    but that   th a thouthand miles away .      never make personal remarks .  no igor would dream of saying anything like    i thould have thomething done about that laugh  if i wath you .      and never  ever ask questions .  admittedly  igor knew  that meant never ask big questions .     would thur like a cup of tea around now .     was fine  but    what do you need a hundred virginth for .     or    where do you expect me to find a brain at thith time of night .     was not .  an igor stood for loyal  dependable  discreet service with a smile  or at least a sort of lopsided grin  or possibly just a curved scar in the right place .    and  therefore  igor was getting worried .  things were wrong  and when an igor thinks that  they are really wrong .  great difficulty lay in getting this across to jeremy without breaking the code  though .  igor was increasingly ill at ease with someone so clearly stark  staring sane .  nevertheless  he tried .      her ladythip will be along again thith morning     he said  as they watched yet another crystal grow in its solution .  and i know you know that  he thought  because you   ve smoothed your hair down with soap and put on a clean shirt .      yes     said jeremy .     i wish we had better progress to report .  however  i   m sure we   re nearly there now .         yeth  that   th very thtrange  ithn   t it     said igor  seizing the opening .      strange  you say .         call me mithter thilly  thur  but it alwayth theemth to me that we   re alwayth on the point of thuctheth when her ladythip payth uth a vithit  but when the   th gone we experienthe new difficultieth .         what are you suggesting  igor .         me  thur .  i   m not a thuggethtive perthon  thur .  but latht time part of the divider array had cracked .         you know i think that was because of dimensional instability .         yeth  thur .         why are you giving me that funny look  igor .      igor shrugged .  that is  one shoulder was momentarily as high as the other one .     goeth with the fathe  thur .         she   d hardly pay us so handsomely and then sabotage the project  would she .  why would she do that .      igor hesitated .  he had his back right up against the code now .      i am thtill wondering if thhe ith all thhe theemth  thur .         sorry .  i didn   t catch that .         i wonder if we can trutht her  thur     said igor patiently .      oh  go and calibrate the complexity resonator  will you .      grumbling  igor obeyed .   the second time that he   d followed their benefactor she   d gone to a hotel .  next day she   d headed for a large house in kings way  where she   d been met by an oily man who   d made a great play of presenting her with a key .  igor had followed the oleaginous man back to his office in a nearby street where   because there are few things that are kept from a man with a face full of stitches   he   d learned that she   d just bought the lease for a very large bar of gold .   after that  igor had resorted to an ancient ankh morpork tradition and paid someone to follow her ladyship .  there was enough gold in the workshops  heavens knew  and the master took no interest in it .   lady lejean went to the opera .  lady lejean went to art galleries .  lady lejean was living life to the fullest .  except that lady lejean  as far as igor could determine  never visited restaurants and had no food delivered to the house .   lady lejean was up to something .  igor could spot this easily .  lady lejean also did not appear in twurps    peerage or the almanack de gothic or any of the other reference books igor had checked as a matter of course  which meant that she had something to hide .  of course  he had worked for masters who occasionally had a great deal to hide  sometimes in deep holes at midnight .  but this situation was morally different for two reasons .  her ladyship wasn   t his master  jeremy was  and that was where his loyalty lay .  and igor had decided it was morally different .   now he reached the glass clock .   it looked almost complete .  jeremy had designed a mechanism to go behind the face and igor had got it made up  all in glass .  it had nothing whatsoever to do with the other mechanism  which flickered away down behind the pendulum and took up a disconcertingly small amount of room now that it was assembled  quite a few of its parts were no longer sharing the same set of dimensions as the rest of it .  but the clock had a face  and a face needed hands  and so the glass pendulum swung and the glass hands moved and told normal  everyday time .  the    tick    had a slightly bell like quality  as though someone was flicking a wineglass with a fingernail .   igor looked at his hand me down hands .  they were beginning to worry him .   now that the glass clock looked like a clock  they began to shake every time igor came near it .       tick  no one noticed susan in the library of the guild of historians  leafing her way through a pile of books .  occasionally she   d make a note .   she didn   t know if her other gift was from death  but she   d always told the children that they had a lazy eye and a business eye .  there were two ways of looking at the world .  the lazy eye just saw the surface .  the business eye saw through into the reality beneath .   she turned a page .   seen through her business eyes  history was very strange indeed .  the scars stood out .  the history of the country of ephebe was puzzling  for example .  either its famous philosophers lived for a very long time  or inherited their names  or extra bits had been stitched into history there .  the history of omnia was a mess .  two centuries had been folded into one  by the look of it  and it was only because of the mind set of the omnians  whose religion mixed the past and future with the present in any case  that it could possibly have passed unnoticed .   and what about koom valley .  everyone knew that there had been a famous battle there  between dwarfs and trolls and mercenaries on both sides  but how many battles had there actually been .  historians talked about the valley being in just the right place in disputed territory to become more or less the preferred local pitch for all confrontations  but you could just as easily believe   at least you could if you had a grandfather called death   that a patch that just happened to fit had been welded into history several times  so that different generations went round through the whole stupid disaster again and again  shouting    remember koom valley .     as they did so .    there were anomalies everywhere .   and no one had noticed .   you had to hand it to human beings .  they had one of the strangest powers in the universe .  even her grandfather had remarked upon it .  no other species anywhere in the world had invented boredom .  perhaps it was boredom  not intelligence  that had propelled them up the evolutionary ladder .  trolls and dwarfs had it  too  that strange ability to look at the universe and think    oh  the same as yesterday  how dull .  i wonder what happens if i bang this rock on that head .      and along with this had come the contrary power  to make things normal .  the world changed mightily  and within a few days humans considered it was normal .  they had the most amazing ability to shut out and forget what didn   t fit .  they told themselves little stories to explain away the inexplicable  to make things normal .   historians were especially good at it .  if it suddenly looked as though hardly anything had happened in the fourteenth century  they   d weigh in with twenty different theories .  not one of them would be that maybe most of the time had been cut out and pasted into the nineteenth century  where the crash had not left enough coherent time for everything that needed to happen  because it only takes a week to invent the horse collar .   the history monks had done their job well  but their biggest ally was the human ability to think narratively .  and humans had risen to the occasion .  they   d say things like    thursday already .  what happened to the week .     and    time seems to go a lot faster these days    and    it seems like only yesterday        but some things remained .   the monks had carefully wiped out the time when the glass clock had struck .  it had been surgically removed from history .  almost     susan picked up grim fairy tales again .  her parents hadn   t bought her books like this when she was a child .  they   d tried to bring her up normally  they knew that it is not entirely a good idea for humans to be too close to death .   they taught her that facts were more important than fancy .  and then she   d grown up and found out that the real fantasies weren   t the pale rider or the tooth fairy or bogeymen   they were all solid facts .  the big fantasy was that the world was the place where the toast didn   t care if it came butter side down or not  where logic was sensible  and that things could be made not to have happened .   something like the glass clock had been too big to hide .  it had leaked out via the dark hidden labyrinths of the human mind  and had become a folk tale .  people had tried to coat it with sugar and magic swords  but its true nature still lurked like a rake in an overgrown lawn  ready to rise up at the in cautious foot .   now someone was treading on it again  and the point  the key point  was the chin it was rising to meet belonged to        someone like me .   she sat and stared at nothing for a while .  around her  historians climbed library ladders  fumbled books onto their lecterns  and generally rebuilt the image of the past to suit the eyesight of today .  one of them was  in fact  looking for his glasses .   time had a son  she thought  someone who walks in the world .   there was a man who devoted himself to the study of time so wholeheartedly that  for him  time became real .  he learned the ways of time and time noticed him  death has said .  there was something there like love .   and time had a son .   how .  susan had the kind of mind that would sour a narrative with a question like that .  time and a mortal man .  how could they ever   well  how could they .   then she thought  my grandfather is death .  he adopted my mother .  my father was his apprentice for a while .  that   s all that happened .  they were both human  and i turned up in the normal way .  there is no way i should be able to walk through walls and live outside time and be a little bit immortal  but i am  and so this is not an area where logic and  let   s face it  basic biology have any part to play .   in any case  time is constantly creating the future .  the future contains things that didn   t exist in the past .  a small baby should be easy for something   someone that rebuilds the universe once every instant .   susan sighed .  and you had to remember that time probably wasn   t time  in the same way that death wasn   t exactly the same as death and war wasn   t exactly the same as war .  she   d met war  a big fat man with an inappropriate sense of humor and a habit of repeating himself  and he certainly didn   t personally attend every minor fracas .  she disliked pestilence  who gave her funny looks  and famine was just wasted and weird .  none of them ran their   call it their discipline .  they personified it .   given that she   d met the tooth fairy  the soul cake duck  and old man trouble  it amazed susan that she had grown up to be mostly human  nearly normal .   as she stared at her notes  her hair unwound itself from its tight bun and took up its ground state position  which was that of someone who had just touched something highly electrical .  it spread out around her head like a cloud  with one black streak of nearly normal hair .   grandfather might be an ultimate destroyer of worlds and the final truth of the universe  but that wasn   t to say he didn   t take an interest in the little people .  perhaps time did  too .   she smiled .   time waited for no man  they said .   perhaps she   d waited for one  once .   susan was aware that someone was looking at her  turned  and saw the death of rats peering through the lens of the glasses that a mildly distracted man was searching for on the other side of the room .  up on a long disregarded bust of a former historian the raven preened himself .      well .     she said .   squeak .      oh  he is  is he .      the doors of the library were nuzzled open and a white horse walked in .  there is a terrible habit among horsey people to call a white horse    gray     but even one of that bowlegged fraternity would have had to admit that this one  at least  was white   not as white as snow  which is a dead white  but at least as white as milk  which is alive .  his bridle and reins were black  and so was the saddle  but all of them were  in a sense  just for show .  if the horse of death was inclined to let you ride him  then you   d stay on  saddle or no .  and there was no upper limit to the amount of people he could carry .  after all  plagues sometimes happened suddenly .   the historians paid him no attention .  horses did not walk into libraries .   susan mounted .  there were plenty of times when she wished she   d been born completely human and wholly normal .  she   d give up all the immortality tomorrow        apart from binky .   a moment later  four hoofprints glowed like plasma in the air above the museum and faded away .       tick  the crunch crunch of the yeti   s feet over the snow  and the eternal wind of the mountains were the only sounds .   then lobsang said     by    cut off his head     you actually mean    .         sever the head from the body     said lu tze .      and     said lobsang  still in the tones of one carefully exploring every aspect of the haunted cave     he doesn   t mind .         waal  it   s a nuisance     said the yeti .     a bit of a paarty trick .  but it okaay  if it helps .  the sweeper haas alwaays been a goood friend to us .  we owe him faavors .         i   ve tried teaching    em the way     said lu tze proudly .      yaas .  ver    usefuul .     a washed pot never boils        said the yeti .   curiosity vied with annoyance in lobsang   s head  and won .      what have i missed here .     he said .     you don   t die .         i doon   t die .  wit my head cut off .  for laughing .  ho .  ho     said the yeti .     of course i die .  but this is not such a sizeaable traansaaction .         it took us years to work out what the yetis were up to     said lu tze .     their loops played hob with the mandala until the abbot worked out how to allow for them .  they   ve been extinct three times .         three times  eh .     said lobsang .     that   s a lot of times to go extinct .  i mean  most species only manage it once  don   t they .      the yeti was now entering taller forest  of ancient pines .      this   d be a good place     said lu tze .     put us down  sir .         and we   ll chop your head off     said lobsang weakly .     what am i saying .  i   m not going to chop anyone   s head off .         you heard him say it doesn   t bother him     said lu tze  as they were gently lowered to the ground .      that   s not the point .     said lobsang hotly .      it   s his head     lu tze pointed out .      but i mind .         oh  well  in that case     said lu tze     is it not written     if you want a thing done properly you   ve got to do it yourself    .         yass  it is     said the yeti .   lu tze took the sword out of lobsang   s hand .  he held it carefully  like someone unused to weapons .  the yeti obligingly knelt .      you   re up to date .     said lu tze .      yaas .         i cannot believe you   re really doing this .     said lobsang .      interesting     said lu tze .     mrs .  cosmopilite says     seeing is believing    and  strangely enough  the great wen said     i have seen  and i believe .         he brought the sword down and cut off the yeti   s head .       tick  there was a sound rather like a cabbage being sliced in half  and then a head rolled into the basket to cheers and cries of    oh  i say  well done .     from the crowd .  the city of quirm was a nice  peaceful  law abiding place and the city council kept it that way with a penal policy that combined the maximum of deterrence with the minimum of re offending .   gripper    the butcher    smartz .   the late gripper rubbed his neck .      i demand a retrial .     he said .   this may not be a good time  said death .      it couldn   t possibly have been murder because the       the soul of gripper smartz fumbled in its spectral pockets for a ghostly piece of paper  unfolded it and continued  in a voice of those to whom the written word is an uphill struggle        because the balance of my mind was d   dess turbed .      really  said death .  he found it best to let the recently departed get things off their chests .      yes     cos i really  really wanted to kill him  right .  and you can   t tell me that   s a normal frame of mind  right .  he was a dwarf  anyway  so i don   t think that should count as manslaughter .      i understand that was the seventh dwarf you killed  said death .      i   m very prone to being dess turbed     said gripper .     really  it   s me who is the victim here .  all i needed was a bit of understanding  someone to see my point of view for five minutes        what was your point of view .      all dwarfs need a damn good kicking  in my opinion .      ere  you   re death  right .      yes indeed .      i   m a big fan .  i   ve always wanted to meet you  y   know .  i   ve got a tattoo of you on my arm  look here .  done it meself .      the benighted gripper turned at the sound of hooves .  a young woman in black  entirely unregarded by the crowd  who were gathered around the food stalls and souvenir stands and the guillotine  was leading a large white stallion toward them .      and you   ve even got valet parking .     said gripper .     now that   s what i call style .     and with that  he faded .   what a curious person  said death .  ah  susan .  thank you for coming .  our search narrows .      our search .      your search  in fact .      it   s just mine now  is it .      i told you i have something else to attend to .      more important than the end of the world .      it is the end of the world .  the rules say that the horsemen shall ride out .      that old legend .  but you don   t have to do that .      it is one of my functions .  i have to obey the rules .      why .  they   re breaking the rules .      bending them .  they have found a loophole .  i do not have that kind of imagination .   it was like jason and the battle for the stationery cupboard  susan told herself .  you soon learned that    no one is to open the door of the stationery cupboard    was a prohibition that a seven year old simply would not understand .  you had to think and rephrase it in more immediate terms  like    no one  jason  no matter what  no  not even if they thought they heard someone shouting for help  no one   are you paying attention  jason .    is to open the door of the stationery cupboard  or accidentally fall on the door handle so that it opens  or threatens to steal richenda   s teddy bear unless she opens the door of the stationery cupboard  or be standing nearby when a mysterious wind comes out of nowhere and blows the door open all by itself  honestly  it really did  or in any way open  cause to open  ask anyone else to open  jump up and down on the loose floorboard to open  or in any other way seek to obtain entry to the stationery cupboard  jason .         a loophole     said susan .   yes .      well  why can   t you find one  too .      i am the grim reaper .  i do not think people wish me to get   creative .  they would wish me to do the task assigned to me at this time by custom and practice .      and that   s just   riding out .      yes .      where to .      everywhere  i think .  in the meantime  you will need this .   death handed her a lifetimer .   it was one of the special ones  slightly bigger than normal .  she took it reluctantly .  it looked like an hourglass  but all those little glittering shapes tumbling through the pinch were seconds .      you know i don   t like doing the   the whole scythe thing     she said .     it   s not   hey  this is really heavy .      he is lu tze  a history monk .  eight hundred years old .  he has an apprentice .  i have learned this .  but i cannot feel him  i cannot sense him .  he is the one .  binky will take you to the monk  you will find the child .      and then what .      i suspect he will need someone .  when you have found him  let binky go .  i shall need him .   susan   s lips moved as a memory collided with a thought .      to ride out .     she said .     are you really talking about the apocalypse .  are you serious .  no one believes in that sort of thing anymore .      i do .   susan   s jaw dropped .     you   re really going to do that .  knowing everything you know .      death patted binky on the muzzle .   yes  he said .   susan gave her grandfather a sideways look .      hold on  there   s a trick  isn   t there   you   re planning something and you   re not even going to tell me  right .  you   re not really going to just wait for the world to end and celebrate it  are you .      we will ride out .      no .      you will not tell the rivers not to flow .  you will not tell the sun not to shine .  you will not tell me what i should and should not do .      but it   s so       susan   s expression changed  and death flinched .     i thought you cared .      take this also .   without wanting to  susan took a smaller lifetimer from her grandfather .   she may talk to you .      and who is this .      the midwife  said death .  now   find the son .   he faded .   susan looked down at the lifetimer in her hands .  he   s done it to you again  she screamed at herself .  you don   t have to do this and you can put this thing down and you can go back to the classroom and you can be normal again and you just know that you won   t  and so does he     squeak .   the death of rats was sitting between binky   s ears  grasping a lock of the white mane with the general impression of someone anxious to be going .  susan raised a hand to slap him off  and then stopped herself .  instead  she pushed the heavy lifetimer into the rat   s paws .      make yourself useful     she said  grasping the reins and mounting up .     why do i do this .      squeak .      i have not got a nice nature .          tick  there was not  surprisingly  a great deal of blood .  the head rolled into the snow  and the body slowly toppled forward .      now you killed       lobsang began .      just a second     said lu tze .     any moment now        the headless body vanished .  the kneeling yeti turned his head to lu tze  blinked  and said     that stung a biit .         sorry .      lu tze turned to lobsang .     now  hold on to that memory .     he commanded .     it   ll try to vanish  but you   ve had training .  you   ve got to go on remembering that you saw something which now did not happen  understand .  remember that time   s a lot less unbending than people think  if you get your head right .  just a little lesson .  seeing is believing .         how did it do that .         good question .  they can save their life up to a certain point and go back to it if they get killed     said lu tze .     how it   s done   well  the abbot spent the best part of a decade working that one out .  not that anyone else can understand it .  there   s a lot of quantum involved .     he took a pull of his permanent foul cigarette .     gotta be good working out  if no one else can understand it .          how is der abboott dese daays .     said the yeti  getting to its feet again and picking up the pilgrims .      teething .         ah .  reincarnation   s alwaays a problem     said the yeti  falling into its long  ground eating lope .      teeth are the worst  he says .  always coming or going .         how fast are we going .     said lobsang .   the yeti   s stride was more like a continuous series of leaps from one foot to the other  there was so much spring in the long legs that each landing was a mere faint rocking sensation .  it was almost restful .      i reckon we   re doing thirty miles an hour or so  clock time     said lu tze .     get some rest .  we   ll be above copperhead in the morning .  it   s all downhill from there .         coming back from the dead       lobsang murmured .      it   s more like not actually ever going in the first place     said lu tze .     i   ve studied the technique a bit  but   well  unless it   s built in  you have to learn how to do it  and would you want to bet on getting it right first time .  tricky one .  you   d have to be desperate .  i hope i   m never that desperate .          tick  susan recognized the country of lancre from the air  a little bowl of woods and fields perched like a nest on the edge of the ramtop mountains .  and she found the cottage  too  which was not the corkscrew chimneyed compost heap kind of witch   s house popularized by grim fairy tales and other books  but a spanking new one with gleaming thatch and a manicured front lawn .   there were more ornaments   gnomes  toadstools  pink bunnies  big eyed deer   around a tiny pond than any sensible gardener should have allowed .  susan spotted one brightly painted gnome fishi   no  that wasn   t a rod he was holding  was it .  surely a nice old lady wouldn   t put something like that in her garden  would she .  would she .   susan was bright enough to go around to the back  because witches were allergic to front doors .  it was opened by a small  fat  rosy cheeked woman whose little currant eyes said  yep  that   s my gnome all right  and be thankful he   s only widdling in the pond .      mrs .  ogg .  the midwife .      there was a pause before mrs .  ogg said     the very same .         you don   t know me  but       said susan and realized that mrs .  ogg was looking past her at binky  who was standing by the gate .  the woman was a witch  after all .      maybe i do know you     said mrs .  ogg .     o   course  if you just stole that horse  you just don   t know how much trouble you are in .         i borrowed it .  the owner is   my grandfather .      another pause  and it was disconcerting how those friendly little eyes could bore into yours like an auger .      you   d better come in     said mrs .  ogg .   the inside of the cottage was as clean and new as the outside .  things gleamed  and there were a lot of them to gleam .  the place was a shrine to bad but enthusiastically painted china ornaments  which occupied every flat surface .  what space was left was full of framed pictures .  two harassed looking women were polishing and dusting .      i got comp   ny     said mrs .  ogg sternly  and the women left with such alacrity that the word    fled    might have been appropriate .      my daughters in law     said mrs .  ogg  sitting down in a plump armchair which  over the years  had shaped itself to fit her .     they like to help a poor old lady who   s all alone in the world .      susan took in the pictures .  if they were all of family members  mrs .  ogg was head of an army .  mrs .  ogg  unashamedly caught out in a flagrant lie  went on     sit down  girl  and say what   s on your mind .  there   s tea brewing .         i need to know something .         most people do     said mrs .  ogg .     and they can go on wantin    .         i want to know about   a birth     said susan  persevering .      oh  yes .  well  i done hundreds of confinements .  thousands  prob   ly .         i imagine this one was difficult .         a lot of them are     said mrs .  ogg .      you   d remember this one .  i don   t know how it started  but i   d imagine that a stranger came knocking .         oh .     mrs .  ogg   s face became a wall .  the black eyes stared out at susan as if she was an invading army .      you   re not helping me  mrs .  ogg .         that   s right .  i ain   t     said mrs .  ogg .     i think i know about you  miss  but i don   t care who you are  you see .  you can go and get the other one  if you like .  don   t think i ain   t seen him  neither .  i   ve been at plenty of deathbeds  too .  but deathbeds is public  mostly  and birthbeds ain   t .  not if the lady don   t want them to be .  so you get the other one  and i   ll spit in his eye .         this is very important  mrs .  ogg .         you   re right there     said mrs .  ogg firmly .      i can   t say how long ago it was .  it may have been last week  even .  time  that   s the key .      and there it was .  mrs .  ogg was not a poker player  at least against someone like susan .  there was the tiniest flicker of the eyes .   mrs .  ogg   s chair was rammed back in her effort to rise  but susan got to the mantelpiece first and snatched what was there  hidden in plain view among the ornaments .      you give that here .     shouted mrs .  ogg  as susan held it out of her reach .  she could feel the power in the thing .  it seemed to pulse in her hand .      have you any idea what this is  mrs .  ogg .     she said  opening her hand to reveal the little glass bulbs .      yes  it   s an egg timer that don   t work .     mrs .  ogg sat down hard in her overstuffed chair  so that her little legs rose off the floor for a moment .      it looks to me like a day  mrs .  ogg .  a day   s worth of time .      mrs .  ogg glanced at susan  and then at the little hourglass in her hand .      i reckoned there was something odd about it     she said .     the sand don   t go through when you tip it up  see .         that   s because you don   t need it to yet  mrs .  ogg .      nanny ogg appeared to relax .  once again susan reminded herself that she was dealing with a witch .  they tended to keep up .      i kept it    cos it was a gift     said the old lady .     and it looks so pretty  too .  what do them letters around the edge say .      susan read the words etched on the metal base of the lifetimer  tempus redux .        time returned        she said .      ah  that   d be it     said mrs .  ogg .     the man did say i   d be repaid for my time .         the man    .     said susan gently .   nanny ogg glanced up  her eyes ablaze .      don   t you try to take advantage of me just    cos i   m momentr   y a bit flustered     she snapped .     there   s no way around nanny ogg .      susan looked at the woman  and this time not with the lazy eye .  and there was  indeed  no way around mrs .  ogg .  but there was another way  with mrs .  ogg .  it went straight through the heart .      a child needs to know his parents  mrs .  ogg     she said .     now more than ever .  he needs to know who he really is .  it   s going to be hard for him  and i want to help him .         why .         because i wish someone had helped me     said susan .      yes  but there   s rules to midwifery     said nanny ogg .     you don   t say what was said or what you saw .  not if the lady don   t want you to .      the witch wriggled awkwardly in her chair  her face going red .  she wants to tell me  susan knew .  she   s desperate to .  but i   ve got to play it right  so she can square it with herself .      i   m not asking for names  mrs .  ogg  because i expect you don   t know them     she went on .      that   s true .         but the child           look  miss  i   m not supposed to tell a living soul about           if it helps  i   m not entirely certain that i am one     said susan .  she watched mrs .  ogg for a while .     but i understand .  there have to be rules  don   t there .  thank you for your time .      susan stood up and put the preserved day back on the mantelpiece .  then she walked out of the cottage  shutting the door behind her .  binky was still waiting by the gate .  she mounted up  and it wasn   t until then that she heard the door open behind her .      that   s what he said     said mrs .  ogg .     when he gave me the egg timer .     thank you for your time  mrs .  ogg     he said .  you   d better come back in  my girl .          tick  death found pestilence in a hospice in llamedos .  pestilence liked hospitals .  there was always something for him to do .   currently he was trying to remove the    now wash your hands    sign over a cracked basin .  he looked up .      oh  it   s you     he said .     soap .  i   ll give    em soap .      i sent out the call  said death .      oh .  yes .  right .  yes     said pestilence  clearly embarrassed .   you   ve still got your horse .      of course  but        you had a fine horse .      look  death   it   s   look  it   s not that i don   t see your point  but   excuse me       pestilence stepped aside as a white robed nun  completely oblivious of the two horsemen  passed between them .  but he took the opportunity to breathe in her face .      just a mild flu     he said  catching death   s expression .   so we can count on you  can we .      to ride out        yes .      for the big one    .      it   s expected of us .      how many of the others have you got .      you are the first .      er        death sighed .  of course  there had been plenty of diseases  long before humans had been around .  but humans had definitely created pestilence .  they had a genius for crowding together  for poking around in jungles  for setting the midden so handily next to the well .  pestilence was  therefore  part human  with all that this entailed .  he was frightened .   i see  death said .      the way you put it        you are afraid .      i   ll   think about it .      yes .  i am sure you will .       tick  quite a lot of brandy splashed into mrs .  ogg   s mug .  she waved the bottle vaguely at susan  with an inquiring look .      no  thank you .         fair enough .  fair enough .     nanny ogg put the bottle aside and took a draught of the brandy as though it was beer .      a man came knocking     she said .     three times he came  in my life .  last time was  oh  maybe ten days ago .  same man every time .  he wanted a midwife           ten days ago .     said susan .     but the child   s at least sixt       she stopped .      ah  you   ve got it     said mrs .  ogg .     i could see you was bright .  time didn   t matter to him .  he wanted the best midwife .  and it was like  he   d found out about me  but got the date wrong  just like you or me could knock on the wrong door .  can you understand what i mean .         more than you think     said susan .      the third time      another gulp at the brandy      he was in a bit of a state     said mrs .  ogg .     that   s how i knew he was just a man  despite everything that happened after .  it was because he was panicking  to tell you the truth .  pregnant fathers often panic .  he was going on about me coming right away and how there was no time .  he had all the time in the world  he just wasn   t thinking properly     cos husbands never do when the time comes .  they panic     cos it ain   t their world anymore .         and what happened next .     said susan .      he took me in his  well  it was like one of them old chariots  he took me to       mrs .  ogg hesitated .     i   ve seen a lot of strange things in my life  i   ll have you know     she said  as if preparing the ground for a revelation .      i can believe it .         it was a castle made of glass .     mrs .  ogg gave susan a look that dared her to disbelieve .  susan decided to hurry things up .      mrs .  ogg  one of my earliest memories is of helping to feed the pale horse .  you know .  the one outside .  the horse of death .  his name is binky .  so please don   t keep stopping .  there is practically no limit to the things i find normal .         there was a woman   well  eventually there was a woman     said the witch .     can you imagine someone exploding into a million pieces .  yes  i expect you can .  well  imagine it happening the other way .  there   s a mist and it   s all flying together and then  whoosh  there   s a woman .  then  whoosh  back into a mist again .  and all the time  this noise       mrs .  ogg ran her finger around the edge of the brandy glass  making it hum .      a woman kept   incarnating and then disappearing again .  why .         because she was frightened  of course .  first time  see .     mrs .  ogg grinned .     i person   ly never had any problems in that area but i   ve been at a lot of births when it   s all new to the girl and she   ll be frightened as hell and when push comes to shove  if you take my meaning  old midwifery term there  she   ll be yellin    and swearin    at the father and i reckon that she   d give anything to be somewhere else .  well  this lady could be somewhere else .  we   d have been in a real pickle if it wasn   t for the man  as it turned out .         the man that brought you .         he was kind of foreign  you know .  like the hub people .  bald as a coot .  i remember thinking     you look like a young man  mister  but you look like you   ve been a young man for a long  long time if i   m any judge .     normally i wouldn   t have any man there  but he sat and talked to her in his foreign lingo and sang her songs and little poems and soothed her  and back she came  out of thin air  and i was ready and it was one  two  done .  and then she was gone .  except that she was still there  i think .  in the air .         what did she look like .     said susan .   mrs .  ogg gave her a look .      you   ve got to remember the view i got where i was sitting     she said .     the kind of description i might give you ain   t a thing anyone   d put on a poster  if you understand me .  and no woman looks at her best at a time like that .  she was young  she had dark hair        mrs .  ogg refilled her brandy glass  and this meant the pause went on for some time     and she was old  too  if you   re after the truth of it .  not old like me .  i mean old .      she stared at the fire .      old like darkness and stars     she said  to the flames .      the boy was left outside the thieves    guild     said susan  to break the silence .     i suppose they thought that with gifts like that he   d be all right .         he .     said mrs .  ogg .     why he .  why are you talking about he .          tick  lady lejean was being strong .   she   d never realized how much humans were controlled by their bodies .  the thing nagged night and day .  it was always too hot  too cold  too empty  too full  too tired     the key was discipline  she was sure .  auditors were immortal .  if she couldn   t tell her body what to do  she didn   t deserve to have one .  bodies were a major human weakness .   senses  too .  the auditors had hundreds of senses  since every possible phenomenon had to be witnessed and recorded .  she could only find five available now .  five ought to be easy to deal with .  but they were wired directly into the rest of the body .  they didn   t just submit information  they made demands .   she   d walked past a stall selling roasted meats and her mouth had started to drool .  the sense of smell wanted the body to eat without consulting the brain .  but that wasn   t the worst part .  the brain itself did its own thinking .   that was the hardest part .  the bag of soggy tissue behind the eyes worked away independently of its owner .  it took in information from the senses  and checked them against memory  and presented options .  sometimes the hidden parts of it even fought for control of the mouth .  humans weren   t individuals  they were  each one  a committee .   some of the other members of the committee were dark and red and entirely uncivilized .  they had joined the brain before civilization  some of them had got aboard even before humanity .  and the bit that did the joined up thinking had to fight  in the darkness of the brain  to get the casting vote .   after little more than a couple of weeks as a human  the entity that was lady lejean was having real trouble .   food  for example .  auditors did not eat .  they recognized that feeble life forms had to consume one another to obtain energy and body building material .  the process was astonishingly inefficient  however  and her ladyship had tried assembling nutrients directly out of the air .  this worked  but the process felt   what was the word .  oh  yes   creepy .   besides  part of the brain didn   t believe it was getting fed and insisted that it was hungry .  its incessant nagging interfered with her thought processes and so  despite everything  she   d had to face up to the whole  well  the whole orifices business .   the auditors had known about these for a long time .  the human body appeared to have up to eight of them .  one didn   t seem to work and the rest appeared to be multifunctional  although surprisingly there seemed to be only one thing that could be done by the ears .   so yesterday she   d tried a piece of dry toast .   it had been the single worst experience of her existence .   it had been the single most intense experience of her existence .   it had been something else  too .  as far as she could understand the language  it had been enjoyable .   it seemed that the human sense of taste was quite different to the sense employed by an auditor .  that was precise  measured  analytical .  but the human sense of taste was like being hit in the mouth by the whole world .  it had been half an hour of watching fireworks in her head before she remembered to swallow .   how did humans survive this .   she   d been fascinated by the art galleries .  it was clear that some humans could present reality in a way that made it even more real  that spoke to the viewer  that seared the mind   but what could possibly transcend the knowledge that the genius of an artist had to poke alien substances into his face .  could it be that humans had got used to it .  and that was only the start     the sooner the clock was finished  the better .  a species as crazy as this couldn   t be allowed to survive .  she was visiting the clockmaker and his ugly assistant every day now  giving them as much help as she dared  but they always seemed one vital step away from completion     amazing .  she could even lie to herself .  because another voice in her head  which was part of the dark committee  said  you   re not helping  are you  you   re stealing parts and twisting parts   and you go back every day because of the way he looks at you  don   t you     parts of the internal committee that were so old they didn   t have voices  only direct control of the body  tried to interfere at this point .  and she tried to put them out of her mind .   and now she had to face the other auditors .  they would be punctual .   she pulled herself together .  water had taken to running out of her eyes lately for no reason at all .  she did the best she could with her hair  and made her way to the large drawing room .   grayness was already filling the air .  in this space  there was no room for too many auditors  but that did not really matter .  one could speak for all .   lady lejean found the corners of her mouth turned up automatically as nine of them appeared .  nine was three threes  and the auditors liked threes .  two would keep an eye on the other one .  each two would keep an eye on each other one .  they don   t trust themselves  said one of her voices in her head .  another voice cut in  it   s we  we don   t trust ourselves .  and she thought  oh  yes .  we  not they .  i must remember i   m a we .   an auditor said  why is there no further progress .   the corners of the mouth turned down again .      there have been minor problems of precision and alignment     said lady lejean .  she found that her hands were rubbing themselves together slowly  and wondered why .  she hadn   t told them to .   auditors had never needed body language  so they didn   t understand it .   one said  what is the nature of     but another one cut in with  why are you dwelling in this building .  the voice was tinted with suspicion .      the body requires one to do things that cannot be done on the street     said lady lejean and  because she   d got to know something about ankh morpork  she added     at least  on many streets .  also  i believe the servant of the clockmaker is suspicious .  i have allowed the body to yield to gravity  since that is what it was designed for .  it is as well to give the appearance of humanity .      one  and it was the same one  said  and what is the meaning of these .   it had noticed the paints and the easel .  lady lejean wished fervently that she   d remembered to put them away .   the one said  you are making an image with pigments .      yes .  very badly  i am afraid .      one said  for what reason .      i wished to see how humans do it .      one said  that is simple  the eye receives the input  the hand applies the pigment .      that   s what i thought  but it appears to be much more complex than that        the one who had raised the question of the painting drifted toward one of the chairs and said  and what is this .      it is a cat .  it arrived .  it does not appear to wish to depart .      the cat  a feral ginger tom  flicked a serrated ear and curled up in a tighter ball .  anything that could survive in ankh morpork   s alleys  with their abandoned swamp dragons  dog packs  and furriers    agents  was not about to open even one eye for a bunch of floating nightdresses .   the one who was now getting on lady lejean   s nerves said  and the reason for its presence .      it appears to tolerate the company of hum   of apparent humans  asking nothing in return but food  water  shelter  and comfort     said lady lejean .     this interests me .  our purpose is to learn  and thus i have  as you can see  begun .     she hoped it sounded better to them than it did to her .   one said  when will the clock problems you spoke of be resolved .      oh  soon .  very soon .  yes .      the one that was beginning to terrify lady lejean said  we wonder  is it possible that you are slowing the work in some way .   lady lejean felt a prickling on her forehead .  why was it doing that .      no .  why should i slow the work .  there would be no logic to it .      one said  hmm .   and an auditor did not say    hmm    by accident .     hmm    had a very precise meaning .   it went on  you are making moisture on your head .      yes .  it   s a body thing .      one said  yes .  and that  too  had a very specific and ominous meaning .   one said  we wonder if too long a time in a solid body weakens resolve .  also  we find it hard to see your thoughts .      body again  i am afraid .  the brain is a very imprecise instrument .     lady lejean got control of her hands at last .   one said  yes .   another said  when water fills a jug  it takes the shape of the jug .  but the water is not the jug  nor is the jug the water .      of course     said lady lejean .  and  inside  a thought that she hadn   t known she was thinking  a thought that turned up out of the darkness behind the eyes  said  we are the most stupid creatures in the universe .   one said  it is not good to act alone .   she said     of course .     and once again  a thought emerged from the darkness  i   m in trouble now .   one said  and therefore  you will have companions .  no blame attaches .  one should never be alone .  together  resolve is strengthened .   motes began to twinkle in the air .   lady lejean   s body backed away automatically and  when she saw what was forming  she backed it away further .  she had seen humans in all states of life and death  but seeing a body being spun out of raw matter was curiously disquieting when you were currently inhabiting a similar one .  it was one of those times when the stomach did the thinking  and thought it wanted to throw up .   six figures took shape  blinked  and opened their eyes .  three of the figures were male  three were female .  they were dressed in human sized equivalents of the auditors    robes .   the remaining auditors drew back  but one said  they will accompany you to the clockmaker  and matters will be resolved today .  they will not eat or breathe .   hah .  thought one of the little voices that made up lady lejean   s thinking .   one of the figures whimpered .      the body will breathe     said her ladyship .     you will not persuade it that air is not required .      she was aware of the choking noises .      you are thinking  yes  we can exchange necessary materials with the outside world  and this is true     she went on .     but the body does not know that .  it thinks it is dying .  let it breathe .      there was a series of gasps .      and you will feel better shortly     said her ladyship  and was enthralled to hear the inner voice think  these are your jailers  and you are already stronger than them .   one of the figures felt its face with a clumsy hand and  panting  said     whom do you speak to with your mouth .         you     said lady lejean .      us .         this will take some explaining           no     said the auditor .     danger lies that way .  we believe the body imposes a method of thought on the brain .  no blame attaches .  it is a   malfunction .  we will accompany you to the clockmaker .  we will do this now .         not in those clothes     said lady lejean .     you will frighten him .  it may lead to irrational actions .      there was a moment of silence .  the auditors made flesh looked hopelessly at one another .      you have to talk with your mouth     lady lejean prompted .     the minds stay inside the head .      one said     what is wrong with these clothes .  it is a simple shape found in many human cultures .      lady lejean walked to the window .      see the people down there .     she said .     you must dress in appropriate city fashions .      reluctantly  the auditors did so  and while they retained the grayness  they did give themselves clothes that would pass unnoticed in the street .  up to a point  anyway .      only those of female appearance should wear dresses     lady lejean pointed out .   a hovering gray shape said  warning .  danger .  the one calling itself lady lejean may give unsafe advice .  warning .      understood     said one of the incarnate ones .     we know the way .  we will lead .      it walked into the door .   the auditors clustered around the door for a while  and then one of them glared at lady lejean  who smiled .      doorknob     she said .   the auditor turned back to the door  stared at the brass knob  and then looked the door up and down .  it dissolved into dust .      doorknob was simpler     said lady lejean .       tick  there were big mountains around the hub .  but the ones towering above the temple didn   t all have names  because there was simply too many of them .  only gods have enough time to name all the pebbles on a beach  but gods don   t have the patience .   copperhead was small enough to be big enough to have a name .  lobsang awoke and saw its crooked peak  towering above the lesser local mountains  outlined against the sunrise .   sometimes the gods have no taste at all .  they allow sunrises and sunsets in ridiculous pink and blue hues that any professional artist would dismiss as the work of some enthusiastic amateur who   d never looked at a real sunset .  this was one of those sunrises .  it was the kind of sunrise a man rises and looks at and says     no real sunrise could paint the sky surgical appliance pink .      nevertheless  it was beautiful .    he was half covered in a pile of dry bracken .  there was no sign of the yeti .   it was springtime here .  there was still snow  but there was the occasional patch of bare soil and a hint of green .  lobsang stared around and saw leaves in bud .   lu tze was standing some way off  staring up into a tree .  he didn   t turn his head as lobsang approached .      where   s the yeti .         he wouldn   t go further than this .  can   t ask a yeti to leave snow     whispered lu tze .      oh     whispered lobsang .     er   why are we whispering .         look at the bird .      it was perched on a branch by a fork in the tree  next to what looked like a birdhouse  and nibbling at a piece of roughly round wood it held in one claw .      must be an old nest they   re repairing     said lu tze .     can   t have got that advanced this early in the season .         looks like some kind of an old box to me     said lobsang .  he squinted to see better .     is it an old   clock .     he added .      look at what the bird is nibbling     suggested lu tze .      well  it looks like   a crude gearwheel .  but why           well spotted .  that  lad  is a clock cuckoo .  a young one  by the look of it  trying to build a nest that   ll attract a mate .  not much chance of that   see .  it got the numerals all wrong and it   s stuck the hands on crooked .         a bird that builds clocks .  i thought a cuckoo clock was a clock with a mechanical cuckoo  which came out when           and where do you think people got such a strange idea from .         but that   s some kind of miracle .         why .     said lu tze .     they barely go for more than half an hour  they keep lousy time  and the poor dumb males go frantic trying to keep them wound .         but even to           everything happens somewhere  i suppose     said lu tze .     not worth making too much of a fuss .  got any food left .         no .  we finished it last night     said lobsang .  he added  hopefully     er   i heard tell that really advanced monks can live on the  er  life force in the actual air itself           only on the planet sausage  i expect     said lu tze .     no  we   ll skirt copperhead and find something in the valleys on the other side .  let   s go  there   s not much time        but time enough to watch a bird  thought lobsang  as he let the world around him become blue and fade  and the thought was comforting .   it was easier going without the snow on the ground  provided he avoided the strange resistance offered by bushes and long grass .  lu tze walked on ahead  looking oddly colorful and unreal against the faded landscape .   they went past the entrance to dwarf mines  but saw no one above ground .  lobsang was glad of that .  the statues that he had seen in the villages yesterday weren   t dead  he knew  but merely frozen at a different speed of time .  lu tze had forbidden him to go near anyone  but he needn   t have bothered .  walking around the living statues was invasive  somehow .  it made it worse when you realized that they were moving  but very  very slowly     the sun had barely moved from the horizon when they came down through warmer woods on the rim side of the mountain .  here the landscape had a more domesticated air .  it was woodland rather than forest .  the game trail they   d been following crossed a creek at a point where there were cart tracks  old but still not overgrown .   lobsang looked behind him after he   d walked across the ford  and watched the water very slowly reclaim the shape of his footprints in the stream .   he   d been trained in time slicing on the snowfields above the valley  like the rest of the novices .  that was so they couldn   t come to any harm  the monks had said  although no one actually explained what harm they might come to .  outside the monastery  this was the first time lobsang had sliced in a living landscape .   it was marvelous .  birds hung in the sky .  early morning bumblebees hovered over the opening flowers .  the world was a crystal made of living things .   lobsang slowed near a group of deer cropping the grass  and watched as the nearest eye of one of them swiveled  with geological slowness  to watch him .  he saw the skin move as the muscles underneath started to bunch for flight        time for a smoko     said lu tze .   the world around lobsang speeded up .  the deer fled  along with the magic of the moment .      what   s a smoko .     said lobsang .  he was annoyed .  the quiet slow world had been fun .      you ever been to fourecks .         no .  there   s a barman at the bunch of grapes from there  though .      lu tze lit one of his skinny cigarettes .      don   t mean much     he said .     the barman everywhere is from there .  strange country .  big time source right in the middle  very useful .  time and space all tangled up .  probably all that beer .  nice place  though .  now   you see that country down there .      on one side of the clearing the ground fell away steeply  showing treetops and  beyond  a small patchwork of fields tucked into a fold in the mountains .  in the distance was a gorge  and lobsang thought he could make out a bridge across it .      doesn   t look much like a country     he said .     looks more like a shelf .         that   s witch country     said lu tze .     and we   re going to borrow a broomstick .  quickest way to ankh morpork .  only way to travel .         isn   t that   er  interfering with history .  i mean  i was told that sort of thing is all right up in the valleys  but down here in the world           no  it   s absolutely forbidden     said lu tze        cos it   s interfering with history .  got to be careful of your witch  of course .  some of them are pretty canny .     he caught lobsang   s expression .     look  that   s why there   s rules  understand .  so that you think before you break    em .         but        lu tze sighed and pinched out the end of his cigarette .      we   re being watched     he said .   lobsang spun around .  there were only trees  and insects buzzing in the early morning air .      up there     said lu tze .   there was a raven perched on the broken crown of a pine tree  shattered in some winter storm .  it looked at them looking at it .      caw .     it said .      it   s just a raven     said lobsang .     there   s lots of them in the valley .         it was watching us when we stopped for tea .         there   s ravens all over the mountains  sweeper .         and when we met the yeti     lu tze persisted .      that settles it  then .  it   s coincidence .  one raven couldn   t move that fast .         maybe it   s a special raven     said lu tze .     anyway  it   s not one of our mountain ravens .  it   s a lowland raven .  mountain ravens croak .  they don   t caw .  why   s it so interested in us .         it   s a bit   weird  thinking you   re being followed by a bird     said lobsang .      when you get to my age you notice things in the sky     said lu tze .  he shrugged  and gave a grin .     you start worrying they might be vultures .      they faded into time  and vanished .   the raven ruffled its feathers .      croak .     it said .     damn .          tick  lobsang felt around under the thatched eaves of the cottage  and his hand closed on the bristles of a broomstick that had been thrust among the reeds .      this is rather like stealing     he said  as lu tze helped him down .      no  it   s not     said the sweeper  taking the broomstick and holding it up so he could look along its length .     and i   ll tell you why .  if we sort things out  we   ll drop it off on our way back and she   ll never know it   s gone   and if we don   t sort things out  well  she   ll still never know it   s gone .  honestly  they don   t take much care of their sticks  witches .  look at the bristles on this one .  i wouldn   t use it to clean a pond .  oh  well   back into clock time  lad  i   d hate to fly one of these things while i was slicing        he straddled the stick and gripped the handle .  it rose a little way .      good suspension  at least     he said .     you can have the comfy seat on the back .  hold tight to my own broom and make sure you wrap your robe around you .  these things are pretty breezy .      lobsang pulled himself aboard and the stick rose .  as it drew level with the lower branches around the clearing  it brought lu tze to eye level with a raven .   it shifted uneasily and turned its head this way and that  trying to fix both eyes on him .      are you going to caw or croak  i wonder     said lu tze  apparently to himself .      croak     said the raven .      so you   re not the raven we saw on the other side of the mountain  then .         me .  gosh  no     said the raven .     it   s croaking territory over here .         just checking .      the broom rose higher and set off above the trees in a hubward direction .   the raven ruffled his feathers  and blinked .      damn .     he said .  he shuffled around the tree to where the death of rats was sitting .   squeak .      look  if you want me to do this undercover work you   ve got to get me a book on ornithology  okay .     said quoth .     let   s go  or i   ll never keep up .          tick  death found famine in a restaurant in genua .  he had a booth all to himself and was eating duck and dirty rice .      oh     said famine .     it   s you .      yes .  we must ride .  you must have got my message .      pull up a chair     famine hissed .     they do a very good alligator sausage here .      i said  we must ride .      why .      death sat down and explained .  famine listened  although he never stopped eating .      i see     he said at last .     thank you  but i think i shall sit this one out .      sit it out .  you   re a horseman .      yes  of course .  but what is my role here .      i beg your pardon .      no famine appears to be involved  does it .  a shortage of food per se .  as such .      well  no .  not as such  obviously  but        so i would  as it were  be turning up just to wave .  no  thank you .      you used to ride out every time  said death accusingly .   famine waved a bone airily .     we had proper apocalypses in those days     he said and sucked at the bone .     you could sink your teeth into them .      nevertheless  this is the end of the world .   famine pushed his plate aside and opened the menu .      there are other worlds     he said .     you   re too sentimental  death .  i   ve always said so .      death drew himself up .  humans had created famine  too .  oh  there had always been droughts and locusts  but for a really good famine  for fertile land to be turned into a dust bowl by stupidity and avarice  you needed humans .  famine was arrogant .   i am sorry  death said  to have trespassed on your time .   he went outside  into the crowded street  all alone .       tick  the stick swooped down toward the plains and leveled off a few hundred feet above the ground .      we   re on our way now .     shouted lu tze  pointing ahead .   lobsang looked down at a slim wooden tower hung with complicated boxes .  there was another one in the far distance  a toothpick in the morning mist .      semaphore towers .     lu tze shouted .     ever seen them .         only in the city .     lobsang shouted above the slipstream .      it   s the grand trunk .     the sweeper shouted back .     runs like an arrow all the way to the city .  all we have to do is follow it .      lobsang clung on .  there was no snow beneath them and it looked as though spring was well advanced .  and therefore it was unfair that here  that much nearer the sun  the air was frigid and was being driven into his flesh by the wind of their travel .      it   s very cold up here .         yes .  did i tell you about the double knit combinations .         yes .         i   ve got a spare pair in my sack  you can have them when we stop .         your own personal pair .         yes .  second best but well darned .         no  thank you .         they   ve been washed .         lu tze .         yes .         why can   t we slice when we   re on this thing .      the tower was well past them .  the next one was pencilsized already .  the two toned shutters on the boxes were twinkling in the sunlight .      do you know what happens if you slice time on a magically powered vehicle traveling at more than seventy miles an hour .         no .         me neither .  and i don   t want to find out .          tick  igor opened the door before the second knock .  an igor might be filling coffins with earth in the cellar  or up on the roof adjusting the lightning conductor  but a caller never had to knock twice .      ladythip     he muttered  nodding his head .  he looked blankly at the six figures behind her .      we have called to inspect progress     said lady lejean .      and thethe ladieth and gentlemen  ladythip .         my associates     said her ladyship  matching igor   s blank stare .      if you will be tho kind ath to thtep inthide  i will thee if the marthter ith in     said igor  observing the convention that a true butler never knows the whereabouts of anyone in the house until they decide they want it to be known .   he backed through the door into the workshop and then lurched into the kitchen  where jeremy was calmly pouring a spoonful of medicine down the sink .      that woman ith here     he said     and thhe hath brought lawyerth .      jeremy held out a hand  palm downward  and examined it critically .      you see  igor .     he said .     here we are  almost at the completion of our great work  and i remain absolutely calm .  you could build a house on my hand  it is so steady .         lawyerth  thur     said igor  giving the word some extra spin .      and .         well  we have had a lot of money     said igor with the conviction of a man who informally secreted a small but sensible amount of gold in his own bag .      and we have finished the clock     said jeremy  still watching his hand .      we   ve been nearly finithed for dayth     said igor darkly .     if it wathn   t for her  i reckon we could   ve caught that thunderthtorm two dayth ago .         when   s the next one .      igor screwed up his face and banged the side of his temple a couple of times with the palm of his hand .      unthettled conditionth with a low approaching from the rim     he said .     can   t promith anything with the thloppy weather you get here .  hah  back home the thunderthtormth come running as thoon as they thee you put up the iron pole .  tho what do you want me to do about the lawyerth .         show them in  of course .  we have nothing to hide .         are you thure  thur .     said igor  whose carpetbag couldn   t be lifted with one hand .      please do it  igor .      jeremy smoothed down his hair while the grumbling igor disappeared into the shop and returned with the guests .      lady lejean  thur .  and some other   people     said igor .      it is good to see you  your ladyship     said jeremy  smiling glassily .  he vaguely remembered something he had read .     won   t you introduce me to your friends .      lady lejean gave him a nervous look .  oh  yes   humans always needed to know names .  and he was smiling again .  it made it so hard to think .      mr .  jeremy  these are my   associates     she said .     mr .  black .  mr .  green .  miss brown .  miss white .  miss   yellow .  and mr .  blue .      jeremy held out his hand .     i am pleased to meet you     he said .   six pairs of eyes looked uncomprehendingly at the hand .      the custom here is to shake hands     said her ladyship .   in unison  the auditors extended a hand and wiggled it slowly in the air .      the hand of the other person     said her ladyship .  she gave jeremy a thin lipped smile .     they are foreigners     she said .   and she recognized the panic in their eyes  even if they didn   t .  we can count the number and types of atom in this room  they were thinking .  how can there be anything in here we cannot understand .   jeremy managed to catch one wavering hand in his .     and you are mr .     .      the auditor turned worried eyes on lady lejean .      mr .  black     she said .      i understood that we were mr .  black     said another male shaped auditor .      no  you are mr .  green .         nevertheless  we would prefer mr .  black .  we are the senior  and black is a more significant shade .  we do not wish to be mr .  green .         the translation of your names is not  i think  important     said lady lejean .  she gave jeremy another smile .     they are my accountants     she added  some reading on her part having suggested that this might excuse most oddities .      you see  igor .     said jeremy .     they are simply accountants .      igor grimaced .  where his baggage was concerned  accountants were probably worse news than lawyers .      gray would be acceptable     said mr .  green .      nevertheless  you are mr .  green .  we are mr .  black .  it is a matter of status .         if that is the case     said miss white     white is higher status than black .  black is absence of color .         the point is valid     said mr .  black .     therefore we are now mr .  white .  you are now miss red .         you previously indicated that you were mr .  black .         new information indicates a change of position .  this does not indicate incorrectness of said previous position .      it   s happening already  thought lady lejean .  it   s in the darkness where your eyes can   t see .  the universe becomes two halves  and you live in the half behind the eyes .  once you have a body  you have a    me .      i have seen galaxies die .  i have watched atoms dance .  but until i had the dark behind the eyes  i didn   t know the death from the dance .  and we were wrong .  when you pour water into a jug  it becomes jug shaped and it is not the same water anymore .  an hour ago they never dreamed of having names  and now they are arguing about them     and they can   t hear what i think .   she wanted more time .  the habits of a billion years don   t yield entirely to a mouthful of dry toast  and she could see that a crazy life form like humanity should not be allowed to exist .  yes  indeed .  certainly .  of course .   but she wanted more time .   they should be studied .  yes  studied .   there should be   reports .  yes .  reports .  full reports .  long  long full reports .   caution .  that was it .  that was the word .  auditors loved that word .  always put off until tomorrow something which  tomorrow  you could put off until  let   s say  next year .   it has to be said that lady lejean was not herself at this point .  she didn   t quite have a herself to be .  the other six auditors   in time  yes  they   d think the same way .  but there wasn   t time .  if only she could persuade them to eat something that would   yes  that would bring them to their senses .  there seemed to be no food around  though .   she could see a very large hammer on the bench .      how is progress  mr .  jeremy .     she said  walking over to the clock .  igor moved very fast  and stood almost protectively next to the glass pillar .   jeremy hurried foward .     we have carefully aligned all the systems              again       igor growled .      yes  again           theveral timeth  in fact     igor added .      and now we simply await the right weather conditions .         but i thought you stored lightning .      her ladyship indicated the greenish glass cylinders bubbling and hissing along the wall of the workshop .  just by the bench with  yes  the hammer on it .  and no one could read her thoughts .  the power .      there will easily be enough to keep the mechanism working  but to start the clock will require what igor calls a jump     said jeremy .   igor held up two crocodile clips the size of his head .         th   right     he said .     but you hardly ever get the right kind of thunderthtormth down here .  thould   ve built thith in uberwald  i keep thaying .         what is the nature of this delay .     said   possibly   mr .  white .      we need a thunderstorm  sir .  for the lightning     said jeremy .  lady lejean stepped back  a little closer to the bench .      well .  arrange one     said mr .  white .      hah  well  if we were in uberwald  of courthe           it is merely a matter of pressures and potentials     said mr .  white .     can you not simply create one .      igor gave him a look of disbelief mixed with respect .      you   re not from uberwald  are you .     he said .  then he gasped  and banged the side of his head .      hey  i felt that one     he said .     whoopth .  how did you do that .  preththure dropping like a thtone .      sparks glittered along his black fingernails .  he beamed .      i   ll jutht go and raithe the lightning rod     he said  hurrying to a pulley system on the wall .   lady lejean turned on the others .  this time she wished they could read her thoughts .  she didn   t know enough pronounceable human swearwords .      that is against the rules .     she hissed .      mere expediency     said mr .  white .     if you had not been   lax  this would have been concluded by now .         i counseled further study .         unnecessary .         is there a problem .     said jeremy  in the diffident voice he used for conversations not involving clocks .      the clock should not be started yet .     said lady lejean  not taking her eyes off the other auditors .      but you asked me   we   ve been   it   s all set up .         there may be   problems .  i think we should see another week of testing .      but there weren   t problems  she knew .  jeremy had built the thing as if he   d built a dozen like it before .  it had been all lady lejean could do to spin things out this long  especially with the igor watching her like a hawk .      what is your    name     young person .     said mr .  white to jeremy .  the clockmaker backed away .      jeremy     he said     and i   i don   t understand  mr .   er  white .  a clock tells the time .  a clock isn   t dangerous .  how can a clock be a problem .  it   s a perfect clock .         then start it .         but her ladyship        the door knocker thundered .      igor .     said jeremy .      yeth  thur .     said igor from the hallway .      how did the servant person get there .     said mr .  white  still watching her ladyship .      it   s a  a sort of trick they  they have     said jeremy .     i   m  i   m sure it   s only           it   s dr .  hopkinth  thur     said igor  entering from the hall .     i told him you were buthy  but           but dr .  hopkins  although apparently as mild mannered as milk  was also a guild official and had survived as such for several years .  ducking under igor   s arm was no problem at all for a man who could handle a meeting of clockmakers  none of whom exactly ticked in time with the rest of humanity .      i just happened to have business this way     he began  smiling brightly     and it was no trouble to drop in at the apothecary to pick up   oh  you have company .      igor grimaced  but there was the code to think of .      thall i make thome tea  thur .     he said  as all the auditors glared at the doctor .      what is this tea .     mr .  white demanded .      it is protocol .     snapped lady lejean .   mr .  white hesitated .  protocol was important .      er  er  er  yes     said jeremy .     tea  igor  please .  please .         my word  i see you have finished your clock .     said dr .  hopkins  apparently oblivious of an atmosphere that could float iron .     what a magnificent piece of work .      the auditors stared at one another as the doctor ambled past them and looked up the glass face .      well done indeed  jeremy .     he said  removing his glasses and polishing them enthusiastically .     and what is this pretty blue glow .         it   s  it   s the crystal ring     said jeremy .     it  it           it spins light     said lady lejean .     and then it makes a hole in the universe .         really .     said dr .  hopkins  putting his glasses back on .     what an original idea .  does a cuckoo come out .          tick  among the very worst words that can be heard by anyone high in the air  the pair known as    oh oh    possibly combines the maximum of bowel knotting terror with the minimum wastage of breath .   when lu tze uttered them  lobsang didn   t need a translation .  he   d been watching the clouds for some time .  they were getting blacker  and thicker  and darker .      the handle   s tingling .     shouted lu tze .      that   s because there   s a storm right above us .     screamed lobsang .      the sky was as clear as a bell a few minutes ago .      ankh morpork was much closer now .  lobsang could make out some of the taller buildings  and see the river snaking across the plain .  but the storm was coming up all around the city .      i   m going to have to land this thing while i can .     lu tze said .     hold on        the stick dropped until it was a few feet above the cabbage fields .  the plants were a rushing green blur inches below lobsang   s sandals .   lobsang heard another word that  while not the worst you can hear while airborne  is not at all good when it   s said by the person steering .      er           do you know how to stop this .     screamed lobsang .      not in so many words     shouted lu tze .     hold on  i   m going to try something        the stick tilted up but kept moving in the same direction .  the bristles dipped into the cabbages .   it took the width of a field to slow down  at the end of a furrow with the smell that only squashed cabbage leaves can yield .      how fine can you slice time .     the sweeper said  scrambling over the battered plants .      i   m pretty good       lobsang began .      get better quick .      lu tze faded to blue as he ran toward the city .  lobsang caught him up within a hundred yards but the sweeper was still fading  still slicing time thinner and thinner .  the apprentice gritted his teeth and followed  straining every muscle .   the old man might be a fraud when it came to fighting  but there was no kidding here .  the world went from blue to indigo to an inky  unnatural darkness  like the shadow of an eclipse .   this was deep time .  you couldn   t stay there long  he knew .  even if you could tolerate the ghastly chill  there were parts of the body that just weren   t designed for this .  go too far down  too  and you   d die if you came back too quickly     he hadn   t seen it  of course  no apprentice had  but there were some quite graphic drawings in the classrooms .  a man   s life could become very  very painful if his blood began to move through time faster than his bones .  it would also be very short .      i can   t   keep this up       he panted  running after lu tze in the violet gloom .      you can     gasped the sweeper .     you   re fast  right .         i   m not   trained   for this .      the city was getting closer .      no one gets trained for this .     growled lu tze .     you do it and you find out that you   re good at it .         what happens if you find out you   re no good .     said lobsang .  the going felt easier now .  he no longer had the feeling that his skin was trying to drag itself off him .      dead men don   t find things out     said lu tze .  he turned his head to his apprentice and his evil grin was a yellow toothed curve in the shadows .     getting the hang of it .     he added .      i   m   i   m on top of it           right .  then now that we   ve warmed up        to lobsang   s horror  the sweeper faded further into the dark .   he called up reserves he knew he didn   t have .  he screamed at his liver to keep up  thought that he felt his brain creak  and plunged on .   the shape of lu tze lightened as lobsang drew level with him in time .      still here .  one last effort  lad .         i can   t .         you bloody well can .      lobsang gulped freezing air and fell onward        where the light was suddenly a calm  pale blue and lu tze was trotting gently between the frozen carts and unmoving people around the city   s gate .      see .  nothing to it     said the sweeper .     just maintain  that   s all .  nice and steady .      it was like balancing on a wire .  it was fine if you didn   t think about it .      but all the scrolls say you go to blue and violet and into the black and then you hit the wall     said lobsang .      ah  well  scrolls     said lu tze and left it there  as if the tone of voice said it all .     this is zimmerman   s valley  lad .  it helps if you know it   s here .  the abbot said it   s something to do with   what was it   oh  yeah  boundary conditions .  something like   the foam on the tide .  we   re right on the edge  boy .         but i can breathe easily .         yeah .  shouldn   t happen .  keep moving about  though  otherwise you   ll exhaust all the good air around your body field .  good old zimmerman  eh .  one of the best  he was .  and he reckoned there was another dip even closer to the wall  too .         did he ever find it .         don   t think so .         why .         the way he exploded gave me a hint .  don   t worry .  you can maintain the slice easily here .  you don   t have to think about it .  you   ve got other things to think about .  keep an eye on those clouds .      lobsang looked up .  even in this blue on blue landscape  the clouds over the city looked ominous .      it   s what happened back in uberwald     said lu tze .     the clock needs a lot of power .  the storm blew up out of nowhere .         but the city   s huge .  how can we find a clock here .         first  we   re going to head for the center     said lu tze .      why .         because with luck we won   t have to run so far when the lightning strikes  of course .         sweeper  no one can outrun lightning .      lu tze spun around and grabbed lobsang by the robe  dragging him closer .      then tell me where to run  speedy boy .     he shouted .     there   s more to you than meets the third eye  lad .  no apprentice should be able to find zimmerman   s valley .  it takes hundreds of years of training .  and no one should be able to make the spinners sit up and dance to his tune the very first time he sees them .  think i   m daft  do you .  orphan boy  strange power   what the hell are you .  the mandala knew you .  well  i   m just a mortal human  and what i know is  i   ll be damned if i   ll see the world shattered a second time .  so help me .  whatever it is you   ve got  i need it now .  use it .      he let go  and stood back .  a vein in his bald head was throbbing .      but i don   t know what i can do to           find out what you can do .          tick  protocol .  rules .  precedent .  ways of doing things .  that   s how we   ve always worked  thought lady lejean .  this and this must follow that .  it has always been our strength .  i wonder if it can be a weakness .   if looks could kill  dr .  hopkins would have been a smear on the wall .  the auditors watched his every move like cats watching a new species of mouse .   lady lejean had been incarnate much longer than the others .  time can change a body  especially when you   ve never had one before .  she wouldn   t have stared and fumed .   she would have clubbed the doctor to the ground .  what was one more human .   she realized  with some amazement  that the thought was a human thought .   but the other six were still wet behind the ears .  they hadn   t yet realized the dimensions of duplicity that you needed to survive as a human being .  they clearly found it hard to think inside the little dark world behind the eyes  too .  auditors reached decisions in concert with thousands  millions of other auditors .   sooner or later they   d learn to be their own thinkers  though .  it might take a while  because they   d try to learn from one another first .   at the moment they were watching igor   s tea tray with great suspicion .      drinking tea is protocol     said lady lejean .      is this correct .     mr .  white barked at dr .  hopkins .      oh  yes     said the doctor .     with a ginger biscuit  usually     he added hopefully .      a ginger biscuit     repeated mr .  white .     a biscuit of red brown coloring .         yes  thur     said igor .  he nodded to the plate on his tray .      i would like to try a ginger biscuit     volunteered miss red .   oh yes  thought lady lejean  please try the ginger biscuits .      we do not eat or drink .     snapped mr .  white .  he gave lady lejean a look of deep suspicion .     it could cause incorrect ways of thinking .         but it is the custom     said lady lejean .     to ignore protocol is to draw attention .      mr .  white hesitated .  but he was a quick adaptor .      it is against our religion .     he said .     correct .      it was an amazing leap .  it was inventive .  and he   d come up with it all alone .  lady lejean was impressed .  the auditors had tried to understand religion  because so much that made no sense whatsoever was done in its name .  but it could also excuse practically any kind of eccentricity .  genocide  for example .  by comparison  a lack of tea drinking was easy .      yes  indeed .     said mr .  white  turning to the other auditors .     is that not true .         yes  that is not true .  indeed .     said mr .  green .      oh .     said dr .  hopkins .     i did not know there was any religion that forbade tea .         indeed .     said mr .  green .  lady lejean could almost feel his mind racing .     it is a   yes  it is a drink of the   correct   it is a drink of the   extremely bad  negatively regarded gods .  it is a   correct   it is a commandment of our religion to   yes   to shun ginger biscuits also .     there was sweat on his forehead .  for an auditor  this was genius level creativity .     also     he went on slowly  as if reading the words off some page invisible to everyone else     our religion   correct .    our religion demands that the clock be started now .  for   who may know when the hour may be .      despite herself  lady lejean nearly applauded .      who indeed     said dr .  hopkins .      i  i absolutely agree     said jeremy  who had been staring at lady lejean .     i don   t understand who you   why there   s all this fuss   i don   t understand why   oh  dear   i   m getting a headache        dr .  hopkins spilled his tea because of the speed with which he got up and reached into his coat pocket .      ahitsohappensiwaspassingtheapothecaryonmyway here       he began  all in one breath .      i feel it   s not the time to start the clock     said lady lejean  edging herself along the desk .  the hammer was still invitingly there .      i   m seeing those little flashes of light  dr .  hopkins     said jeremy urgently  staring into the middle distance .      not the flashes of light .  not the flashes of light .     said dr .   hopkins .  he grabbed a teaspoon off igor   s tray  stared at it  threw it over his shoulder  tipped the tea out of a cup  opened the bottle of blue medicine by smashing the top off on the edge of the bench  and poured a cupful  spilling quite a lot of it in his hurry .   the hammer was inches away from her ladyship   s hand .  she didn   t dare look around  but she could sense it there .  while the auditors stared at the trembling jeremy  she let her fingers walk across the bench .  she wouldn   t even have to move .  a brisk overarm throw should do it .   she saw dr .  hopkins try to put the cup to jeremy   s lips .  the boy put his hands over his face and elbowed the cup out of the way  spilling the medicine across the floor .   then lady lejean   s fingers were grasping the handle .  she brought her hand around and hurled the hammer directly at the clock .       tick  the war was going badly for the weaker side .  their positioning was wrong  their tactics ragged  their strategy hopeless .  the red army advanced across the whole front  dismembering the scurrying remnant of the collapsing black army .   there was room for only one ant hill on this lawn     death found war down among the grass blades .  he admired attention to detail .  war was in full armor  too  but the human heads he normally had tied to his saddle had been replaced by ant heads  feelers and all .   do they notice  do you think .  death said .      i doubt it     said war .   nevertheless  if they did  i   m sure they would appreciate it .      ha .  only decent theater of war around these days     said war .     that   s what i like about ants .  the buggers don   t learn  what .      it has been rather peaceful of late  i agree  said death .      peaceful .     said war .     ha .  i may as well change m   name to    police action     or    negotiated settlement    .  remember the old days .  warriors used to froth at the mouth .  arms and legs bouncing in all directions .  great times  eh .     he leaned across and slapped death on the back .     i   ll bag    em and you   ll tag    em  what .      this looks hopeful  death thought .   talking of the old days  he said carefully .  i   m sure you remember the tradition of riding out .   war gave him a puzzled look .      mind   s a blank on that one  old boy .      i sent out the call .      can   t say it rings a bell        apocalypse .  said death .  end of the world .   war continued to stare .      definitely knocking  old chap  but no one   s home .  and talking of home       war looked around at the twitching remains of the recent slaughter .     spot of lunch .      around them the forest of grass grew shorter and smaller until it was  indeed  no more than grass  and became the lawn outside a house .   it was an ancient longhouse .  where else would war live .  but death saw ivy growing over the roof .  he remembered when war would never have allowed anything like that  and a little worm of worry began to gnaw .   war hung up his helmet as he entered  and once he would have kept it on .  and the benches around the fire pit would have been crowded with warriors  and the air would have been thick with beer and sweat .      brought an old friend back  dear     he said .   mrs .  war was preparing something on the modern black iron kitchen range which  death saw  had been installed in the fire pit  with shiny pipes extending up through the hole in the roof .  she gave death the kind of nod a wife gives a man whom her husband has  despite previous warnings  unexpectedly brought back from the pub .      we   re having rabbit     she said  and added in the voice of one who has been put upon and will extract payment later     i   m sure i can make it stretch to three .      war   s big red face wrinkled .      do i like rabbit .         yes  dear .         i thought i liked beef .         no  dear .  beef gives you wind .         oh .     war sighed .     any chance of onions .         you don   t like onions  dear .         i don   t .         because of your stomach  dear .         oh .      war smiled awkwardly at death .      it   s rabbit     he said .     erm   dear  do i ride out for apocalypses .      mrs .  war took the lid off a saucepan and prodded viciously at something inside .      no  dear     she said firmly .     you always come down with a cold .         i thought i rather  er  sort of liked that kind of thing    .         no  dear .  you don   t .      despite himself  death was fascinated .  he had never come across the idea of keeping your memory inside someone else   s head .      perhaps i would like a beer .     war ventured .      you don   t like beer  dear .         i don   t .         no  it brings on your trouble .         ah .  uh  how do i feel about brandy .         you don   t like brandy  dear .  you like your special oat drink with the vitamins .         oh  yes     said war mournfully .     i   d forgotten i liked that .     he looked sheepishly at death .     it   s quite nice     he said .   could i have a word with you  said death  in private .   war looked puzzled .      do i like wo        in private  please  death thundered .   mrs .  war turned and gave death a disdainful look .      i understand  i quite understand     she said haughtily .     but don   t you dare say anything to bring on his acid  that   s all i shall say .      mrs .  war had been a valkyrie once  death remembered .  it was another reason to be extremely careful on the battlefield .      you   ve never been tempted by the prospect of marriage  old man .     said war  when she   d gone .   no .  absolutely not .  in no way .      why not .      death was nonplussed .  it was like asking a brick wall what it thought of dentistry .  as a question  it made no sense .   i have been to see the other two  he said  ignoring it .  famine doesn   t care and pestilence is frightened .      just the two of us .     said war .   right is on our side .      speaking as war     said war     i   d hate to tell you what happens to very small armies that have right on their side .      i have seen you fight .      my old right arm isn   t what it was       war murmured .   you are immortal .  you are not ill  said death  but he could see the worried  slightly hunted look in war   s eyes and knew that there was only one way this was going to go .   to be human was to change  death realized .  the horsemen   were horsemen .  men had wished upon them a certain shape  a certain form .  and  just like the gods  and the tooth fairy  and the hogfather  their shape had changed them .  they would never be human  but they had caught aspects of humanity as though they were some kind of disease .   because the point was that nothing  nothing had one aspect and one aspect alone .  men would envisage a being called famine  but once they gave him arms and legs and eyes  that meant he had to have a brain .  that meant he   d think .  and a brain can   t think about plagues of locusts all the time .   emergent behavior again .  complications always crept in .  everything changed .   thank goodness  thought death  that i am completely unchanging and exactly the same as i ever was .   and then there was one .       tick  the hammer stopped halfway across the room .   mr .  white walked over and picked it out of the air .      really  your ladyship     he said .     you think we don   t watch you .  you  the igor  make the clock ready .      igor looked from him to lady lejean and back .     i only take orderth from marthter jeremy  thank you     he said .      the world will end if you start that clock .     said lady lejean .      what a foolish idea     said mr .  white .     we laugh at it .         hahaha     said the other auditors obediently .      i don   t need medicine .     jeremy shouted  pushing dr .  hopkins out of the way .     and i don   t need people to tell me what to do .  shut up .      in the silence  thunder grumbled in the clouds .      thank you     said jeremy more calmly .     now  i hope i am a rational man  and i will approach this rationally .  a clock is a measuring device .  i have built the perfect clock  my lady .  i mean ladies .  and gentlemen .  it will revolutionize timekeeping .      he reached up and moved the hands of the clock to almost one o   clock .  then he reached down  gripped the pendulum  and set it swinging .   the world continued to exist .      you see .  the universe doesn   t stop even for my clock     jeremy went on .  he folded his hands  and sat down .     watch     he said calmly .   the clock ticked gently .  then something rattled in the machinery around it  and the big green tubes of acid began to sizzle .      well  nothing seems to have happened     said dr .  hopkins .     that   s a blessing .      sparks crackled around the lightning rod positioned above the clock .      this is just making a path for the lightning     said jeremy happily .     we sent a little lightning up  and a lot more comes back        things were moving inside the clock .  there was a sound best represented as fizzle  and greenish blue light filled the case .      ah  the cascade has initialized     said jeremy .     as a little exercise  the  ah  more traditional pendulum clock has been slaved to the big clock  you   ll see  so that every second it will be readjusted to the correct time .     he smiled  and one cheek twitched .     some day all clocks will be like this     he said  and added     while i normally hate such an imprecise term as    any second now     nevertheless  i            tick  there was a fight going on in the square .  in the strange colors involved in the time slicing state known as zimmerman   s valley  it was picked out in shades of light blue .   by the look of it  a couple of watchmen were trying to take on a gang .  one man was airborne  and hung there without support .  another had fired a crossbow directly at one of the watchmen  the arrow was nailed unmoving in the air .   lobsang examined it curiously .      you   re going to touch it  aren   t you     said a voice behind lobsang .     you   re just going to reach out and touch it  despite everything i   ve told you .  pay attention to the damn sky .      lu tze was smoking nervously .  when it got a few inches away from his body  the smoke went rigid in the air .      are you sure you can   t feel where it is .     he snapped .      it   s all around us  sweeper .  we   re so close  it   it   s like trying to see the woods when you   re standing under the trees .         well  this is the street of cunning artificers and that   s the guild of clockmakers over there     said lu tze .     i don   t dare go inside if it   s this close  not until we   re certain .         could it be the wizards at the university .         wizards aren   t mad enough to try it .         you   re going to try and race the lightning .         it   s doable  if we start from here in the valley .  lightning ain   t as quick as people think .         are we waiting to see a little pointy bit of lightning coming out of a cloud .         hah .  kids today  where do they get their education .  the first stroke is from the ground to the air  lad .  that makes a nice hole in the air for the main lightning to come down .  look for the glow .  we   ve got to be giving the road plenty of sandal by the time it reaches the clouds .  you holding up okay .         i could go on like this all day     said lobsang .      don   t try it .     lu tze scanned the sky again .     maybe i was wrong .  maybe it   s just a storm .  sooner or later you get        he stopped .  one look at lobsang   s face was enough .      o kay     said the sweeper slowly .     just give me a direction .  just point if you can   t speak .      lobsang dropped to his knees  hands rising to his head .      i don   t know   don   t know        silvery light rose over the city  a few streets away .  lu tze grabbed the boy   s elbow .      come on  lad .  on your feet .  faster than lightning  eh .  okay .         yeah   yeah  okay           you can do it  right .      lobsang blinked .  he could see the glass house again  stretching away as a pale outline overlaid onto the city .      clock     he said thickly .      run  boy  run .     shouted lu tze .     and don   t stop for anything .      lobsang plunged forward and found it hard .  time moved aside for him  sluggishly at first  as his legs pumped  with every step he pushed himself faster and faster  the landscape changing colors again as the world slowed even further .   there was another stitch in time  the sweeper had said .  another valley  even closer to the null point .  insofar as he could think at all  lobsang hoped he reached it soon .  his body felt as though it would fly apart  he could feel his bones creaking .   the glow ahead was halfway to the iron heavy clouds now  but he   d reached a crossroads and he could see it rising from a house halfway down the street .   he turned to look for the sweeper  and saw the man yards behind him  mouth open  a statue falling forward .   lobsang turned  concentrated  let time speed up .   he reached lu tze and caught him before he hit the ground .  there was blood coming from the old man   s ears .      i can   t do it  lad     the sweeper mumbled .     get on .  get on .             i can do it .  it   s like running downhill .         not for me it ain   t .         i can   t just leave you here like this .         save us from heroes .  get that bloody clock .      lobsang hesitated .  the downstroke was already emerging from the clouds  a drifting  glowing spike .   he ran .  the lightning was falling toward a shop  a few buildings away .  he could see a big clock hanging over its window .   he pushed against the flow of time ever further  and it yielded .  but the lightning had reached the iron pole atop the building .   the window was closer than the door .  he lowered his head and jumped through it  the glass shattering around him and then freezing in midair  clocks pinwheeling off the display and stopping as if caught in invisible amber .   there was another door ahead of him .  he grabbed the knob and pulled  feeling the terrible resistance of a slab of wood urged to move at an appreciable fraction of the speed of light .   it was barely open a few inches when he saw  beyond  the slow ooze of lightning down the rod and into the heart of the big clock .   the clock struck one .   time stopped .       ti     mr .  soak  the dairyman  was washing bottles at the sink when the air dimmed and the water solidified .   he stared at it for a moment and then  with the manner of a man trying an experiment  held the bottle over the stone floor and let it go .   it remained hanging in the air .      damn it     he said .     another idiot with a clock  eh .      what he did then was not usual dairy practice .  he walked into the center of the room and made a few passes in the air with his hands .   the air brightened .  the water splashed .  the bottle smashed   although  when ronnie turned around and waved a hand at it  the glass slivers ran together again .   then ronnie soak sighed and went into the cream settling room .  large wide bowls stretched away into the distance and  if ronnie had ever allowed another to notice this  the distance contained far more distance than is usually found in a normal building .      show me     he said .   the surface of the nearest bowl of milk became a mirror  and then began to show pictures     ronnie went back into the dairy  took his peaked cap off its hook by the door  and crossed the courtyard to the stable .  the sky overhead was a sullen  unmoving gray as he emerged leading his horse .   it was black  glistening with health  and there was this about it that was odd  it shone as though it was illuminated by a red light .  redness spangled off its shoulders and flanks  even under the grayness .   and even when it was harnessed to the cart it didn   t look like any kind of horse that should be hitched to any kind of wagon  but people never noticed this and  again  ronnie took care to make sure that they didn   t .   the cart gleamed with white paint  picked out here and there with a fresh green .  the wording on the side declared proudly      ronald soak  hygenic dairyman .   established     perhaps it was odd that people never said     established when  exactly .     and  if they ever had  the answer would have had to be quite complicated .   ronnie opened the gates to the yard and  milk crates rattling  set out into the timeless moment .  it was terrible  he thought  the way things conspired against the small businessman .      lobsang ludd awoke to a little clicking  spinning sound .   he was in darkness  but it yielded reluctantly to his hand .  it felt like velvet  and it was .  he   d rolled under one of the display cabinets .   there was a vibration in the small of his back .  he reached around gingerly  and realized that the portable procrastinator was revolving in its cage .   so     how did it go  now .  he was living on borrowed time .  he   d got maybe an hour  perhaps a lot less .  but he could slice it  so        no .  something told him that trying that would be a really terminal idea with time stored in a device made by qu .  the mere thought made him feel that his skin was inches from a universe full of razor blades .   so   one hour  perhaps a lot less .  but you could rewind a spinner  right .   no .  the handle was at the back .  you could rewind someone else   s spinner .  thank you  qu  and your experimental models .   could you take it off  then .  no .  the harness was part of it .  without it  different parts of your body would be traveling at different speeds .  the effect would probably be rather like freezing a human body solid  and then pushing it down a flight of stone stairs .   open the box with the crowbar that you will find inside     there was a green blue glow through the crack in the door .  he took a step toward it  and heard the spinner suddenly pick up speed .  that meant it was shedding more time  and that was bad when you had an hour  perhaps a lot less .   he took a step away from the door and the procrastinator settled back into its routine clicking .   so     lu tze was out in the street and he had a spinner and that should have cut in automatically  too .  in this timeless world  he was going to be the only person who could turn a handle .   the glass that he had broken in his leap through the window had opened around the hole like a great sparkling flower .  he reached out to touch a piece .  it moved as though alive  cut his finger  and then dropped toward the ground  stopping only when it fell out of the field around his body .   don   t touch people  lu tze had said .  don   t touch arrows .  don   t touch things that were moving  that was the rule .  but the glass        but the glass  in normal time  had been flying through the air .  it   d still have that energy  wouldn   t it .   he eased himself carefully around the glass  and opened the front door of the shop .  the wood moved very slowly  fighting against the enormous speed .   lu tze was not in the street .  but there was something new  hovering in the air just a few inches above the ground right where the old man had been .  it had not been there before .   someone with their own portable time had been here  and had dropped this  and had moved on before it reached the ground .   it was a small glass jar  colored blue by temporal effects .  now   how much energy could it have .  lobsang cupped his hand and gingerly brought it underneath and up  and there was a tingle and a sudden feeling of weight as the spinner   s field claimed it .   now its true colors came back .  the jar was a milky pink or  rather  clear glass that looked pink because of the contents .  the paper lid was covered with badly printed pictures of unbelievably flawless strawberries  surrounding some ornate lettering which read  ronald soak  hygenic dairyman .  strawberry yogurt    fresh as the morning dew .      soak .  he knew the name .  the man had delivered milk to the guild .  good fresh milk  too  not the watery  green tinted stuff the other dairies supplied .  very reliable  everyone said .  but  reliable or not  he was just a milkman   allright  just a very good milkman   andif time had stopped  then why     lobsang looked around desperately .  the people and carts that thronged the street were still there .  no one had moved .  no one could move .   but something was running along the gutter .  it looked like a rat in a black robe  running along on its hind legs .  it looked up at lobsang  and he saw that it had a skull rather than a head .  as skulls went  it was quite a cheerful one .   the word squeak manifested itself inside his brain without bothering to go via his ears .  then the rat hopped onto the pavement and scampered down an alley .   lobsang followed it .   a moment later someone behind him grabbed him by the neck .  he went to break the lock  and realized how much he   d relied on slicing when he was fought .  besides  the person behind him had a very strong grip indeed .      i just want to make sure you don   t do anything silly     it said .  it was a female voice .     what is this thing on your back .         who are           the protocol in these matters     said the voice     is that the person with the killer neckgrip asks the questions .         er  it   s a procrastinor .  er  it stores time .  who            oh dear  there you go again .  what is your name .         lobsang .  lobsang ludd .  look  could you wind me up  please .  it   s urgent .         certainly .  lobsang ludd  you are thoughtless and impulsive and deserve to die a stupid and pointless death .         what .         and you are also rather slow on the uptake .  you are referring to this handle .         yes .  i   m running out of time .  now can i ask who you are .         miss susan .  hold still .      he heard  behind him  the incredibly welcome sound of the procrastinator   s clockwork being rewound .      miss susan .     he said .      that   s what most people i know call me .  now  i   m going to let you go .  i will add that trying anything stupid will be counterproductive .  besides  i   m the only person in the world right now who might be inclined to twiddle your handle again .      the pressure was released .  lobsang turned slowly .   miss susan was a slightly built young woman  dressed severely all in black .  her hair stood out around her head like an aura  white blond with one black streak .  but the most striking thing about her was   was everything  lobsang realized  everything from her expression to the way she stood .  some people fade into the background .  miss susan faded into the foreground .  she stood out .  everything she stood in front of became nothing more than background .      finished .     she said .     seen everything .         sorry .  have you seen an old man .  dressed a bit like me .  with one of these on his back .         no .  now it   s my turn .  have you got rhythm .         what .      susan rolled her eyes .     all right .  do you have music .         not on me  no .         and you certainly haven   t got a girl     said miss susan .     i saw old man trouble go past a few minutes ago .  it   d be a good idea if you don   t bump into him  then .         and is he likely to have taken my friend .         i doubt it .  and old man trouble is more an it than a he .  anyway  there   s far worse than him around right now .  even the bogeymen have gone to ground .         look  time has stopped  right .     said lobsang .      yes .         so how can you be here talking to me .         i   m not what you might call a creature of time     said miss susan .     i work in it  but i don   t have to live there .  there are a few of us about .         like this old man trouble you mentioned .         right .  and the hogfather  the tooth fairy  the sandman  people like that .         i thought they were mythical .         so .     susan glanced out of the mouth of the alley again .      and you   re not .         i take it you didn   t stop the clock     said miss susan  looking up and down the street .      no .  i was   too late .  perhaps i shouldn   t have gone back to help lu tze .         i   m sorry .  you were dashing to prevent the end of the world but you stopped to help some old man .  you   hero .         oh  i wouldn   t say that i was a       and then lobsang stopped .  she hadn   t said    you hero    in the tone of voice of    you star     it had been the tone in which people say    you idiot .         i see a lot of your sort     susan went on .     heroes have a very strange grasp of elementary maths  you know .  if you   d smashed the clock before it struck  everything would have been fine .  now the world has stopped  and we   ve been invaded  and we   re probably all going to die  just because you stopped to help someone .  i mean  very worthy and all that  but very  very   human        she used the word as if she meant it to mean    silly .         you mean you need cool calculating bastards to save the world  do you .     said lobsang .      the cool calculation does help  i must admit     said susan .     now  shall we go and look at this clock .         why .  the damage is done now .  if we smash it  it   ll only make things worse .  besides  uh  the spinner started to run wild and i  er  i felt           cautious     said susan .     good .  caution is sensible .  but there   s something i want to check .      lobsang tried to pull himself together .  this strange woman had the air of someone who knew exactly what she was doing   who knew exactly what everyone was doing   and  besides  what alternative did he have .  then he remembered the yogurt pot .      does this mean anything .     he said .     i   m certain it was dropped in the street after time stopped .      she took the pot and examined it .      oh     she said casually .     ronnie   s been around  has he .         ronnie .         oh  we all know ronnie .         what   s that supposed to mean .         let   s just say if he found your friend then your friend is going to be okay .  probably okay .  more okay that he would be if just about anything else found him  at least .  look  this is not a time when you should be worrying about one person .  cold calculation  right .      she stepped out into the street .  lobsang followed .  susan walked as if she owned the street .  she scanned every alley and doorway  but not like a potential victim apprehensive of attackers .  it seemed to lobsang that she was disappointed to find nothing dangerous in the shadows .   susan reached the shop  and stepped inside  pausing for a moment to regard the floating flower of broken glass in the shop .  her expression suggested that she considered it to be a perfectly normal kind of thing to find  and had seen far more interesting things .  then she walked on and stopped at the inner door .  there was still a glow from the crack  but it was dimmer now .      settling down     she said .     shouldn   t be too bad   but there   s two people in here .         who .         wait  i   ll open the door .  and be careful .      the door moved very slowly .  lobsang stepped into the workshop after the girl .  the spinner began to speed up .   the clock glowed in the middle of the floor  painful to look at .   but he stared  nevertheless .     it   s   it   s just as i imagined it     he said .     it   s the way to           don   t go near it     said susan .     it   s uncertain death  believe me .  do pay attention .      lobsang blinked .      what did you say .         i said it   s uncertain death .         is that worse than certain death .         much .  watch .     susan picked up a hammer that was lying on the floor and poked it gently toward the clock .  it vibrated in her hand when she brought it closer  and she swore under her breath as it was dragged from her fingers and vanished .  just before it did  there was a brief  contracting ring around the clock that might have been something like a hammer would be if you rolled it very flat and bent it into a circle .      have you any idea why that happened .     she said .      no .         nor have i .  now imagine that you were the hammer .  uncertain death  see .      lobsang looked at the two frozen people .  one was medium sized and had all the right number of appendages to qualify as a member of the human race  and so therefore probably had to be given the benefit of the doubt .  it was staring at the clock .  so was the other figure  which was of a middle aged  sheep faced man still holding a cup of tea and  as far as lobsang could make out  a biscuit .      the one who wouldn   t win a beauty contest even if he was the only entrant is an igor     said susan .     the other one is dr .  hopkins of the clockmakers    guild here .         so we know who built the clock  at least     said lobsang .      i don   t think so .  mr .  hopkins   s workshop is several streets away .  and he makes novelty watches for a rather strange kind of discerning customer .  it   s his speciality .         then the   igor must   ve built it .         good grief  no .  igors are professional servants .  they never work for themselves .         you seem to know a lot     said lobsang  as susan circled the clock like a wrestler trying to spy out a hold .      yes     she said without turning her head .     i do .  the first clock broke .  this one   s holding .  whoever designed it was a genius .         an evil genius .         it   s hard to say .  i can   t see any signs .         what kind of signs .         well     hahaha .  .  .  .  .     painted on the side would be a definite clue  don   t you think .     she said  rolling her eyes .      i   m in your way  am i .     said lobsang .      no  not at all     said susan  turning her attention to the workbench .     well  there   s nothing here .  i suppose he could have set a timer .  a sort of alarm clock         she stopped .  she picked up a length of rubber hosepipe that was coiled on a hook by the glass jars  and looked hard at it .  then she tossed it into a corner  and stared at it as if she had never seen anything like it before .      don   t say a word     she said quietly .     they have some very acute senses .  just ease back among those big glass vats behind you and try to look inconspicuous .  and do it now .      the last word had odd harmonics to it  and lobsang felt his legs begin to move almost without his conscious control .   the door moved a little and a man came in .   what was strange about the face  lobsang thought afterward  was how unmemorable it was .  he   d never seen a face so lacking in anything to mention .  it had a nose and mouth and eyes  and they were all quite flawless  but somehow they didn   t make up a face .  they were just parts that made no proper whole .  if they became anything at all it was the face of a statue  good looking but without anything looking out of it .   slowly  like someone who had to think about his muscles  the man turned to look at lobsang .   lobsang felt himself bunch up to slice time .  the spinner groaned a warning on his back .      that   s about enough  i think     said susan  stepping forward .  the man was spun around .  an elbow was jabbed into his stomach and then the palm of her hand caught him so hard under his chin that he was lifted off the floor and slammed against the wall .   as he fell  susan hit him on the head with a wrench .      we might as well be going     she said  as if she   d just shuffled some paper that had been untidy .     nothing more for us here .         you killed him .         certainly .  he   s not a human being .  i have   a sense about these things .  it   s sort of inherited .  besides  go and pick up the hose .  go on .      since she was still holding the wrench  lobsang did so .  or tried to do so .  the coil she   d flung into the corner was knotted and tangled like rubber spaghetti .      malignancy  my grandfather calls it     said susan .     the local hostility of things toward nonthings always increases when there   s an auditor about .  they can   t help it .  the hosepipe test is very reliable in the field  according to a rat i know .      rat  thought lobsang  but said     what   s an auditor .         and they have no sense of color .  they don   t understand it .  look how he   s dressed .  gray suit  gray shirt  gray shoes  gray cravat  gray everything .         er   er   perhaps it was just someone trying to be very cool .         you think so .  no loss there  then     said susan .     anyway  you   re wrong .  watch .      the body was disintegrating .  it was a fast and quite ungory process  a sort of dry evaporation .  it simply became floating dust  which expanded away and vanished .  but the last few handfuls formed  just for a few seconds  a familiar shape .  that  too  vanished  with the merest whisper of a scream .      that was a dhlang .     he said .     an evil spirit .  the peasants down in the valleys hang up charms against them .  but i thought they were just a superstition .         no  they   re a substition     said susan .     i mean they   re real  but hardly anyone really believes in them .  mostly everyone believes in things that aren   t real .  something very strange is going on .  these things are all over the place  and they   ve got bodies .  that   s not right .  we   ve got to find the person who built the clock           and  er  what are you  miss susan .         me .  i   m   a schoolteacher .      she followed his gaze to the wrench that she still held in her hand  and shrugged .      it can get pretty rough at break time  can it .     said lobsang .      there was an overpowering smell of milk .   lu tze sat bolt upright .   it was a large room  and he had been placed on a slab in the middle of it .  by the feel of the surface  it was sheeted with metal .  there were churns stacked along the wall  and big metal bowls ranged beside a sink the size of a bath .   under the milk smell were many others   disinfectant  well scrubbed wood  and a distant odor of horses .   footsteps approached .  lu tze lay back hurriedly  and shut his eyes .   he heard someone enter the room .  they were whistling under their breath  and they had to be a man  because no woman in lu tze   s long experience had ever whistled in that warbling  hissing way .  the whistling approached the slab  stayed still for a moment  then turned away and headed for the sink .  it was replaced by the sound of a pump handle being operated .   lu tze half opened one eye .   the man standing at the sink was quite short  so that the standard issue blue and white striped apron he wore almost reached the floor .  he appeared to be washing bottles .   lu tze swung his legs off the slab  moving with a stealthiness that made the typical ninja sound like a brass band  and let his sandals gently touch the floor .      feeling better .     said the man  without turning his head .      oh  er  yes .  fine     said lu tze .      i thought  here   s a little bald monk sort of a fellow     said the man  holding a bottle up to the light to inspect it .     with a wind up thing on his back  and down on his luck .  fancy a cup of tea .  kettle   s on .  i   ve got yak butter .         yak .  am i still in ankh morpork .     lu tze looked down at a rack of ladles beside him .  the man still hadn   t looked around .      hmm .  interestin    question     said the bottle washer .     you could say you   re sort of in ankh morpork .  no to yak milk .  i can get cow milk  or goat  sheep  camel  llama  horse  cat  dog  dolphin  whale  or alligator  if you prefer .         what .  alligators don   t give milk .     said lu tze  grasping the biggest ladle .  it made no noise as it came off its hook .      i didn   t say it was easy .      the sweeper got a good grip .      what is this place  friend .     he said .      you are in   the dairy .      the man at the sink said the last word as if it was as portentous as    castle of dread     placed another bottle on the draining board  and  still with his back to lu tze  held up a hand .  all the fingers were folded except for the middle digit  which was extended .      you know what this is  monk .     he said .      it   s not a friendly gesture  friend .     the ladle felt good and heavy .  lu tze had used much worse weapons than this .      oh  a superficial interpretation .  you are an old man  monk .  i can see the centuries on you .  tell me what this is  and know what i am .      the coldness in the dairy got a little colder .      it   s your middle finger     said lu tze .      pah .     said the man .      pah .         yes  pah .  you have a brain .  use it .         look  it was good of you to           you know the secret wisdoms which everyone seeks  monk .     the bottle washer paused .     no  i even suspect that you know the explicit wisdoms  the ones hidden in plain view  which practically no one looks for .  who am i .      lu tze stared at the solitary finger .  the walls of the dairy faded .  the cold grew deeper .   his mind raced  and the librarian of memory took over .   this wasn   t a normal place  that wasn   t a normal man .  a finger .  one finger .  one of the five digits on a   one of five .  one of five .  faint echoes of an ancient legend signaled his attention .   one from five is four .   and one left over .   he very carefully hung the ladle back on its hook .      one from five     he said .     the fifth of four .         there we are .  i could see you were educated .         you were   you were the one who left before they became famous .         yes .         but   this is a dairy  and you   re washing bottles .         well .  i had to do something with my time .         but   you were the fifth horseman of the apocalypse .         and i bet you can   t remember my name .      lu tze hesitated .      no     he said .     i don   t think i ever heard it .      the fifth horseman turned around .  his eyes were black .  completely black .  shiny  and black  and without any whites at all .      my name     said the fifth horseman     is           yes .         my name is ronnie .         timelessness grew like ice .  waves froze on the sea .  birds were pinned to the air .  the world went still .   but not quiet .  there was a sound like a finger running around the rim of a very large glass .      come on     said susan .      can   t you hear it .     said lobsang  stopping .      but it   s no use to us        she pushed lobsang back into the shadows .  the robed gray shape of an auditor appeared in the air halfway down the street and began to spin .  the air around it filled with dust  which became a whirling cylinder  which became  slightly unsteady on its feet  something that looked human .   it rocked backward and forward for a moment .  it raised its hands slowly and looked at them  turning them this way and that .  then it marched away purposefully .  halfway along the street it was joined by another one  emerging from an alley .      this really isn   t like them     said susan  as the pair turned a corner .     they   re up to something .  let   s follow them .         what about lu tze .         what about him .  how old did you say he was .         he says he   s eight hundred years old .         hard to kill  then .  ronnie   s safe enough if you   re alert and don   t argue .  come on .      she set off along the streets .   the auditors were joined by others  weaving through the silent carts and motionless people and along the street toward  as it turned out  sator square  one of the biggest open spaces in the city .  it was a market day .  silent  motionless figures thronged the stalls .  but  among them  there were scurrying gray shapes .      there   s hundreds of them     said susan .     all human shaped   and it looks like they   re having a meeting .         mr .  white was losing patience .  up until now  he had never been aware that he had any  because  if anything  he had been all patience .  but now he could feel it evaporating .  it was a strange  hot sensation in his head .  and how could a thought be hot .   the mass of incarnated auditors watched him nervously .      i am mr .  white .     he said to the luckless new auditor that had been brought before him  and shuddered with the astonishment of using that singular word and surviving .     you cannot be mr .  white also .  it would be a matter of confusion .         but we are running out of colors     said mr .  violet  intervening .      that cannot be the case     said mr .  white .     there are an infinite number of colors .         but there are not that many names     said miss taupe .      that is not possible .  a color must have a name .         we can find only one hundred and three names for green before the color becomes noticeably either blue or yellow     said miss crimson .      but the shades are endless .         nevertheless  the names are not .         this is a problem that must be solved .  add it to the list  miss brown .  we must name every possible shade .      one of the female auditors looked startled .     i cannot remember all the things     she said .     nor do i understand why you are giving orders .         apart from the renegade  i have the greatest seniority as an incarnate .         only by a matter of seconds     said miss brown .      that is immaterial .  seniority is seniority .  this is a fact .      it was a fact .  auditors respected facts .  and it was also a fact  mr .  white knew  that there were now more than seven hundred auditors walking rather awkwardly around the city .   mr .  white had put a stop to the relentless increase in incarnations as more and more of his fellows rushed into the trouble spot .  it was too dangerous .  the renegade had demonstrated  he pointed out  that the human shape forced the mind to think in a certain troublesome way .  the utmost caution was necessary .  this was a fact .  only those with a proven ability to survive the process should be allowed to incarnate and complete the work .  this was a fact .   auditors respected facts .  at least  until now .  miss brown took a step back .      nevertheless     she said     being here is dangerous .  it is my view that we should discarnate .      mr .  white found his body replying by itself .  it let out a breath of air .      and leave things unknown .     he said .     things that are unknown are dangerous .  we are learning much .         what we are learning makes no sense     said miss brown .      the more we learn  the more sense it will make .  there is nothing we cannot understand     said mr .  white .      i do not understand why it is that i now perceive a desire to bring my hand in sharp contact with your face     said miss brown .      exactly my point     said mr .  white .     you do not understand it  and therefore it is dangerous .  perform the act  and we will know more .      she hit him .   he raised his hand to his cheek .      unbidden thoughts of avoidance of repetition are engendered     he said .     also heat .  remarkably  the body does indeed appear to do some thinking on its own behalf .         for my part     said miss brown     the unbidden thoughts are of satisfaction coupled with apprehension .         already we learn more about humans     said mr .  white .      to what end .     said miss brown  whose sensations of apprehension were increasing at the sight of the contorted expression of mr .  white   s face .     for our purposes  they are no longer a factor .  time has ended .  they are fossils .  the skin under one of your eyes is twitching .         you are guilty of inappropriate thought     said mr .  white .     they exist .  therefore we must study them in every detail .  i wish to try a further experiment .  my eye is functioning perfectly .      he took an ax from a market stall .  miss brown took another step back .      unbidden thoughts of apprehension increase markedly     she said .      yet this is a mere lump of metal on a piece of wood     said mr .  white  hefting the ax .     we  who have seen the hearts of stars .  we  who have watched worlds burn .  we  who have seen space tormented .  what is there about this ax that could cause concern to us .      he swung .  it was a clumsy blow  and the human neck is a lot tougher than people believe  but miss brown   s neck exploded into colored motes and she collapsed .   mr .  white looked around at the nearest auditors  who all stepped back .      is there anyone else who wishes to try the experiment .     he said .   there was a chorus of hasty refusals .      good     said mr .  white .     already we are learning a great deal .            he chopped her head off .         don   t shout .  and keep your head down .     susan hissed .      but he           i think she knows .  anyway  it   s an it .  and so   s it .         what   s going on .      susan drew back into the shadows .      i   m not   entirely sure     she said     but i think they   ve tried to make themselves human bodies .  pretty good copies  too .  and now   they   re acting human .         do you call that acting human .      susan gave him a sad look .     you don   t get out much  do you .  my grandfather says that if an intelligent creature takes a human shape  it starts to think human .  form defines function .         that was the action of an intelligent creature .     said lobsang  still shocked .      not only doesn   t get out much  also doesn   t read history     said susan glumly .     do you know about the curse of the werewolves .         isn   t being a werewolf curse enough .         they don   t think so .  but if they stay wolf shaped for too long  they stay a wolf     said susan .     a wolf is a very strong   form  you see .  even though the mind is human  the wolf creeps in through the noses and the ears and the paws .  know about witches .         we  er  stole the broomstick of one of them to get here     said lobsang .      really .  bit of luck for you that the world   s ended  then    said susan .     anyway  some of the best witches have this trick they call borrowing .  they can get into the mind of an animal .  very useful .  but the trick is to know when to pull out .  be a duck for too long and a duck you   ll stay .  a bright duck  maybe  with some odd memories  but still a duck .         the poet hoha once dreamed he was a butterfly  and then he awoke and said     am i a man who dreamed he was a butterfly  or am i a butterfly dreaming he is a man .        said lobsang  trying to join in .      really .     said susan briskly .     and which was he .         what .  well   who knows .         how did he write his poems .     said susan .      with a brush  of course .         he didn   t flap around making information rich patterns in the air or laying eggs on cabbage leaves .         no one ever mentioned it .         then he was probably a man     said susan .     interesting  but it doesn   t move us on a lot .  except you could say that the auditors are dreaming that they   re human  and the dream is real .  and they   ve got no imagination .  just like my grandfather  really .  they can create a perfect copy of anything  but they can   t make anything that   s really new .  so what i think is happening is that they   re finding out what being human really means .         which is .         that you   re not as much in control as you think .     she took another careful look at the crowd in the square .     do you know anything about the person who built the clock .         me .  no .  well   not really           then how did you find the place .         lu tze thought this was where the clock was being built .         really .  not a bad guess .  you even got the right house .         i   er   it was me that found the house .  it   er   i knew that was where i should be .  does that sound silly .         oh  yes .  with twinkly bells and bluebirds on it .  but it might be true  too .  i always know where i should be  too .  and where should you be now .         just a minute     said lobsang .     who are you .  time has stopped  the world is given over to   fairy tales and monsters  and there   s a schoolteacher walking around .         best kind of person to have     said susan .     we don   t like silliness .  anyway  i told you   i   ve inherited certain talents .         like living outside time .         that   s one of them .         it   s a weird talent for a schoolteacher .         good for grading papers  though     said susan calmly .      are you actually human .         hah .  as human as you are .  i won   t say i haven   t got a few skeletons in the family closet  though .      there was something about the way she said it        that wasn   t just a figure of speech  was it     said lobsang flatly .      no  not really     said susan .     that thing on your back   what happens when it stops spinning .         i   ll run out of time  of course .         ah .  so the fact that it slowed down and stopped back there when that auditor practiced its axmanship isn   t a factor  then .         it   s not turning .     panicking  lobsang tried to reach around to the small of his back  spinning himself in the effort .      it looks as though you have a hidden talent     said susan  leaning against the wall and grinning .      please .  wind me up again .         all right .  you are a           that wasn   t very funny the first time .         that   s all right  i don   t have much of a sense of humor .      she grabbed his arms as he wrestled with the straps of the spinner .      you don   t need it  understand .     she said .     it   s just a dead weight .  trust me .  don   t give in .  you   re making your own time .  don   t wonder how .      he stared at her in terror .      what   s happening .         it   s okay  it   s okay     said susan as patiently as she could .     this sort of thing always comes as a shock .  when it happened to me  there wasn   t anyone around  so consider yourself lucky .         what happened to you .         i found out who my grandfather is .  and don   t ask .  now  concentrate   where ought you to be .         uh  uh       lobsang looked around .     uh   over that way  i think .         i wouldn   t dream of asking you how you know     said susan .     and it   s away from that mob .      she smiled .     look on the bright side     she added .     we   re young  we   ve got all the time in the world       she swung the wrench onto her shoulder .     let   s go clubbing .         if there had been such a thing as time  it would have been a few minutes after susan and lobsang left that a small robed figure  about six inches high  strutted into the workshop .  it was followed by a raven  which perched on the door and regarded the glowing clock with considerable suspicion .      looks dangerous to me     he said .   squeak .  said the death of rats  advancing on the clock .      no  don   t you go trying to be a hero     said quoth .   the rat walked up to the base of the clock  stared up at it with a the bigger they are the harder they fall expression  and then whacked it with its scythe .   or  at least  tried to .  there was a flash as the blade made contact .  for a moment the death of rats was a ring shaped  black and white blur around the clock  and then it vanished .      told yer     said the raven  preening his feathers .     i bet you feel like mister silly now  right .               and then i thought  what   s a job that really needs someone with my talents .     said ronnie .     to me  time is just another direction .  and then i thought  everyone wants fresh milk  yes .  and everyone wants it delivered early in the morning .         got to be better than the window cleaning     said lu tze .      i only went into that after they invented windows     said ronnie .     it was the gardening before that .  more rancid yak butter .         please     said lu tze  holding out his cup .   lu tze was eight hundred years old  and that was why he was having a rest .  a hero would have leaped up and rushed out into the silent city and then     and there you had it .  then a hero would have had to wonder what to do next .  eight hundred years had taught lu tze that what happens  stays happened .  it might stay happened in a different set of dimensions  if you wanted to get technical  but you couldn   t make it unhappen .  the clock had struck  and time had stopped .  later  a solution would present itself .  in the meantime  a cup of tea and conversation with his serendipitous rescuer might speed that time .  after all  ronnie was not your average milkman .   lu tze had long considered that everything happens for a reason  except possibly football .      it   s the real stuff you got there  ronnie     he said  taking a sip .     the butter we   re getting these days  you wouldn   t grease a cart with it .         it   s the breed     said ronnie .     i go and get this from the highland herds six hundred years ago .         cheers     said lu tze  raising his cup .     funny  though .  i mean  if you said to people there were originally five horsemen of the apocalypse  and then one of them left and became a milkman  well  they   d be a bit surprised .  they   d wonder about why you        for a moment ronnie   s eyes blazed silver .      creative differences     he growled .     the whole ego thing .  some people might say   no  i don   t like to talk about it .  i wish them all the luck in the world  of course .         of course     said lu tze  keeping his expression opaque .      and i   ve watched their careers with great interest .         i   m sure .         do you know i even got written out of the official history .     said ronnie .   he held up a hand and a book appeared in it .  it looked brand new .      this was before     he said sourly .     book of om  prophecies of tobrun .  ever meet him .  tall man  beard  tendency to giggle at nothing .         before even my time  ronnie .      ronnie handed the book over .      first edition .  try chapter two  verse seven     he said .   and lu tze read     and the angel cloth  d all in white opened the iron book  and a fifth rider appeared in a chariot of burning ice  and there was a snapping of laws and a breaking of bonds and the multitudes cried    oh god  we   re in trouble now .            that was me     said ronnie proudly .   lu tze   s eyes strayed to verse eight     and i saw  sort of like rabbits  in many colors but basically a plaid pattern  kind of spinning around  and there was a sound as of like big syrupy things .         that verse got cut from the next edition     said ronnie .     very open to visions of all sorts  old tobrun .  the fathers of omnianism could pick and mix what they wanted .  of course  in those days everything was new .  death was death   of course  but the rest were really just localized crop failure  scuffles  and spots .         and you    .     lu tze ventured .      the public wasn   t interested in me anymore     said ronnie .     or so i was told .  back in those days we were only playing to very small crowds .  one plague of locusts  some tribe   s waterhole drying up  a volcano exploding   we were glad of any gig going .  there wasn   t room for five .     he sniffed .     so i was told .      lu tze put down the cup .      well  ronnie  it   s been very nice talking to you  but time   s   time   s not rushing  you see .         yeah .  heard about that .  the streets are full of the law .     ronnie   s eyes blazed again .      law .         dhlang .  the auditors .  they   ve had the glass clock built again .         you know that .         look  i might not be one of the fearsome four  but i do keep my eyes and ears open     said ronnie .      but that   s the end of the world .         no  it   s not     said ronnie  calmly .     everything   s still here .         but it   s not going anywhere .         oh  well  that   s not my problem  is it .     said ronnie .     i do milk and dairy products .      lu tze looked around the sparkling dairy  at the glistening bottles  at the gleaming churns .  what a job for a timeless person .  the milk would always be fresh .   he looked back at the bottles  and an unbidden thought rose in his mind .   even the horsemen were people shaped  and people are vain .  knowing how to use other people   s vanity was a martial art all in itself  and lu tze had been doing it for a long time .      i bet i can work out who you were     he said .     i bet i can work out your real name .         hah .  not a chance  monk     said ronnie .      not a monk  just a sweeper     said lu tze calmly .     just a sweeper .  you called them the law  ronnie .  there   s got to be a law  right .  they make the rules  ronnie .  and you   ve got to have rules  isn   t that true .         i do milk and dairy products     said ronnie  but a muscle twitched under his eye .     also eggs by arrangement .  it   s a good  steady business .  i   m thinking of taking on more staff for the shop .         why .     said lu tze .     there won   t be anything for them to do .         and expand the cheese side more     said ronnie  not looking at the sweeper .     big market for cheese .  and i thought maybe i could get a c mail address  people could send in orders  it could be a big market .         all the rules have won  ronnie .  nothing moves anymore .  nothing is unexpected because nothing happens .      ronnie sat staring at nothing .      i can see you   ve found your niche  then  ronnie     said lu tze soothingly .     and you keep this place like a new pin  there   s no doubt about it .  i expect the rest of the lads   d be really pleased to know that you   re  you know  getting on all right .  just one thing  uh   why did you rescue me .         what .  well  it was my charitable duty           you   re the fifth horseman  mr .  soak .  charitable duty .     except  lu tze thought  you   ve been human shaped a long time .  you want me to find out   you want me to .  thousands of years of a life like this   it   s curled you in on yourself .  you   ll fight me all the way but you want me to drag your name out of you     ronnie   s eyes glowed .      i look after my own  sweeper .         i   m one of yours  am i .         you have   certain worthwhile points .      they stared at one another .      i   ll take you back to where i found you     said ronnie soak .     that   s all .  i don   t do that other stuff anymore .         the auditor lay on its back  mouth open .  occasionally it made a weak little noise  like the whimper of a gnat .      try again  mr .            dark avocado  mr .  white .         is that a real color .         yes  mr .  white .     said mr .  dark avocado  who wasn   t entirely sure that it was .      try again then  mr .  dark avocado .      mr .  dark avocado  with great reluctance  reached down toward the prone figure   s mouth .  its fingers were a few inches away when  apparently of its own volition  the figure   s left hand moved in a blur and gripped them .  there was a crackle of bone .      i feel extreme pain  mr .  white .         what is in its mouth  mr .  dark avocado .         it appears to be cooked fermented grain product  mr .  white .  the extreme pain is continuing .         a foodstuff .         yes  mr .  white .  the sensations of pain are really quite noticeable at this point .         did i not give an order that there should be no eating or drinking or unnecessary experimentation with sensory apparatus .         indeed you did  mr .  white .  the sensation known as extreme pain  which i mentioned previously  is now really quite acute .  what shall i do now .      the concept of    orders    was yet another new and intensely unfamiliar one for any auditor .  they were used to decisions by committee  reached only when the possibilities of doing nothing whatsoever about the matter in question had been exhausted .  decisions made by everyone were decisions made by no one  which therefore precluded any possibility of blame .   but the bodies understood orders .  this was clearly something that made humans human  and so the auditors went along with it in a spirit of investigation .  there was no choice  in any case .  all kinds of sensations arose when they were given instructions by a man holding an edged weapon .  it was surprising how smoothly the impulse to consult and discuss metamorphosed into a pressing desire to do what the weapon said .      can you not persuade him to let go of your hand .         he appears to be unconscious  mr .  white .  his eyes are bloodshot .  he is making a little sighing noise .  yet the body seems determined that the bread should not be removed .  could i raise again the issue of the unbearable pain .      mr .  white signaled to two other auditors .  with considerable effort  they pried mr .  dark avocado   s fingers loose .      this is something we will have to learn more about     said mr .  white .     the renegade spoke of it .  mr .  dark avocado .         yes  mr .  white .         do the sensations of pain persist .         my hand feels both hot and cold  mr .  white .         how strange     said mr .  white .     i see that we will need to investigate pain in greater depth .     mr .  dark avocado found that a little voice in the back of his head screamed at the thought of this  while mr .  white went on     what other foodstuffs are there .         we know the names of three thousand seven hundred and nineteen foods     said mr .  indigo violet  stepping forward .  he had become the expert on such matters  and this was another new thing for the auditors .  they had never had experts before .  what one knew  all knew .  knowing something that others did not know marked one as  in a small way  an individual .  individuals could die .  but it also gave you power and value  which meant that you might not die quite so easily .  it was a lot to deal with  and like some of the other auditors he was already assembling a number of facial tics and twitches as his mind tried to cope .      name one     said mr .  white .      cheese     said mr .  indigo violet smartly .     it is rotted bovine lactation .         we will find some cheese     said mr .  white .      three auditors went past .   susan peered out of a doorway .      are you sure we   re going the right way .     she said .     we   re leaving the city center .         this is the way i should be going     said lobsang .      all right  but i don   t like these narrow streets .  i don   t like hiding .  i   m not a hiding kind of person .         yes  i   ve noticed .         what   s that place ahead .         that   s the back of the royal art museum .  broad way   s on the other side     said lobsang .     and that   s the way we need to go .         you know your way around  for a man from the mountains .         i grew up here .  i know five different ways to break into the museum  too .  i used to be a thief .         i used to be able to walk through the walls     said susan .     can   t seem to do it with time stopped .  i think the power gets canceled out somehow .         you could really walk through a solid wall .         yes .  it   s a family tradition     susan snapped .     come on   let   s go through the museum .  at least no one moves about much in there at the best of times .      ankh morpork had not had a king for many centuries  but palaces tend to survive .  a city might not need a king  but it can always use big rooms and some handy large walls  long after the monarchy is but a memory and the building is renamed the glorious memorial to the people   s industry .   although the last king of the city was no oil painting himself   especially when he   d been beheaded  after which no one looks at their best  not even a short king   it was generally agreed that he had amassed some pretty good works of art .  even the common people of the city had a keen eye for works like caravati   s three large pink women and one piece of gauze or mauvaise   s man with big fig leaf and  besides  a city with a history the length of ankh morpork   s accumulated all kinds of artistic debris and in order to prevent congestion in the streets needed some sort of civic attic in which to store it .  and thus  at little more cost than a few miles of plush red rope and a few old men in uniform to give directions to three large pink women and one piece of gauze  the royal art museum was born .   lobsang and susan hurried through the silent halls .  as with fidgett   s  it was hard to know if time had stopped here .  its passage was barely perceptible in any case .  the monks at oi dong considered it a valuable resource .   susan stopped  turned to look up at a huge gilt framed picture that occupied one whole wall of a lengthy corridor  and said quietly     oh           what is it .         the battle of ar gash  by blitzt     said susan .   lobsang looked at the flaking  uncleaned paint and the yellow brown varnish .  the colors had faded to a dozen shades of mud  but something violent and evil shone through .      is that meant to be hell .     he said .      no  it was an ancient city in klatch  thousands of years ago     said susan .     but grandfather did say that men made it hell .  blitzt went mad when he painted it .         er   he did good storm clouds  though     said lobsang  swallowing .     wonderful  er  light           look at what   s coming out of the clouds     said susan .   lobsang squinted into the crusted cumulus and fossilized lightning .      oh  yes .  the four horsemen .  you often get them in           count again     said susan .   lobsang stared .      there   s two of them           don   t be silly  there   s fi       she began  and then followed his gaze .  he hadn   t been interested in the art .   a couple of auditors were hurrying away from them  toward the porcelain room .      they   re running away from us .     said lobsang .  susan grabbed his hand .      not exactly     she said .     they always consult .  there has to be three of them to do that .  and they   ll be back  so come on .      she grabbed his hand and towed him into the next gallery .   there were gray figures at the far end .  the pair ran on  past dust encrusted tapestries and into another huge  ancient room .      ye gods  there   s a picture of three huge pink women with only       lobsang began  as he was dragged past .      pay attention  will you .  the way to the main door was back there .  this place is full of auditors .         but it   s just an old art gallery .  there   s nothing for them here  is there .      they slid to a stop on the marble slabs .  a wide staircase led up to the next floor .      we   ll be trapped up there     said lobsang .      there   s balconies all around     said susan .     come on .      she dragged him up the stairs and through an archway .  and stopped .   the galleries were several storeys high .  on the second floor  visitors could look down on to the floor below .  and  in the room below  the auditors were very busy .      what the hell are they doing now .     whispered lobsang .      i think     said susan grimly     that they are appreciating art .         miss tangerine was annoyed .  her body kept making strange demands of her  and the work with which she had been entrusted was going so very badly .   the frame of what once had been sir robert cuspidor   s waggon stuck in river was leaning against a wall in front of her .  it was empty .  the bare canvas was neatly rolled beside it .   in front of the frame  carefully heaped in order of size  were piles of pigment .  several dozen auditors were breaking these down into their component molecules .      still nothing .     she said  striding along the line .      no  miss tangerine .  only known molecules and atoms so far     said an auditor  its voice shaking slightly .      well   is it something to do with the proportions .  the balance of molecules .  the basic geometry .         we are continuing to           get on with it .      the other auditors in the gallery  clustered industriously in front of what had once been a painting and in fact still was  insofar as every single molecule was still present in the room  glanced up and then bent again to their tasks .   miss tangerine was getting even angrier because she couldn   t work out why she was angry .  one reason was probably that  when he gave her this task  mr .  white had looked at her in a funny way .  being looked at was an unfamiliar experience for an auditor in any case   no auditor bothered to look at another auditor very often because all auditors looked the same   and neither were they used to the idea that you could say things with your face .  or even have a face .  or have a body that reacted in strange ways to the expression on another face belonging to  in this case  mr .  white .  when he looked at her like that  she felt a terrible urge to claw his face off .   which made absolutely no sense at all .  no auditor should feel like that about another auditor .  no auditor should feel like that about anything .  no auditor should feel .   she felt livid .  they   d all lost so many powers .  it was ridiculous to have to communicate by flapping bits of your skin  and as for the tongue   yuerkkk     as far as she knew  in the whole life of the universe  no auditor had ever experienced the sensation of yuerkkk .  this wretched body was full of opportunities for yuerkkk .  she could leave it at any time and yet  and yet   part of her didn   t want to .  there was this horrible desire  second by second  to hang on .   and she felt hungry .  and that also made no sense .  the stomach was a bag for digesting food .  it wasn   t supposed to issue commands .  the auditors could survive quite well by exchanging molecules with their surroundings and making use of any local source of energy .  that was a fact .   try telling that to the stomach .  she could feel it .  it was sitting there  grumbling .  she was being harassed by her internal organs .  why the   why the   why had they copied internal organs .  yuerkkk .   it was all too much .  she wanted to   she wanted to   express herself by shouting some  some  some terrible words        discord .  confusion .      the other auditors looked around in terror .   but the words just didn   t work for miss tangerine .  they just didn   t have the same force that they used to .  there had to be something worse .  ah  yes        organs .     she shouted  pleased to have found it at last .     and what are all you   organs looking at .     she added .     get on with it .            they   re taking everything apart     whispered lobsang .      that   s the auditors for you     said susan .     they think that   s how you find out about things .  you know  i really loathe them .  i really do .      lobsang glanced sideways at her .  the monastery was not a single sex institution .  that is to say  it was  but corporately it had never thought of itself like that because the possibility of females working there had never crossed even minds capable of thinking in sixteen dimensions at once .  but the thieves    guild had recognized that girls were at least as good as boys in all areas of thieving   he had  for example  fond memories of his classmate steff  who could steal the small change out of your back pocket and climb better than an assassin .  he was at home around girls .  but susan scared the life out of him .  if was as if some secret place inside her boiled with wrath  and with the auditors she let it out .   he remembered her hitting that one with her wrench .  there had been just a faint frown of concentration  as if she was making certain the job was done properly .      shall we go .     he ventured .      look at them     said susan .     only an auditor would take a picture apart to see what made it a work of art .         there   s a big pile of white dust over there     said lobsang .      man with big fig leaf     said susan absently  her eyes still intent on the gray figures .     they   d dismantle a clock to search for the tick .         how do you know it   s man with big fig leaf .         i just happen to remember where it is  that   s all .         you  er  you appreciate art .     lobsang ventured .      i know what i like     said susan  still staring at the busy gray figures .     and right now i   d like quite a lot of weaponry .         we   d better move           the bastards get into your head if you let them     said susan  not moving .     when you find yourself thinking    there ought to be a law     or    i don   t make the rules  after all     or           i really think we should leave     said lobsang carefully .     and i think this because there are some of them coming up the stairs .      her head jerked around .      what are you standing about for  then .     she said .   they ran through the next arch and into a gallery of pottery  turning to look only when they reached the far end .  three auditors were following them .  they weren   t running  but there was something about their synchronized step that had a horrible we   ll keep on coming quality .      all right  let   s go this way           no  let   s go this way     said lobsang .      that   s not the way we need to go .     susan snapped .      no  but the sign up there says    arms and armor    .         so .  are you any good with weapons .         no .     said lobsang proudly  and then realized she   d taken this the wrong way .      you see  i   ve been taught to fight without           maybe there   s a sword i can use     susan growled and strode forward .   by the time the auditors entered the gallery  there were more than three of them .  the gray crowd paused .   susan had found a sword  part of a display of agatean armor .  it had been blunted by disuse  but anger flared along the blade .      should we keep running .     said lobsang .      no .  they always catch up .  i don   t know if we can kill them here but we can make them wish we could .  you still haven   t got a weapon .         no  because  you see  i   ve been trained to           just keep out of my way then  okay .      the auditors advanced cautiously  which struck lobsang as odd .      we can   t kill them .     said lobsang .      it depends on how alive they   ve let themselves become .         but they look scared     he said .      they   re human shaped     said susan over her shoulder .     human bodies .  perfect copies .  human bodies have had thousands and thousands of years of not wanting to be cut in half .  that kind of leaks into the brain  don   t you think .      and then the auditors were circling and moving in .  of course they would all attack at once .  no one would want to be first .   three made a grab at lobsang .   he   d enjoyed the fighting  back in the training dojos .  of course  everyone was padded  and no one was actually trying to kill you  and that helped .  but lobsang had done well because he was good at slicing .  he could always find that extra edge .  and if you had that edge  you didn   t need quite so much skill .   there was no edge here .  there was no time to slice .   he adopted a mixture of sna fu and okidoki and anything that worked  because you were dead if you treated a real fight like the dojo .  the gray men were no contest  in any case .  they just attempted to grab and hug .  a granny could fend them off .   he sent two reeling and turned to the third  which was trying to grab him around the neck .  he broke the hold  spun around ready to chop  and hesitated .      oh  good grief .     said a voice .   susan   s blade whirled past lobsang   s face .   the head in front of him was parted from its former body in a shower not of blood but of colored  floating dust .  the body evaporated  became very briefly a gray robed shape in the air  and vanished .   lobsang heard a couple of thumps behind him  and then susan grabbed his shoulder .      you   re not supposed to hesitate  you know .     she said .      but it was a woman .         it was not .  but it was the last one .  now let   s go  before the rest get here .     she nodded at a second group of auditors that were watching them very carefully from the end of the hall .      they weren   t much of a contest anyway     said lobsang  getting his breath .     what are those doing .         learning .  can you fight better than that .         of course .         good  because next time they   ll be as good as you just were .  where to now .         er   this way .      the next gallery was full of stuffed animals .  there   d been a vogue for it  a few centuries before .  these weren   t the sad old hunting trophy bears or geriatric tigers whose claws had faced a man armed with nothing more than five crossbows  twenty loaders  and a hundred beaters .  some of these animals were arranged in groups .  quite small groups  of quite small animals .   there were frogs  seated around a tiny dining table .  there were dogs  dressed in hunting jackets  in pursuit of a fox wearing a cap with feathers in it .  there was a monkey  playing a banjo .      oh  no  it   s an entire band     said susan in tones of horrified astonishment .      and just look at the little kittens dancing           horrible .         i wonder what happened when the man who did this met my grandfather           would he have met your grandfather .         oh yes     said susan .     oh  yes .  and my grandfather is rather fond of cats .      lobsang paused at the foot of staircase  half hidden behind a luckless elephant .  a red rope  now hard as a bar  suggested that this wasn   t part of the public museum .  there was an added hint in the shape of a notice saying     absolutely no admittance .         i should be up there     he said .      let   s not hang around  then  eh .     said susan  leaping over the rope .   the narrow stairs led up into a large bare landing .  boxes were stacked here and there .      the attics     said susan .     hold on   what   s that sign for .            keep left        lobsang read .     well  if they have to move heavy items around           look at the sign  will you .     said susan .     don   t see what you expect to see  see what   s in front of you .      lobsang looked .          what a stupid sign     he said .      hmm .  interesting  certainly     said susan .     which way do you think we should go .  i don   t think it   ll take them too long to decide to follow us .         we   re so close .  any passage might do .     said lobsang .      any passage it is  then .      susan headed for a narrow gap between packing cases .  lobsang followed .      what do you mean  decide .     he said  as they entered the gloom .      the sign on the stairs said there was no admittance .         you mean they   ll disobey it .     he stopped .      eventually .  but they   ll have a terrible feeling that they ought not to .  they obey rules .  they are the rules  in a way .         but you can   t obey the keep left right sign  no matter what you do   oh  i see           isn   t learning fun .  oh  and here   s another one .          do not feed the elephant     now that     said susan     is good .  you can   t obey it              because there   s no elephant     said lobsang .     i think i   m getting the hang of this           it   s an auditor trap     said susan  peering at a packing case .      here   s another good one     said lobsang .       ignore this sign .   by order     nice touch     susan agreed     but i   m wondering   who put up the signs .      there were voices  someone behind them .  they were low  but then one was suddenly raised .         says left but points right .  it has no sense .         the fault is yours .  we disobeyed the first sign .  woe to them that stray onto the pathway of irregularity .         don   t you give me that  you organic thing .  i raise my voice at you  you        there was a soft sound  a choking noise  and a scream that dopplered into nothing .      are they fighting one another .     said lobsang .      we can only hope so .  let   s move     said susan .  they crept on  weaving through the maze of spaces between the crates  and past a sign saying       duck     ah   now we   re getting metaphysical     said susan .      why duck .     said lobsang .      why indeed .      somewhere among the cases a voice reached the end of its tether .      what organic damn elephant .  where is the elephant .         there is no elephant .         how can there be a sign  then .         it is a         and once again the little choke and the vanishing scream .  and then   running footsteps .   susan and lobsang backed into the shadows  and then susan said     what have i put my foot in .      she reached down and picked up the soft  sticky mess .  and as she rose  she saw the auditor come around the corner .   it was wild eyed and frantic .  it focused on the pair of them with difficulty  as if trying to remember who and what they were .  but it was holding a sword  and holding it correctly .   a figure rose up behind it .  one hand grabbed it by the hair and jerked its head back .  the other was thrust over its open mouth .   the auditor struggled for a moment  and then went rigid .   and then disintegrated  tiny particles spinning away and disappearing into nothing .   for a moment the last few handfuls tried to form  in the air  the shape of a small cowled figure .  then it  too  was dragged apart  with a faint scream that was heard via the hairs on the back of the neck .   susan glared at the figure in front of her .      you   re a   you can   t be a   what are you .     she demanded .   the figure was silent .  this may have been because thick cloth covered its nose and mouth .  heavy gloves encased its hands  too .  and this was odd  because most of the rest of it was wearing a sequined evening gown .  and a mink stole .   and a knapsack .  and a huge picture hat with enough feathers to make three rare species totally extinct .   the figure rummaged in the knapsack  and then thrust out a piece of dark brown paper  as if proffering holy writ .  lobsang took it with care .      it says here     higgs   meakins luxury assortment        he said .     caramel crunch  hazelnut surprise   they   re chocolates .      susan opened her hand and looked at the crushed strawberry whirl she had picked up .  she gave the figure a careful look .      how did you know that would work .     she said .      please .  you have nothing to fear from me     said the muffled voice through the bandages .     i   m down to the ones with the nuts in now  and they don   t melt very quickly .         sorry .     said lobsang .     you just killed an auditor with a chocolate .         my last orange creme  yes .  we are exposed here .  come with me .         an auditor       susan breathed .     you   re an auditor  too .  aren   t you .  why should i trust you .         there isn   t anyone else .         but you are one of them     said susan .     i can tell  even under all that   that stuff .         i was one of them     said lady lejean .     now i rather think i   m one of me .         people were living in the attic .  there was a whole family up there .  susan wondered if their presence was official or unofficial or one of those in between states that were so common in ankh morpork  where there was always a chronic housing shortage .  so much of the city   s life took place on the street because there was no room for it inside .  whole families were raised in shifts  so that the bed could be used for twenty four hours a day .  by the look of it  the caretakers and men who knew the way to caravati   s three large pink women and one piece of gauze had moved their families into the rambling attics .   the rescuer had simply moved in on top of them .  a family  or at least one shift of it  was seated on benches around a table  frozen in timelessness .  lady lejean removed her hat  hung it on the mother  and shook out her hair .  then she unwrapped the heavy bandages from her nose and mouth .   they revealed an exquisite mask of a face that had nevertheless been made up by a clown .  probably a blind clown .  and one who was wearing boxing gloves .  in a fog .  the woman looked at the world through panda eyes and her lipstick touched her mouth only by accident .   she looked down when she caught susan   s stare .      i know what i look like     she said .     i   m afraid i   i   m losing control .  i   m sorry .  there   s just too much   it   s all too   ever since i   i just feel so       she stopped and attempted to pull herself together .     my name is myria lejean .  i know you  susan sto helit .  i do not know the young man  although there is something familiar about him .  i take it you are here to destroy the clock .         to stop it     said lobsang .      hold on  hold on     said susan .     this makes no sense .  auditors hate everything about life .  and you are an auditor  aren   t you .         i have no idea what i am     sighed lady lejean .     but right now i know that i am everything an auditor should not be .  we   they   we have to be stopped .         with chocolate .     said susan .      the sense of taste is new to us .  alien .  we have no defenses .         but   chocolate .         a dry toast almost killed me     said her ladyship .     susan  can you imagine what it is like to experience taste for the first time .  we built our bodies well .  oh  yes .  lots of taste buds .  even water is like wine .  but chocolate   even the mind stops .  there is nothing but the taste .     she sighed .     i imagine it is a wonderful way to die .         it doesn   t seem to affect you     said susan suspiciously .      the bandages and the gloves     said lady lejean .     even then  it is all i can do not to give in .  oh  where are my manners .  do sit down .  pull up a small child .      lobsang and susan exchanged a glance .  lady lejean noticed it .      i said something wrong .     she said .      we don   t use people as furniture     said susan .      but surely they will not be aware of it .     said her ladyship .      we will     said lobsang .     that   s the point  really .         ah .  i have so much to learn .  there is   there is so much context to being human  i am afraid .  you  sir  can you stop the clock .         i don   t know how to     said lobsang .     but i   i think i should know .  i   ll try .         would the clockmaker know .  he is here .         where .     said susan .      just down the passage     said lady lejean .      you carried him here .         he was barely able to walk .  he was hurt badly in the fight .         what .     said lobsang .     how could he walk at all .  we   re outside time .      susan took a deep breath .      he carries his own time  just like you     she said .     he   s your brother .      and it was a lie .  but he wasn   t ready for the truth .  by the look of his face  he wasn   t even ready for the lie .         twins     said mrs .  ogg .  she picked up the brandy glass  looked at it  and put it down .      there wasn   t one .  there was twins .  two boys .  but        she turned on susan a glare like a thermic lance .     you   ll be thinking  this is an old biddy of a midwife     she said .     you   ll be thinking  what does she know .      susan paid her the courtesy of not lying .      part of me was     she admitted .      good answer .  part of us thinks all kinds of things     said mrs .  ogg .     part of me is thinking  who   s this haughty little miss who talks to me as if i was a kiddie of five .  but most of me is thinking  she   s got a heap of troubles of her own and has seen plenty of things a human shouldn   t have to see .  mind you  part of me says  so have i .  seeing things a human shouldn   t have to see makes us human .  well  miss   if you   ve any sense  part of you is thinking  there   s a witch in front of me who   s seen my grandad many times  when she   s sat by a sickbed that   s suddenly become a deathbed  and she   ll be ready to spit in his eye when the time comes so she could probably bother me considerable right now if she puts her mind to it .  understand .  let   s all keep our parts to ourselves     and suddenly she gave susan a wink     as the high priest said to the actress .         i absolutely agree     said susan .     completely .         right     said mrs .  ogg .     so   twins   well  it was her first time  and human wasn   t exactly a familiar shape with her  i mean  you can   t do what comes naturally when you ain   t exactly natural and   twins ain   t quite the right word              a brother     said lobsang .     the clockmaker .         yes     said susan .      but i was a foundling .         so was he .         i want to see him now .         that might not be a good idea     said susan .      i am not interested in your opinion  thank you .     lobsang turned to lady lejean .     down that passage .         yes .  but he is asleep .  i think the clock upset his mind  and also he was hit in the fight .  he says things in his sleep .         says what .         the last thing i heard him say before i came to find you was    we   re so close  any passage might do        said her ladyship .  she looked from one to the other .     have i said the wrong thing .      susan put her hand over her eyes .  oh dear        i said that     said lobsang .     just after we came up the stairs .     he glared at susan .     twins  right .  i   ve heard about this sort of thing .  what one thinks the other thinks  too .      susan sighed .  sometimes  she thought  i really am a coward .      something like that  yes     she said .      i   m going to see him  then  even if he can   t see me .      damn  thought susan  and hurried after lobsang as he headed along the passage .  lady lejean trailed behind them both  looking concerned .   jeremy was lying on a bed  although it was no softer than anything else in the timeless world .  lobsang stopped and stared .      he looks   quite like me     he said .      oh  yes     said susan .      thinner  perhaps .         could be  yes .         different   lines on his face .         you   ve led different lives     said susan .      how did you know about him and me .         my grandfather takes  er  an interest in this sort of thing .  i found out some more by myself  too     she said .      why should we interest anyone .  we   re not special .         this is going to be quite hard to explain .     susan looked around at lady lejean .      how safe are we here .         the signs upset them     said her ladyship .     they tend to keep away .  i   shall we say   took care of the ones who followed you .         then you   d better sit down  mr .  ludd     said susan .     it might help if i told you about me .         well .         my grandfather is death .         that   s a strange thing to say .  death is just the end of life .  it   s not a   a person        pay attention to me when i am talking to you     a wind whipped around the room  and the light changed .  shadows formed on susan   s face .  a faint blue light outlined her .   lobsang swallowed .   the light faded .  the shadows vanished .      there is a process called death  and there is a person called death     said susan .     that is how it works .  and i am death   s granddaughter .  am i going too fast for you .         er   no   although right up until just now you looked human     said lobsang .      both my parents were human .  there   s more than one kind of genetics .     susan paused .     you look human  too .  human is a very popular look in these parts .  you   d be amazed .         except that i am human .      susan gave a little smile that  on anyone less obviously in full control of themselves  might have seemed slightly nervous .      yes     she said .     and  then again  no .         no .         take war  now     said susan  backing away from the point .     big man  hearty laugh  tends to fart after meals .  as human as the next man  you say .  but the next man is death .  he   s human shaped  too .  and that   s because humans invented the idea of   of   of ideas  and they think in human shapes           get back to the    and  then again  no     will you .         your mother is time .         no one knows who my mother is .         i could take you to the midwife     said susan .     your father found the best there   s ever been .  she delivered you .  your mother was time .      lobsang sat with his mouth open .      it was easier for me     said susan .     when i was very small my parents used to let me visit my grandfather .  i thought every grandfather had a long black robe and rode a pale horse .  and then they decided that maybe that wasn   t the right environment for a child .  they were worried about how i was going to grow up .     she laughed mirthlessly .      i had a very strange education  you know .  maths  logic  that sort of thing .  and then  when i was a bit younger than you  a rat turned up in my room and suddenly everything i thought i knew was wrong .         i   m a human .  i do human things .  i   d know if           you had to live in the world .  otherwise  how could you learn to be human .     said susan as kindly as she could .      and my brother .  what about him .      here it comes  susan thought .      he   s not your brother     said susan .     i lied a bit .  i   m sorry .         but you said           i had to lead up to it     said susan .     it   s one of those things you have to get hold of a bit at a time  i   m afraid .  he   s not your brother .  he   s you .         then who am i .      susan sighed .     you .  both of you   are you .            and there i was  and there she was     said mrs .  ogg     and out the baby came  no problem there  but that   s always a tryin    moment for the new mum  and there was       she paused  her eyes peering through the windows of memory     like   like a feelin   that the world had stuttered  and i was holdin    the baby and i looked down and there was me deliverin    a baby  and i looked at me  and i looked at me  and i remember saying     this is a fine to do  mrs .  ogg     and she  who was me  said     you never said a truer word  mrs .  ogg     and then it all went strange and there i was  just one of me  holding two babies .         twins     susan said .      you could call them twins  yes  i s   pose you could     said mrs .  ogg .     but i always thought that twins is two little souls born once  not one born twice .      susan waited .  mrs .  ogg looked in the mood to talk .      so i said to the man  i said     what now .    and he said     is that any business of yours .     and i said he could be damn sure it was my business and he could look me in the eye and i   d speak my mind to anyone .  but i was thinking  you   re in trouble now  my girl     cos it   d all gone myffic .         mythic .     said schoolteacher susan .      yep .  with extra myff .  and you can get into big trouble  with myffic .  but the man just smiled and said he must be brought up human until he   s of age and i thought  yep  it   s gone myffic all right .  i could see he hadn   t got a clue about what to do next and it was all going to be down to me .     mrs .  ogg took a suck at her pipe  and her eyes twinkled at susan through the smoke .     i don   t know how much experience you have with this sort of thing  my girl  but sometimes when the high and mighty make big plans they don   t always think about the fine detail  right .      yes .  i   m a fine detail  susan thought .  one day death took it into his skull to adopt a motherless child  and i   m a fine detail .  she nodded .      i thought  how does this go  in a myffic kind of way .     mrs .  ogg went on .     i mean  technic   ly i could see we   re in that area where the prince gets brought up as a swineherd until he manifests his destiny  but there   s not that many swineherding jobs around these days and poking hogs with a stick is not all it   s cracked up to be  believe you me .  so i said  well  i   d heard the guilds down in the big cities took in foundlings out of charity  and looked after them well enough  and there   s many well set up men and women who started life that way .  there   s no shame in it  plus  if the destiny doesn   t manifest as per schedule  he   d have set his hands to a good trade  which would be a consolation .  whereas swineherding   s just swineherding .  you   re giving me a stern look  miss .         well  yes .  it was rather a chilly decision  wasn   t it .         someone has to make    em     said mrs .  ogg sharply .     besides  i   ve been around for some time and i   ve noticed that them as has it in them to shine will shine through six layers of muck  whereas those who ain   t shiny won   t shine however much you buff    em .  you may think otherwise  but it was me standing there .      she investigated the bowl of her pipe with a matchstick .   eventually she went on     and that was it .  i would have stayed  of course  because there wasn   t so much as a crib in the place  but the man took me aside and said thank you and that it was time to go .  and why would i argue .  there was love there .  it was in the air .  but i won   t say that i don   t sometimes wonder how it all turned out .  i really do .         there were differences  susan had to admit .  two different lives had indeed burned their unique tracks on the faces .  and the selves had been born a second or so apart  and a lot of the universe can change in a second .   think of identical twins  she told herself .  but they are two different selves occupying bodies that  at least  start out identical .  they don   t start out as identical selves .      he looks quite like me     said lobsang  and susan blinked .  she leaned closer to the unconscious form of jeremy .      say that again     she said .      i said  he looks quite like me     said lobsang .   susan glanced at lady lejean  who said     i saw it too  susan .         who saw what .     said lobsang .     what are you hiding from me .         his lips move when you speak     said susan .     they try to form the same words .         he can pick up my thoughts .         it   s more complicated than that  i think .     susan picked up a limp hand and gently pinched the web of skin between thumb and forefinger .   lobsang winced and glanced at his own hand .  a patch of white skin was reddening .      not just thoughts     said susan .     this close  you feel his pain .  your speech controls his lips .      lobsang stared down at jeremy .      then what will happen     he said slowly     when he comes round .         i   m wondering the same thing     said susan .     perhaps you shouldn   t be here .         but this is where i have to be .         we  at least  should not stay here     said lady lejean .     i know my kind .  they will have been discussing what to do .  the signs will not hold them forever .  and i have run out of soft centers .         what are you supposed to do when you are where you   re supposed to be .     said susan .   lobsang reached down and touched jeremy   s hand with his fingertip .   the world went white .   susan wondered later if this was what it would be like at the heart of a star .  it wouldn   t be yellow  you wouldn   t see fire  there would just be the searing whiteness of every overloaded sense screaming all at once .   it faded  gradually  into a mist .  the walls of the room appeared  but she could see through them .  there were other walls beyond  and other rooms  transparent as ice and visible only at the corners and where the light caught them .  in each one  another susan was turning to look at her .   the rooms went on forever .   susan was sensible .  it was  she knew  a major character flaw .  it did not make you popular  or cheerful  and   this seemed to her to be the most unfair bit   it didn   t even make you right .  but it did make you definite  and she was definite that what was happening around her was not  in any accepted sense  real .   that was not in itself a problem .  most of the things humans busied themselves with weren   t real  either .  but sometimes the mind of the most sensible person encountered something so big  so complex  so alien to all understanding  that it told itself little stories about it instead .  then  when it felt it understood the story  it felt it understood the huge incomprehensible thing .  and this  susan knew  was her mind telling itself a story .   there was a sound like great  heavy  metal doors slamming  one after another  getting louder and faster     the universe reached a decision .   the other glass rooms vanished .  the walls clouded .  color rose  pastel at first  then darkening  as timeless reality flowed back .   the bed was empty .  lobsang had gone .  but the air was full of slivers of blue light  turning and swirling like ribbons in a storm .   susan remembered to breathe again .      oh     she said aloud .     destiny .      she turned .  the bedraggled lady lejean was still staring at the empty bed .      is there another way out of here .         there   s an elevator at the end of the corridor  susan  but what happened to           not susan     said susan sharply .     it   s miss susan .  i   m only susan to my friends  and you are not one of them .  i don   t trust you at all .         i don   t trust me  either     said lady lejean meekly .     does that help .         show me this elevator  will you .      it turned out to be nothing more than a large box  the size of a small room  that hung from a web of ropes and pulleys in the ceiling .  it had been installed recently  by the look of it  to move the large works of art around .  sliding doors occupied most of one wall .      there are capstans in the cellar for winching in up     said lady lejean .     downward journeys are slowed safely because of a mechanism by which the weight of the descending elevator causes water to be pumped up into rainwater cisterns on the roof  which  in turn  can be released back into a hollow counterweight that assists in the elevation of heavier items of           thank you     said susan quickly .     but what it really needs in order to descend is time .     under her breath  she added     can you help .      the ribbons of blue light orbited her  like puppies anxious to play  and then drifted toward the elevator .      however     she added     i believe time is on our side now .         miss tangerine was amazed at how fast a body learned .   until now  auditors had learned by counting .  sooner or later  everything came down to numbers .  if you knew all the numbers  you knew everything .  often the    later    was a lot later  but that did not matter because for an auditor time was just another number .  but a brain  a few soggy pounds of gristle  counted numbers so fast that they stopped being numbers at all .  she   d been astonished at how easily it could direct a hand to catch a ball in the air  calculating future positions of hand and ball without her even being aware of it .   the senses seemed to operate and present her with conclusions before she had time to think .   at the moment she was trying to explain to other auditors that not feeding an elephant when there was no elephant not to feed was not  in fact  impossible .  miss tangerine was one of the faster learning auditors and had already formulated a group of things  events  and situations that she categorized as    bloody stupid .     things that were    bloody stupid    could be dismissed .   some of the others were having difficulty understanding this  but now she stopped in midharangue when she heard the rumble of the elevator .      do we have anyone upstairs .     she demanded .   the auditors around her shook their heads .     ignore this sign    had produced too much confusion .      then someone is coming down .     said miss tangerine .     they are out of place .  they must be stopped .         we must discuss       an auditor began .      do what i say  you organic organ .            it   s a matter of personalities     said lady lejean  as susan pushed open a door in the roof and stepped out onto the leads .      yes .     said susan  looking around at the silent city .     i thought you didn   t have them .         they will have them now     said lady lejean  climbing out behind her .     and personalities define themselves in terms of other personalities .      susan  prowling along the parapet  considered this strange statement .      you mean there will be flaming rows .     she said .      yes .  we have never had egos before .         well  you seem to be managing .         only by becoming completely and utterly insane     said her ladyship .   susan turned .  lady lejean   s hat and dress had become even more tattered  and she was shedding sequins .  the journey through the museum had done nothing at all for her makeup  either .      you don   t look insane     lied susan .     as such .         thank you .  but sanity is defined by the majority  i am afraid .  do you know the saying    the whole is greater than the sum of the parts    .         of course .     susan scanned the rooftops for a way down .  she did not need this .  the   thing seemed to want to talk .  or  rather  to chatter aimlessly .      it is an insane statement .  it is a nonsense .  but now i believe that it is true .         good .  that elevator should be getting down about   now .         slivers of blue light  like trout slipping through a stream  danced around the elevator door .   the auditors gathered .  they had been learning .  many of them had acquired weapons .  and a number of them had taken care not to communicate to the others that gripping something offensive in the hand seemed a very natural thing to do .  it spoke to something right down in the back of the brain .   it was  therefore  unfortunate that when a couple of them pulled open the elevator door it was to reveal  slightly melting in the middle of the floor  a cherry liqueur chocolate .   the scent wafted .   there was only one survivor and  when miss tangerine ate the chocolate  there wasn   t even that .         one of life   s little certainties     said susan  standing on the edge of the museum   s parapet     is that there is generally a last chocolate hidden in all those empty wrappers .      then she reached down and grabbed the top of a drainpipe .   she wasn   t certain how this would work .  if she fell   but would she fall .  there was no time to fall .  she had her own personal time .  in theory  if anything so definite as a theory existed in a case like this  that meant she could just drift down to the ground .  but the time to test a theory like that was when you had no other choice .  a theory was just an idea  but a drainpipe was a fact .   the blue light flickered around her hands .      lobsang .     she said quietly     it is you  isn   t it .      that name is as good as any for us .  the voice was as faint as a breath .      this may seem a stupid question  but where are you .      we are just a memory .  and i am weak .      oh .     susan slid a little further .   but i will grow strong .  get to the clock .      what   s the point .  there was nothing we could do .      times have changed .   susan reached the ground .  lady lejean followed  moving clumsily .  her evening dress had acquired several more tears .      may i offer a fashion tip .     said susan .      it would be welcomed     said her ladyship politely .      long cerise bloomers with that dress .  not a good idea .         no .  they are very colorful  and quite warm .  what should i have chosen instead .         with that cut .  practically nothing .         that would have been acceptable .         er       susan blanched at the thought of unfolding the complex laws of lingerie to someone who wasn   t even  she felt  anybody .     to anyone likely to find out  yes     she finished .     it would take too long to explain .      lady lejean sighed .      all of it does     she said .     even clothing .  skin substitutes to preserve body heat .  so simple .  so easy to say .  but there are so many rules and exceptions  impossible to understand .      susan looked along broad way .  it was thick with silent traffic  but there was no sign of an auditor .      we   ll run into more of them     she said aloud .      yes .  there will be hundreds  at least     said lady lejean .      why .         because we have always wondered what life is like .         then let   s get up into zephire street     said susan .      what is there for us .         wienrich and boettcher .         who are they .         i think the original herr wienrich and frau boettcher died a long time ago .  but the shop still does very good business     said susan  darting across the street .     we need ammunition .      lady lejean caught up .      oh .  they make chocolate .     she said .      does a bear poo in the woods .     said susan and realized her mistake straight away .    too late .  lady lejean looked thoughtful for a moment .      yes     she said at last .     yes  i believe that most varieties do  indeed  excrete  as you suggest  at least in the temperate zones  but there are several that           i meant to say that  yes  they make chocolate     said susan .      vanity  vanity  thought lu tze  as the milk cart rattled through the silent city .  ronnie would have been like a god  and people of that stripe don   t like hiding .  not really hiding .  they like to leave a little clue  some emerald tablet somewhere  some code in some tomb under the desert  something to say to the keen researcher  i was here  and i was great .   what else had the first people been afraid of .  night  maybe .  cold .  bears .  winter .  stars .  the endless sky .  spiders .  snakes .  one another .  people had been afraid of so many things     he reached into his pack for the battered copy of the way  and opened it at random .   koan ninety seven     do unto otters as you would have them do unto you .     hmm .  no real help there .  besides  he   d occasionally been unsure that he   d written that one down properly  although it certainly had worked .  he   d always left aquatic mammals well alone  and they had done the same to him .   he tried again .   koan one hundred and twenty four     it   s amazing what you see if you keep your eyes open .         what   s the book  monk .     said ronnie .      oh  just   a little book     said lu tze .  he looked around .   the cart was passing a funeral parlor .  the owner had invested in a large plate glass window  even though the professional undertaker does not  in truth  have that much to sell that looks good in a window  and they usually make do with dark  somber drapes and perhaps a tasteful urn .   and the name of the fifth horseman .      hah .     said lu tze quietly .      something funny  monk .         obvious  when you think about it     said lu tze  as much to himself as to ronnie .  then he turned in his seat and stuck out his hand .      pleased to meet you     he said .     let me guess your name .      and said it .      susan had been unusually inexact .  to call wienrich and boettcher    chocolate makers    was like calling leonard of quirm    a decent painter who also tinkered with things     or death    not someone you   d want to meet every day .     it was accurate  but it didn   t tell the whole story .   for one thing  they didn   t make  they created .  there   s an important difference .   and  while their select little shop sold the results  it didn   t do anything so crass as to fill the window with them .  that would suggest   well  overeagerness .  generally  w b had a display of silk and velvet drapes with  on a small stand  perhaps one of their special pralines or no more than three of their renowned frosted caramels .  there was no price tag .  if you had to ask the price of w b   s chocolates  you couldn   t afford them .  and if you   d tasted one and still couldn   t afford them  you   d save and scrimp and rob and sell elderly members of your family for just one more of those mouthfuls that fell in love with your tongue and turned your soul to whipped cream .   there was a discreet drain in the pavement in case people standing in front of the window drooled too much .   wienrich and boettcher were  naturally  foreigners  and according to ankh morpork   s guild of confectioners  they did not understand the peculiarities of the city   s taste buds .  ankh morpork people  said the guild  were hearty  no nonsense folk who did not want chocolate that was stuffed with cocoa liquor and were certainly not like effete la di dah foreigners who wanted cream in everything .  in fact  they actually preferred chocolate made mostly from milk  sugar  suet  hooves  lips  miscellaneous squeezings  rat droppings  plaster  flies  tallow  bits of tree  hair  lint  spiders  and powdered cocoa husks .  this meant that  according to the food standards of the great chocolate centers in borogravia and quirm  ankh morpork chocolate was formally classed as    cheese    and only escaped  through being the wrong color  being defined as    tile grout .      susan allowed herself one of their cheaper boxes per month .  and she could easily stop at the first layer if she wanted to .      you needn   t come in     she said  as she opened the shop door .  rigid customers lined the counter .      please call me myria .         i don   t think i           please .     said lady lejean meekly .     a name is important .      suddenly  in spite of everything  susan felt a brief pang of sympathy for the creature .      oh  very well .  myria  you needn   t come in .         i can stand it .         but i thought chocolate was a raging temptation .     said susan  being firm with herself .      it is .      they stared up at the shelves behind the counter .      myria   myria     said susan  speaking only some of her thoughts aloud .     from the ephebian word myrios  meaning    innumerable .     and lejean as a crude pun of    legion      oh dear .         we thought a name should say what a thing is     said her ladyship .     and there is safety in numbers .  i am sorry .         well  these are their basic assortments     said susan  dismissing the shop display with a wave of her hand .     let   s try the back room   are you all right .         i am fine  i   fine       murmured lady lejean  swaying .      you   re not going to pig out on me  are you .         we   i   know about willpower .  the body craves the chocolate but the mind does not .  at least   so i tell myself .  and it must be true .  the mind can overrule the body .  otherwise  what is it for .         i   ve often wondered     said susan  pushing open another door .     ah .  the magician   s cave           magic .  they used magic here .         nearly right        lady lejean leaned on the door frame for support when she saw the tables .      oh     she said .     uh   i can detect   sugar  milk  butter  cream  vanilla  hazelnuts  almonds  walnuts  raisins  orange peel  various liqueurs  citrus pectin  strawberries  raspberries  essence of violets  cherries  pineapples  pistachios  oranges  limes  lemons  coffee  cocoa           nothing there to be frightened of  right .     said susan  surveying the workshop for useful weaponry .     cocoa is just a rather bitter bean  after all .         yes  but       lady lejean clenched her fists  shut her eyes and bared her teeth     put them all together and they make           steady  steady           the will can overrule the emotions  the will can overrule the instincts       the auditor chanted .      good  good  now just work your way up to the bit where it says chocolate  okay .         that   s the hard one .      in fact  it seemed to susan  as she walked past the vats and counters  that chocolate lost some of its attraction when you saw it like this .  it was the difference between seeing the little heaps of pigment and seeing the whole picture .  she selected a syringe that seemed designed to do something intensely personal to female elephants  although she decided that here it was probably used for doing the wiggly bits of decoration .   and over here was a small vat of cocoa liquor .   she stared around at the trays and trays of fondant cremes  marzipans  and caramels .  oh  and here was an entire table of soul cake eggs .  but these weren   t the hollow shelled  cardboard tasting presents for children  oh no   these were the confectionery equivalent of fine  intricate jewelery .   out of the corner of her eye she saw movement .  one of the statuelike workers bent over her tray of praline dreams was shifting almost imperceptibly .   time was flowing into the room .  pale blue light glinted in the air .   she turned and saw a vaguely human figure hovering beside her .  it was featureless and as transparent as mist  but in her head it said  i   m stronger .  you are my anchor  my link to this world  can you guess how hard it is to find it again in so many .    get me to the clock     susan turned and thrust the icing syringe into the arms of the groaning myria .     grab that .  and make some kind of   of sling or something .  i want you to be carrying as many of those chocolate eggs as possible .  and the cremes .  and the liqueurs .  understand .  you can do it .      oh  gods  there was no alternative .  the poor thing needed some kind of morale boost .     please  myria .  and that   s a stupid name .  you   re not many  you   re one .  okay .  just be   yourself .  unity   that   d be a good name .      the new unity raised a mascara streaked face .      yes   it is   it   s a good name        susan snatched as much merchandise as she could carry  aware of some rustling behind her  and turned to find unity standing to attention holding  by the look of it  a benchworth of assorted confectionery in        a sort of a big cerise sack .      oh .  good .  intelligent use of the materials at hand     said susan weakly .  then the teacher within her cut in and added     i hope you brought enough for everybody .            you were the first     said lu tze .     you basically created the whole business .  innovative  you were .         that was then     said ronnie soak .     it   s all changed now .         not like it used to be     agreed lu tze .      take death     said ronnie soak .     impressive  i   ll grant you  and who doesn   t look good in black .  but  after all  death   what   s death .         just a big sleep     said lu tze .      just a big sleep     said ronnie soak .     as for the others   war .  if war   s so bad  why do people keep doing it .         practically a hobby     said lu tze .  he began to roll himself a cigarette .      practically a hobby     repeated ronnie soak .     as for famine and pestilence  well           enough said     said lu tze  sympathetically .      exactly .  i mean  famine   s a fearful thing  obviously              in an agricultural community  but you   ve got to move with the times     said lu tze  putting the roll up in his mouth .      you   ve put your finger right on it .  you   ve got to move with the times .  i mean  does your average city person fear famine .         no  he thinks food grows in shops     said lu tze .  he was beginning to enjoy this .  he had eight hundred years    worth of experience in steering the thoughts of his superiors  and most of them had been intelligent .  he decided to strike out a little .      fire  now  city folk really fear fire     he said .     that   s new .  your primitive villager  he reckoned fire was a good thing  didn   t he .  kept the wolves away .  if it burned down his hut  well  logs and turf are cheap enough .  but now he lives in a street of crowded wooden houses and everyone   s cooking in their rooms  well        ronnie glared .      fire .  fire .  just a demigod .  some little runt of a thief pinches the flame from the gods and suddenly he   s immortal .  you call that training and experience .     a spark leaped from his fingers and ignited the end of lu tze   s cigarette .     and as for gods           johnny come latelys  the pack of    em     said lu tze quickly .      right .  people started worshiping them because they were afraid of me     said ronnie .     did you know that .         no  really .     said lu tze innocently .   but now ronnie sagged .      that was then  of course     he said .     it   s different now .  i   m not what i used to be .         no  no  obviously not  no     said lu tze soothingly .     but it   s all a matter of how you look at it  am i correct .  now  supposing a man   that is to say  a           anthropomorphic personification     said ronnie soak .     but i   ve always preferred the term    avatar .         lu tze   s brow wrinkled .      you fly around a lot .     he said .      that would be aviator .         sorry .  well  supposing an avatar  thank you  who was perhaps a bit ahead of his time thousands of years ago  well  supposing he took a good look around now  he might just find the world is ready for him again .      lu tze waited .      my abbot  now  he reckons you are the bee   s knees     he said for a little reinforcement .      does he .     said ronnie soak suspiciously .      bee   s knees  cat   s pajamas  and dog   s   elbows     lu tze finished .     he   s written scrolls and scrolls about you .  says you are hugely important in understanding how the universe works .         yeah  but   he   s just one man     said ronnie soak  with all the sullenness and reluctance of someone cuddling a lifetime   s huge snit like a favorite soft toy .      technically  yes     said lu tze .     but he   s an abbot .  and brainy .  he thinks such big thoughts he needs a second lifetime just to finish them off .  let a lot of peasants fear famine  i say  but someone like you should aim for quality .  and you look at the cities  now .  back in the old days there were just heaps of mud bricks with names like ur and uh and ugg .  these days there   s millions of people living in cities .  very  very complicated cities .  just you think about what they really  really fear .  and fear   well  fear is belief .  hmm .      there was another long pause .      well  alright  but       ronnie began .      of course  they won   t be living in    em very long  because by the time the gray people have finished taking them to pieces to see how they work there won   t be any belief left .         my customers do depend on me       ronnie soak mumbled .      what customers .  that   s soak speaking     said lu tze .     that   s not the voice of kaos .         hah .     said kaos bitterly .     you haven   t told me yet how you worked that one out .      because i   ve got more than three brain cells  and you   re vain  and you painted your actual name back to front on your cart whether you knew it or not  and a dark window is a mirror  and k and s are still recognizable in a reflection even when they   re back to front  thought lu tze .  but that wasn   t a good way forward .      it was just obvious     he said .     you sort of shine through .  it   s like putting a sheet over an elephant .  you might not be able to see it  but you   re sure the elephant   s still there .      kaos looked wretched .      i don   t know     he said     it   s been a long time           oh .  and i thought you said you were number one .     said lu tze  deciding on a new approach .     sorry .  still  i suppose it   s not your fault you   ve lost a few skills over the centuries  what with one thing and           lost skills .     snapped kaos  waving a finger under the sweeper   s nose .     i could certainly take you to the cleaners  you little maggot .         what with  a dangerous yogurt .     said lu tze  climbing off the cart .  kaos leaped down after him .      where do you get off  talking to me like that .     he demanded .   lu tze glanced up .      corner of merchant and broad way     he said .     so what .      kaos roared .  he tore off his striped apron and his white cap .  he seemed to grow in size .  darkness evaporated off him like smoke .       lu tze folded his hands and grinned .      remember rule one     he said .      rules .  rules .  .  i   m kaos .         who was the first .     said lu tze .      yes .         creator and destroyer .         right .         apparently complicated  apparently patternless behavior that nevertheless has a simple  deterministic explanation and is a key to new levels of understanding of the multidimensional universe .         you   d better believe it   what .         got to move with the times  mister  got to keep up .     shouted lu tze excitedly  hopping from foot to foot .     you   re what people think you are .  and they   ve changed you .  i hope you   re good at sums .         you can   t tell me what to be .     kaos roared .     i   m kaos .         you don   t think so .  well  your big comeback ain   t gonna happen now that the auditors have taken over .  the rules  mister .  that   s what they are .  they   re the cold  dead rules .      silver lightning flickered in the walking cloud that had once been ronnie .  then cloud  cart  and horse vanished .      well  could have been worse  i suppose     said lu tze to himself .     not a very bright lad  really .  possibly a bit too old fashioned .      he turned around and found a crowd of auditors watching him .  there were dozens of them .   he sighed and grinned his sheepish little grin .  he   d had just about enough for one day .      well  i expect you have heard of rule one  right .     he said .   that seemed to give them pause .  one said     we know millions of rules  human .         billions .  trillions     said another .      well  you can   t attack me     said lu tze        cos of rule one .      the nearest auditors went into a huddle .      it must involve gravitation .         no  quantum effects .  obviously .         logically  there cannot be a rule one because at that point there would be no concept of plurality .         but if there is not a rule one  can there be any other rules .  if there is no rule one  where is rule two .         there are millions of rules .  they cannot fail to be numbered .      wonderful  thought lu tze .  all i have to do is wait until their heads explode .   but an auditor stepped forward .  it looked more wild eyed than the others  and was much more unkempt .  it was also carrying an ax .      we do not have to discuss this     it snapped .     we must think  this is nonsense  we will not discuss it .         but what is rule       an auditor began .      you will call me mr .  white .         mr .  white  what is rule one .         i am not glad you asked that question .     screamed mr .  white and swung the ax .  the body of the other auditor crumbled in around the blade  dissolving into floating motes that dispersed in a fine cloud .        anyone else got any questions .     said mr .  white  raising the ax again .   one or two auditors  not yet entirely in tune with current developments  opened their mouths to speak .  and shut them again .   lu tze took a few steps back .  he prided himself on an incredibly well honed ability to talk his way in or out of anything  but that rather depended on a passably sane entity being involved at the other end of the dialogue .   mr .  white turned to lu tze .      what are you doing out of your place  organic .      but lu tze was overhearing another  whispered conversation .  it was coming from the other side of a nearby wall  and it went like this      who cares about the damn wording .         accuracy is important  susan .  there is a precise description on the little map inside the lid .  look .         and you think that will impress anyone .         please .  things should be done properly .         oh  give it to me  then .      mr .  white advanced on lu tze  ax raised .      it is forbidden to       he began .      eat   oh  good grief   eat      a delicious fondant sugar creme infused with delightfully rich and creamy raspberry filling wrapped in mysterious dark chocolate      you gray bastards .      a shower of small objects pattered down on the street .  several of them broke open .   lu tze heard a whine or  rather  the silence caused by the absence of a whine he   d grown used to .      oh no  i   m winding dow           trailing smoke  but looking more like a milkman again  albeit one that   d just delivered to a blazing house  ronnie soak stormed into his dairy .        who does he think he is .     he muttered  gripping the spotless edge of a counter so hard that the metal bent .     hah  oh yes  they just toss you aside  but when they want you to make a comeback        under his fingers  the metal went white hot and then dripped .      i   ve got customers .  i   ve got customers .  people depend on me .  it might not be a glamorous job  but people will always need milk        he clapped a hand to his forehead .  where the molten metal touched his skin  the metal evaporated .   the headache was really bad .   he could remember the time when there was only him .  it was hard to remember  because   there was nothing  no color  no sound  no pressure  no time  no spin  no light  no life     just kaos .   and the thought arose  do i want that again .  the perfect order that goes with changelessness .   more thoughts were following that one  like little silvery eels in his mind .  he was  after all  a horseman  and had been ever since the time the people in mud cities on baking plains put together some hazy idea of something that had existed before anyone else .  and a horseman picks up the noises of the world .  the mud city people and the skin tent people  they   d known instinctively that the world swirled perilously through a complex and uncaring multiverse  that life was lived a mirror   s thickness from the cold of space and the gulfs of night .  they knew that everything they called reality  the web of rules that made life happen  was a bubble on the tide .  they feared old kaos .  but now     he opened his eyes and looked down at his dark  smoking hands .   to the world in general  he said     who am i now .          lu tze heard his voice speed up from nothing        wn           no  you   re wound up again     said a young woman in front of him .  she stood back  giving him a critical look .  lu tze  for the first time in eight hundred years  felt that he   d been caught doing something wrong .  it was that kind of expression   searching  rummaging around inside his head .      you   ll be lu tze  then     said susan .     i   m susan sto helit .  no time for explanations .  you   ve been out for   well  not for long .  we have to get lobsang to the glass clock .  are you any good .  lobsang thinks you   re a bit of a fraud .         only a bit .  i   m surprised .     lu tze looked around .     what happened here .      the street was empty  except for the ever present statues .  but scraps of silver paper and colored wrappers littered the ground  and across the wall behind him was a long splash of what looked very much like chocolate icing .      some of them got away     said susan  picking up what lu tze could only hope was a giant icing syringe .     mostly they fought with one another .  would you try to tear someone apart just for a coffee creme .      lu tze looked into those eyes .  after eight hundred years you learn how to read people .  and susan was a story that went back a very long way .  she probably even knew about rule one  and didn   t care .  this was someone to treat with respect .  but you couldn   t let even someone like her have it all their own way .      the kind with a coffee bean on the top  or the ordinary kind .     he said .      the kind without the coffee bean  i think     said susan  holding his gaze .      nnn   o .  no .  no  i don   t think i would     said lu tze .      but they are learning     said a woman   s voice behind the sweeper .     some resisted .  we can learn .  that   s how humans became humans .        lu tze regarded the speaker .  she looked like a society lady who had just had a really bad day in a threshing machine .      can i just be clear here .     he said  staring from one woman to the other .     you   ve been fighting the gray people with chocolate .         yes     said susan  peering around the corner .     it   s the sensory explosion .  they lose control of their morphic field .  can you throw at all .  good .  unity  give him as many chocolate eggs as he can carry .  the secret is to get them to land hard so that there   s lots of shrapnel           and where is lobsang .     said lu tze .      him .  you could say he   s with us in spirit .      there were blue sparkles in the air .      growing pains  i think     susan added .   centuries of experience once again came to lu tze   s aid .      he always looked like a lad who needed to find himself     he said .      yes .  and it came as a bit of a shock .  let   s go .         death looked down at the world .  timelessness had reached the rim now and was expanding into the universe at the speed of light .  the discworld was a sculpture in crystal .   not an apocalypse .  there had always been plenty of those   small apocalypses  not the full shilling at all  fake apocalypses  apocryphal apocalypses .  most of them had been back in the old days  when the world as in    end of the world    was often objectively no wider than a few villages and a clearing in the forest .   and those little worlds had ended .  but there had always been somewhere else .  there had been the horizon  to start with .  the fleeing refugees would find that the world was bigger than they   d thought .  a few villages in a clearing .  hah  how could they have been so stupid .  now they knew it was a whole island .  of course  there was that horizon again       the world had run out of horizons .   as death watched  the sun stopped in its orbit  and its light became duller  redder .   he sighed and nudged binky .  the horse stepped forward  in a direction that could not be found on any map .   and the sky was full of gray shapes .  there was a ripple in the ranks of auditors as the pale horse trotted forward .   one drifted toward death and hung in the air a few feet away .   it said  should you not be riding out .   do you speak for all .   you know the custom  said the voice in death   s mind .  among us  one speaks for all .   what is being done is wrong .   it is not your business .   nevertheless  we are all answerable .   the universe will last forever  said the voice .  everything preserved  ordered  understood  lawful  filed   changeless .  a perfect world .  finished .   no .   it will all end one day in any case .   but this is too soon .  there is unfinished business .   and that is    .   everything .   and  with a flash of light  a figure cloth  d all in white appeared  holding a book in one hand .   it looked from death to the endlessly massing ranks of the auditors  and said      sorry .  is this the right place .         two auditors were measuring the number of atoms in a paving slab .  it existed  and therefore it had to be measured .   they looked up at a movement .      good afternoon     said lu tze .     may i draw your attention to the notice my assistant is holding up .        susan held up the sign .  it read  mouths must be open .  by order .   and lu tze unfolded his hands .  there was a caramel in each one  and he was a good shot .   the mouths shut .  the faces went impassive .  then there was a sound somewhere between a purr and a wail  which disappeared into the ultrasonic .  and then   the auditors dissolved  gently  first going fuzzy around the edges and  as the process accelerated  swiftly becoming a spreading cloud .      hand to mouth fighting     said lu tze .     why doesn   t it happen to humans .         lt nearly does     said susan  and when they stared at her  she blinked and said     to stupid  indulgent humans  anyway .         you don   t have to concentrate to stay the same shape     said unity .     and that was the last of the caramels  by the way .         no  there   s six in one of b w   s gold selections     said susan .     three have got white chocolate cream in dark chocolate and three have got whipped cream in milk chocolate .  they   re the ones in the silver wrapp   look  i just happen to know things  all right .  let   s keep going  okay .  without mentioning chocolate .         you have no power over us  said the auditor .  we are not alive .   but you are demonstrating arrogance  pride  and stupidity .  these are emotions .  i would say they are signs of life .      excuse me .     said the shining figure in white .   but you are all alone here .      excuse me .      yes .  said death .  what is it .      this is the apocalypse  yes .     said the shining figure petulantly .   we are talking .        yes  right  but is it the apocalypse .  the actual end of the actual whole world .      no  said the auditor .   yes  said death .  it is .      great .     said the figure  what .  said the auditor .   what .  said death .   the figure looked embarrassed .      well  not great  obviously .  obviously not great  as such .  but it   s what i   m here for .  it   s what i   m for  really .     it held up a book .     er   i   ve got the place marked ready .  wow .  it   s been  you know  so long        death glanced at the book .  the cover and all the pages were made of iron .  realization dawned .   you are the angel clothed all in white of the iron book from the prophecies of tobrun  am i correct .      that   s right .     the pages clanged as the angel hurriedly thumbed through them .     and it   s cloth  d  by the way  if you don   t mind .  clo theddd .  just a detail  i know  but i like to get it right .      what is happening here .  the auditor growled .   i don   t know how to tell you this  said death  ignoring the interruption  but you are not official .   the pages stopped clanking .      what do you mean .     said the angel suspiciously .   the book of tobrun has not been considered official church dogma for a hundred years .  the prophet brutha revealed that the whole chapter was a metaphor for a power struggle within the early church .  it is not included in the revised version of the book of om  as determined by the convocation of ee .      not at all .      i   m sorry .        i   ve been thrown out .  just like the damn rabbits and the big syrupy things .      yes .      even the bit where i blow the trumpet .      oh  yes .      you   re sure .      always .      but you are death and this is the apocalypse  right .     said the angel  looking wretched .     so therefore        unfortunately  however  you are no longer a formal part of the proceedings .   out of the corner of his mind  death was observing the auditor .  auditors always listened when people spoke .  the more people spoke  the closer to consensus every decision came  and the less responsibility anyone had .  but the auditor was showing signs of impatience and annoyance     emotions .  and emotions made you alive .  death knew how to deal with the living .   the angel looked around at the universe .      then what am i supposed to do .     he wailed .     this is what i   ve been waiting for .  for thousands of years .     he stared at the iron book .     thousands of dull  boring  wasted years       he mumbled .   have you quite finished .  said the auditor .      one big scene .  that   s all i had .  that was my purpose .  you wait  you practice   and then you   re just edited out because brimstone is no longer a fashionable color .     anger was infusing the bitterness in the angel   s voice .     no one told me  of course        he glared at the rusted pages .      it ought to be pestilence next     he muttered .      am i late  then .     said a voice in the night .   a horse walked forward .  it gleamed unhealthily  like a gangrenous wound just before the barber surgeon would be called in with his hacksaw for a quick trim .     i thought you weren   t coming  said death .      i didn   t want to     pestilence oozed     but humans do get such interesting diseases .  i   d rather like to see how weasles turn out  too .     one crusted eye winked at death .      you mean measles .     said the angel .      weasles  i   m afraid     said pestilence .     people are getting really careless with this bioartificing .  we   re talking boils that really bite .      two of you will not suffice .  snarled the auditor in their heads .   a horse walked out of the darkness .  some toast racks had more flesh .      i   ve been thinking     said a voice .     maybe there are things worth putting up a fight for .         and they are    .     said pestilence  looking around .      salad cream sandwiches .  you just can   t beat them .  that tang of permitted emulsifiers .  marvelous .         hah .  you   re famine  then .     said the angel of the iron book .  it fumbled with the heavy pages again .   what  what  what is this nonsense of    salad cream    .   shouted the auditor .   anger  thought death .  a powerful emotion .      do i like salad cream .     said a voice in the dark .  a second  female voice replied      no  dear  it gives you hives .      the horse of war was huge and red and the heads of dead warriors hung from the saddle horn .  and mrs .  war was hanging on to war  grimly .      all four .  bingo .     said the angel of the book .     so much for the convocation of ee .      war had a woolly scarf around his neck .  he looked sheepishly at the other horsemen .        he   s not to strain himself     said mrs .  war sharply .     and you   re not to let him do anything dangerous .  he   s not as strong as he thinks .  and he gets confused .      so  the gang is all here  said the auditor .   smugness  death noticed .  and self satisfaction .   there was a clanging  as of metal pages .  the angel of the iron book was looking puzzled .      actually  i don   t think that   s entirely correct     it said .   no one paid it any attention .   off you go on your little pantomime  said the auditor .   and now irony and sarcasm  thought death .  they must be picking it up from the ones down in the world .  all the little things that go to make up a   personality .   he looked along the row of horsemen .  they caught his eye  and there were some almost imperceptible nods from famine and pestilence .   war turned in the saddle and spoke to his wife .      right now  dear  i   m not confused at all .  could you get down  please .         remember what happened when       mrs .  war began .      right now  please  my dear     said war  and this time his voice  which was still calm and polite  had echoes of steel and bronze .      er   oh .     mrs .  war was suddenly flustered .     that   s just how you used to talk when       she stopped  blushed happily for a moment  and slid off the horse .   war nodded at death .   and now you must all go and bring terror and destruction and so on and so forth  said the auditor .  correct .   death nodded .  floating in the air above him  the angel of the iron book slammed the pages back and forth in an effort to find his place .   exactly .  only  while it is true we have to ride out  death added  drawing his sword  it doesn   t say anywhere against whom .     your meaning .  hissed the auditor  but now there was a flicker of fear .  things were happening that it didn   t understand .  death grinned .  in order to fear  you had to be a me .  don   t let anything happen to me .  that was the song of fear .      he means     said war     that he asked us all to think about whose side we   re really on .      four swords were drawn  blazing along their edges like flame .  four horses charged .   the angel of the iron book looked down at mrs .  war .      excuse me     he said     but do you have a pencil .         susan peered around the corner into artificers street  and groaned .      it   s full of them   and i think they   ve gone mad .      unity took a look .      no .  they have not gone mad .  they are being auditors .  they are taking measurements  assessing and standardizing where necessary .         they   re taking up the paving slabs now .         yes .  i suspect it is because they are the wrong size .  we do not like irregularities .         what the hell is the wrong size for a slab of rock .         any size which is not the average size .  i   m sorry .      the air around susan flashed blue .  she was very briefly aware of a human shape  transparent  spinning gently  which vanished again .   but a voice in her ear  in her ear  said  nearly strong enough .  can you get to the end of the street .      yes .  are you sure .  you couldn   t do anything to the clock before .      before  i was not me .   a movement in the air made susan look up .  the lightning bolt that had stood rigid over the dead city had gone .  the clouds were rolling like ink poured into water .     there were flashes within them  sulphurous yellows and reds     the four horsemen are fighting the other auditors  lobsang supplied .      are they winning .      lobsang did not answer .      i said       susan began .   it   s hard for me to say .  i can see   everything .  everything that could be        kaos listened to history .   there were new words .  wizards and philosophers had found chaos  which is kaos with his hair combed and a tie on  and had found in the epitome of disorder a new order undreamed of .  there are different kinds of rules .  from the simple comes the complex  and from the complex comes a different kind of simplicity .  chaos is order in a mask     chaos .  not dark  ancient kaos  left behind by the evolving universe  but new  shiny chaos  dancing in the heart of everything .  the idea was strangely attractive .  and it was a reason to go on living .   ronnie soak adjusted his cap .  oh  yes   there was one last thing .   the milk was always lovely and fresh .  everyone remarked on that .  of course  being everywhere at seven in the morning was no trouble to him .  if even the hogfather could climb down every chimney in the world in one night  doing a milk round for most of a city in one second was hardly a major achievement .   keeping things cool was  however .  but there he had been lucky .   mr .  soak walked into the ice room  where his breath turned to fog in the frigid air .  churns were stacked across the floor  sparkling on the outside .  vats of butter and cream were piled on shelves that glistened with ice .  rack after rack of eggs were just visible through the frost .  he   d been planning to add the ice cream business in the summer .  it was such an obvious step .  besides  he needed to use up the cold .   a stove was burning in the middle of the floor .  mr .  soak always bought good coal from the dwarfs  and the iron plates were glowing red .  the room  one felt  ought to be an oven  but there was a gentle sizzling on the stove as frost battled with the heat .  with the stove roaring  the room was merely an ice box .  without the stove     ronnie opened the door of a white rimed cupboard and smashed at the ice within with his fist .  then he reached inside .   what emerged  crackling with blue flame  was a sword .   it was a work of art  the sword .  it had imaginary velocity  negative energy  and positive cold  cold so cold that it met heat coming the other way and took on something of its nature .  burning cold .  there has never been anything as cold as this since before the universe began .  in fact  it seemed to chaos  everything since then had been merely lukewarm .      well  i   m back     he said .   the fifth horseman rode out  and a faint smell of cheese followed with him .      unity looked at the other two  and at the blue glow that still hovered around the group .  they had taken cover behind a fruit barrow .      if i may offer a suggestion     she said     it is that w   that auditors are not good with surprises .  the impulse is always to consult .  and the assumption is always that there will be a plan .         so .     said susan .      i suggest total madness .  i suggest you and   and the   young man run for the shop  and i will attract the attention of the auditors .  i believe this old man should assist me because he will die soon in any case .      there was silence .        accurate yet unnecessary     said lu tze .      that was not good etiquette .     she said .      it could have been better .  however  is it not written     when you have got to go  you have got to go    .     said lu tze .     and also that    you should always wear clean underwear because you never know if you will be knocked down by a cart    .         will it help .     said unity  looking very puzzled .      that is one of the great mysteries of the way     said lu tze  nodding sagely .     what chocolate do we have left .         we   re down to the nougat now     said unity .     and i believe nougat is a terrible thing to cover with chocolate  where it can ambush the unsuspecting .  susan .      susan was peering up the street .      mmm .         do you have any chocolate left .      susan shook her head .     mmm mmm .         i believe you were carrying the cherry cremes .         mmm .      susan swallowed  and then gave a cough which expressed  in a remarkably concise way  embarrassment and annoyance .      i just had one     she snapped .     i needed the sugar .         i   m sure no one said you did have more than one     said unity meekly .      we haven   t been counting at all     said lu tze .      if you have a handkerchief     said unity  diplomatically     i could wipe away the chocolate around your mouth  which must have inadvertently got there during the last engagement .      susan glared and used the back of her hand .      it   s just the sugar     she said .     that   s all .  it   s fuel .  and do stop going on about it .  look  we can   t just let you die to get        yes  we can  said lobsang .      why .     said susan  shocked .     because i have seen everything .      would you like to tell everyone .     said susan  reverting to classroom sarcasm .     we   d all like to know how this ends .      you misunderstand the meaning of    everything .      lu tze rummaged in his sack of ammunition and produced two chocolate eggs and a paper bag .  unity went white at the sight of the bag .      i didn   t know we had any of those .         good  are they .         coffee beans coated in chocolate     breathed susan .     they should be outlawed .      the two women watched in horror as lu tze put one in his mouth .  he gave them a surprised look .      quite nice  but i prefer licorice     he said .      you mean you don   t want another one .     said susan .      no  thank you .         are you sure .         yes .  i   d quite like licorice  though  if you have any           have you had some special monk training .         well  not in chocolate combat  no     said lu tze .     but is it not written     if you have another one  you won   t have an appetite for your dinner    .         you really mean you will not eat a second chocolate coffee bean .         no  thank you .      susan looked across at unity  who was trembling .      you do have taste buds  don   t you .     she said  but she felt a pressure on her arm pulling her away .      you two get behind that cart over there and run when you get the signal     said lu tze .      go now .         what signal .      we   ll know  said the voice of lobsang .   lu tze watched them hurry away .  then he picked up his broom in one hand and stepped out into the view of a street full of gray people .      excuse me .     he said .     could i have your attention  please .         what is he doing .     said susan  crouching behind the cart .   they   re all going toward him  said lobsang .  some of them have got weapons .      they   ll be the ones giving the orders     said susan .   are you sure .      yes .  they   ve learned from humans .  auditors aren   t used to taking orders .  they need persuading .      he   s telling them about rule one  and that means he   s got a plan   i think it   s working   yes .      what   s he done .  what   s he done .      come on .  he   ll be fine .   susan leaped up .     good .      yes  they   ve cut his head off        fear  anger  envy   emotions bring you to life  which is a brief period just before you die .  the gray shapes fled in front of the swords .   but there were billions of them .  and they had their own ways of fighting   passive  subtle ways .      this is stupid .     pestilence shouted .     they can   t even catch a common cold .         no soul to damn  no arse to kick .     said war  hacking at gray shreds that rolled away from his blade .      they have a kind of hunger     said famine .     i just can   t find a way to get at it .      the horses were reined in .  the wall of grayness hovered in the distance and began to close in again .   they are fighting back  said death .  can you not feel it .      i just feel we   re too damn stupid     said war .     and where does that feeling come from .      are you saying they   re affecting our minds .     said pestilence .     we   re horsemen .  how can they do that to us .      we have become too human .      us .  human .  don   t make me lau        look at the sword in your hand  said death .  don   t you notice anything .      it   s a sword .  sword shaped .  well .      look at the hand .  four fingers and a thumb .  a human hand .  humans gave you that shape .  and that is the way in .  listen .  do you not feel small in a big universe .  that is what they are singing .  it is big  and you are small  and around you there is nothing but the cold of space  and you are so very alone .   the other three horsemen looked unsettled  nervous .      that   s coming from them .     said war .   yes .  it is the fear and hatred that matter has for life and they are the bearers of that hatred .      then what can we do .     said pestilence .     there   s too many of them .      did you think that thought  or did they .  death snapped .      they   re coming closer again     said war .   then we will do what we can .      four swords against an army .  that   ll never work .      you thought it might a few moments ago .  who is talking for you now .  humans have always faced us and they have not surrendered .      well  yes     said pestilence .     but with us they could always hope for a remission .         or a sudden truce     said war .      or       famine began  and hesitated  and said finally     a shower of fish .     he looked at their expressions .     that actually happened once     he added defiantly .     in order to have a change of fortune at the last minute you have to take your fortune to the last minute  said death .  we must do what we can .      and if that doesn   t work .     said pestilence .   death gathered up binky   s reins .  the auditors were much closer now .  he could make out their individual  identical shapes .  remove one  and there were always a dozen more .   then we did what we could  he said  until we could not .   on his cloud  the angel cloth  d all in white wrestled with the iron book .      what are they talking about .     said mrs .  war .      i don   t know  i can   t hear .  and these two pages are stuck together .     said the angel .  it scrabbled ineffectively at them for a moment .      this is all because he wouldn   t wear his vest     said mrs .  war firmly .     it   s just the sort of thing i        she had to stop because the angel had wrenched the halo from its head and was dragging it down the fused edge of the pages  with sparks and a sound like a cat slipping down a blackboard .   the pages clanged apart .      right  let   s see       it scanned the newly revealed text .     done that   done that   oh       it stopped and turned a pale face to mrs .  war .      oh boy     it said     we   re in trouble now        a comet sprang up from the world below  growing visibly larger as the angel spoke .  it flamed across the sky  burning fragments detaching and dropping away and revealing  as it closed with the horsemen  a chariot on fire .   it was a blue flame .  chaos burned with cold .   the figure standing in the chariot wore a full face helmet dominated by two eyeholes that looked slightly like the wings of a butterfly and rather more like the eyes of some strange  alien creature .  the burning horse  barely sweating  trotted to a halt  the other horses  regardless of their riders  moved aside to make room .      oh no     said famine  waving a hand in disgust .     not him  too .  i said what   d happen if he came back  didn   t i .  remember that time he threw the minstrel out of the hotel window in zok .  didn   t i say        shut up  said death .  he nodded .  hello  ronnie .  good to see you .  i wondered if you would come .   a hand trailing cold steam came up and removed the helmet .      hello  boys     said chaos pleasantly .      uh   long time no see     said pestilence .   war coughed .     heard you were doing well     he said .      yes indeed     said ronnie in a careful tone of voice .     there   s a real future in the retail milk and milk derivatives business .      death glanced at the auditors .  they   d stopped moving in but were circling watchfully .      well  the world will always need cheese     said war desperately .     haha .         looks like there   s some trouble here     said ronnie .      we can handl       famine began .   we can   t  said death .  you can see how it is  ronnie .  times have changed .  would you care to sit in for this one .      hey  we haven   t discussed       famine began  but stopped when war glared at him .   ronnie soak put on his helmet  and chaos drew his sword .  it glinted and  like the glass clock  looked like the intrusion into the world of something a great deal more complex .      some old man told me you live and learn     he said .     well .  i have lived  and now i   ve learned that the edge of a sword is infinitely long .  i   ve also learned how to make damn good yogurt  although this is not a skill i intend to employ today .  shall we go get    em  boys .          far down  in the street  a few of the auditors moved forward .      what is rule one .     said one of them .      it does not matter .  i am rule one .     an auditor with a big ax waved them back .     obedience is necessary .      the auditors wavered  watching the cleaver .  they   d learned about pain .  they   d never felt pain before  not in billions of years .  those who had felt it had no desire at all to feel it again .      very well     said mr .  white .     now get back to        a chocolate egg spun out of nowhere and smashed on the stones .  the crowd of auditors rippled forward  but mr .  white slashed the ax through the air a few times .      stand back .  stand back .     he screamed .     you three .  find out who threw that .  it came from behind that stall .  no one is to touch the brown material .      he stooped carefully and picked up a large fragment of chocolate  on which could just be made out the shape of a smiling duck in yellow icing .  hand shaking and sweat beading his forehead  he raised it aloft and flourished the cleaver triumphantly .  there was a collective sigh from the crowd .      you see .     he shouted     the body can be overcome .  you see .  we can find a way to live .  if you are good  there may be brown material .  if you disobey  there will be the sharp edge .  ah       he lowered his arms as a struggling unity was dragged toward him .      the pathfinder     he said     the renegade        he walked toward the captive .      what will it be .     he said .     the cleaver or the brown material .         it   s called chocolate     snapped unity .     i do not eat it .         we shall see     mr .  white said .     your associate seemed to prefer the ax .      he pointed to the body of lu tze .   to the empty patch of cobbles where lu tze had been .   a hand tapped him on the shoulder .        why is it     said a voice by his ear     that no one ever believes in rule one .      above him  the sky began to burn blue .      susan sped up the street to the clock shop .   she glanced sideways  and lobsang was there  running beside her .  he looked   human  except that not many humans had a blue glow around them .      there will be gray men around the clock .     he shouted .      trying to find what makes it tick .         hah .  yes .         what are you going to do .         smash it .         that   ll destroy history .         so .      he reached out and took her hand .  she felt a shock run up her arm .      you won   t need to open the door .  you won   t need to stop .  head straight for the clock .     he said .      but           don   t talk to me .  i   ve got to remember .         remember what .         everything .         mr .  white was already raising the ax as he turned around .  but you just can   t trust a body .  it thinks for itself .  when it is surprised  it does a number of things even before the brain has been informed .   the mouth opens  for example .      ah  good     said lu tze  raising his cupped hand .     eat this .         the door was no more substantial than mist .  there were auditors in the workshop  but susan moved through them like a ghost .     the clock glowed .  and  as she ran toward it  it moved away .  the floor unrolled in front of her  dragging her back .  the clock accelerated toward some distant event horizon .  at the same time it grew bigger but became more insubstantial  as if the same amount of clockness was trying to spread itself across more space .   other things were happening .  she blinked  but there was no flicker of darkness .      ah     she said to herself     so i   m not seeing with my eyes .  and what else .  what   s happening to me .  my hand   looks normal  but does that mean it is .  am i getting smaller or bigger .  does        are you always like this .  said the voice of lobsang .      like what .  i can feel your hand and i can hear your voice   at least  i think i can hear it but maybe it   s just in my head  but i can   t feel myself running        so   so analytical .      of course .  what am i supposed to be thinking .     oh my paws and whiskers    .  anyway  it   s quite straightforward .  it   s all metaphorical .  my senses are telling me stories because they can   t cope with what is really happening        don   t let go of my hand .      it   s all right  i won   t let you go .      i meant  don   t let go of my hand because otherwise every part of your body will be compressed into a space much  much smaller than an atom .      oh .      and don   t try to imagine what this really looks like from outside .  here comes the cloooccckkkkkkk        mr .  white   s mouth closed .  his expression of surprise became one of horror  and then one of shock  and then one of terrible  wonderful bliss .   he began to unravel .  he came apart like a big and complex jigsaw made of tiny pieces  crumbling gently at the extremities and then vanishing into the air .  the last piece to evaporate were the lips  and then they  too  were gone .   a half chewed chocolate coated coffee bean dropped onto the street .  lu tze reached down quickly  picked up the ax  and flourished it at the other auditors .  they leaned back out of the way  mesmerized by authority .      who does this belong to now .     he demanded .     come on  whose is it .         it is mine .  i am miss taupe .     shouted a woman in gray .      i am mr .  orange  and it belongs to me .  no one is even sure that taupe is a proper color .     screamed mr .  orange .   an auditor in the crowd said  rather more thoughtfully     is it the case  then  that hierarchy is negotiable .         certainly not .     mr .  orange was jumping up and down .      you have to decide it among yourselves     said lu tze .  he tossed the ax into the air .  a hundred pairs of eyes watched it fall .   mr .  orange got there first  but miss taupe trod on his fingers .  after that  it became very busy and confusing and  to judge from the sounds from within the growing scrum  also very  very painful .   lu tze took the arm of the astonished unity .      how quickly they learn  eh .     he said .     and so do i  i   m pleased to say .  ever heard of yetis  miss .  i was desperate enough to see how much i   d really learned .  and they were right   it does sting a bit        there was a scream from somewhere in the mob .      democracy at work     said lu tze happily .  he glanced at the sky .  the flames above the world were dying out  and he wondered who   d won .      there was bright blue light ahead and dark red light behind  and it amazed susan how she could see both kinds without opening her eyes and turning her head .  eyes open or shut  she couldn   t see herself .  all that told her that she was something else besides mere point of view was a slight pressure on what she remembered as her fingers .   and the sound of someone laughing  close to her .   a voice said     the sweeper said everyone has to find a teacher and then find their way .         and .     said susan .      this is my way .  it   s the way home .      and then  with a noise that was  unromantically  very similar to the kind jason would make by putting a wooden ruler on the edge of his desk and twanging it  the journey ended .   it might not even have begun .  the glass clock was in front of her  full size  glittering .  there was no blue glow inside .  it was just a clock  entirely transparent  and ticking .   susan looked down the length of her arm  and up his arm to lobsang .  he let go of her hand .      we   re here     he said .      with the clock .     said susan .  she could feel herself gasping to get her breath back .      this is only a part of the clock     said lobsang .     the other part .         the bit outside the universe .         yes .  the clock has many dimensions .  do not be afraid .         i don   t think i have ever been afraid of anything in my life     said susan  still gulping air .     not really afraid .  i get angry .  i   m getting angry now  in fact .  are you lobsang or are you jeremy .         yes .         yes  i walked into that .  are you lobsang and are you jeremy .         much closer .  yes .  i will always remember both of them .  but i would prefer you to call me lobsang .  lobsang has the better memories .  i never liked the name jeremy even when i was jeremy .         you really are both of them .         i am   everything about them that was worth being  i hope .  they were both very different and they were both me  born just an instant apart  and they used their   heritage in different ways  and neither of them was very happy by himself .  it makes you wonder if there is anything to astrology after all .         oh  there is     said susan .     delusion  wishful thinking  and gullibility .         don   t you ever let go .         i haven   t yet .         why .         i suppose   because in this world  after everyone panics  there   s always got to be someone to tip the wee out of the shoe .      the clock ticked .  the pendulum swung .  but the hands did not move .      interesting     said lobsang .     you   re not a follower of the way of mrs .  cosmopilite  are you .     said lobsang .      i don   t even know what it is     said susan .      have you got your breath back now .         yes .         let   s turn around  then .      personal time moved on again  and a voice behind them said     is this yours .      behind them there were glass steps .  at the top of the steps was a man dressed like a history monk  shaven headed  besandaled .  the eyes gave away a lot more .  a young man who   d been alive for a very long time  mrs .  ogg had said  and she had been right .   he was holding a struggling death of rats by the scruff of his robe .      er   he   s his own     said susan  as lobsang bowed .      then please take him away with you .  we cannot have him running around here .  hello  my son .      lobsang walked toward him and they embraced  briefly and formally .        father     said lobsang  straightening up .     this is susan .  she has been   very helpful .         of course she has     said the monk  smiling at susan .     she is helpfulness personified .     he put the death of rats on the floor and prodded him forward .      yes  i   m very dependable     said susan .      and interestingly sarcastic  too     the monk added .     i am wen .  thank you for joining us .  and for helping our son find himself .      susan looked from the father to the son .  the words and the movements were stilted and chilly  but there was a communication going on here that she wasn   t party to  and it was happening a lot faster than speech .      aren   t we supposed to be saving the world .     she said .     i don   t want to rush anybody  of course .         there   s something i must do first     said lobsang .     i must meet my mother .         have we got ti       susan began and then added     we have  haven   t we .  all the time in the world .         oh  no .  far more time than that     said wen .     besides  there   s always time to save the world .      time appeared .  again there was the impression that a figure that was in the air  unfocused  was resolving itself into a million specks of matter  which poured together and filled a shape in space  slowly at first  and then   someone was there .   she was a tall woman  quite young  dark haired  in a long red and black dress .  by the look of her face  susan thought  she had been weeping .  but she was smiling now .   wen took susan by the arm and gently pulled her aside .      they   ll want to talk     he said .     shall we walk .      the room vanished .  now there was a garden  with peacocks and fountains  and a stone seat  upholstered with moss .   lawns unrolled toward woodlands that had the manicured look of an estate  which had been maintained for hundreds of years so that nothing grew here that was not wanted  or in the wrong place .  long tailed birds  their plumage like living jewels  flashed from treetop to treetop .  deeper in the woods  other birds called .   as susan watched  a kingfisher alighted on the edge of a fountain .  it glanced at her and flew away  its wingbeats sounding like a snapping of fans .      look     said susan     i don   t   i   m not   look  i understand this sort of thing .  really .  i   m not stupid .  my grandfather has a garden where everything is black .  but   lobsang built the clock .  well   part of him did .  so he   s saving the world and destroying it  all at once .         family trait     said wen .     it is what time does at every instant .      he gave susan the look of a teacher confronted with a keen but stupid pupil .      think like this     he said at last .     think of everything .  it   s an everyday word .  but    everything    means   everything .  it   s a much bigger word than    universe .     and everything contains all possible things that can happen at all possible times in all possible worlds .  don   t look for complete solutions in any one of them .  sooner or later  everything causes everything else .         are you saying one little world is not important  then .     said susan .   wen waved a hand  and two glasses of wine appeared on the stone .      everything is as important as everything else     he said .   susan grimaced .      you know  that   s why i   ve never liked philosophers     she said .     they make it all sound grand and simple  and then you step out into a world that   s full of complications .  i mean  look around .  i bet this garden needs regular weeding  and the fountains have to be unblocked  and the peacocks shed feathers and dig up the lawn   and if they don   t do that  then this is just a fake .           no  everything is real     said wen .     at least  it is as real as anything else .  but this is a perfect moment .     he smiled at susan again .     against one perfect moment  the centuries beat in vain .         i   d prefer a more specific philosophy     said susan .  she tried the wine .  it was perfect .      certainly .  i expected that you would .  i see you cling to logic as a limpet clings to a rock in a storm .  let me see   defend the small spaces  don   t run with scissors  and remember that there is often an unexpected chocolate     said wen .  he smiled .     and never resist a perfect moment .      a breeze made the fountains splash over the sides of their bowls  just for a second .   wen stood up .      and now  i believe  my wife and son have finished their meeting     he said .   the garden faded .  the stone seat melted like mist as soon as susan got up  although up until then it had felt as solid as  well  rock .  the wineglass vanished from her hand  leaving only a memory of its pressure on her fingers and the taste lingering in her mouth .   lobsang was standing in front of the clock .  time herself was not visible  but the song that wove through the rooms had a different tone now .      she   s happier     said lobsang .     she is free now .      susan looked around .  wen had vanished along with the garden .  there was nothing but the endless glass rooms .      don   t you want to talk to your father .     she said .      later .  there will be plenty of time     said lobsang .     i shall see to it .      the way he said it  so carefully dropping the words into place  made her turn .      you   re going to take over .     she said .     you are time now .         yes .         but you   re mostly human .           so .     lobsang   s smile took after his father .  it was the gentle and  to susan  the infuriating smile of a god .      what   s in all these rooms .     she demanded .     do you know .         one perfect moment .  in each one .  an oodleplex of oodleplexes .         i   m not certain there   s such a thing as a genuinely perfect moment     said susan .     can we go home now .      lobsang wrapped the edge of his robe around his fist and smashed it against the glass front panel of the clock .  it shattered and dropped to the ground .      when we get to the other side     he said     don   t stop and don   t look back .  there will be a lot of flying glass .         i   ll try to dive behind one of the benches     said susan .      they probably won   t be there .      squeak .   the death of rats had scurried up the side of the clock and was peering cheerfully over the top .      what do we do about that .     said lobsang .      that looks after itself     said susan .     i never worry about it .      lobsang nodded .      take my hand     he said .  she reached out .   with his free hand  lobsang grasped the pendulum and stopped the clock .   a blue green hole opened in the world .   the return journey was a lot swifter but  when the world existed again  she was falling into water .  it was brown  muddy  and stank of dead plants .  susan surfaced  fighting against the drag of her skirts  and trod water while she tried to get her bearings .   the sun was nailed to the sky  the air was heavy and humid  and a pair of nostrils was watching her from a few feet away .   susan had been brought up to be practical  and that meant swimming lessons .  the quirm college for young ladies had been very advanced in that respect  and its teachers took the view that a girl who couldn   t swim two lengths of the pool with her clothes on wasn   t making an effort .  to their credit  she   d left knowing four swimming strokes and several life saving techniques  and was entirely at home in the water .  she also knew what to do if you were sharing the same stretch of water with a hippopotamus  which was to find another stretch of water .  hippos only look big and cuddly from a distance .  close up  they just look big .   susan summoned up all the inherited powers of the deathly voice plus the terrible authority of the schoolroom  and yelled  go away .   the creature floundered madly in its effort to turn around  and susan struck out for the shore .  it was an unsure shore  the water becoming land in a tangle of sandbanks  sucking black muck  rotted tree roots  and swamp .  insects swirled around and        the cobbles were muddy underfoot  and there was the sound of horsemen in the mist        and ice  piled up against dead trees        and lobsang  taking her arm .      found you     he said .      you just shattered history     said susan .     you broke it .      the hippo had come as a shock .  she   d never realized one mouth could hold so much bad breath  or be so big and deep .      i know .  i had to .  there was no other way .  can you find lu tze .  i know death can locate any living thing  and since you           all right  all right  i know     said susan darkly .  she held out her hand and concentrated .  an image of lu tze   s extremely heavy lifetimer appeared and gathered weight .      he   s only a few hundred yards over there     she said  pointing to a frozen drift .      and i know when he is     said lobsang .     only sixty thousand years away .  so          lu tze  when they found him  was looking calmly up at an enormous mammoth .  under its huge hairy brow its eyes were squinting with the effort both of seeing him and of getting all three of its brain cells lined up so that it could decide whether to trample on him or gouge him out of the frost bound landscape .  one brain cell was saying    gouge     one was going for    trample     but the third had wandered off and was thinking about as much sex as possible .   at the far end of its trunk  lu tze was saying     so   you   ve never heard of rule one  then .      lobsang stepped out of the air beside him .      we must go  sweeper .      the appearance of lobsang did not seem to surprise lu tze at all  although he did seem annoyed at the interruption .      no rush  wonder boy     he said .     i   ve got this perfectly under control           where   s the lady .     said susan .      over by that snowdrift     said lu tze  indicating with his thumb while still trying to outstare a pair of eyes five feet apart .     when this turned up she screamed and twisted her ankle .  look  you can see i   ve made it nervous        susan waded into the drift and hauled unity upright .      come on  we   re leaving     she said brusquely .      i saw his head cut off .     unity babbled .     and then suddenly we were here .         yes  that kind of thing happens     said susan .   unity stared at her  wild eyed .      life is full of surprises     said susan  but the sight of the creature   s distress made her hesitate .  all right  the thing was one of them  it was merely wearing   well  at least had started out merely wearing a body as a kind of coat  but now   after all  you could say that about everyone  couldn   t you .   susan had even wondered if the human soul without the anchor of a body would end up  eventually  as something like an auditor .  which  to be fair  meant that unity  who was getting more firmly wrapped in flesh by the minute  was something like a human .  and that was a pretty good definition of lobsang and  if it came to it  susan as well .  who knew where humanity began and where it finished .      come along     she said .     we   ve got to stick together  right .         like shards of glass spinning through the air  fragments of history drifted and collided and intersected in the dark .   there was a lighthouse  though .  the valley of oi dong held on to the ever repeating day .  in the hall almost all of the giant cylinders stood silent  all time ran out .  some had split .  some had melted .  some had exploded .  some had simply vanished .  but one still turned .   big thanda  the oldest and biggest  ground slowly on its basalt bearing  winding time out at one end and back on the other  ensuring  as wen had decreed  that the perfect day would never end .   rambut handisides was all alone in the hall  sitting beside the turning stone in the light of a butter lamp and occasionally throwing a handful of grease onto the base .   a clink of stone made him peer into the darkness .  it was heavy with the smoke of fried rock .   there the sound was again  and then the scratch and flare of a match .      lu tze .     he said .     is that you .         i hope so  rambut  but who knows these days .     lu tze stepped into the light and sat down .     keeping you busy  are they .      handisides sprang to his feet .     it   s been terrible  sweeper .  everyone   s up in the mandala hall .  it   s worse than the great crash .  there   s bits of history everywhere and we   ve lost half the spinners .  we   ll never be able to put it all           now  now  you look like a man who   s had a busy day     said lu tze kindly .     not got a lot of sleep  eh .  tell you what  i   ll take care of this .  you go and get a bit of shut eye  okay .         we thought you were lost out in the world  and       the monk burbled .      and now i   m back     smiled lu tze  patting him on the shoulder .     there   s still that little alcove around the corner where you repair the smaller spinners .  and there   s still those unofficial bunks for when it   s the night shift and you only need a couple of lads to keep their eye on things .      handisides nodded and looked guilty .  lu tze wasn   t supposed to know about the bunks .      you get along  then     said lu tze .  he watched the man   s retreating back and added quietly     and if you wake up you might turn out to be the luckiest idiot that ever there was .  well  wonder boy .  what next .         we put everything back     said lobsang  emerging from the shadows .      you know how long that took us last time .         yes     said lobsang  looking around at the stricken hall and heading toward the podium .     i do .  i don   t think it will take me as long .         i wish you sounded more certain     said susan .      i   m   pretty certain     said lobsang  running his fingers over the bobbins on the board .   lu tze waved a cautionary hand at susan .  lobsang   s mind was already on the way somewhere else  and now she wondered how large a space it was occupying .  his eyes were closed .      the   spinners that are left   can you move the jumpers .     he said .      i can show the ladies how to     said lu tze .      are there not monks who know how to do this .     said unity .      it   would take too long .  i   am an apprentice to a sweeper .  they   would run around asking questions     said lobsang .     you   will not .         he   s got a point right enough     said lu tze .     people will start saying    what is the meaning of this .     and    bikkit .      and we   ll never get anything done .      lobsang looked down at the bobbins and then across at susan .      imagine   that there is a jigsaw  all in pieces .  but   i am very good at spotting edges and shapes .  very good .  and all the pieces are moving .  but   because they were once linked  they have by their very nature a memory of that link .  their shape is the memory .  once a few are in the right position  the rest will be easier .  oh   and imagine that all the bits are scattered across the whole of eventuality and mixing randomly with pieces from other histories .  can you grasp all that .         yes .  i think so .         good .  everything i have just said is nonsense .  it bears no resemblance to the truth of the matter in any way at all .  but it is a lie that you can   understand  i think .  and then  afterward           you   re going to go  aren   t you     said susan .  it was not a question .      i will not have enough power to stay     said lobsang .      you need power to stay human .     said susan .  she hadn   t been aware of the rise of her heart  but now it was sinking .      yes   even trying to think in a mere four dimensions is a terrible effort .  i   m sorry .  even to hold in my mind the concept of something called    now    is hard .  you thought i was mostly human .  i   m mostly not .     he sighed .     if only i could tell you what everything looks like to me   it   sso beautiful .      lobsang stared into the air above the little wooden bobbins .  things twinkled .  there were complex curves and spirals  brilliant against the blackness       it was like looking at a clock in pieces  with every wheel and spring carefully laid out in the dark in front of him .  dismantled  controllable  every part of it understood   but a number of small but important things had gone ping into the corners of a very large room .  if you were really good  then you could work out where they   d landed        you   ve only got about a third of the spinners     came the voice of lu tze .     the rest are smashed .      lobsang couldn   t see him .  there was only the glittering show before his eyes .      that   is true  but once they were whole     he said .  he raised his hands and lowered them on the bobbins .   susan looked around at the sudden grinding noise and saw row after row of columns rising out of the dust and debris .  they stood like lines of soldiers  dust cascading from them .      good trick .     lu tze shouted into susan   s ear  above the thunder .     feeding time into the spinners themselves .  theoretically possible  but we never managed to do it .         do you know what he   s actually going to do .     susan shouted back .      yeah .  snatch the extra time out of bits of history that are too far ahead and shove it into the bits that have fallen behind .         sounds simple .         just one problem .         what .         can   t do it .  losses .     lu tze snapped his fingers  trying to explain time dynamics to a noninitiate .     friction .  divergence .  all sorts of stuff .  you can   t create time on the spinners  you can only move it around        there was a sudden bright blue glow around lobsang .  it flickered over the desk and then snapped across the air to form arcs of light leading to all the procrastinators .  it crawled between the carved symbols and clung to them in a thickening layer  like cotton winding on a reel .     lu tze looked at the whirling light and the shadow within it  almost lost against the glow .         at least     he added     up until now .      the spinners wound up to their working speed and then went faster  under the lash of the light .  it poured across the cavern in a solid  unending stream .   flames licked around the bottom of the nearest cylinder .  the base was glowing  and the noise from its stone bearing was joining a rising  cavern filling scream of stone in distress .  lu tze shook his head .      you  susan  buckets of water from the wells .  you  miss unity  you follow her with the grease pails .         and what are you going to do .     said susan  grabbing two buckets .      i   m going to worry like hell and that   s not an easy job  believe me .      steam built up then  and there was a smell of burning butter .  there was no time for anything but to run from the wells to the nearest spitting bearing and back  and there was not enough time even for that .   the spinners turned back and forth .  there was no need for the jumpers now .  the crystal rods that had survived the crash hung uselessly from their hooks as time arced overhead from one procrastinator to another  showing up as red or blue glow in the air .  it was a sight to frighten the knoptas off any trained spinner driver  lu tze knew .  it looked like a cascade running wild  but there was some control in there  some huge pattern being woven   bearings squealed .  butter bubbled .  the bases of some spinners were smoking .  but things held .  they   re being held  lu tze thought .   he looked up at the registers .  the boards slammed back and forth  sending lines of red or blue or bare wood across the wall of the cavern .  there was a pall of white smoke around them as their own wooden bearings gently charred .     past and future were streaming through the air .  the sweeper could feel them .   on the podium  lobsang was wrapped in the glow .  the bobbins were not being moved anymore .  what was going on now was on some other level  which didn   t need the intervention of crude mechanisms .   lion tamer  lu tze thought .  he starts off needing chairs and whips  but one day  if he   s really good  he can go into the cage and do the show using nothing more than eye and voice .  but only if he   s really good  and you   ll know if he   s really good  because he   ll come out of the cage again     he stopped his prowl along the thundering lines because there was a change in the sound .   one of the biggest spinners was slowing down .  it stopped as lu tze watched  and didn   t start again .   lu tze raced around the cavern until he found susan and unity .  three more spinners stopped before he reached them .      he   s doing it .  he   s doing it .  come away .     he shouted .  with a jolt that shook the floor  another spinner stopped .   the three ran toward the end of the cavern where the smaller procrastinators were still whirling  but the halt was already speeding down the rows .  spinner after spinner slammed to a standstill  the domino effect overtaking the humans until  when they reached the little chalk spinners  they were in time to see the last ones rattle gently to a standstill .   there was silence  except for the sizzle of grease and the click of cooling rock .      is it all over .     said unity  wiping the sweat from her face with her dress and leaving a trail of sequins .   lu tze and susan looked at the glow at the other end of the hall  and then at one another .      i   don   t   think   so     said susan .   lu tze nodded .     i think it   s just       he began .   bars of green light leaped from spinner to spinner and hung in the air as rigid as steel .  they flickered on and off between the columns  filling the air with thunderclaps .  patterns of switching snapped back and forth across the cavern .   the tempo increased .  the thunderclaps became one long roll of overpowering sound .  the bars brightened  expanded  and then the air was all one brilliant light     which vanished .  the sound ceased so abruptly that the silence clanged .   the trio got to their feet slowly .      what was that .     said unity .      i think he made some changes     said lu tze .   the spinners were silent .  the air was hot .  smoke and steam filled the roof of the cavern .   then  responding to the routine of humanity   s eternal wrestle with time  the spinners began to pick up the load .   it came gently  like a breeze .  and the spinners took the strain  from the smallest to the largest  settling once again into their gentle  ponderous pirouette .      perfect     said lu tze .     almost as good as it was  i   ll bet .         only almost .     said susan  wiping the butter off her face .      well  he   s partly human     said the sweeper .  they turned to the podium  and it was empty .  susan was not surprised .  he   d be weak now  of course .  of course  something like this would take it out of anyone .  of course  he   d need to rest .  of course .      he   s gone     she said flatly .      who knows .     said lu tze .     for is it not written     you never know what   s going to turn up    .      the reassuring rumble of the procrastinators now filled the cave .  lu tze could feel the time flows in the air .  it was invigorating  like the smell of the sea .  i ought to spend more time down here  he thought .      he broke history and repaired it     said susan .     cause and cure .  that makes no sense .         not in four dimensions     said unity .     in eighteen  it   s all perfectly clear .           and now  may i suggest you ladies leave by the back way .     said lu tze .     people are going to come running down here in a minute and it   s all going to get very excitable .  probably best if you aren   t around .         what will you do .     said susan .      lie     said lu tze happily .     it   s amazing how often that works .             ick  susan and unity stepped out of a door in the rock and took the path that led through rhododendron groves out of the valley .  the sun was touching the horizon and the air was warm  although there were snowfields quite close by .   at the lip of the valley the water from the stream plunged over a cliff in a fall so long that it landed as a sort of rain .  susan pulled herself onto a rock and settled down to wait .      it is a long way to ankh morpork     said unity .      we   ll have a lift     said susan .  the first stars were already coming out .      the stars are very pretty     said unity .      do you really think so .         i am learning to .  humans believe they are .         the thing is   i mean  there   s times when you look at the universe and you think    what about me .     and you can just hear the universe replying     well  what about you .         unity appeared to consider this .      well  what about you .     she said .   susan sighed .     exactly .     she sighed again .     you can   t think about just one person while you   re saving the world .  you have to be a cold  calculating bastard .         that sounded as if you were quoting somebody     said unity .     who said that .           some total idiot     said susan .  she tried to think of other things and added     we didn   t get all of them .  there   re still auditors down there somewhere .         that will not matter     said unity calmly .     look at the sun .         well .         it is setting .         and    .         that means time is flowing through the world .  the body exacts its toll  susan .  soon my   my former colleagues  bewildered and fleeing  will become tired .  they will have to sleep .         i follow you  but           i am insane .  i know this .  but the first time it happened to me i found such horror that i cannot express it .  can you imagine what it is like .  for an intellect a billion years old  in a body which is an ape on the back of a rat that grew out of a lizard .  can you imagine what comes out of the dark places  uncontrolled .         what are you telling me .         they will die in their dreams .      susan thought about this .  millions and millions of years of thinking precise  logical thoughts   and then humanity   s murky past drops all its terrors on you in one go .  she could almost feel sorry for them .  almost .      but you didn   t     she said .      no .  i think i must be   different .  it is a terrible thing to be different  susan .  did you have romantic hopes in connection with the boy .      the questions came out of nowhere and there was no defense .  unity   s face showed nothing but a kind of nervous concern .      no     said susan .  unfortunately  unity did not seem to have mastered some of the subtleties of human conversation  such as when a tone of voice means    stop this line of inquiry right now or may huge rats eat you by day and by night .         i confess to strange feelings regarding his   self that was the clockmaker     said unity .     sometimes  when he smiled  he was normal .  i wanted to help him  because he seemed so closed in and sad .         you don   t have to confess to things like that     susan snapped .     how do you even know the word romantic  anyway .     she added .      i found some books of poetry .     unity actually looked embarrassed .      really .  i   ve never trusted it     said susan .  huge  giant  hungry rats .      i found it most curious .  how can words on a page have a power like that .  there is no doubt that being human is incredibly difficult and cannot be mastered in one lifetime     said unity sadly .   susan felt a stab of guilt .  it wasn   t unity   s fault  after all .  people learn things as they grow up  things that never get written down .  and unity had never grown up .      what are you going to do now .     she said .      i do not know .         well  if i can help in any way        it was  she realized later  one of those phrases like    how are you .     people were supposed to understand that it wasn   t a real question .  but unity hadn   t learned that  either .      thank you .  you can  indeed  help .  i wish to do something human .         uh  fine  if           i wish to die .      and  galloping out of the sunset  some riders were approaching .       tick    small fires burned in the rubble  brightening the night .  most of the house had been completely destroyed  although  soto considered  the word    shredded    was much more accurate .   he was sitting by the side of the street  watching carefully  with his begging bowl in front of him .  there were  of course  far more interesting and complex ways for a history monk to avoid being noticed  but he   d adopted the begging bowl method ever since lu tze had shown him that people never see anyone who wants them to give him money .   he   d watched the rescuers drag the bodies out of the house .  initially  they   d thought that one of them had been hideously mutilated in the explosion  until it had sat up and explained that it was an igor and in very good shape for an igor  thank you very much .  the other he   d recognized as dr .  hopkins of the guild of clockmakers  who was miraculously unharmed .   soto did not believe in miracles  however .  he was also suspicious about the fact that the ruined house was full of oranges  that dr .  hopkins was babbling about getting sunlight out of them  and that his sparkling little abacus was telling him that something enormous had happened .   he decided to make a report and see what the boys at oi dong said .   soto picked up the bowl and set off through the network of alleys back to his base .  he didn   t bother much about concealment now  lu tze   s time in the city had been a process of accelerated education for many citizens of the lurking variety .  the people of ankh morpork knew all about rule one .   at least  they had known up until now .  three figures lurched out of the dark  and one of them swung a length of wood that would have connected with soto   s head if he hadn   t ducked .   he was used to this sort of thing  of course .  there was always the occasional slow learner  but they presented no peril that a neat slice couldn   t handle .   he straightened up  ready to ease his way out of there  and a thick lock of black hair fell onto his shoulder  slithered down his robe  and flopped onto the ground .  it made barely a sound  but the expression on his face  as soto looked down and then up at his attackers  made them draw back .   he could see through the blood red rage that they all wore stained gray clothes and looked even crazier than the usual alley people  they looked like accountants gone mad .   one of them reached out toward the begging bowl .   everyone has a conditional clause in their life  some little unspoken addition to the rules like     except when i really need to     or    unless no one is looking     or  indeed     unless the first one was nougat .     soto had for centuries embraced a belief in the sanctity of all life and the ultimate uselessness of violence  but his personal conditional clause was     but not the hair .  no one touches the hair  okay .      even so  everyone ought to have a chance .   the attackers recoiled as he threw the bowl against the wall  where the hidden blades buried themselves in the woodwork .   then it began to tick .   soto ran back down the alley  skidded around the corner  and then shouted     duck .      unfortunately for the auditors  alas  he was just a tiny  tiny fraction of a second too late         tick  lu tze was in his garden of five surprises when the air sparkled and fragmented and swirled into a shape in front of him .     he looked up from his ministrations to the yodeling stick insect  who   d been off its food .   lobsang stood on the path .  the boy was wearing a black robe dotted with stars  which blew and rattled its rags around him on this windless morning as if he was standing in the center of a gale .  which  lu tze supposed  he more or less was .      back again  wonder boy .     said the sweeper .      in a way  i never leave     said lobsang .     things have gone well with you .         don   t you know .         i could .  but part of me has to do this the traditional way .         well  the abbot is mighty suspicious and there   s some amazing rumors flying around the place .  i didn   t say much .  what do i know about anything .  i   m just a sweeper .      with that  lu tze turned his attention to the sick stick insect .  he   d counted to four under his breath before lobsang said     please .  i have to know .  i believe that the fifth surprise is you .  am i right .      lu tze cocked his head .  a low noise that he   d heard for so long that he never consciously heard it anymore had changed its tone .      the spinners are all winding out     he said .     they know you   re here  lad .         i shall not be here long  sweeper .  please .         you just want to know my little surprise .         yes .  i know nearly everything else     said lobsang .      but you are time .  what i tell you in the future you   ll know now  right .         but i   m partly human .  i want to stay partly human .  that means doing things the right way around .  please .      lu tze sighed and looked for a while down the avenue of cherry blossom .      when the pupil can beat the master  there is nothing the master cannot tell him     he said .     remember .           yes .         very well .  the iron dojo should be free .      lobsang looked surprised .      uh   the iron dojo   isn   t that the one with all the sharp spikes in the walls .         and the ceiling  yes .  the one that   s like being inside a giant porcupine turned inside out .      lobsang looked horrified .     but that   s not for practice .  the rules say           that   s the one     said lu tze .     and i say we use it .         oh .         good .  no argument     said lu tze .     this way  lad .      blossom cascaded from the trees as they passed .  they entered the monastery and took the same route they   d taken once before .   this brought them into the hall of the mandala  and the sand rose like a dog welcoming its master and spiraled in the air far below lobsang   s sandals .  lu tze heard the shouts of the attendants behind him .   news like this spread throughout the valley like ink in water .  hundreds of monks  apprentices  and sweepers were trailing the pair as they crossed the inner courtyards  like the tail of a comet .   above them  all the time  petals of cherry blossom fell like snow .   at last lu tze reached the high  round metal door of the iron dojo .  the clasp of the door was fifteen feet up .  no one who did not belong there was supposed to open the door of the dojo .   the sweeper nodded at his former apprentice .      you do it     he said .     i can   t .      lobsang glanced at him and then looked up at the high clasp .  then he pressed a hand against the iron .   rust spread under his fingers .  red stains spread out across the ancient metal .  the door began to creak and then to crumble .  lu tze prodded it with an experimental finger  and a slab of cookie dough strong metal fell out and collapsed on the flagstones .      very impress       he began .  a squeaky rubber elephant bounced off his head .      bikkit .      the crowd parted .  the chief acolyte ran forward  carrying the abbot .      what is the wanna bikkit bikkit meaning of this .  who is wozza funny man this person  sweeper .  the spinners are dancing in their hall .      lu tze bowed .      he is time  reverend one  as you have suspected     he said .  still bent in the bow  he looked up and sideways at lobsang .      bow .     he hissed .   lobsang looked puzzled .     i should bow even now .     he said .      bow  you little stonga  or i shall teach you such discipline .  show deserved respect .  you are still my apprentice until i give you leave .      shocked  lobsang bowed .      and why do you visit us in our timeless valley .     said the abbot .      tell the abbot .     lu tze snapped .      i   i wish to learn the fifth surprise     said lobsang .         reverend one        lu tze supplied .         reverend one     lobsang finished .      you visit us just to learn of our clever sweeper   s fancies .     said the abbot .      yes  er  reverend one .         of all the things time could be doing  you wish to see an old man   s trick .  bikkit .         yes  reverend one .     the monks stared at lobsang .  his robe still fluttered this way and that in the teeth of the intangible gale  the stars glinting when they caught the light .   the abbot smiled a cherubic smile .      so should we all     he said .     none of us has ever seen it  i believe .  none of us has ever been able to wheedle it out of him .  but   this is the iron dojo .  it has rules .  two may walk in  but only one can walk out .  this is no practice dojo .  wanna    lephant .  do you understand .         what .  i didn   t know       lobsang began  but the sweeper jerked an elbow into his ribs .      you say     yes  reverend one        he growled .      but i never intended        this time the back of his head was slapped .      this is no time to step back .     lu tze said .     you   re too late  wonder boy .     he nodded to the abbot .     my apprentice understands  reverend one .         your apprentice  sweeper .         oh  yes  reverend one     said lu tze .     my apprentice .  until i say otherwise .         really .  bikkit .  then he may enter .  you too  lu tze .         but i only meant to       lobsang protested .      inside .     lu tze roared .     will you shame me .  shall people think i have taught you nothing .      the inside of the iron dojo was  indeed  a darkened dome full of spikes .  they were needle thin and there were tens of thousands of them covering the nightmare walls .      who would build something like this .     said lobsang  looking up at the glistening points that covered even the ceiling .      it teaches the virtues of stealth and discipline     said lu tze  cracking his knuckles .     impetuosity and speed can be as dangerous to the attacker as to the attacked  as perhaps you will learn .  one condition  we are all human here .  agreed .           of course  sweeper .  we are all human here .         and shall we agree  no tricks .         no tricks     said lobsang .     but           are we fighting or are we talking .         but  look  if only one can walk out  that means i   ll have to kill you       lobsang began .      or vice versa  of course     said lu tze .     that is the rule  yes .  shall we get on .         but i didn   t know that .         in life  as in breakfast cereal  it is always best to read the instructions on the box     said lu tze .     this is the iron dojo  wonder boy .      he stepped back and bowed .   lobsang shrugged and bowed in return .   lu tze took a few steps back .  he closed his eyes for a moment and then went through a series of simple moves  limbering up .  lobsang winced to hear the crackle of joints .   around lobsang there was a series of snapping noises  and for a moment he thought of the old sweeper   s bones .  but tiny hatches all over the curved wall were swinging open .  he could hear whispers as people jostled for position .  and by the sound of it  there were a great many people .   he extended his hands and let himself rise gently in the air .      i thought we said no tricks .     said lu tze .      yes  sweeper     said lobsang  poised in midair .     and then i thought  never forget rule one .         aha .  well done .  you   ve learned something .      lobsang drifted closer .      you cannot believe the things that i have seen since last i saw you     he said .     words cannot describe them .  i have seen worlds nesting within worlds  like those dolls they carve in uberwald .  i have heard the music of the years .  i know more than i can ever understand .  but i do not know the fifth surprise .  it is a trick  a conundrum   a test .           everything is a test     said lu tze .      then show me the fifth surprise  and i promise not to harm you .         you promise not to harm me .         i promise not to harm you     lobsang repeated solemnly .      fine .  you only had to ask     said lu tze  smiling broadly .      what .  i asked before  and you refused .         you only had to ask at the right time  wonder boy .         and how is it the right time .         it is written     there   s no time like the present        said lu tze .     behold  the fifth surprise .      he reached into his robe .   lobsang floated closer .   the sweeper produced a cheap carnival mask .  it was one of those that consisted of a fake pair of glasses  glued above a big pink nose  and a heavy black mustache .   he put it on and wiggled his ears once or twice .      boo     he said .      what .     said lobsang  bewildered .      boo     lu tze repeated .     i never said it was a particularly imaginative surprise  did i .      he wiggled his ears again and then wiggled his eyebrows .      good  eh .     he said and grinned .   lobsang laughed .  lu tze grinned wider .  lobsang laughed louder and lowered himself to the mat .   the blows came out of nowhere .  they caught him in the stomach  on the back of his neck  in the small of his back  and swept his legs from under him .  he landed on his stomach  with lu tze pinning him down in the straddle of the fish .  the only way to get out of that was to dislocate your own shoulders .   there was a sort of collective sigh from the hidden watchers .      deja fu .           what .     said lobsang into the mat .     you said none of the monks knew deja fu .         i never taught it to    em  that   s why .     said lu tze .     promise not to harm me  would you .  thank you so very much .  submit .         you never told me you knew it .     lu tze   s knees  rammed into the secret pressure points  were turning lobsang   s arms into powerless lumps of flesh .      i may be old  but i   m not daft .     lu tze shouted .     you don   t think i   d give away a trick like that  do you .         that   s not fair         lu tze leaned down until his mouth was an inch from lobsang   s ear .      didn   t say    fair    on the box  lad .  but you can win  you know .  you could turn me into dust  just like that .  how could i stop time .         i can   t do that .         you mean you won   t  and we both know it .  submit .      lobsang could feel parts of his body trying to shut themselves down .  his shoulders were on fire .  i can discarnate  he thought  yes  i can  i could turn him to dust with a thought .  and lose .  i   d walk out  and he   d be dead  and i   d have lost .      nothing to worry about  lad     said lu tze  calmly now .     you just forgot rule nineteen .  submit .         rule nineteen .     said lobsang  almost pushing himself off the mat until terrible pain forced him down again .     what the hell is rule nineteen .  yes  yes  submit  submit .            remember never to forget rule one        said lu tze .  he released his grip .     and always ask yourself  how come it was created in the first place  eh .      lu tze got to his feet and went on     but you have performed well  all things considered  and therefore as your master i have no hesitation in recommending you for the yellow robe .  besides     he lowered his voice to a whisper     everyone peeking in here has seen me beat time and that   s the sort of thing that   ll look really good on my r  sum    if you catch my meaning .  def   nitely give the ol    rule one a fillip .  let me give you a hand up .      he reached down .   lobsang was about to take the hand when he hesitated .  lu tze grinned again and gently pulled him upright .      but only one of us can leave  sweeper     said lobsang  rubbing his shoulders .      really .     said lu tze .     but playing the game changes the rules .  i say the hell with it .      the remains of the door were pushed aside by the hands of many monks .  there was the sound of someone being hit with a rubber yak .     bikkit .            and the abbot  i believe  is ready to present you with the robe     said lu tze .     don   t make any comment if he dribbles on it  please .      they left the dojo and  followed now by every soul in oi dong  headed for the long terrace .   it was  lu tze reminisced later on  an unusual ceremony .  the abbot did not appear overawed  because babies generally aren   t and will throw up over anyone .  besides  lobsang might have been master of the gulfs of time  but the abbot was master of the valley  and therefore respect was a line that traveled in both directions .   but the handing over of the robe had caused a difficult moment .   lobsang had refused it .  it had been left to the chief acolyte to ask why  while the whispered currents of surprise washed through the crowd .      i am not worthy  sir .         lu tze has declared that you have completed your apprenticeship  my lo   lobsang ludd .      lobsang bowed .     then i will take the broom and the robe of a sweeper  sir .      this time the current was a tsunami .  it crashed over the audience .  heads turned .  there were gasps of shock  and one or two nervous laughs .  and  from the lines of sweepers who had been allowed to pause in their tasks to watch the event  there was a watchful  intent silence .   the chief acolyte licked his suddenly dehydrated lips .      but   but   you are the incarnation of time           in this valley  sir     said lobsang firmly     i am as worthy as a sweeper .      the chief acolyte looked around  but there was no help anywhere .  the other senior members of the monastery had no wish to share in the huge pink cloud of embarrassment .  the abbot merely blew bubbles and grinned the inward knowing grin of all babies everywhere .      do we have any   uh   do we present sweepers with   do we by any chance       the acolyte mumbled .   lu tze stepped up behind him .      can i be of any help  your acolytility .     he said with a sort of mad keen subservience that was quite alien to his normal attitude .      lu tze .  ah   er   yes   er           i could fetch a nearly new robe  sir  and the lad can have my old broom if you   ll sign a chitty for me to get a new one from stores  sir     said lu tze  sweating helpfulness from every pore .   the chief acolyte  drowning well out of his depth  seized on this like a passing lifebelt .      oh  would you be so good  lu tze .  it is so kind of you        lu tze vanished in a blur of helpful speed that  once again  quite surprised those who thought they knew him .   he reappeared with his broom and a robe made white and thin with frequent bashings on the stones by the river .  he solemnly handed them over to the chief acolyte .      er   uh   thank you  er   is there a special ceremony for the  for the  er  for   er       the man burbled .        very simple one  sir     said lu tze  still radiating eagerness .     wording is quite loose  sir  but generally we say     this is your robe  look after it  it belongs to the monastery     sir  and then with the broom we say something like    here   s your broom  treat it well  it is your friend  you will be fined if you lose it  remember they do not grow on trees     sir .         er   um   uh     the chief acolyte murmured .     and does the abbot           oh no  the abbot would not make a presentation to a sweeper     said lobsang quickly .      lu tze  who does the  er  does  uh  does the           it   s generally done by a senior sweeper  your acolytility .         oh .  and  er  by some happy chance  er  do you happen to be        lu tze bobbed a bow .      oh  yes  sir .      to the chief acolyte  still floundering in the flood of the turning tide  this was as welcome as the imminent prospect of dry land .  he beamed maniacally .      i wonder  i wonder  i wonder then if you would be so kind  er  then  er  to           happy to  sir .     lu tze swung around .     right now  sir .         oh  please  yes .         right you are .  step forward  lobsang ludd .         yes  sweeper .      lu tze held out the worn robe and the elderly broom .     broom .  robe .  do not lose them  we are not made of money .     he announced .      i thank you for them     said lobsang .     i am honored .      lobsang bowed  lu tze bowed .  with their heads close together and at the same height  lu tze hissed     very surprising .         thank you .         nicely mythic  the whole thing  definitely one for the scrolls  but bordering on smug .  do not try it again .           right .      they both stood up .     and   er   what happens now .     said the chief acolyte .  he was a broken man  and he knew it .  nothing was going to be the same after this .      nothing  really     said lu tze .     sweepers get on with sweeping .  you take that side  lad  and i   ll take this .         but he is time .     said the chief acolyte .     the son of wen .  there is so much we have to ask .         there is so much i will not tell     said lobsang  smiling .  the abbot leaned forward and dribbled in the chief acolyte   s ear .   the chief acolyte gave up .      of course  it is not up to us to question you     he said  backing away .      no     said lobsang .     it is not .  i suggest you all get on with your very important work  because this plaza is going to need all my attention .      there were frantic hand signals among the senior monks and  gradually  reluctantly  the monastery staff moved away .      they   ll be watching us from every place they can hide     mumbled lu tze when the sweepers were alone .      oh  yes     said lobsang .      so   how are you  then .         very well .  and my mother is happy  and she will retire with my father .         what .  a cottage in the country  that sort of thing .         not quite .  similar  though .      there was no sound for a while but the brushing of two brooms .   then lobsang said     i   m aware  lu tze  that it is usual for an apprentice to give a small gift or token to his master when he finishes his apprenticeship           possibly     said lu tze  straightening up     but i don   t need anything .  i   ve got my mat  my bowl  and my way .           every man has something he desires     said lobsang .      hah .  got you there then  wonder boy .  i   m eight hundred years old .  i   ve run through all my desires long ago .         oh dear .  that is a shame .  i hoped i could find something .     now lobsang straightened up and swung his broom onto his shoulder .      in any case  i must leave     he said .     there is so much still to do .         i   m sure there is     said lu tze .     i   m sure there is .  there   s the whole stretch under the trees  for one thing .  and while we   re on the subject  wonder boy  did you let that witch have her broomstick back .      lobsang nodded .     let us just say   i put things back .  it   s a lot newer than it was  too .         hah .     said lu tze  sweeping up a few more petals .     just like that .  just like that .  so easily does a thief of time repay his debts .      lobsang must have caught the rebuke in the tone .  he stared down at his feet .      well   perhaps not all of them  i admit     he said .      oh .     said lu tze  still apparently fascinated by the end of his own broom .      but when you have to save the world you cannot think of one person  you see  because one person is a part of that world     lobsang went on .      really .     said the sweeper .     you think so .  you   ve been talking to some very strange people  my lad .         but now i have time     said lobsang earnestly .     and i hope she   ll understand .         it   s amazing what a lady will understand  if you find the right way of putting it     said lu tze .     best of luck  lad .  you didn   t do so bad  on the whole .  and is it not written     it   s never too late    .      lobsang smiled at him  and vanished .     lu tze went back to sweeping .  after a while  he grinned at a memory .  an apprentice gives a gift to the master  eh .  as if lu tze could want anything that time could give him     and he stopped  and looked up  and laughed out loud .   overhead  swelling as he watched  the cherries were ripening .       tick  in some place that had not existed before  and only existed now for this very purpose  there stood a large  gleaming vat .      ten thousand gallons of delicate fondant sugar cream infused with essence of violets and stirred into dark chocolate     said chaos .     there are also strata of hazelnut praline in rich butter cream  and areas of soft caramel for that especial touch of delight .      so   you   re saying that this vat could exist somewhere in a truly infinite everywhere  and therefore it can exist here .  said death .      indeed     said chaos .   but it no longer exists in the place where it should exist .      no .  it should  now  exist here .  the math is easy     said chaos .   ah .  well  maths   said death  dismissively .  generally i never get much further than subtraction .      in any case  chocolate is hardly a rare commodity     said chaos .     there are planets covered in the stuff .      really .      indeed .        it might be best  said death  if news like that did not get about .   he walked back to where unity was waiting in the darkness .   you do not need to do this  he said .      what else is there .     said unity .     i have betrayed my own kind .  and i am hideously insane .  i can never be at home anywhere .  and staying here would be an agony .      she stared into the chocolate abyss .  a dusting of sugar sparkled on its surface .   then she slipped out of her dress .  to her amazement  she felt embarrassed about doing so  but still drew herself up haughtily .      spoon     she commanded and held out her right hand imperiously .  chaos gave a silver ladle a final  theatrical polish and passed it to her .      goodbye     said unity .     do pass on my best wishes to your granddaughter .      she walked a few steps back  turned  broke into a run  and took off into a perfect swallow dive .   the chocolate closed over her with barely a sound .  then the two watchers waited until the fat  lazy ripples had died away .      now there was a lady with style     said chaos .     what a waste .      yes .  i thought so .      well  it   s been fun   up to that point  anyway .  and now  i must be off     said chaos .   you   re continuing with the milk round .      people rely on me .      death looked impressed .   it   s going to be   interesting to have you back  he said .      yeah .  it is     said chaos .     you   re not coming .        i   m just going to wait here for a while .      why .      just in case .      ah .      yes .   it was some minutes later that death reached into his robe and pulled out a lifetimer that was small and light enough to have been designed for a doll .  he turned around .      but   i died     said the shade of unity .   yes  said death .  this is the next part         tick  emma robertson sat in the classroom with wrinkled brow  chewing on her pencil .  then  rather slowly  but with the air of one imparting great secrets  she set to work .   she wrote          we went to lanker where there are witches they are kind they grow erbs .  we met this which she was very jole and sang us a snog abot a hedghog it had difficut words .  jason try to kick her cat it chase him up a tre .  i know a lot about wiches now they do not have warts they do not eat you they are just like your grane except your grane does not know difult words .          at her high desk susan relaxed .  there was nothing like a classroom of bent heads .  a good teacher used whatever materials there were to hand  and taking the class to visit mrs .  ogg was an education in itself .  two educations .   a classroom going well had its own smell  a hint of pencil shavings  poster paints  long dead stick insects  glue  and  of course  the faint aroma of billy .   there had been an uneasy meeting with her grandfather .  she   d raged that he hadn   t told her things .  and he   d said  of course he hadn   t .  if you told humans what the future held  it wouldn   t .  that made sense .  of course  it made sense .  it was good logic .  the trouble was that susan was only mostly logical .  and so  now  things were back in that uneasy  rather cool state where they spent most of their time  in the tiny little family that ran on dysfunctionality .   maybe  she thought  that was a normal family state in any case .  when push came to shove   thank you  mrs .  ogg  she   d always remember that phrase now   they   d rely on each other automatically  without a thought .  apart from that  they kept out of one another   s way .   she hadn   t seen the death of rats lately .  it was too much to hope that he was dead .  in any case  it hadn   t slowed him down so far .   that thought made her think about the contents of her desk .  susan was very strict about eating in class and took the view that  if there were rules  then they applied to everyone  even her .  otherwise they were merely tyranny .  but rules were there to make you think before you broke them .   there was still half a box of higgs   meakins cheapest assortment tucked in there among the books and papers .   opening the lid carefully and slipping her hand in was easy  and so was the maintenance of a suitably teachery face while she did so .  questing fingers found a chocolate in the nest of empty paper cups .     then she briskly picked up the keys and walked to the classroom cupboard with what she hoped was the purposeful step of someone about to check on the supply of pencils .  after all  you never knew  with pencils .  they needed watching .   the door clicked behind her  leaving only the dim light through the transom .  she put the chocolate in her mouth  and shut her eyes .   she was mostly human and partly immortal .  it was a difficult trick .  it had to do with how you reacted to the universe and how the universe reacted to you .  in a way  it was all smoke and mirrors  or maybe it was really just a matter of assumption .  it certainly wasn   t a matter of logic .  she   d had certain powers and advantages and she would be immortal for as long as she lived .   the chocolate outer shell dissolved and her very human senses told her that she had selected a nougat .  but she was resolute .  life was tough .  sometimes you got a nougat .  you just had to bite it .   a faint  cardboardy sound made her open her eyes .   the lids were lifting on the boxes of stars she kept for the children  and the scraps of gold and silver paper were spilling out .   they twirled .  they moved around her in wheels and spirals .  they whirled up into the shadows of the cupboard and hung there  brilliant and beautiful against the darkness  a whole universe in miniature .   susan watched them for a while  and then said     all right .  you have my full attention  whoever you are .     at least  that was what she meant to say .  the peculiar stickiness of the nougat caused it to come out as     allite .  you ot my fo    a   nen   on  oover ooah .     damn .   the stars around her head grew brighter  and the cupboard   s interior darkened into interstellar black .        if iss is oo  def o    raffs       she began .      it   s me     said lobsang .       tick  even with nougat  you can have a perfect moment .       about the author

       quite an overrated activity .         an edge witch is one who makes her living on the edges  in that moment when boundary conditions apply   between life and death  light and dark  good and evil and  most dangerous of all  today and tomorrow .         but they still use forks  or  at least  the idea of forks .  there may  as the philosopher says  be no spoon  although this begs the question of why there is the idea of soup .         and the story continues  the novice who had protested that it was only the shrine of a sweeper ran away from the temple  the student who said nothing remained a sweeper for the rest of his life  and the student who had seen the inevitable shape of the story went  after much agonizing and several months of meticulous sweeping  to lu tze and knelt and asked to be shown the right way .  whereupon the sweeper took him to the dojo of the tenth djim  with its terrible multibladed fighting machines and its fearsome serrated weapons such as the clong clong and the uppsi .  the story runs that the sweeper then opened a cupboard at the back of the dojo and produced a broom and spake thusly     one hand here and the other here  understand .  people never get it right .  use good  even strokes and let the broom do most of the work .  never try to sweep up a big pile  you   ll end up sweeping every bit of dust twice .  use your dustpan wisely  and remember  a small brush for the corners .            one reason for this was the club food .  at his club  a gentleman could find the kind of food he   d got used to at school  like spotted dick  jam roly poly  and that perennial favorite  stodge and custard .  vitamins are eaten by wives .         which is much harder than seeing things that aren   t there .  everyone does that .         this is true .  a chocolate you did not want to eat does not count as chocolate .  this discovery is from the same branch of culinary physics that determined that food eaten while walking along contains no calories .         not    did    anything  just    did .     some things were done  and some things were not done .  and the things that were done  igors did .         igors were loyal  but they were not stupid .  a job was a job .  when an employer had no further use for your services  for example because he   d just been staked through the heart by a crowd of angry villagers  it was time to move on before they decided that you ought to be on the next stake .  an igor soon learned a secret way out of any castle and where to stash an overnight bag .  in the words of one of the founding igors     webelong dead .  excuthe me .  where doth it thay    we    .            and it has to be said that there was nothing intrinsically evil about igors themselves .  they just didn   t pass judgment on other people .  admittedly  that was because  if you worked for werewolves and vampires and people who looked on surgery as modern art rather than science  passing judgment would mean you   d never have time to get anything done .         every society needs a cry like that  but only in a very few do they come out with the complete  unvarnished version  which is    remember the atrocity committed against us last time that will excuse the atrocity that we   re about to commit today .  and so on .  hurrah .            the yeti of the ramtops  where the discworld   s magical field is so intense that it is part of the very landscape  are one of the few creatures to utilize control of personal time for genetic advantage .  the result is a kind of physical premonition   you find out what is going to happen next by allowing it to happen .  faced with danger  or any kind of task that involves risk of death  a yeti will save its life up to that point and then proceed with all due caution yet in the comfortable knowledge that  should everything go pancake shaped  it will wake up at the point where it saved itself with  and this is the important part  knowledge of the events which have just happened but which will not happen now because it   s not going to be such a damn fool next time .  this is not quite the paradox it appears because  after it has taken place  it hasn   t happened .  all that actually remains is a memory in the yeti   s head  which merely turns out to be a remarkably accurate premonition .  the little eddies in time caused by all this are just lost in the noise of all the kinks  dips  and knots put in time by every other living creature .         but not tasteful .         teaching small children for any length of time can do this to a vocabulary .         up to ten dollars a pound  usually .         if you live in a country where the tradition calls for mayonnaise  just don   t ask .  just don   t .
