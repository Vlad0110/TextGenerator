terry pratchett  small gods      a novel of discworld        now consider the tortoise and the eagle .   the tortoise is a ground living creature .  it is impossible to live nearer the ground without being under it .  its horizons are a few inches away .  it has about as good a turn of speed as you need to hunt down a lettuce .  it has survived while the rest of evolution flowed past it by being  on the whole  no threat to anyone and too much trouble to eat .   and then there is the eagle .  a creature of the air and high places  whose horizons go all the way to the edge of the world .  eyesight keen enough to spot the rustle of some small and squeaky creature half a mile away .  all power  all control .  lightning death on wings .  talons and claws enough to make a meal of anything smaller than it is and at least take a hurried snack out of anything bigger .   and yet the eagle will sit for hours on the crag and survey the kingdoms of the world until it spots a distant movement and then it will focus  focus  focus on the small shell wobbling among the bushes down there on the desert .  and it will leap     and a minute later the tortoise finds the world dropping away from it .  and it sees the world for the first time  no longer one inch from the ground but five hundred feet above it  and it thinks  what a great friend i have in the eagle .   and then the eagle lets go .   and almost always the tortoise plunges to its death .  everyone knows why the tortoise does this .  gravity is a habit that is hard to shake off .  no one knows why the eagle does this .  there   s good eating on a tortoise but  considering the effort involved  there   s much better eating on practically anything else .  it   s simply the delight of eagles to torment tortoises .   but of course  what the eagle does not realize is that it is participating in a very crude form of natural selection .   one day a tortoise will learn how to fly .       the story takes place in desert lands  in shades of umber and orange .  when it begins and ends is more problematical  but at least one of its beginnings took place above the snowline  thousands of miles away in the mountains around the hub .    one of the recurring philosophical questions is      does a falling tree in the forest make a sound when there is no one to hear .      which says something about the nature of philosophers  because there is always someone in a forest .  it may only be a badger  wondering what that cracking noise was  or a squirrel a bit puzzled by all the scenery going upwards  but someone .  at the very least  if it was deep enough in the forest  millions of small gods would have heard it .   things just happen  one after another .  they don   t care who knows .  but history   ah  history is different .  history has to be observed .  otherwise it   s not history .  it   s just   well  things happening one after another .   and  of course  it has to be controlled .  otherwise it might turn into anything .  because history  contrary to popular theories  is kings and dates and battles .  and these things have to happen at the right time .  this is difficult .  in a chaotic universe there are too many things to go wrong .  it   s too easy for a general   s horse to lose a shoe at the wrong time  or for someone to mishear an order  or for the carrier of the vital message to be waylaid by some men with sticks and a cash flow problem .  then there are wild stories  parasitic growths on the tree of history  trying to bend it their way .   so history has its caretakers .   they live   well  in the nature of things they live wherever they are sent  but their spiritual home is in a hidden valley in the high ramtops of the discworld  where the books of history are kept .   these aren   t books in which the events of the past are pinned like so many butterflies to a cork .  these are the books from which history is derived .  there are more than twenty thousand of them  each one is ten feet high  bound in lead  and the letters are so small that they have to be read with a magnifying glass .   when people say    it is written       it is written here .   there are fewer metaphors around than people think .   every month the abbot and two senior monks go into the cave where the books are kept .  it used to be the duty of the abbot alone  but two other reliable monks were included after the unfortunate case of the   th abbot  who made a million dollars in small bets before his fellow monks caught up with him .   besides  it   s dangerous to go in alone .  the sheer concentratedness of history  sleeting past soundlessly out into the world  can be overwhelming .  time is a drug .  too much of it kills you .   the    rd abbot folded his wrinkled hands and addressed lu tze  one of his most senior monks .  the clear air and untroubled life of the secret valley was such that all the monks were senior  besides  when you work with time every day  some of it tends to rub off .      the place is omnia     said the abbot     on the klatchian coast .         i remember     said lu tze .     young fellow called ossory  wasn   t there .         things must be   carefully observed     said the abbot .     there are pressures .  free will  predestination   the power of symbols   turning point   you know all about this .         haven   t been to omnia for  oh  must be seven hundred years     said lu tze .     dry place .  shouldn   t think there   s a ton of good soil in the whole country  either .         off you go  then     said the abbot .      i shall take my mountains     said lu tze .     the climate will be good for them .      and he also took his broom and his sleeping mat .  the history monks don   t go in for possessions .  they find most things wear out in a century or two .   it took him four years to get to omnia .  he had to watch a couple of battles and an assassination on the way  otherwise they would just have been random events .       it was the year of the notional serpent  or two hundred years after the declaration of the prophet abbys .   which meant that the time of the  th prophet was imminent .   that was the reliable thing about the church of the great god om .  it had very punctual prophets .  you could set your calendar by them  if you had one big enough .   and  as is generally the case around the time a prophet is expected  the church redoubled its efforts to be holy .  this was very much like the bustle you get in any large concern when the auditors are expected  but tended towards taking people suspected of being less holy and putting them to death in a hundred ingenious ways .  this is considered a reliable barometer of the state of one   s piety in most of the really popular religions .  there   s a tendency to declare that there is more backsliding around than in the national toboggan championships  that heresy must be torn out root and branch  and even arm and leg and eye and tongue  and that it   s time to wipe the slate clean .  blood is generally considered very efficient for this purpose .       and it came to pass that in that time the great god om spake unto brutha  the chosen one      psst .      brutha paused in mid hoe and stared around the temple garden .      pardon .     he said .   it was a fine day early in the lesser spring .  the prayer mills spun merrily in the breeze off the mountains .  bees loafed around in the bean blossoms  but buzzed fast in order to give the impression of hard work .  high above  a lone eagle circled .   brutha shrugged  and got back to the melons .   yea  the great god om spake again unto brutha  the chosen one      psst .      brutha hesitated .  someone had definitely spoken to him from out of the air .  perhaps it was a demon .  novice master brother nhumrod was hot on the subject of demons .  impure thoughts and demons .  one led to the other .  brutha was uncomfortably aware that he was probably overdue a demon .   the thing to do was to be resolute and repeat the nine fundamental aphorisms .   once more the great god om spake unto brutha  the chosen one      are you deaf  boy .      the hoe thudded on to the baking soil .  brutha spun around .  there were the bees  the eagle and  at the far end of the garden  old brother lu tze dreamily forking over the dung heap .  the prayer mills whirled reassuringly along the walls .   he made the sign with which the prophet ishkible had cast out spirits .      get thee behind me  demon     he muttered .      i am behind you .      brutha turned again  slowly .  the garden was still empty .   he fled .       many stories start long before they begin  and brutha   s story had its origins thousands of years before his birth .   there are billions of gods in the world .  they swarm as thick as herring roe .  most of them are too small to see and never get worshiped  at least by anything bigger than bacteria  who never say their prayers and don   t demand much in the way of miracles .   they are the small gods   the spirits of places where two ant trails cross  the gods of microclimates down between the grass roots .  and most of them stay that way .   because what they lack is belief .   a handful  though  go on to greater things .  anything may trigger it .  a shepherd  seeking a lost lamb  finds it among the briars and takes a minute or two to build a small cairn of stones in general thanks to whatever spirits might be around the place .  or a peculiarly shaped tree becomes associated with a cure for disease .  or someone carves a spiral on an isolated stone .  because what gods need is belief  and what humans want is gods .   often it stops there .  but sometimes it goes further .  more rocks are added  more stones are raised  a temple is built on the site where the tree once stood .  the god grows in strength  the belief of its worshipers raising it upwards like a thousand tons of rocket fuel .  for a very few  the sky   s the limit .   and  sometimes  not even that .       brother nhumrod was wrestling with impure thoughts in the privacy of his severe cell when he heard the fervent voice from the novitiates    dormitory .   the brutha boy was flat on his face in front of a statue of om in his manifestation as a thunderbolt  shaking and gabbling fragments of prayer .   there was something creepy about that boy  nhumrod thought .  it was the way he looked at you when you were talking  as if he was listening .   he wandered out and prodded the prone youth with the end of his cane .      get up  boy .  what do you think you   re doing in the dormitory in the middle of the day .  mmm .      brutha managed to spin around while still flat on the floor and grasped the priest   s ankles .      voice .  a voice .  it spoke to me .     he wailed .   nhumrod breathed out .  ah .  this was familiar ground .  voices were right up nhumrod   s cloister .  he heard them all the time .      get up  boy     he said  slightly more kindly .   brutha got to his feet .   he was  as nhumrod had complained before  too old to be a proper novice .  about ten years too old .  give me a boy up to the age of seven  nhumrod had always said .   but brutha was going to die a novice .  when they made the rules  they   d never allowed for anything like brutha .   his big red honest face stared up at the novice master .      sit down on your bed  brutha     said nhumrod .   brutha obeyed immediately .  brutha did not know the meaning of the word disobedience .  it was only one of a large number of words he didn   t know the meaning of .   nhumrod sat down beside him .      now  brutha     he said     you know what happens to people who tell falsehoods  don   t you .      brutha nodded  blushing .      very well .  now tell me about these voices .      brutha twisted the hem of his robe in his hands .      it was more like one voice  master     he said .         like one voice     said brother nhumrod .     and what did this voice say .  mmm .      brutha hesitated .  now he came to think about it  the voice hadn   t said anything very much .  it had just spoken .  it was  in any case  hard to talk to brother nhumrod  who had a nervous habit of squinting at the speaker   s lips and repeating the last few words they said practically as they said them .  he also touched things all the time   walls  furniture  people   as if he was afraid the universe would disappear if he didn   t keep hold of it .  and he had so many nervous tics that they had to queue .  brother nhumrod was perfectly normal for someone who had survived in the citadel for fifty years .      well       brutha began .   brother nhumrod held up a skinny hand .  brutha could see the pale blue veins in it .      and i am sure you know that there are two kinds of voice that are heard by the spiritual     said the master of novices .  one eyebrow began to twitch .      yes  master .  brother murduck told us that     said brutha  meekly .         told us that .  yes .  sometimes  as he in his infinite wisdom sees fit  the god speaks to a chosen one and he becomes a great prophet     said nhumrod .     now  i am sure you wouldn   t presume to consider yourself one of them .  mmm .         no  master .            master .  but there are other voices     said brother nhumrod  and now his voice had a slight tremolo     beguiling and wheedling and persuasive voices  yes .  voices that are always waiting to catch us off our guard .      brutha relaxed .  this was more familiar ground .   all the novices knew about those kinds of voices .  except that usually they talked about fairly straightforward things  like the pleasures of nighttime manipulation and the general desirability of girls .  which showed that they were novices when it came to voices .  brother nhumrod got the kind of voices that were  by comparison  a full oratorio .  some of the bolder novices liked to get brother nhumrod talking on the subject of voices .  he was an education  they said .  especially when little bits of white spit appeared at the corners of his mouth .   brutha listened .       brother nhumrod was the novice master  but he wasn   t the novice master .  he was only master of the group that included brutha .  there were others .  possibly someone in the citadel knew how many there were .  there was someone somewhere whose job it was to know everything .   the citadel occupied the whole of the heart of the city of kom  in the lands between the deserts of klatch and the plains and jungles of howondaland .  it extended for miles  its temples  churches  schools  dormitories  gardens  and towers growing into and around one another in a way that suggested a million termites all trying to build their mounds at the same time .   when the sun rose the reflection of the doors of the central temple blazed like fire .  they were bronze  and a hundred feet tall .  on them  in letters of gold set in lead  were the commandments .  there were five hundred and twelve so far  and doubtless the next prophet would add his share .   the sun   s reflected glow shone down and across the tens of thousands of the strong in faith who labored below for the greater glory of the great god om .   probably no one did know how many of them there were .  some things have a way of going critical .  certainly there was only one cenobiarch  the superior iam .  that was certain .  and six archpriests .  and thirty lesser iams .  and hundreds of bishops  deacons  subdeacons  and priests .  and novices like rats in a grain store .  and craftsmen  and bull breeders  and torturers  and vestigial virgins     no matter what your skills  there was a place for you in the citadel .   and if your skill lay in asking the wrong kinds of questions or losing the righteous kind of wars  the place might just be the furnaces of purity  or the quisition   s pits of justice .   a place for everyone .  and everyone in their place .       the sun beat down on the temple garden .   the great god om tried to stay in the shade of a melon vine .  he was probably safe here  here inside these walls and with the prayer towers all around  but you couldn   t be too careful .  he   d been lucky once  but it was asking too much to expect to be lucky again .   the trouble with being a god is that you   ve got no one to pray to .   he crawled forward purposefully towards the old man shoveling muck until  after much exertion  he judged himself to be within earshot .   he spake thusly     hey  you .      there was no answer .  there was not even any suggestion that anything had been heard .   om lost his temper and turned lu tze into a lowly worm in the deepest cesspit of hell  and then got even more angry when the old man went on peacefully shoveling .      the devils of infinity fill your living bones with sulphur .     he screamed .   this did not make a great deal of difference .      deaf old bugger     muttered the great god om .       or perhaps there was someone who did know all there was to be known about the citadel .  there   s always someone who collects knowledge  not because of a love of the stuff but in the same way that a magpie collects glitter or a caddis fly collects little bits of twigs and rock .  and there   s always someone who has to do all those things that need to be done but which other people would rather not do or  even  acknowledge existed .   the third thing the people noticed about vorbis was his height .  he was well over six feet tall  but stick thin  like a normal proportioned person modeled in clay by a child and then rolled out .   the second thing that people noticed about vorbis was his eyes .  his ancestors had come from one of the deep desert tribes that had evolved the peculiar trait of having dark eyes   not just dark of pupil  but almost black of eyeball .  it made it very hard to tell where he was looking .  it was as if he had sunglasses on under his skin .   but the first thing they noticed was his skull .   deacon vorbis was bald by design .  most of the church   s ministers  as soon as they were ordained  cultivated long hair and beards that you could lose a goat in .  but vorbis shaved all over .  he gleamed .  and lack of hair seemed to add to his power .  he didn   t menace .  he never threatened .  he just gave everyone the feeling that his personal space radiated several meters from his body  and that anyone approaching vorbis was intruding on something important .  superiors fifty years his senior felt apologetic about interrupting whatever it was he was thinking about .   it was almost impossible to know what he was thinking about and no one ever asked .  the most obvious reason for this was that vorbis was the head of the quisition  whose job it was to do all those things that needed to be done and which other people would rather not do .   you do not ask people like that what they are thinking about in case they turn around very slowly and say    you .      the highest post that could be held in the quisition was that of deacon  a rule instituted hundreds of years ago to prevent this branch of the church becoming too big for its boots .   but with a mind like his  everyone said  he could easily be an archpriest by now  or even an iam .   vorbis didn   t worry about that kind of trivia .  vorbis knew his destiny .  hadn   t the god himself told him .          there     said brother nhumrod  patting brutha on the shoulder .     i   m sure you will see things clearer now .      brutha felt that a specific reply was expected .      yes  master     he said .     i   m sure i shall .            shall .  it is your holy duty to resist the voices at all times     said nhumrod  still patting .      yes  master .  i will .  especially if they tell me to do any of the things you mentioned .            mentioned .  good .  good .  and if you hear them again  what will you do .  mmm .         come and tell you     said brutha  dutifully .         tell you .  good .  good .  that   s what i like to hear     said nhumrod .     that   s what i tell all my boys .  remember that i   m always here to deal with any little problems that may be bothering you .         yes  master .  shall i go back to the garden now .            now .  i think so .  i think so .  and no more voices  d   you hear .     nhumrod waved a finger of his nonpatting hand .  a cheek puckered .      yes  master .         what were you doing in the garden .         hoeing the melons  master     said brutha .      melons .  ah .  melons     said nhumrod slowly .      melons .  melons .  well  that goes some way toward explaining things  of course .      an eyelid flickered madly .       it wasn   t just the great god that spoke to vorbis  in the confines of his head .  everyone spoke to an exquisitor  sooner or later .  it was just a matter of stamina .   vorbis didn   t often go down to watch the inquisitors at work these days .  exquisitors didn   t have to .  he sent down instructions  he received reports .  but special circumstances merited his special attention .   it has to be said   there was little to laugh at in the cellar of the quisition .  not if you had a normal sense of humor .  there were no jolly little signs saying  you don   t have to be pitilessly sadistic to work here but it helps .  .  .   but there were things to suggest to a thinking man that the creator of mankind had a very oblique sense of fun indeed  and to breed in his heart a rage to storm the gates of heaven .   the mugs  for example .  the inquisitors stopped work twice a day for coffee .  their mugs  which each man had brought from home  were grouped around the kettle on the hearth of the central furnace which incidentally heated the irons and knives .   they had legends on them like a present from the holy grotto of ossory  or to the world   s greatest daddy .  most of them were chipped  and no two of them were the same .   and there were the postcards on the wall .  it was traditional that  when an inquisitor went on holiday  he   d send back a crudely colored woodcut of the local view with some suitably jolly and risqu   message on the back .  and there was the pinned up tearful letter from inquisitor first class ishmale    pop    quoom  thanking all the lads for collecting no fewer than seventy eight obols for his retirement present and the lovely bunch of flowers for mrs .  quoom  indicating that he   d always remember his days in no .    pit  and was looking forward to coming in and helping out any time they were shorthanded .   and it all meant this  that there are hardly any excesses of the most crazed psychopath that cannot easily be duplicated by a normal  kindly family man who just comes in to work every day and has a job to do .   vorbis loved knowing that .  a man who knew that  knew everything he needed to know about people .   currently he was sitting alongside the bench on which lay what was still  technically  the trembling body of brother sasho  formerly his secretary .   he looked up at the duty inquisitor  who nodded .  vorbis leaned over the chained secretary .      what were their names .     he repeated .         don   t know           i know you gave them copies of my correspondence  sasho .  they are treacherous heretics who will spend eternity in the hells .  will you join them .            don   t know names           i trusted you  sasho .  you spied on me .  you betrayed the church .            no names           truth is surcease from pain  sasho .  tell me .            truth        vorbis sighed .  and then he saw one of sasho   s fingers curling and uncurling under the manacles .  beckoning .      yes .      he leaned closer over the body .   sasho opened his one remaining eye .         truth           yes .            the turtle moves        vorbis sat back  his expression unchanged .  his expression seldom changed unless he wanted it to .  the inquisitor watched him in terror .      i see     said vorbis .  he stood up  and nodded at the inquisitor .      how long has he been down here .         two days  lord .         and you can keep him alive for    .         perhaps two days more  lord .         do so .  do so .  it is  after all     said vorbis     our duty to preserve life for as long as possible .  is it not .      the inquisitor gave him the nervous smile of one in the presence of a superior whose merest word could see him manacled on a bench .      er   yes  lord .         heresy and lies everywhere     vorbis sighed .     and now i shall have to find another secretary .  it is too vexing .          after twenty minutes brutha relaxed .  the siren voices of sensuous evil seemed to have gone away .   he got on with the melons .  he felt capable of understanding melons .  melons seemed a lot more comprehensible than most things .      hey  you .      brutha straightened up .      i do not hear you  oh foul succubus     he said .      oh yes you do  boy .  now  what i want you to do is           i   ve got my fingers in my ears .         suits you .  suits you .  makes you look like a vase .  now           i   m humming a tune .  i   m humming a tune .      brother preptil  the master of the music  had described brutha   s voice as putting him in mind of a disappointed vulture arriving too late at the dead donkey .  choral singing was compulsory for novitiates  but after much petitioning by brother preptil a special dispensation had been made for brutha .  the sight of his big round face screwed up in the effort to please was bad enough  but what was worse was listening to his voice  which was certainly powerful and full of intent conviction  swinging backward and forward across the tune without ever quite hitting it .   he got extra melons instead .   up in the prayer towers a flock of crows took off in a hurry .   after a full chorus of he is trampling the unrighteous with hooves of hot iron brutha unplugged his ears and risked a quick listen .   apart from the distant protests of the crows  there was silence .   it worked .  put your trust in the god  they said .  and he always had .  as far back as he could remember .   he picked up his hoe and turned back  in relief  to the vines .   the hoe   s blade was about to hit the ground when brutha saw the tortoise .   it was small and basically yellow and covered with dust .  its shell was badly chipped .  it had one beady eye   the other had fallen to one of the thousands of dangers that attend any slow moving creature which lives an inch from the ground .   he looked around .  the gardens were well inside the temple complex  and surrounded by high walls .      how did you get in here  little creature .     he said .     did you fly .      the tortoise stared monoptically at him .  brutha felt a bit homesick .  there had been plenty of tortoises in the sandy hills back home .      i could give you some lettuce     said brutha .     but i don   t think tortoises are allowed in the gardens .  aren   t you vermin .      the tortoise continued to stare .  practically nothing can stare like a tortoise .   brutha felt obliged to do something .      there   s grapes     he said .     probably it   s not sinful to give you one grape .  how would you like a grape  little tortoise .         how would you like to be an abomination in the nethermost pit of chaos .     said the tortoise .   the crows  who had fled to the outer walls  took off again to a rendering of the way of the infidel is a nest of thorns .   brutha opened his eyes and took his fingers out of his ears again .   the tortoise said     i   m still here .      brutha hesitated .  it dawned on him  very slowly  that demons and succubi didn   t turn up looking like small old tortoises .  there wouldn   t be much point .  even brother nhumrod would have to agree that when it came to rampant eroticism  you could do a lot better than a one eyed tortoise .      i didn   t know tortoises could talk     he said .      they can   t     said the tortoise .     read my lips .      brutha looked closer .      you haven   t got lips     he said .      no  nor proper vocal cords     agreed the tortoise .     i   m doing it straight into your head  do you understand .         gosh .         you do understand  don   t you .         no .      the tortoise rolled its eye .      i should have known .  well  it doesn   t matter .  i don   t have to waste time on gardeners .  go and fetch the top man  right now .         top man .     said brutha .  he put his hand to his mouth .     you don   t mean   brother nhumrod .         who   s he .     said the tortoise .      the master of the novices .         oh  me .     said the tortoise .     no     it went on  in a singsong imitation of brutha   s voice     i don   t mean the master of the novices .  i mean the high priest or whatever he calls himself .  i suppose there is one .      brutha nodded blankly .      high priest  right .     said the tortoise .     high .  priest .  high priest .      brutha nodded again .  he knew there was a high priest .  it was just that  while he could just about encompass the hierarchical structure between his own self and brother nhumrod  he was unable to give serious consideration to any kind of link between brutha the novice and the cenobiarch .  he was theoretically aware that there was one  that there was a huge canonical structure with the high priest at the top and brutha very firmly at the bottom  but he viewed it in the same way as an amoeba might view the chain of evolution all the way between itself and  for example  a chartered accountant .  it was missing links all the way to the top .      i can   t go asking the       brutha hesitated .  even the thought of talking to the cenobiarch frightened him into silence .     i can   t ask anyone to ask the high cenobiarch to come and talk to a tortoise .         turn into a mud leech and wither in the fires of retribution .     screamed the tortoise .      there   s no need to curse     said brutha .   the tortoise bounced up and down furiously .      that wasn   t a curse .  that was an order .  i am the great god om .      brutha blinked .   then he said     no you   re not .  i   ve seen the great god om     he waved a hand making the shape of the holy horns  conscientiously     and he isn   t tortoise shaped .  he comes as an eagle  or a lion  or a mighty bull .  there   s a statue in the great temple .  it   s seven cubits high .  it   s got bronze on it and everything .  it   s trampling infidels .  you can   t trample infidels when you   re a tortoise .  i mean  all you could do is give them a meaningful look .  it   s got horns of real gold .  where i used to live there was a statue one cubit high in the next village and that was a bull too .  so that   s how i know you   re not the great god      holy horns      om .      the tortoise subsided .      how many talking tortoises have you met .     it said sarcastically .      i don   t know     said brutha .      what d   you mean  you don   t know .         well  they might all talk     said brutha conscientiously  demonstrating the very personal kind of logic that got him extra melons .     they just might not say anything when i   m there .         i am the great god om     said the tortoise  in a menacing and unavoidably low voice     and before very long you are going to be a very unfortunate priest .  go and get him .         novice     said brutha .      what .         novice  not priest .  they won   t let me           get him .         but i don   t think the cenobiarch ever comes into our vegetable garden     said brutha .     i don   t think he even knows what a melon is .         i   m not bothered about that     said the tortoise .     fetch him now  or there will be a shaking of the earth  the moon will be as blood  agues and boils will afflict mankind and diverse ills will befall .  i really mean it     it added .      i   ll see what i can do     said brutha  backing away .      and i   m being very reasonable  in the circumstances .     the tortoise shouted after him .      you don   t sing badly  mind you .     it added  as an afterthought .      i   ve heard worse .     as brutha   s grubby robe disappeared through the gateway .      puts me in mind of that time there was the affliction of plague in pseudopolis     it said quietly  as the footsteps faded .     what a wailing and a gnashing of teeth was there  all right .     it sighed .     great days .  great days .          many feel they are called to the priesthood  but what they really hear is an inner voice saying     it   s indoor work with no heavy lifting  do you want to be a plowman like your father .      whereas brutha didn   t just believe .  he really believed .  that sort of thing is usually embarrassing when it happens in a god fearing family  but all brutha had was his grandmother  and she believed too .  she believed like iron believes in metal .  she was the kind of woman every priest dreads in a congregation  the one who knows all the chants  all the sermons .  in the omnian church women were allowed in the temple only on sufferance  and had to keep absolutely silent and well covered up in their own section behind the pulpit in case the sight of one half of the human race caused the male members of the congregation to hear voices not unakin to those that plagued brother nhumrod through every sleeping and waking hour .  the problem was that brutha   s grandmother had the kind of personality that can project itself through a lead sheet and a bitter piety with the strength of a diamond bit auger .   if she had been born a man  omnianism would have found its  th prophet rather earlier than expected .  as it was  she organized the temple cleaning  statue polishing  and stoning of suspected adulteresses rotas with a terrible efficiency .   so brutha grew up in the sure and certain knowledge of the great god om .  brutha grew up knowing that om   s eyes were on him all the time  especially in places like the privy  and that demons assailed him on all sides and were only kept at bay by the strength of his belief and the weight of grandmother   s cane  which was kept behind the door on those rare occasions when it was not being used .  he could recite every verse in all seven books of the prophets  and every single precept .  he knew all the laws and the songs .  especially the laws .   the omnians were a god fearing people .   they had a great deal to fear .       vorbis   s room was in the upper citadel  which was unusual for a mere deacon .  he hadn   t asked for it .  he seldom had to ask for anything .  destiny has a way of marking her own .   he also got visited by some of the most powerful men in the church   s hierarchy .   not  of course  the six archpriests or the cenobiarch himself .  they weren   t that important .  they were merely at the top .  the people who really run organizations are usually found several levels down  where it   s still possible to get things done .   people liked to be friends with vorbis  mainly because of the aforesaid mental field which suggested to them  in the subtlest of ways  that they didn   t want to be his enemy .   two of them were sitting down with him now .  they were general iam fri   it  who whatever the official records might suggest was the man who ran most of the divine legion  and bishop drunah  secretary to the congress of iams .  people might not think that was much of a position of power  but then they   d never been minutes secretary to a meeting of slightly deaf old men .   neither man was in fact there .  they were not talking to vorbis .  it was one of those kinds of meeting .  lots of people didn   t talk to vorbis  and went out of their way to not have meetings with him .  some of the abbots from the distant monasteries had recently been summoned to the citadel  traveling secretly for up to a week across tortuous terrain  just so they definitely wouldn   t join the shadowy figures visiting vorbis   s room .  in the last few months  vorbis had apparently had about as many visitors as the man in the iron mask .   nor were they talking .  but if they had been there  and if they had been having a conversation  it would have gone like this      and now     said vorbis     the matter of ephebe .      bishop drunah shrugged .       of no consequence  they say .  no threat .      the two men looked at vorbis  a man who never raised his voice .  it was very hard to tell what vorbis was thinking  often even after he had told you .      really .  is this what we   ve come to .     he said .     no threat .  after what they did to poor brother murduck .  the insults to om .  this must not pass .  what is proposed to be done .         no more fighting     said fri   it .     they fight like madmen .  no .  we   ve lost too many already .         they have strong gods     said drunah .      they have better bows     said fri   it .      there is no god but om     said vorbis .     what the ephebians believe they worship are nothing but djinns and demons .  if it can be called worship .  have you seen this .      he pushed forward a scroll of paper .      what is it .     said fri   it cautiously .      a lie .  a history that does not exist and never existed   the   the things       vorbis hesitated  trying to remember a word that had long since fallen into disuse        like the   tales told to children  who are too young   words for people to say   the           oh .  a play     said fri   it .  vorbis   s gaze nailed him to the wall .      you know of these things .         i   when i traveled in klatch once       fri   it stuttered .  he visibly pulled himself together .  he had commanded one hundred thousand men in battle .  he didn   t deserve this .   he found he didn   t dare look at vorbis   s expression .      they dance dances     he said limply .     on their holy days .  the women have bells on their   and sing songs .  all about the early days of the worlds  when the gods        he faded .     it was disgusting     he said .  he clicked his knuckles  a habit of his whenever he was worried .      this one has their gods in it     said vorbis .     men in masks .  can you believe that .  they have a god of wine .  a drunken old man .  and people say ephebe is no threat .  and this        he tossed another  thicker scroll on to the table .      this is far worse .  for while they worship false gods in error  their error is in their choice of gods  not in their worship .  but this        drunah gave it a cautious examination .      i believe there are other copies  even in the citadel     said vorbis .     this one belonged to sasho .  i believe you recommended him to my service  fri   it .         he always struck me as an intelligent and keen young man     said the general .      but disloyal     said vorbis     and now receiving his just reward .  it is only to be regretted that he has not been induced to give us the names of his fellow heretics .      fri   it fought against the sudden rush of relief .  his eyes met those of vorbis .   drunah broke the silence .      de chelonian mobile     he said aloud .        the turtle moves .     what does that mean .         even telling you could put your soul at risk of a thousand years in hell     said vorbis .  his eyes had not left fri   it  who was now staring fixedly at the wall .      i think it is a risk we might carefully take     said drunah .   vorbis shrugged .     the writer claims that the world   travels through the void on the back of four huge elephants     he said .   drunah   s mouth dropped open .      on the back .     he said .      it is claimed     said vorbis  still watching fri   it .      what do they stand on .         the writer says they stand on the shell of an enormous turtle     said vorbis .   drunah grinned nervously .      and what does that stand on .     he said .      i see no point in speculating as to what it stands on     snapped vorbis     since it does not exist .         of course  of course     said drunah quickly .     it was only idle curiosity .         most curiosity is     said vorbis .     it leads the mind into speculative ways .  yet the man who wrote this walks around free  in ephebe  now .      drunah glanced at the scroll .      he says here he went on a ship that sailed to an island on the edge and he looked over and           lies     said vorbis evenly .     and it would make no difference even if they were not lies .  truth lies within  not without .  in the words of the great god om  as delivered through his chosen prophets .  our eyes may deceive us  but our god never will .         but        vorbis looked at fri   it .  the general was sweating .      yes .     he said .      well   ephebe .  a place where madmen have mad ideas .  everyone knows that .  maybe the wisest course is leave them to stew in their folly .      vorbis shook his head .     unfortunately  wild and unstable ideas have a disturbing tendency to move around and take hold .      fri   it had to admit that this was true .  he knew from experience that true and obvious ideas  such as the ineffable wisdom and judgment of the great god om  seemed so obscure to many people that you actually had to kill them before they saw the error of their ways  whereas dangerous and nebulous and wrong headed notions often had such an attraction for some people that they would   he rubbed a scar thoughtfully   hide up in the mountains and throw rocks at you until you starved them out .  they   d prefer to die rather than see sense .  fri   it had seen sense at an early age .  he   d seen it was sense not to die .      what do you propose .     he said .      the council want to parley with ephebe     said drunah .     you know i have to organize a deputation to leave tomorrow .         how many soldiers .     said vorbis .      a bodyguard only .  we have been guaranteed safe passage  after all     said fri   it .      we have been guaranteed safe passage     said vorbis .  it sounded like a lengthy curse .     and once inside    .      fri   it wanted to say  i   ve spoken to the commander of the ephebian garrison  and i think he is a man of honor  although of course he is indeed a despicable infidel and lower than the worms .  but it was not the kind of thing he felt it wise to say to vorbis .   he substituted     we shall be on our guard .         can we surprise them .      fri   it hesitated .     we .     he said .      i shall lead the party     said vorbis .  there was the briefest exchange of glances between himself and the secretary .     i   would like to be away from the citadel for a while .  a change of air .  besides  we should not let the ephebians think they merit the attentions of a superior member of the church .  i was just musing as to the possibilities  should we be provoked        fri   it   s nervous click was like a whip crack .      we have given them our word           there is no truce with unbelievers     said vorbis .      but there are practical considerations     said fri   it  as sharply as he dared .     the palace of ephebe is a labyrinth .  i know .  there are traps .  no one gets in without a guide .         how does the guide get in .     said vorbis .      i assume he guides himself     said the general .      in my experience there is always another way     said vorbis .     into everything  there is always another way .  which the god will show in his own good time  we can be assured of that .         certainly matters would be easier if there was a lack of stability in ephebe     said drunah .     it does indeed harbor certain   elements .         and it will be the gateway to the whole of the turn wise coast     said vorbis .      well           the djel  and then tsort     said vorbis .   drunah tried to avoid seeing fri   it   s expression .      it is our duty     said vorbis .     our holy duty .  we must not forget poor brother murduck .  he was unarmed and alone .          brutha   s huge sandals flip flopped obediently along the stone flagged corridor toward brother nhumrod   s barren cell .   he tried composing messages in his head .  master  there   s a tortoise who says   master  this tortoise wants   master  guess what  i heard from this tortoise in the melons that     brutha would never have dared to think of himself as a prophet  but he had a shrewd idea of the outcome of any interview that began in this way .   many people assumed that brutha was an idiot .  he looked like one  from his round open face to his splayfeet and knock ankles .  he also had the habit of moving his lips while he thought deeply  as if he was rehearsing every sentence .  and this was because that was what he was doing .  thinking was not something that came easily to brutha .  most people think automatically  thoughts dancing through their brains like static electricity across a cloud .  at least  that   s how it seemed to him .  whereas he had to construct thoughts a bit at a time  like someone building a wall .  a short lifetime of being laughed at for having a body like a barrel and feet that gave the impression that they were about to set out in opposite directions had given him a strong tendency to think very carefully about anything he said .   brother nhumrod was prostrate on the floor in front of a statue of om trampling the ungodly  with his fingers in his ears .  the voices were troubling him again .   brutha coughed .  he coughed again .   brother nhumrod raised his head .      brother nhumrod .     said brutha .      what .         er   brother nhumrod .         what .      brother nhumrod unplugged his ears .      yes .     he said testily .      um .  there   s something you ought to see .  in the   in the garden .  brother nhumrod .      the master of novices sat up .  brutha   s face was a glowing picture of concern .      what do you mean .     brother nhumrod said .      in the garden .  it   s hard to explain .  um .  i found out   where the voices were coming from  brother nhumrod .  and you did say to be sure and tell you .      the old priest gave brutha a sharp look .  but if ever there was a person without guile or any kind of subtlety  it was brutha .       fear is strange soil .  mainly it grows obedience like corn  which grows in rows and makes weeding easy .  but sometimes it grows the potatoes of defiance  which flourish underground .   the citadel had a lot of underground .  there were the pits and tunnels of the quisition .  there were cellars and sewers  forgotten rooms  dead ends  spaces behind ancient walls  even natural caves in the bedrock itself .   this was such a cave .  smoke from the fire in the middle of the floor found its way out through a crack in the roof and  eventually  into the maze of uncountable chimneys and light wells above .   there were a dozen figures in the dancing shadows .  they wore rough hoods over nondescript clothes   crude things made of rags  nothing that couldn   t easily be burned after the meeting so that the wandering fingers of the quisition would find nothing incriminating .  something about the way most of them moved suggested men who were used to carrying weapons .  here and there  clues .  a stance .  the turn of a word .   on one wall of the cave there was a drawing .  it was vaguely oval  with three little extensions at the top   the middle one slightly the largest of the three   and three at the bottom  the middle one of these slightly longer and more pointed .  a child   s drawing of a turtle .      of course he   ll go to ephebe     said a mask .     he won   t dare not to .  he   ll have to dam the river of truth  at its source .         we must bail out what we can  then     said another mask .      we must kill vorbis .         not in ephebe .  when that happens  it must happen here .  so that people will know .  when we   re strong enough .         will we ever be strong enough .     said a mask .  its owner clicked his knuckles nervously .      even the peasants know there   s something wrong .  you can   t stop the truth .  dam the river of truth .  then there are leaks of great force .  didn   t we find out about murduck .  hah .     killed in ephebe     vorbis said .         one of us must go to ephebe and save the master .  if he really exists .         he exists .  his name is on the book .         didactylos .  a strange name .  it means two fingered  you know .         they must honor him in ephebe .         bring him back here  if possible .  and the book .      one of the masks seemed hesitant .  his knuckles clicked again .      but will people rally behind   a book .  people need more than a book .  they   re peasants .  they can   t read .         but they can listen .         even so   they need to be shown   they need a symbol           we have one .      instinctively  every masked figure turned to look at the drawing on the wall  indistinct in the firelight but graven on their minds .  they were looking at the truth  which can often impress .      the turtle moves .         the turtle moves .         the turtle moves .      the leader nodded .      and now     he said     we will draw lots            the great god om waxed wroth  or at least made a spirited attempt .  there is a limit to the amount of wroth that can be waxed one inch from the ground  but he was right up against it .   he silently cursed a beetle  which is like pouring water onto a pond .  it didn   t seem to make any difference  anyway .  the beetle plodded away .   he cursed a melon unto the eighth generation  but nothing happened .  he tried a plague of boils .  the melon just sat there  ripening slightly .   just because he was temporarily embarrassed  the whole world thought it could take advantage .  well  when om got back to his rightful shape and power  he told himself  steps would be taken .  the tribes of beetles and melons would wish they   d never been created .  and something really horrible would happen to all eagles .  and   and there would be a holy commandment involving the planting of more lettuces     by the time the big boy arrived back with the waxy skinned man  the great god om was in no mood for pleasantries .  besides  from a tortoise eye viewpoint even the most handsome human is only a pair of feet  a distant pointy head  and  somewhere up there  the wrong end of a pair of nostrils .      what   s this .     he snarled .      this is brother nhumrod     said brutha .     master of the novices .  he is very important .         didn   t i tell you not to bring me some fat old pederast .     shouted the voice in his head .     your eyeballs will be spitted on shafts of fire for this .      brutha knelt down .      i can   t go to the high priest     he said  as patiently as possible .     novices aren   t even allowed in the great temple except on special occasions .  i   d be taught the error of my ways by the quisition if i was caught .  it   s the law .         stupid fool .     the tortoise shouted .   nhumrod decided that it was time to speak .      novice brutha     he said     for what reason are you talking to a small tortoise .         because       brutha paused .     because it   s talking to me   isn   t it .      brother nhumrod looked down at the small  one eyed head poking out of the shell .   he was  by and large  a kindly man .  sometimes demons and devils did put disquieting thoughts in his head  but he saw to it that they stayed there and he did not in any literal sense deserve to be called what the tortoise called him which  in fact  if he had heard it  he would have thought was something to do with feet .  and he was well aware that it was possible to hear voices attributed to demons and  sometimes  gods .  tortoises was a new one .  tortoises made him feel worried about brutha  whom he   d always thought of as an amiable lump who did  without any sort of complaint  anything asked of him .  of course  many novices volunteered for cleaning out the cesspits and bull cages  out of a strange belief that holiness and piety had something to do with being up to your knees in dirt .  brutha never volunteered  but if he was told to do something he did it  not out of any desire to impress  but simply because he   d been told .  and now he was talking to tortoises .      i think i have to tell you  brutha     he said     that it is not talking .         you can   t hear it .         i cannot hear it  brutha .         it told me it was       brutha hesitated .     it told me it was the great god .      he flinched .  grandmother would have hit him with something heavy now .      ah .  well  you see  brutha     said brother nhumrod  twitching gently     this sort of thing is not unknown among young men recently called to the church .  i daresay you heard the voice of the great god when you were called  didn   t you .  mmm .      metaphor was lost on brutha .  he remembered hearing the voice of his grandmother .  he hadn   t been called so much as sent .  but he nodded anyway .      and in your   enthusiasm  it   s only natural that you should think you hear the great god talking to you     nhumrod went on .   the tortoise bounced up and down .      smite you with thunderbolts .     it screamed .      i find healthy exercise is the thing     said nhumrod .     and plenty of cold water .         writhe on the spikes of damnation .      nhumrod reached down and picked up the tortoise  turning it over .  its legs waggled angrily .      how did it get here  mmm .         i don   t know  brother nhumrod     said brutha dutifully .      your hand to wither and drop off .     screamed the voice in his head .      there   s very good eating on one of these  you know     said the master of novices .  he saw the expression on brutha   s face .      look at it like this     he said .     would the great god om      holy horns      ever manifest himself in such a lowly creature as this .  a bull  yes  of course  an eagle  certainly  and i think on one occasion a swan   but a tortoise .         your sexual organs to sprout wings and fly away .         after all     nhumrod went on  oblivious to the secret chorus in brutha   s head     what kind of miracles could a tortoise do .  mmm .         your ankles to be crushed in the jaws of giants .         turn lettuce into gold  perhaps .     said brother nhumrod  in the jovial tones of those blessed with no sense of humor .     crush ants underfoot .  ahaha .         haha     said brutha dutifully .      i shall take it along to the kitchen  out of your way     said the master of novices .     they make excellent soup .  and then you   ll hear no more voices  depend upon it .  fire cures all follies  yes .         soup .         er       said brutha .      your intestines to be wound around a tree until you are sorry .      nhumrod looked around the garden .  it seemed to be full of melons and pumpkins and cucumbers .  he shuddered .      lots of cold water  that   s the thing     he said .     lots and lots .     he focused on brutha again .     mmm .      he wandered off toward the kitchens .       the great god om was upside down in a basket in one of the kitchens  half buried under a bunch of herbs and some carrots .   an upturned tortoise will try to right itself firstly by sticking out its neck to its fullest extent and trying to use its head as a lever .  if this doesn   t work it will wave its legs frantically  in case this will rock it upright .   an upturned tortoise is the ninth most pathetic thing in the entire multiverse .   an upturned tortoise who knows what   s going to happen to it next is  well  at least up there at number four .   the quickest way to kill a tortoise for the pot is to plunge it into boiling water .   kitchens and storerooms and craftsmen   s workshops belonging to the church   s civilian population honeycombed the citadel .   this was only one of them  a smoky ceilinged cellar whose focal point was an arched fireplace .  flames roared up the flue .  turnspit dogs trotted in their treadmills .  cleavers rose and fell on the chopping blocks .   off to one side of the huge hearth  among various other blackened cauldrons  a small pot of water was already beginning to seethe .      the worms of revenge to eat your blackened nostrils .     screamed om  twitching his legs violently .  the basket rocked .   a hairy hand reached in and removed the herbs .      hawks to peck your liver .      a hand reached in again and took the carrots .      afflict you with a thousand cuts .      a hand reached in and took the great god om .      the cannibal fungi of    .         shut up .     hissed brutha  shoving the tortoise under his robe .   he sidled toward the door  unnoticed in the general culinary chaos .   one of the cooks looked at him and raised an eyebrow .      just got to take this back     brutha burbled  bringing out the tortoise and waving it helpfully .     deacon   s orders .      the cook scowled  and then shrugged .  novices were regarded by one and all as the lowest form of life  but orders from the hierarchy were to be obeyed without question  unless the questioner wanted to find himself faced with more important questions like whether or not it is possible to go to heaven after being roasted alive .   when they were out in the courtyard brutha leaned against the wall and breathed out .      your eyeballs to    .     the tortoise began .      one more word     said brutha     and it   s back in the basket .      the tortoise fell silent .      as it is  i shall probably get into trouble for missing comparative religion with brother whelk     said brutha .     but the great god has seen fit to make the poor man shortsighted and he probably won   t notice i   m not there  only if he does i shall have to say what i   ve done because telling lies to a brother is a sin and the great god will send me to hell for a million years .         in this one case i could be merciful     said the tortoise .     no more than a thousand years at the outside .         my grandmother told me i shall go to hell when i die anyway     said brutha  ignoring this .     being alive is sinful .  it stands to reason  because you have to sin every day when you   re alive .      he looked down at the tortoise .      i know you   re not the great god om      holy horns      because if i was to touch the great god om      holy horns      my hands would burn away .  the great god would never become a tortoise  like brother nhumrod said .  but it says in the book of the prophet cena that when he was wandering in the desert the spirits of the ground and the air spoke unto him  so i wondered if you were one of those .      the tortoise gave him a one eyed stare for a while .  then it said     tall fellow .  full beard .  eyes wobbling all over the place .         what .     said brutha .      i think i recall him     said the tortoise .     eyes wobbled when he talked .  and he talked all the time .  to himself .  walked into rocks a lot .         he wandered in the wilderness for three months     said brutha .      that explains it  then     said the tortoise .     there   s not a lot to eat there that isn   t mushrooms .         perhaps you are a demon     said brutha .     the septateuch forbids us to have discourse with demons .  yet in resisting demons  says the prophet fruni  we may grow strong in faith           your teeth to abscess with red hot heat .         pardon .         i swear to me that i am the great god om  greatest of gods .      brutha tapped the tortoise on the shell .      let me show you something  demon .      he could feel his faith growing  if he listened hard .       this wasn   t the greatest statue of om  but it was the closest .  it was down in the pit level reserved for prisoners and heretics .  and it was made of iron plates riveted together .   the pits were deserted except for a couple of novices pushing a rough cart in the distance .      it   s a big bull     said the tortoise .      the very likeness of the great god om in one of his worldly incarnations .     said brutha proudly .     and you say you   re him .         i haven   t been well lately     said the tortoise .   its scrawny neck stretched out further .      there   s a door on its back     it said .     why   s there a door on its back .         so that the sinful can be put in     said brutha .      why   s there another one in its belly .         so the purified ashes can be let out     said brutha .     and the smoke issues forth from the nostrils  as a sign to the ungodly .      the tortoise craned its neck around at the rows of barred doors .  it looked up at the soot encrusted walls .  it looked down at the now empty fire trench under the iron bull .  it reached a conclusion .  it blinked its one eye .      people .     it said eventually .     you roast people in it .         there .     said brutha triumphantly .     and thus you prove you are not the great god .  he would know that of course we do not burn people in there .  burn people in there .  that would be unheard of .         ah     said the tortoise .     then what    .         it is for the destruction of heretical materials and other such rubbish     said brutha .      very sensible     said the tortoise .      sinners and criminals are purified by fire in the quisition   s pits or sometimes in front of the great temple     said brutha .     the great god would know that .         i think i must have forgotten     said the tortoise quietly .      the great god om      holy horns      would know that he himself said unto the prophet wallspur       brutha coughed and assumed the creased eyebrow squint that meant serious thought was being undertaken .        let the holy fire destroy utterly the unbeliever .     that   s verse sixty five .         did i say that .         in the year of the lenient vegetable the bishop kreeblephor converted a demon by the power of reason alone     said brutha .     it actually joined the church and became a subdeacon .  or so it is said .         fighting i don   t mind     the tortoise began .      your lying tongue cannot tempt me  reptile     said brutha .     for i am strong in my faith .      the tortoise grunted with effort .      smite you with thunderbolts .      a small  a very small black cloud appeared over brutha   s head and a small  a very small bolt of lightning lightly singed an eyebrow .   it was about the same strength as the spark off a cat   s fur in hot dry weather .      ouch .         now do you believe me .     said the tortoise .       there was a bit of breeze on the roof of the citadel .  it also offered a good view of the high desert .   fri   it and drunah waited for a while to get their breath back .   then fri   it said     are we safe up here .      drunah looked up .  an eagle circled over the dry hills .  he found himself wondering how good an eagle   s hearing was .  it certainly was good at something .  was it hearing .  it could hear a creature half a mile below in the silence of the desert .  what the hells   it couldn   t talk as well  could it .      probably     he said .      can i trust you .     said fri   it .      can i trust you .      fri   it drummed his fingers on the parapet .      uh     he said .   and that was the problem .  it was the problem of all really secret societies .  they were secret .  how many members did the turtle movement have .  no one knew  exactly .  what was the name of the man beside you .  two other members knew  because they would have introduced him  but who were they behind these masks .  because knowledge was dangerous .  if you knew  the inquisitions could wind it slowly out of you .  so you made sure you didn   t know .  this made conversation much easier during cell meetings  and impossible outside of them .   it was the problem of all tentative conspirators throughout history  how to conspire without actually uttering words to an untrusted possible fellow conspirator which  if reported  would point the accusing red hot poker of guilt .   the little beads of sweat on drunah   s forehead  despite the warm breeze  suggested that the secretary was agonizing along the same lines .  but it didn   t prove it .  and for fri   it  not dying had become a habit .   he clicked his knuckles nervously .      a holy war     he said .  that was safe enough .  the sentence included no verbal clue to what fri   it thought about the prospect .  he hadn   t said     ye god  not a damn holy war  is the man insane .  some idiot missionary gets himself killed  some man writes some gibberish about the shape of the world  and we have to go to war .     if pressed  and indeed stretched and broken  he could always claim that his meaning had been    at last .  a not to be missed opportunity to die gloriously for om  the one true god  who shall trample the unrighteous with hooves of iron .     it wouldn   t make a lot of difference  evidence never did once you were in the deep levels where accusation had the status of proof  but at least it might leave one or two inquisitors feeling that they might just have been wrong .      of course  the church has been far less militant in the last century or so     said drunah  looking out over the desert .     much taken up with the mundane problems of the empire .      a statement .  not a crack in it where you could insert a bone disjointer .      there was the crusade against the hodgsonites     said fri   it distantly .     and the subjugation of the melchiorites .  and the resolving of the false prophet zeb .  and the correction of the ashelians  and the shriving of the           but all that was just politics     said drunah .      hmm .  yes .  of course  you are right .         and  of course  no one could possibly doubt the wisdom of a war to further the worship and glory of the great god .         no .  none could doubt it     said fri   it  who had walked across many a battlefield the day after a glorious victory  when you had ample opportunity to see what winning meant .  the omnians forbade the use of all drugs .  at times like that the prohibition bit hard  when you dared not go to sleep for fear of your dreams .      did not the great god declare  through the prophet abbys  that there is no greater and more honorable sacrifice than one   s own life for the god .         indeed he did     said fri   it .  he couldn   t help recalling that abbys had been a bishop in the citadel for fifty years before the great god had chosen him .  screaming enemies had never come at him with a sword .  he   d never looked into the eyes of someone who wished him dead   no  of course he had  all the time  because of course the church had its politics   but at least they hadn   t been holding the means to that end in their hands at the time .      to die gloriously for one   s faith is a noble thing     drunah intoned  as if reading the words off an internal notice board .      so the prophets tell us     said fri   it  miserably .   the great god moved in mysterious ways  he knew .  undoubtedly he chose his prophets  but it seemed as if he had to be helped .  perhaps he was too busy to choose for himself .  there seemed to be a lot more meetings  a lot more nodding  a lot more exchanging of glances even during the services in the great temple .   certainly there was a glow about young vorbis   how easy it was to slip from one thought to the other .  there was a man touched by destiny .  a tiny part of fri   it  the part that had lived for much of its life in tents  and been shot at quite a lot  and had been in the middle of melees where you could just as easily be killed by an ally as an enemy  added  or at least by something .  it was a part of him that was due to spend all the eternities in all the hells  but it had already had a lot of practice .      you know i traveled a lot when i was much younger .     he said .      i have often heard you talk most interestingly of your travels in heathen lands     said drunah politely .     often bells are mentioned .         did i ever tell you about the brown islands .         out beyond the end of the world     said drunah .     i remember .  where bread grows on trees and young women find little white balls in oysters .  they dive for them  you said  while wearing not a stitc           something else i remember     said fri   it .  it was a lonely memory  out here with nothing but scrubland under a purple sky .     the sea is strong there .  there are big waves  much bigger than the ones in the circle sea  you understand  and the men paddle out beyond them to fish .  on strange planks of wood .  and when they wish to return to shore  they wait for a wave  and then   they stand up  on the wave  and it carries them all the way to the beach .         i like the story about the young swimming women best     said drunah .      sometimes there are very big waves     said fri   it  ignoring him .     nothing would stop them .  but if you ride them  you do not drown .  this is something i learned .      drunah caught the glint in his eye .      ah     he said  nodding .     how wonderful of the great god to put such instructive examples in our path .         the trick is to judge the strength of the wave     said fri   it .     and ride it .         what happens to those who don   t .         they drown .  often .  some of the waves are very big .         such is often the nature of waves  i understand .      the eagle was still circling .  if it had understood anything  then it wasn   t showing it .      useful facts to bear in mind     said drunah  with sudden brightness .     if ever one should find oneself in heathen parts .         indeed .          from prayer towers up and down the contours of the citadel the deacons chanted the duties of the hour .   brutha should have been in class .  but the tutor priests weren   t too strict with him .  after all  he had arrived word perfect in every book of the septateuch and knew all the prayers and hymns off by heart  thanks to grandmother .  they probably assumed he was being useful .  usefully doing something no one else wanted to do .   he hoed the bean rows for the look of the thing .  the great god om  although currently the small god om  ate a lettuce leaf .   all my life  brutha thought  i   ve known that the great god om   he made the holy horns sign in a fairly halfhearted way   was a   a   great big beard in the sky  or sometimes  when he comes down into the world  as a huge bull or a lion or   something big  anyway .  something you could look up to .   somehow a tortoise isn   t the same .  i   m trying hard   but it isn   t the same .  and hearing him talk about the septarchs as if they were just   just some mad old men   it   s like a dream     in the rain forests of brutha   s subconscious the butterfly of doubt emerged and flapped an experimental wing  all unaware of what chaos theory has to say about this sort of thing        i feel a lot better now     said the tortoise .     better than i have for months .         months .     said brutha .     how long have you been   ill .      the tortoise put its foot on a leaf .      what day is it .     it said .      tenth of grune     said brutha .      yes .  what year .         er   notional serpent   what do you mean  what year .         then   three years     said the tortoise .     this is good lettuce .  and it   s me saying it .  you don   t get lettuce up in the hills .  a bit of plantain  a thorn bush or two .  let there be another leaf .      brutha pulled one off the nearest plant .  and lo  he thought  there was another leaf .      and you were going to be a bull .     he said .      opened my eyes   my eye   and i was a tortoise .         why .         how should i know .  i don   t know .     lied the tortoise .      but you   you   re omnicognisant     said brutha .      that doesn   t mean i know everything .      brutha bit his lip .     um .  yes .  it does .         you sure .         yes .         thought that was omnipotent .         no .  that means you   re all powerful .  and you are .  that   s what it says in the book of ossory .  he was one of the great prophets  you know .  i hope     brutha added .      who told him i was omnipotent .         you did .         no i didn   t .         well  he said you did .         don   t even remember anyone called ossory     the tortoise muttered .      you spoke to him in the desert     said brutha .     you must remember .  he was eight feet tall .  with a very long beard .  and a huge staff .  and the glow of the holy horns shining out of his head .     he hesitated .  but he   d seen the statues and the holy icons .  they couldn   t be wrong .      never met anyone like that     said the small god om .      maybe he was a bit shorter     brutha conceded .      ossory .  ossory     said the tortoise .     no   no   can   t say i           he said that you spoke unto him from out of a pillar of flame     said brutha .      oh  that ossory     said the tortoise .     pillar of flame .  yes .         and you dictated to him the book of ossory     said brutha .     which contains the directions  the gateways  the abjurations  and the precepts .  one hundred and ninety three chapters .         i don   t think i did all that     said om doubtfully .     i   m sure i would have remembered one hundred and ninety three chapters .         what did you say to him  then .         as far as i can remember it was    hey  see what i can do .        said the tortoise .   brutha stared at it .  it looked embarrassed  insofar as that   s possible for a tortoise .      even gods like to relax     it said .      hundreds of thousands of people live their lives by the abjurations and the precepts .     brutha snarled .      well .  i   m not stopping them     said om .      if you didn   t dictate them  who did .         don   t ask me .  i   m not omnicognisant .      brutha was shaking with anger .      and the prophet abbys .  i suppose someone just happened to give him the codicils  did they .         it wasn   t me           they   re written on slabs of lead ten feet tall .         oh  well  it must have been me  yes .  i always have a ton of lead slabs around in case i meet someone in the desert  yes .         what .  if you didn   t give them to him  who did .         i don   t know .  why should i know .  i can   t be everywhere at once .         you   re omnipresent .         what says so .         the prophet hashimi .         never met the man .         oh .  oh .  so i suppose you didn   t give him the book of creation  then .         what book of creation .         you mean you don   t know .         no .         then who gave it to him .         i don   t know .  perhaps he wrote it himself .      brutha put his hand over his mouth in horror .      thaff blafhngf .         what .      brutha removed his hand .      i said  that   s blasphemy .         blasphemy .  how can i blaspheme .  i   m a god .         i don   t believe you .         hah .  want another thunderbolt .         you call that a thunderbolt .      brutha was red in the face  and shaking .  the tortoise hung its head sadly .      all right .  all right .  not much of one  i admit     it said .     if i was better  you   d have been just a pair of sandals with smoke coming out .     it looked wretched .     i don   t understand it .  this sort of thing has never happened to me before .  i intended to be a great big roaring white bull for a week and ended up a tortoise for three years .  why .  i don   t know  and i   m supposed to know everything .  according to these prophets of yours who say they   ve met me  anyway .  you know  no one even heard me .  i tried talking to goatherds and stuff  and they never took any notice .  i was beginning to think i was a tortoise dreaming about being a god .  that   s how bad it was getting .         perhaps you are     said brutha .      your legs to swell to tree trunks .     snapped the tortoise .      but   but     said brutha     you   re saying the prophets were   just men who wrote things down .         that   s what they were .         yes  but it wasn   t from you .         some of it was  perhaps     said the tortoise .     i   ve   forgotten so much  the past few years .         but if you   ve been down here as a tortoise  who   s been listening to the prayers .  who has been accepting the sacrifices .  who has been judging the dead .         i don   t know     said the tortoise .     who did it before .         you did .         did i .      brutha stuck his fingers in his ears and opened up with the third verse of lo  the infidels flee the wrath of om .   after a couple of minutes the tortoise stuck its head out from under its shell .      so     it said     before unbelievers get burned alive   do you sing to them first .         no .         ah .  a merciful death .  can i say something .         if you try to tempt my faith one more time        the tortoise paused .  om searched his fading memory .  then he scratched in the dust with a claw .      i   remember a day   summer day   you were   thirteen        the dry little voice droned on .  brutha   s mouth formed a slowly widening o .   finally he said     how did you know that .         you believe the great god om watches everything you do  don   t you .         you   re a tortoise  you couldn   t have           when you were almost fourteen  and your grandmother had beaten you for stealing cream from the still room  which in fact you had not done  she locked you in your room and you said     i wish you were               there will be a sign  thought vorbis .  there was always a sign  for the man who watched for them .  a wise man always put himself in the path of the god .   he strolled through the citadel .  he always made a point of taking a daily walk through some of the lower levels  although of course always at a different time  and via a different route .  insofar as vorbis got any pleasure in life  at least in any way that could be recognized by a normal human being  it was in seeing the faces of humble members of the clergy as they rounded a corner and found themselves face to chin with deacon vorbis of the quisition .  there was always that little intake of breath that indicated a guilty conscience .  vorbis liked to see properly guilty consciences .  that was what consciences were for .  guilt was the grease in which the wheels of the authority turned .   he rounded a corner and saw  scratched crudely on the wall opposite  a rough oval with four crude legs and even cruder head and tail .   he smiled .  there seemed to be more of them lately .  let heresy fester  let it come to the surface like a boil .  vorbis knew how to wield the lance .   but the second or two of reflection had made him walk past a turning and  instead  he stepped out into the sunshine .   he was momentarily lost  for all his knowledge of the byways of the church .  this was one of the walled gardens .  around a fine stand of tall decorative klatchian corn  bean vines raised red and white blossoms towards the sun  in between the bean rows  melons baked gently on the dusty soil .  in the normal way  vorbis would have noted and approved of this efficient use of space  but in the normal way he wouldn   t have encountered a plump young novice  rolling back and forth in the dust with his fingers in his ears .   vorbis stared down at him .  then he prodded brutha with his sandal .      what ails you  my son .      brutha opened his eyes .   there weren   t many superior members of the hierarchy he could recognize .  even the cenobiarch was a distant blob in the crowd .  but everyone recognized vorbis the exquisitor .  something about him projected itself on your conscience within a few days of your arrival at the citadel .  the god was merely to be feared in the perfunctory ways of habit  but vorbis was dreaded .   brutha fainted .      how very strange     said vorbis .   a hissing noise made him look around .   there was a small tortoise near his foot .  as he glared  it tried to back away  and all the time it was staring at him and hissing like a kettle .   he picked it up and examined it carefully  turning it over and over in his hands .  then he looked around the walled garden until he found a spot in full sunshine  and put the reptile down  on its back .  after a moment   s thought he took a couple of pebbles from one of the vegetable beds and wedged them under the shell so that the creature   s movement wouldn   t tip it over .   vorbis believed that no opportunity to acquire esoteric knowledge should ever be lost  and made a mental note to come back again in a few hours to see how it was getting on  if work permitted .   then he turned his attention to brutha .       there was a hell for blasphemers .  there was a hell for the disputers of rightful authority .  there were a number of hells for liars .  there was probably a hell for little boys who wished their grandmothers were dead .  there were more than enough hells to go around .   this was the definition of eternity  it was the space of time devised by the great god om to ensure that everyone got the punishment that was due to them .   the omnians had a great many hells .   currently  brutha was going through all of them .   brother nhumrod and brother vorbis looked down at him  tossing and turning on his bed like a beached whale .      it   s the sun     said nhumrod  almost calm now after the initial shock of having the exquisitor come looking for him .     the poor lad works all day in that garden .  it was bound to happen .         have you tried beating him .     said brother vorbis .      i   m sorry to say that beating young brutha is like trying to flog a mattress     said nhumrod .     he says    ow .     but i think it   s only because he wants to show he   s willing .  very willing lad  brutha .  he   s the one i told you about .         he doesn   t look very sharp     said vorbis .      he   s not     said nhumrod .   vorbis nodded approvingly .  undue intelligence in a novice was a mixed blessing .  sometimes it could be channeled for the greater glory of om  but often it caused   well  it did not cause trouble  because vorbis knew exactly what to do with misapplied intelligence  but it did cause unnecessary work .      and yet you tell me his tutors speak so highly of him     he said .   nhumrod shrugged .      he is very obedient     he said .     and   well  there   s his memory .         what about his memory .         there   s so much of it     said nhumrod .      he has got a good memory .         good is the wrong word .  it   s superb .  he   s word perfect on the entire sept           hmm .     said vorbis .   nhumrod caught the deacon   s eye .      as perfect  that is  as anything may be in this most imperfect world     he muttered .      a devoutly read young man     said vorbis .      er     said nhumrod     no .  he can   t read .  or write .         ah .  a lazy boy .      the deacon was not a man who dwelt in gray areas .  nhumrod   s mouth opened and shut silently as he sought for the proper words .      no     he said .     he tries .  we   re sure he tries .  he just does not seem to be able to make the   he cannot fathom the link between the sounds and the letters .         you have beaten him for that  at least .         it seems to have little effect  deacon .         how  then  has he become such a capable pupil .         he listens     said nhumrod .   no one listened quite like brutha  he reflected .  it made it very hard to teach him .  it was like   it was like being in a great big cave .  all your words just vanished into the unfillable depths of brutha   s head .  the sheer concentrated absorption could reduce unwary tutors to stuttering silence  as every word they uttered whirled away into brutha   s ears .      he listens to everything     said nhumrod .     and he watches everything .  he takes it all in .      vorbis stared down at brutha .      and i   ve never heard him say an unkind word     said nhumrod .     the other novices make fun of him  sometimes .  call him the big dumb ox .  you know the sort of thing .      vorbis   s gaze took in brutha   s ham sized hands and tree trunk legs .   he appeared to be thinking deeply .      cannot read and write     said vorbis .     but extremely loyal  you say .         loyal and devout     said nhumrod .      and a good memory     vorbis murmured .      it   s more than that     said nhumrod .     it   s not like memory at all .      vorbis appeared to reach a decision .      send him to see me when he is recovered     he said .   nhumrod looked panicky .      i merely wish to talk to him     said vorbis .     i may have a use for him .         yes  lord .         for  i suspect  the great god om moves in mysterious ways .          high above .  no sound but the hiss of wind in feathers .   the eagle stood on the breeze  looking down at the toy buildings of the citadel .   it had dropped it somewhere  and now it couldn   t find it .  somewhere down there  in that little patch of green .       bees buzzed in the bean blossoms .  and the sun beat down on the upturned shell of om .   there is also a hell for tortoises .   he was too tired to waggle his legs now .  that was all you could do  waggle your legs .  and stick your head out as far as it would go and wave it about in the hope that you could lever yourself over .   you died if you had no believers  and that was what a small god generally worried about .  but you also died if you died .   in the part of his mind not occupied with thoughts of heat  he could feel brutha   s terror and bewilderment .  he shouldn   t have done that to the boy .  of course he hadn   t been watching him .  what god did that .  who cared what people did .  belief was the thing .  he   d just picked the memory out of the boy   s mind  to impress  like a con juror removing an egg from someone   s ear .   i   m on my back  and getting hotter  and i   m going to die     and yet   and yet   that bloody eagle had dropped him on a compost heap .  some kind of clown  that eagle .  a whole place built of rocks on a rock in a rocky place  and he landed on the one thing that   d break his fall without breaking him as well .  and really close to a believer .   odd  that .  made you wonder if it wasn   t some kind of divine providence  except that you were divine providence   and on your back  getting hotter  preparing to die     that man who   d turned him over .  that expression on that mild face .  he   d remember that .  that expression  not of cruelty  but of some different level of being .  that expression of terrible peace     a shadow crossed the sun .  om squinted up into the face of lu tze  who gazed at him with gentle  upside down compassion .  and then turned him the right way up .  and then picked up his broom and wandered off  without a second glance .   om sagged  catching his breath .  and then brightened up .   someone up there likes me  he thought .  and it   s me .       sergeant simony waited until he was back in his own quarters before he unfolded his own scrap of paper .   he was not at all surprised to find it marked with a small drawing of a turtle .  he was the lucky one .   he   d lived for a moment like this .  someone had to bring back the writer of the truth  to be a symbol for the movement .  it had to be him .  the only shame was that he couldn   t kill vorbis .   but that had to happen where it could be seen .   one day .  in front of the temple .  otherwise no one would believe .       om stumped along a sandy corridor .   he   d hung around a while after brutha   s disappearance .  hanging around is another thing tortoises are very good at .  they   re practically world champions .   bloody useless boy  he thought .  served himself right for trying to talk to a barely coherent novice .   of course  the skinny old one hadn   t been able to hear him .  nor had the chef .  well  the old one was probably deaf .  as for the cook   om made a note that  when he was restored to his full godly powers  a special fate was going to lie in wait for the cook .  he wasn   t sure exactly what it was going to be  but it was going to involve boiling water and probably carrots would come into it somewhere .   he enjoyed the thought of that for a moment .  but where did it leave him .  it left him in this wretched garden  as a tortoise .  he knew how he   d got in   he glared in dull terror at the tiny dot in the sky that the eye of memory knew was an eagle   and he   d better find a more terrestrial way out unless he wanted to spend the next month hiding under a melon leaf .   another thought struck him .  good eating .   when he had his power again  he was going to spend quite some time devising a few new hells .  and a couple of fresh precepts  too .  thou shalt not eat of the meat of the turtle .  that was a good one .  he was surprised he hadn   t thought of it before .  perspective  that   s what it was .   and if he   d thought of one like thou shalt bloody well pick up any distressed tortoises and carry them anywhere they want unless  and this is important  you   re an eagle a few years ago  he wouldn   t be in this trouble now .   nothing else for it .  he   d have to find the cenobiarch himself .  someone like a high priest would be bound to be able to hear him .   and he   d be in this place somewhere .  high priests tended to stay put .  he should be easy enough to find .  and while he might currently be a tortoise  om was still a god .  how hard could it be .   he   d have to go upwards .  that   s what a hierarchy meant .  you found the top man by going upwards .   wobbling slightly  his shell jerking from side to side  the former great god om set off to explore the citadel erected to his greater glory .   he couldn   t help noticing things had changed a lot in three thousand years .          me .     said brutha .     but  but           i don   t believe he means to punish you     said nhumrod .     although punishment is what you richly deserve  of course .  we all richly deserve     he added piously .      but why .            why .  he said he just wants to talk to you .         but there is nothing i could possibly say that a quisitor wants to hear .     wailed brutha .         hear .  i am sure you are not questioning the deacon   s wishes     said nhumrod .      no .  no .  of course not     said brutha .  he hung his head .      good boy     said nhumrod .  he patted as far up brutha   s back as he could reach .     just you trot along     he said .     i   m sure everything will be all right .     and then  because he too had been brought up in habits of honesty  he added     probably all right .          there were few steps in the citadel .  the progress of the many processions that marked the complex rituals of great om demanded long  gentle slopes .  such steps as there were  were low enough to encompass the faltering steps of very old men .  and there were so many very old men in the citadel .   sand blew in all the time from the desert .  drifts built up on the steps and in the courtyards  despite everything that an army of brush wielding novices could do .   but a tortoise has very inefficient legs .      thou shall build shallower steps     he hissed  hauling himself up .   feet thundered past him  a few inches away .  this was one of the main thoroughfares of the citadel  leading to the place of lamentation  and was trodden by thousands of pilgrims every day .   once or twice an errant sandal caught his shell and spun him around .      your feet to fly from your body and be buried in a termite mound .     he screamed .   it made him feel a little better .   another foot clipped him and slid him across the stones .  he fetched up  with a clang  against a curved metal grille set low in one wall .  only a lightning grab with his jaws stopped him slipping through it .  he ended up hanging by his mouth over a cellar .   a tortoise has incredibly powerful jaw muscles .  he swayed a bit  legs wobbling .  all right .  a tortoise in a crevassed  rocky landscape was used to this sort of thing .  he just had to get a leg hooked     faint sounds drew themselves to his attention .  there was the clink of metal  and then a very soft whimper .   om swiveled his eye around .   the grille was high in one wall of a very long  low room .  it was brightly illuminated by the light wells that ran everywhere through the citadel .   vorbis had made a point of that .  the inquisitors shouldn   t work in the shadows  he said  but in the light .   where they could see  very clearly  what they were doing .   so could om .   he hung from the grille for some time  unable to take his eye off the row of benches .   on the whole  vorbis discouraged red hot irons  spiked chains  and things with drills and big screws on  unless it was for a public display on an important fast day .  it was amazing what you could do  he always said  with a simple knife     but many of the inquisitors liked the old ways best .   after a while  om very slowly hauled himself up to the grille  neck muscles twitching .  like a creature with its mind on something else  the tortoise hooked first one front leg over a bar  then another .  his back legs waggled for a while  and then he hooked a claw on to the rough stonework .   he strained for a moment and then pulled himself back into the light .   he walked off slowly  keeping close to the wall to avoid the feet .  he had no alternative to walking slowly in any case  but now he was walking slowly because he was thinking .  most gods find it hard to walk and think at the same time .       anyone could go to the place of lamentation .  it was one of the great freedoms of omnianism .   there were all sorts of ways to petition the great god  but they depended largely on how much you could afford  which was right and proper and exactly how things should be .  after all  those who had achieved success in the world clearly had done it with the approval of the great god  because it was impossible to believe that they had managed it with his disapproval .  in the same way  the quisition could act without possibility of flaw .  suspicion was proof .  how could it be anything else .  the great god would not have seen fit to put the suspicion in the minds of his exquisitors unless it was right that it should be there .  life could be very simple  if you believed in the great god om .  and sometimes quite short  too .   but there were always the improvident  the stupid  and those who  because of some flaw or oversight in this life or a past one  were not even able to afford a pinch of incense .  and the great god  in his wisdom and mercy as filtered through his priests  had made provision for them .   prayers and entreaties could be offered up in the place of lamentation .  they would assuredly be heard .  they might even be heeded .   behind the place  which was a square two hundred meters across  rose the great temple itself .   there  without a shadow of a doubt  the god listened .   or somewhere close  anyway     thousands of pilgrims visited the place every day .   a heel knocked om   s shell  bouncing him off the wall .  on the rebound a crutch caught the edge of his carapace and whirled him away into the crowd  spinning like a coin .  he bounced up against the bedroll of an old woman who  like many others  reckoned that the efficacy of her petition was increased by the amount of time she spent in the square .   the god blinked muzzily .  this was nearly as bad as eagles .  it was nearly as bad as the cellar   no  perhaps nothing was as bad as the cellar     he caught a few words before another passing foot kicked him away .      the drought has been on our village for three years   a little rain  oh lord .      rotating on the top of his shell  vaguely wondering if the right answer might stop people kicking him  the great god muttered     no problem .      another foot bounced him  unseen by any of the pious  between the forest of legs .  the world was a blur .   he caught an ancient voice  steeped in hopelessness  saying     lord  lord  why must my son be taken to join your divine legion .  who now will tend the farm .  could you not take some other boy .         don   t worry about it     squeaked om .   a sandal caught him under his tail and flicked him several yards across the square .  no one was looking down .  it was generally believed that staring fixedly at the golden horns on the temple roof while uttering the prayer gave it added potency .  where the presence of the tortoise was dimly registered as a bang on the ankle  it was disposed of by an automatic prod with the other foot .         my wife  who is sick with the           right .      kick           make clean the well in our village  which is foul with           you got it .      kick           every year the locusts come  and           i promise  only    .      kick           lost upon the seas these five months              stop kicking me .      the tortoise landed  right side up  in a brief  clear space .   visible     so much of animal life is the recognition of pattern  the shapes of hunter and hunted .  to the casual eye the forest is  well  just forest  to the eye of the dove it is so much unimportant fuzzy green background to the hawk which you did not notice on the branch of a tree .  to the tiny dot of the hunting buzzard in the heights  the whole panorama of the world is just a fog compared to the scurrying prey in the grass .   from his perch on the horns themselves  the eagle leapt into the sky .   fortunately  the same awareness of shapes that made the tortoise so prominent in a square full of scurrying humans made the tortoise   s one eye swivel upwards in dread anticipation .   eagles are single minded creatures .  once the idea of lunch is fixed in their mind  it tends to remain there until satisfied .       there were two divine legionaries outside vorbis   s quarters .  they looked sideways at brutha as he knocked timorously at the door  as if looking for a reason to assault him .   a small gray priest opened the door and ushered brutha into a small  barely furnished room .  he pointed meaningfully at a stool .   brutha sat down .  the priest vanished behind a curtain .  brutha took one glance around the room and     blackness engulfed him .  before he could move  and brutha   s reflexes were not well coordinated at the best of times  a voice by his ear said     now  brother  do not panic .  i order you not to panic .      there was cloth in front of brutha   s face .      just nod  boy .      brutha nodded .  they put a hood over your face .  all the novices knew that .  stories were told in the dormitories .  they put a cloth over your face so the inquisitors didn   t know who they were working on        good .  now  we are going into the next room .  be careful where you tread .      hands guided him upright and across the floor .  through the mists of incomprehension he felt the brush of the curtain  and then was jolted down some steps and into a sandy floored room .  the hands spun him a few times  firmly but without apparent ill will  and then led him along a passageway .  there was the swish of another curtain  and then the indefinable sense of a larger space .   afterward  long afterward  brutha realized  there was no terror .  a hood had been slipped over his head in the room of the head of the quisition  and it never occurred to him to be terrified .  because he had faith .      there is a stool behind you .  be seated .      brutha sat .      you may remove the hood .      brutha removed the hood .   he blinked .   seated on stools at the far end of the room  with a holy legionary on either side of them  were three figures .  he recognized the aquiline face of deacon vorbis  the other two were a short and stocky man  and a very fat one .  not heavily built  like brutha  but a genuine lard tub .  all three wore plain gray robes .   there was no sign of any branding irons  or even of scalpels .   all three were staring intently .      novice brutha .     said vorbis .   brutha nodded .   vorbis gave a light laugh  the kind made by very intelligent people when they think of something that probably isn   t very amusing .      and  of course  one day we shall have to call you brother brutha     he said .     or even father brutha .  rather confusing  i think .  best to be avoided .  i think we shall have to see to it that you become subdeacon brutha just as soon as possible  what do you think of that .      brutha did not think anything of it .  he was vaguely aware that advancement was being discussed  but his mind had gone blank .      anyway  enough of this     said vorbis  with the slight exasperation of someone who realizes that he is going to have to do a lot of work in this conversation .     do you recognize these learned fathers on my left and right .      brutha shook his head .      good .  they have some questions to ask you .      brutha nodded .   the very fat man leaned forward .      do you have a tongue  boy .      brutha nodded .  and then  feeling that perhaps this wasn   t enough  presented it for inspection .   vorbis laid a restraining hand on the fat man   s arm .      i think our young friend is a little overawed     he said mildly .   he smiled .      now  brutha   please put it away   i am going to ask you some questions .  do you understand .      brutha nodded .      when you first came into my apartments  you were for a few seconds in the anteroom .  please describe it to me .      brutha stared frog eyed at him .  but the turbines of recollection ground into life without his volition  pouring their words into the forefront of his mind .      it is a room about three meters square .  with white walls .  there is sand on the floor except in the corner by the door  where the flagstones are visible .  there is a window on the opposite wall  about two meters up .  there were three bars in the window .  there is a three legged stool .  there is a holy icon of the prophet ossory  carved from aphacia wood and set with silver leaf .  there is a scratch in the bottom left hand corner of the frame .  there is a shelf under the window .  there is nothing on the shelf but a tray .      vorbis steepled his long thin fingers in front of his nose .      on the tray .     he said .      i am sorry  lord .         what was on the tray  my son .      images whirled in front of brutha   s eyes .      on the tray was a thimble .  a bronze thimble .  and two needles .  on the tray was a length of cord .  there were knots in the cord .  three knots .  and nine coins were on the tray .  there was a silver cup on the tray  decorated with a pattern of aphacia leaves .  there was a long dagger  i think it was steel  with a black handle with seven ridges on it .  there was a small piece of black cloth on the tray .  there was a stylus and a slate           tell me about the coins     murmured vorbis .      three of them were citadel cents     said brutha promptly .     two were showing the horns  and one the sevenfold crown .  four of the coins were very small and golden .  there was lettering on them which   which i could not read  but which if you were to give me a stylus i think i could           this is some sort of trick .     said the fat man .      i assure you     said vorbis     the boy could have seen the entire room for no more than a second .  brutha   tell us about the other coins .         the other coins were large .  they were bronze .  they were derechmi from ephebe .         how do you know this .  they are hardly common in the citadel .         i have seen them once before  lord .         when was this .      brutha   s face screwed up with effort .      i am not sure       he said .   the fat man beamed at vorbis .      hah     he said .      i think       said brutha       it was in the afternoon .  but it may have been the morning .  around midday .  on grune    in the year of the astounded beetle .  some merchants came to our village .         how old were you at that time .     said vorbis .      i was within one month of three years old  lord .         i don   t believe this     said the fat man .   brutha   s mouth opened and shut once or twice .  how did the fat man know .  he hadn   t been there .      you could be wrong  my son     said vorbis .     you are a well grown lad of   what   seventeen  eighteen years .  we feel you could not really recall a chance glimpse of a foreign coin fifteen years ago .         we think that you are making it up     said the fat man .   brutha said nothing .  why make anything up .  when it was just sitting there in his head .      can you remember everything that   s ever happened to you .     said the stocky man  who had been watching brutha carefully throughout the exchange .  brutha was glad of the interruption .      no  lord .  most things .         you forget things .         uh .  there are sometimes things i don   t remember .     brutha had heard about forgetfulness  although he found it hard to imagine .  but there were times in his life  in the first few years of his life especially  when there was   nothing .  not an attrition of memory  but great locked rooms in the mansion of his recollection .  not forgotten  any more than a locked room ceases to exist  but   locked .      what is the first thing you can remember  my son .     said vorbis  kindly .      there was a bright light  and then someone hit me     said brutha .   the three men stared at him blankly .  then they turned to one another .  brutha  through the misery of his terror  heard snatches of whispering .         is there to lose .           foolishness and probably demonic          stakes are high          one chance  and they will be expecting us        and so on .   he looked around the room .   furnishing was not a priority in the citadel .  shelves  stools  tables   there was a rumor among the novices that priests towards the top of the hierarchy had golden furniture  but there was no sign of it here .  the room was as severe as anything in the novices    quarters although it had  perhaps  a more opulent severity  it wasn   t the forced bareness of poverty  but the starkness of intent .      my son .      brutha looked back hurriedly .   vorbis glanced at his colleagues .  the stocky man nodded .  the fat man shrugged .      brutha     said vorbis     return to your dormitory now .  before you go  one of the servants will give you something to eat  and a drink .  you will report to the gate of horns at dawn tomorrow  and you will come with me to ephebe .  you know about the delegation to ephebe .      brutha shook his head .      perhaps there is no reason why you should     said vorbis .     we are going to discuss political matters with the tyrant .  do you understand .      brutha shook his head .      good     said vorbis .     very good .  oh  and   brutha .         yes  lord .         you will forget this meeting .  you have not been in this room .  you have not seen us here .      brutha gaped at him .  this was nonsense .  you couldn   t forget things just by wishing .  some things forgot themselves   the things in those locked rooms   but that was because of some mechanism he could not access .  what did this man mean .      yes  lord     he said .   it seemed the simplest way .       gods have no one to pray to .   the great god om scurried towards the nearest statue  neck stretched  inefficient legs pumping .  the statue happened to be himself as a bull  trampling an infidel  although this was no great comfort .   it was only a matter of time before the eagle stopped circling and swooped .   om had been a tortoise for only three years  but with the shape he had inherited a grab bag of instincts  and a lot of them centered around a total terror of the one wild creature that had found out how to eat tortoise .   gods have no one to pray to .   om really wished that this was not the case .   but everyone needs someone .      brutha .          brutha was a little uncertain about his immediate future .  deacon vorbis had clearly cut him loose from his chores as a novice  but he had nothing to do for the rest of the afternoon .   he gravitated towards the garden .  there were beans to tie up  and he welcomed the fact .  you knew where you were with beans .  they didn   t tell you to do impossible things  like forget .  besides  if he was going to be away for a while  he ought to mulch the melons and explain things to lu tze .   lu tze came with the gardens .   every organization has someone like him .  they might be pushing a broom in obscure corridors  or wandering among the shelves in the back of the stores  where they are the only person who knows where anything is  or have some ambiguous but essential relationship with the boiler room .  everyone knows who they are and no one remembers a time when they weren   t there  or knows where they go when they   re not  well  where they usually are .  just occasionally  people who are slightly more observant than most other people  which is not on the face of it very difficult  stop and wonder about them for a while   and then get on with something else .   strangely enough  given his gentle ambling from garden to garden around the citadel  lu tze never showed much interest in the plants themselves .  he dealt in soil  manure  muck  compost  loam  and dust  and the means of moving it about .  generally he was pushing a broom  or turning over a heap .  once anyone put seeds in anything he lost interest .   he was raking the paths when brutha entered .  he was good at raking paths .  he left scallop patterns and gentle soothing curves .  brutha always felt apologetic about walking on them .   he hardly ever spoke to lu tze  because it didn   t matter much what anyone ever said to lu tze .  the old man just nodded and smiled his single toothed smile in any case .      i   m going away for a little while     said brutha  loudly and distinctly .     i expect someone else will be sent to look after the gardens  but there are some things that need doing        nod  smile .  the old man followed him patiently along the rows  while brutha spoke beans and herbs .      understand .     said brutha  after ten minutes of this .   nod  smile .  nod  smile  beckon .      what .      nod  smile  beckon .  nod  smile  beckon  smile .   lu tze walked his little crab monkey walk to the little area at the far end of the walled garden which contained his heaps  the flowerpot stacks  and all the other cosmetics of the garden beautiful .  the old man slept there  brutha suspected .   nod  smile  beckon .   there was a small trestle table in the sun by a stack of bean canes .  a straw mat had been spread on it  and on the mat were half a dozen pointy shaped rocks  none of them bigger than a foot high .   a careful arrangement of sticks had been constructed around them .  bits of thin wood shadowed some parts of the rocks .  small metal mirrors directed sunlight towards other areas .  paper cones at odd angles appeared to be funneling the breeze to very precise points .   brutha had never heard about the art of bonsai  and how it was applied to mountains .      they   re   very nice     he said uncertainly .   nod  smile  pick up a small rock  smile  urge  urge .      oh  i really couldn   t take        urge  urge .  grin  nod .   brutha took the tiny mountain .  it had a strange  unreal heaviness   to his hand it felt like a pound or so  but in his head it weighed thousands of very  very small tons .      uh .  thank you .  thank you very much .      nod  smile  push away politely .      it   s very   mountainous .      nod  grin .      that can   t really be snow on the top  can           brutha .      his head jerked up .  but the voice had come from inside .   oh  no  he thought wretchedly .   he pushed the little mountain back into lu tze   s hands .      but  er  you keep it for me  yes .         brutha .      all that was a dream  wasn   t it .  before i was important and talked to by deacons .      no  it wasn   t .  help me .          the petitioners scattered as the eagle made a pass over the place of lamentation .   it wheeled  only a few feet above the ground  and perched on the statue of great om trampling the infidel .   it was a magnificent bird  golden brown and yellow eyed  and it surveyed the crowds with blank disdain .      it   s a sign .     said an old man with a wooden leg .      yes .  a sign .     said a young woman next to him .      a sign .      they gathered around the statue .      it   s a bugger     said a small and totally unheard voice from somewhere around their feet .      but what   s it a sign of .     said an elderly man who had been camping out in the square for three days .      what do you mean  of .  it   s a sign .     said the wooden legged man .     it don   t have to be a sign of anything .  that   s a suspicious kind of question to ask  what   s it a sign of .         got to be a sign of something     said the elderly man .     that   s a referential wossname .  a gerund .  could be a gerund .      a skinny figure appeared at the edge of the group  moving surreptitiously yet with surprising speed .  it was wearing the djeliba of the desert tribes  but around its neck was a tray on a strap .  there was an ominous suggestion of sticky sweet things covered in dust .      it could be a messenger from the great god himself     said the woman .      it   s a bloody eagle is what it is     said a resigned voice from somewhere among the ornamental bronze homicide at the base of the statue .      dates .  figs .  sherbets .  holy relics .  nice fresh indulgences .  lizards .  onna stick .     said the man with the tray hopefully .      i thought when he appeared in the world it was as a swan or a bull     said the wooden legged man .      hah .     said the unregarded voice of the tortoise .      always wondered about that     said a young novice at the back of the crowd .     you know   well   swans .  a bit   lacking in machismo  yes .         may you be stoned to death for blasphemy .     said the woman hotly .     the great god hears every irreverent word you utter .         hah .     from under the statue .  and the man with the tray oiled forward a little further  saying     klatchian delight .  honeyed wasps .  get them while they   re cold .         it   s a point  though     said the elderly man  in a kind of boring  unstoppable voice .     i mean  there   s something very godly about an eagle .  king of birds  am i right .         it   s only a better looking turkey     said the voice from under the statue .     brain the size of a walnut .         very noble bird  the eagle .  intelligent  too     said the elderly man .     interesting fact  eagles are the only birds to work out how to eat tortoises .  you know .  they pick them up  flying up very high  and drop them on to the rocks .  smashes them right open .  amazing .         one day     said a dull voice from down below     i   m going to be back on form again and you   re going to be very sorry you said that .  for a very long time .  i might even go so far as to make even more time just for you to be sorry in .  or   no  i   ll make you a tortoise .  see how you like it  eh .  that rushing wind around y   shell  the ground getting bigger the whole time .  that   d be an interesting fact .         that sounds dreadful     said the woman  looking up at the eagle   s glare .     i wonder what passes through the poor little creature   s head when he   s dropped .         his shell  madam     said the great god om  trying to squeeze himself even further under the bronze overhang .   the man with the tray was looking dejected .     tell you what     he said .     two bags of sugared dates for the price of one  how about it .  and that   s cutting my own hand off .      the woman glanced at the tray .      ere  there   s flies all over everything .     she said .      currants  madam .         why   d they just fly away  then .     the woman demanded .   the man looked down .  then he looked back up into her face .      a miracle .     he said  waving his hands dramatically .     the time of miracles is at hand .      the eagle shifted uneasily .   it recognized humans only as pieces of mobile landscape which  in the lambing season in the high hills  might be associated with thrown stones when it stooped upon the newborn lamb  but which otherwise were as unimportant in the scheme of things as bushes and rocks .  but it had never been so close to so many of them .  its mad eyes swiveled backward and forward uncertainly .   at that moment trumpets rang out across the place .   the eagle looked around wildly  its tiny predatory mind trying to deal with this sudden overload .   it leapt into the air .  the worshipers fought to get out of its way as it dipped across the flagstones and then rose majestically toward the turrets of the great temple and the hot sky .   below it  the doors of the great temple  each one made of forty tons of gilded bronze  opened by the breath  it was said  of the great god himself  swung open ponderously and   and this was the holy part   silently .       brutha   s enormous sandals flapped and flapped on the flagstones .  brutha always put a lot of effort into running  he ran from the knees  lower legs thrashing like paddlewheels .   this was too much .  there was a tortoise who said he was the god  and this couldn   t be true except that it must be true  because of what it knew .  and he   d been tried by the quisition .  or something like that .  anyway  it hadn   t been as painful as he   d been led to expect .      brutha .      the square  normally alive with the susurration of a thousand prayers  had gone quiet .  the pilgrims had all turned to face the temple .   his mind boiling with the events of the day  brutha shouldered his way through the suddenly silent crowd    .      brutha .      people have reality dampers .   it is a popular fact that nine tenths of the brain is not used and  like most popular facts  it is wrong .  not even the most stupid creator would go to the trouble of making the human head carry around several pounds of unnecessary gray goo if its only real purpose was  for example  to serve as a delicacy for certain remote tribesmen in unexplored valleys .  it is used .  and one of its functions is to make the miraculous seem ordinary and turn the unusual into the usual .   because if this was not the case  then human beings  faced with the daily wondrousness of everything  would go around wearing big stupid grins  similar to those worn by certain remote tribesmen who occasionally get raided by the authorities and have the contents of their plastic greenhouses very seriously inspected .  they   d say    wow .     a lot .  and no one would do much work .   gods don   t like people not doing much work .  people who aren   t busy all the time might start to think .   part of the brain exists to stop this happening .  it is very efficient .  it can make people experience boredom in the middle of marvels .  and brutha   s was working feverishly .   so he didn   t immediately notice that he   d pushed through the last row of people and had trotted out into the middle of a wide pathway  until he turned and saw the procession approaching .   the cenobiarch was returning to his apartments  after conducting   or at least nodding vaguely while his chaplain conducted on his behalf   the evening service .   brutha spun around  looking for a way to escape .  then there was a cough beside him  and he stared up into the furious faces of a couple of lesser iams and  between them  the bemused and geriatrically good natured expression of the cenobiarch himself .   the old man raised his hand automatically to bless brutha with the holy horns  and then two members of the divine legion picked up the novice by the elbows  on the second attempt  and marched him swiftly out of the procession   s path and hurled him into the crowd .      brutha .      brutha bounded across the plaza to the statue and leaned against it  panting .      i   m going to go to hell .     he muttered .     for all eternity .         who cares .  now   get me away from here .      no one was paying him any attention now .  they were all watching the procession .  even watching the procession was a holy act .  brutha knelt down and peered into the scrollwork around the base of the statue .   one beady eye glared back at him .      how did you get under there .         it was touch and go     said the tortoise .     i tell you  when i   m back on form  there   s going to be a considerable redesigning of eagles .         what   s the eagle trying to do to you .     said brutha .      it wants to carry me off to its nest and give me dinner     snarled the tortoise .     what do you think it wanted to do .     there was a short pause in which it contemplated the futility of sarcasm in the presence of brutha  it was like throwing meringues at a castle .      it wants to eat me     it said patiently .      but you   re a tortoise .         i am your god .         but currently in the shape of a tortoise .  with a shell on  is what i mean .         that doesn   t worry eagles     said the tortoise darkly .     they pick you up  carry you up a few hundred feet  and then   drop you .         urrgh .         no .  more like   crack   splat .  how did you think i got in here .         you were dropped .  but           landed on a pile of dirt in your garden .  that   s eagles for you .  whole place built of rock and paved with rock on a big rock and they miss .         that was lucky .  million to one chance     said brutha .      i never had this trouble when i was a bull .  the number of eagles who can pick up a bull  you can count them on the fingers of one head .  anyway     said the tortoise     there   s worse here than eagles .  there   s a           there   s good eating on one of them  you know     said a voice behind brutha .   he stood up guiltily  the tortoise in his hand .      oh  hello  mr .  dhblah     he said .   everyone in the city knew cut me own hand off dhblah  purveyor of suspiciously new holy relics  suspiciously old rancid sweetmeats on a stick  gritty figs  and long past the sell by dates .  he was a sort of natural force  like the wind .  no one knew where he came from or where he went at night .  but he was there every dawn  selling sticky things to the pilgrims .  and in this the priests reckoned he was on to a good thing  because most of the pilgrims were coming for the first time and therefore lacked the essential thing you needed in dealing with dhblah  which was the experience of having dealt with him before .  the sight of someone in the place trying to unstick their jaws with dignity was a familiar one .  many a devout pilgrim  after a thousand miles of perilous journey  was forced to make his petition in sign language .      fancy some sherbet for afters .     said dhblah hopefully .     only one cent a glass  and that   s cutting me own hand off .         who is this fool .     said om .      i   m not going to eat it     said brutha hurriedly .      going to teach it to do tricks  then .     said dhblah cheerfully .     look through hoops  that kind of thing .         get rid of him     said om .     smite him on the head  why don   t you  and push the body behind the statue .         shut up     said brutha  beginning to experience once again the problems that occur when you   re talking to someone no one else can hear .      no need to be like that about it     said dhblah .      i wasn   t talking to you     said brutha .      talking to the tortoise  were you .     said dhblah .  brutha looked guilty .      my old mum used to talk to a gerbil     dhblah went on .     pets are always a great help in times of stress .  and in times of starvation too  o   course .         this man is not honest     said om .     i can read his mind .         can you .         can i what .     said dhblah .  he gave brutha a lopsided look .     anyway  it   ll be company on your journey .         what journey .         to ephebe .  the secret mission to talk to the infidel .      brutha knew he shouldn   t be surprised .  news went around the enclosed world of the citadel like bushfire after a drought .      oh     he said .     that journey .         they say fri   it   s going     said dhblah .     and   that other one .  the   minence grease .         deacon vorbis is a very nice person     said brutha .     he has been very kind to me .  he gave me a drink .         what of .  never mind     said dhblah .     of course  i wouldn   t say a word against him  myself     he added quickly .      why are you talking to this stupid person .     om demanded .      he   s a   friend of mine     said brutha .      i wish he was a friend of mine     said dhblah .     friends like that  you never have enemies .  can i press you to a candied sultana .  onna stick .          there were twenty three other novices in brutha   s dormitory  on the principle that sleeping alone promoted sin .  this always puzzled the novices themselves  since a moment   s reflection would suggest that there were whole ranges of sins only available in company .  but that was because a moment   s reflection was the biggest sin of all .  people allowed to be by themselves overmuch might indulge in solitary cogitation .  it was well known that this stunted your growth .  for one thing  it could lead to your feet being chopped off .   so brutha had to retire to the garden  with his god screaming at him from the pocket of his robe  where it was being jostled by a ball of garden twine  a pair of shears  and some loose seeds .   finally he was fished out .      look  i didn   t have a chance to tell you     said brutha .     i   ve been chosen to go on a very important mission .  i   m going to ephebe  on a mission to the infidels .  deacon vorbis picked me .  he   s my friend .         who   s he .         he   s the chief exquisitor .  he   makes sure you   re worshiped properly .      om picked up the hesitation in brutha   s voice  and remembered the grating .  and the sheer busyness below        he tortures people     he said coldly .      oh  no .  the inquisitors do that .  they work very long hours for not much money  too  brother nhumrod says .  no  the exquisitors just   arrange matters .  every inquisitor wants to become an exquisitor one day  brother nhumrod says .  that   s why they put up with being on duty at all hours .  they go for days without sleep  sometimes .         torturing people     mused the god .  no  a mind like that one in the garden wouldn   t pick up a knife .  other people would do that .  vorbis would enjoy other methods .      letting out the badness and the heresy in people     said brutha .      but people   perhaps   don   t survive the process .         but that doesn   t matter     said brutha earnestly .     what happens to us in this life is not really real .  there may be a little pain  but that doesn   t matter .  not if it ensures less time in the hells after death .         but what if the exquisitors are wrong .     said the tortoise .      they can   t be wrong     said brutha .     they are guided by the hand of   by your hand   your front leg   i mean  your claw     he mumbled .   the tortoise blinked its one eye .  it remembered the heat of the sun  the helplessness  and a face watching it not with any cruelty but  worse  with interest .  someone watching something die just to see how long it took .  he   d remember that face anywhere .  and the mind behind it   that steel ball of a mind .      but suppose something went wrong     it insisted .      i   m not any good at theology     said brutha .     but the testament of ossory is very clear on the matter .  they must have done something  otherwise you in your wisdom would not direct the quisition to them .         would i .     said om  still thinking of that face .     it   s their fault they get tortured .  did i really say that .            we are judged in life as we are in death      ossory iii  chapter vi  verse    .  my grandmother said that when people die they come before you  they have to cross a terrible desert and you weigh their heart in some scales     said brutha .     and if it weighs less than a feather  they are spared the hells .         goodness me     said the tortoise .  and it added     has it occurred to you  lad  that i might not be able to do that and be down here walking around with a shell on .         you could do anything you wanted to     said brutha .   om looked up at brutha .   he really believes  he thought .  he doesn   t know how to lie .   the strength of brutha   s belief burned in him like a flame .   and then the truth hit om like the ground hits tortoises after an attack of eagles .      you   ve got to take me to this ephebe place     he said urgently .      i   ll do whatever you want     said brutha .     are you going to scourge it with hoof and flame .         could be  could be     said om .     but you   ve got to take me .     he was trying to keep his innermost thoughts calm  in case brutha heard .  don   t leave me behind .      but you could get there much quicker if i left you     said brutha .     they are very wicked in ephebe .  the sooner it is cleansed  the better .  you could stop being a tortoise and fly there like a burning wind and scourge the city .      a burning wind  thought om .  and the tortoise thought of the silent wastes of the deep desert  and the chittering and sighing of the gods who had faded away to mere djinns and voices on the air .   gods with no more believers .   not even one .  one was just enough .   gods who had been left behind .   and the thing about brutha   s flame of belief was this  in all the citadel  in all the day  it was the only one the god had found .       fri   it was trying to pray .   he hadn   t done so for a long time .   oh  of course there had been the eight compulsory prayers every day  but in the pit of the wretched night he knew them for what they were .  a habit .  a time for thought  perhaps .  and method of measuring time .   he wondered if he   d ever prayed  if he   d ever opened heart and mind to something out there  or up there .  he must have done  mustn   t he .  perhaps when he was young .  he couldn   t even remember that .  blood had washed away the memories .   it was his fault .  it had to be his fault .  he   d been to ephebe before  and had rather liked the white marble city on its rock overlooking the blue circle sea .  and he   d visited djelibeybi  those madmen in their little river valley who believed in gods with funny heads and put their dead in pyramids .  he   d even been to far ankh morpork  across the water  where they   d worship any god at all so long as he or she had money .  yes  ankh morpork   where there were streets and streets of gods  squeezed together like a deck of cards .  and none of them wanted to set fire to anyone else  or at least any more than was normally the case in ankh morpork .  they just wanted to be left in peace  so that everyone went to heaven or hell in their own way .   and he   d drunk too much tonight  from a secret cache of wine whose discovery would deliver him into the machinery of the inquisitors within ten minutes .   yes  you could say this for old vorbis .  once upon a time the quisition had been bribable  but not anymore .  the chief exquisitor had gone back to fundamentals .  now there was a democracy of sharp knives .  better than that  in fact .  the search for heresy was pursued even more vigorously among the higher levels in the church .  vorbis had made it clear  the higher up the tree  the blunter the saw .   give me that old time religion     he squeezed his eyes shut again  and all he could see were the horns of the temple  or fragmented suggestions of the carnage to come  or   the face of vorbis .   he   d liked that white city .   even the slaves had been content .  there were rules about slaves .  there were things you couldn   t do to slaves .  slaves had value .   he   d learned about the turtle  there .  it had all made sense .  he   d thought  it sounds right .  it makes sense .  but sense or not  that thought was sending him to hell .   vorbis knew about him .  he must do .  there were spies everywhere .  sasho had been useful .  how much had vorbis got out of him .  had he said what he knew .   of course he   d say what he knew     something went snap inside fri   it .   he glanced at his sword  hanging on the wall .   and why not .  after all  he was going to spend all eternity in a thousand hells     the knowledge was freedom  of a sort .  when the least they could do to you was everything  then the most they could do to you suddenly held no terror .  if he was going to be boiled for a lamb  then he might as well be roasted for a sheep .   he staggered to his feet and  after a couple of tries  got the swordbelt off the wall .  vorbis   s quarters weren   t far away  if he could manage the steps .  one stroke  that   s all it would take .  he could cut vorbis in half without trying .  and maybe   maybe nothing would happen afterward .  there were others who felt like him   somewhere .  or  anyway  he could get down to the stables  be well away by dawn  get to ephebe  maybe  across the desert     he reached the door and fumbled for the handle .   it turned of its own accord .   fri   it staggered back as the door swung inward .   vorbis was standing there .  in the flickering light of the oil lamp  his face registered polite concern .      excuse the lateness of the hour  my lord     he said .     but i thought we should talk .  about tomorrow .      the sword clattered out of fri   it   s hand .   vorbis leaned forward .      is there something wrong  brother .     he said .   he smiled  and stepped into the room .  two hooded inquisitors slipped in behind him .      brother     vorbis said again .  and shut the door .          how is it in there .     said brutha .      i   m going to rattle around like a pea in a pot     grumbled the tortoise .      i could put some more straw in .  and  look  i   ve got these .      a pile of greenstuff dropped on om   s head .      from the kitchen     said brutha .     peelings and cabbage .  i stole them     he added     but then i thought it can   t be stealing if i   m doing it for you .      the fetid smell of the half rotten leaves suggested strongly that brutha had committed his crime when the greens were halfway to the midden  but om didn   t say so .  not now .      right     he mumbled .   there must be others  he told himself .  sure .  out in the country .  this place is too sophisticated .  but   there had been all those pilgrims in front of the temple .  they weren   t just country people  they were the devoutest ones .  whole villages clubbed together to send one person carrying the petitions of many .  but there hadn   t been the flame .  there had been fear  and dread  and yearning  and hope .  all those emotions had their flavor .  but there hadn   t been the flame .   the eagle had dropped him near brutha .  he   d   woken up .  he could dimly remember all that time as a tortoise .  and now he remembered being a god .  how far away from brutha would he still remember .  a mile .  ten miles .  how would it be   feeling the knowledge drain away  dwindling back to nothing but a lowly reptile .  maybe there would be a part of him that would always remember  helplessly     he shuddered .   currently om was in a wickerwork box slung from brutha   s shoulder .  it wouldn   t have been comfortable at the best of times  but now it shook occasionally as brutha stamped his feet in the pre dawn chill .   after a while some of the citadel grooms arrived  with horses .  brutha was the subject of a few odd looks .  he smiled at everyone .  it seemed the best way .   he began to feel hungry  but didn   t dare leave his post .  he   d been told to be here .  but after a while sounds from around the corner made him sidle a few yards to see what was going on .   the courtyard here was u shaped  around a wing of the citadel buildings  and around the corner it looked as though another party was preparing to set out .   brutha knew about camels .  there had been a couple in his grandmother   s village .  there seemed to be hundreds of them here  though  complaining like badly oiled pumps and smelling like a thousand damp carpets .  men in djeliba moved among them and occasionally hit them with sticks  which is the approved method of dealing with camels .   brutha wandered over to the nearest creature .  a man was strapping water bottles around its hump .      good morning  brother     said brutha .      bugger off     said the man without looking around .      the prophet abbys tells us  chap .  xxv  verse        woe unto he who defiles his mouth with curses for his words will be as dust        said brutha .      does he .  well  he can bugger off too     said the man  conversationally .   brutha hesitated .  technically  of course  the man had bought himself vacant possession of a thousand hells and a month or two of the attentions of the quisition  but now brutha could see that he was a member of the divine legion  a sword was half hidden under the desert robes .   and you had to make special allowances for legionaries  just as you did for inquisitors .  their often intimate contact with the ungodly affected their minds and put their souls in mortal peril .  he decided to be magnanimous .      and where are you going to with all these camels on this fine morning  brother .      the soldier tightened a strap .      probably to hell     he said  grinning nastily .     just behind you .         really .  according to the word of the prophet ishkible  a man needs no camel to ride to hell  yea  nor horse  nor mule  a man may ride into hell on his tongue     said brutha  letting just a tremor of disapproval enter his voice .      does some old prophet say anything about nosy bastards being given a thump alongside the ear .     said the soldier .         woe unto him who raises his hand unto his brother  dealing with him as unto an infidel        said brutha .     that   s ossory  precepts xi  verse    .            sod off and forget you ever saw us otherwise you   re going to be in real trouble  my friend .     sergeant aktar  chapter i  verse       said the soldier .   brutha   s brow wrinkled .  he couldn   t remember that one .      walk away     said the voice of the god in his head .     you don   t need trouble .         i hope your journey is a pleasant one     said brutha politely .     whatever the destination .      he backed away and headed toward the gate .      a man who will have to spend some time in the hells of correction  if i am any judge     he said .  the god said nothing .   the ephebian traveling group was beginning to assemble now .  brutha stood to attention and tried to keep out of everyone   s way .  he saw a dozen mounted soldiers  but unlike the camel riders they were in the brightly polished fishmail and black and yellow cloaks that the legionaries usually only wore on special occasions .  brutha thought they looked very impressive .   eventually one of the stable servants came up to him .      what are you doing here  novice .     he demanded .      i am going to ephebe     said brutha .   the man glared at him and then grinned .      you .  you   re not even ordained .  you   re going to ephebe .         yes .         what makes you think that .         because i told him so     said the voice of vorbis  behind the man .     and here he is  most obedient to my wishes .      brutha had a good view of the man   s face .  the change in his expression was like watching a grease slick cross a pond .  then the stableman turned as though his feet were nailed to a turntable .      my lord vorbis     he oiled .      and now he will require a steed     said vorbis .   the stableman   s face was yellow with dread .      my pleasure .  the very best the sta           my friend brutha is a humble man before om     said vorbis .     he will ask for no more than a mule  i have no doubt .  brutha .         i   i do not know how to ride  my lord     said brutha .      any man can get on a mule     said vorbis .     often many times in a short distance .  and now  it would appear  we are all here .      he raised an eyebrow at the sergeant of the guard  who saluted .      we are awaiting general fri   it  lord     he said .      ah .  sergeant simony  isn   t it .      vorbis had a terrible memory for names .  he knew every one .  the sergeant paled a little  and then saluted crisply .      yes .  sir .         we will proceed without general fri   it     said vorbis .   the b of the word    but    framed itself on the sergeant   s lips  and faded there .      general fri   it has other business     said vorbis .     most pressing and urgent business .  which only he can attend to .          fri   it opened his eyes in grayness .   he could see the room around him  but only faintly  as a series of edges in the air .   the sword     he   d dropped the sword  but maybe he could find it again .  he stepped forward  feeling a tenuous resistance around his ankles  and looked down .   there was the sword .  but his fingers passed through it .  it was like being drunk  but he knew he wasn   t drunk .  he wasn   t even sober .  he was   suddenly clear in his mind .   he turned and looked at the thing that had briefly impeded his progress .      oh     he said .   good morning .      oh .      there is a little confusion at first .  it is only to be expected .   to his horror  fri   it saw the tall black figure stride away through the gray wall .      wait .      a skull draped in a black hood poked out of the wall .   yes .      you   re death  aren   t you .      indeed .   fri   it gathered what remained of his dignity .      i know you     he said .     i have faced you many times .      death gave him a long stare .   no you haven   t .      i assure you        you have faced men .  if you had faced me  i assure you   you would have known .      but what happens to me now .      death shrugged .   don   t you know .  he said  and disappeared .      wait .      fri   it ran at the wall and found to his surprise that it offered no barrier .  now he was out in the empty corridor .  death had vanished .   and then he realized that it wasn   t the corridor he remembered  with its shadows and the grittiness of sand underfoot .   that corridor didn   t have a glow at the end  that pulled at him like a magnet pulls at an iron filing .   you couldn   t put off the inevitable .  because sooner or later  you reached the place when the inevitable just went and waited .   and this was it .   fri   it stepped through the glow into a desert .  the sky was dark and pocked with large stars  but the black sand that stretched away to the distance was nevertheless brightly lit .   a desert .  after death  a desert .  the desert .  no hells  yet .  perhaps there was hope .   he remembered a story from his childhood .  unusually  it wasn   t about smiting .  no one was trampled underfoot .  it wasn   t about om  dreadful in his rage .  it was worse .  it was about what happened when you died   the journey of your soul .   they said  you must walk a desert        where is this place .     he said hoarsely .   this is no place  said death    .  all alone        what is at the end of the desert .      judgment .      with your beliefs     fri   it stared at the endless  featureless expanse .      i have to walk it alone .     he whispered .     but   now  i   m not sure what i believe        yes .   and now  if you will excuse me     fri   it took a deep breath  purely out of habit .  perhaps he could find a couple of rocks out there .  a small rock to hold and a big rock to hide behind  while he waited for vorbis     and that thought was habit  too .  revenge .  here .   he smiled .   be sensible  man .  you were a soldier .  this is a desert .  you crossed a few in your time .   and you survive by learning about them .  there   s whole tribes that know how to live in the worst kinds of desert .  licking water off the shady sides of dunes  that sort of thing   they think it   s home .  put    em in a vegetable garden and they   d think you were mad .   the memory stole over him  a desert is what you think it is .  and now  you can think clearly     there were no lies here .  all fancies fled away .  that   s what happened in all deserts .  it was just you  and what you believed .   what have i always believed .   that on the whole  and by and large  if a man lived properly  not according to what any priests said  but according to what seemed decent and honest inside  then it would  at the end  more or less  turn out all right .   you couldn   t get that on a banner .  but the desert looked better already .   fri   it set out .       it was a small mule and brutha had long legs  if he   d made the effort he could have remained standing and let the mule trot out from underneath .   the order of progression was not as some may have expected .  sergeant simony and his soldiers rode ahead  on either side of the track .   they were trailed by the servants and clerks and lesser priests .  vorbis rode in the rear  where an exquisitor rode by right  like a shepherd watching over his flock .   brutha rode with him .  it was an honor he would have preferred to avoid .  brutha was one of those people who could raise a sweat on a frosty day  and the dust was settling on him like a gritty skin .  but vorbis seemed to derive some amusement from his company .  occasionally he would ask him questions      how many miles have we traveled  brutha .         four miles and seven estado  lord .         but how do you know .      that was a question he couldn   t answer .  how did he know the sky was blue .  it was just something in his head .  you couldn   t think about how you thought .  it was like opening a box with the crowbar that was inside .      and how long has our journey taken .         a little over seventy nine minutes .      vorbis laughed .  brutha wondered why .  the puzzle wasn   t why he remembered  it was why everyone else seemed to forget .      did your fathers have this remarkable faculty .      there was a pause .      could they do it as well .     said vorbis patiently .      i don   t know .  there was only my grandmother .  she had   a good memory .  for some things .     transgressions  certainly .     and very good eyesight and hearing .     what she could apparently see or hear through two walls had  he remembered  seemed phenomenal .   brutha turned gingerly in the saddle .  there was a cloud of dust about a mile behind them on the road .      here come the rest of the soldiers     he said conversationally .   this seemed to shock vorbis .  perhaps it was the first time in years that anyone had innocently addressed a remark to him .      the rest of the soldiers .     he said .      sergeant aktar and his men  on ninety eight camels with many water bottles     said brutha .     i saw them before we left .         you did not see them     said vorbis .     they are not coming with us .  you will forget about them .         yes  lord .     the request to do magic again .   after a few minutes the distant cloud turned off the road and started up the long slope that led to the high desert .  brutha watched them surreptitiously  and raised his eyes to the dune mountains .   there was a speck circling up there .   he put his hand to his mouth .   vorbis heard the gasp .      what ails you  brutha .     he said .      i remembered about the god     said brutha  without thinking .      we should always remember the god     said vorbis     and trust that he is with us on this journey .         he is     said brutha  and the absolute conviction in his voice made vorbis smile .   he strained to hear the nagging internal voice  but there was nothing .  for one horrible moment brutha wondered if the tortoise had fallen out of the box  but there was a reassuring weight on the strap .      and we must bear with us the certainty that he will be with us in ephebe  among the infidel     said vorbis .      i am sure he will     said brutha .      and prepare ourselves for the coming of the prophet     said vorbis .   the cloud had reached the top of the dunes now  and vanished in the silent wastes of the desert .   brutha tried to put it out of his mind  which was like trying to empty a bucket underwater .  no one survived in the high desert .  it wasn   t just the dunes and the heat .  there were terrors in the burning heart  where even the mad tribes never went .  an ocean without water  voices without mouths     which wasn   t to say that the immediate future didn   t hold terrors enough     he   d seen the sea before  but the omnians didn   t encourage it .  this may have been because deserts were so much harder to cross .  they kept people in  though .  but sometimes the desert barriers were a problem  and then you had to put up with the sea .   il drim was nothing more than a few shacks around a stone jetty  at one of which was a trireme flying the holy oriflamme .  when the church traveled  the travelers were very senior people indeed  so when the church traveled it generally traveled in style .   the party paused on a hill and looked at it .      soft and corrupt     said vorbis .     that   s what we   ve become  brutha .         yes  lord vorbis .         and open to pernicious influence .  the sea  brutha .  it washes unholy shores  and gives rise to dangerous ideas .  men should not travel  brutha .  at the center there is truth .  as you travel  so error creeps in .         yes  lord vorbis .      vorbis sighed .      in ossory   s day we sailed alone in boats made of hides  and went where the winds of the god took us .  that   s how a holy man should travel .      a tiny spark of defiance in brutha declared that it  personally  would risk a little corruption for the sake of traveling with two decks between its feet and the waves .      i heard that ossory once sailed to the island of erebos on a millstone     he ventured by way of conversation .      nothing is impossible for the strong in faith     said vorbis .      try striking a match on jelly  mister .      brutha stiffened .  it was impossible that vorbis could have failed to hear the voice .   the voice of the turtle was heard in the land .      who   s this bugger .         forward     said vorbis .     i can see that our friend brutha is agog to get on board .      the horse trotted on .      where are we .  who   s that .  it   s as hot as hell in here and  believe me  i know what i   m talking about .         i can   t talk now .     hissed brutha .      this cabbage stinks like a swamp .  let there be lettuce .  let there be slices of melon .      the horses edged along the jetty and were led one at a time up the gangplank .  by this time the box was vibrating .  brutha kept looking around guiltily  but no one else was taking any notice .  despite his size  brutha was easy not to notice .  practically everyone had better things to do with their time than notice someone like brutha .  even vorbis had switched him off  and was talking to the captain .   he found a place up near the pointed end  where one of the sticking up bits with the sails on gave him a bit of privacy .  then  with some dread  he opened the box .   the tortoise spoke from deep within its shell .      any eagles about .      brutha scanned the sky .      no .      the head shot out .      you       it began .      i couldn   t talk .     said brutha .     people were with me all the time .  can   t you   read the words in my mind .  can   t you read my thoughts .         mortal thoughts aren   t like that     snapped om .     you think it   s like watching words paint themselves across the sky .  hah .  it   s like trying to make sense of a bundle of weeds .  intentions  yes .  emotions  yes .  but not thoughts .  half the time you don   t know what you   re thinking  so why should i .         because you   re the god     said brutha .     abbys  chapter lvi  verse        all of mortal mind he knows  and there are no secrets .            was he the one with the bad teeth .      brutha hung his head .      listen     said the tortoise     i am what i am .  i can   t help it if people think something else .         but you knew about my thoughts   in the garden       muttered brutha .   the tortoise hesitated .     that was different     it said .     they weren   t   thoughts .  that was guilt .         i believe that the great god is om  and in his justice     said brutha .     and i shall go on believing  whatever you say  and whatever you are .         good to hear it     said the tortoise fervently .     hold that thought .  where are we .         on a boat     said brutha .     on the sea .  wobbling .         going to ephebe on a boat .  what   s wrong with the desert .         no one can cross the desert .  no one can live in the heart of the desert .         i did .         it   s only a couple of days    sailing .     brutha   s stomach lurched  even though the boat had hardly cleared the jetty .     and they say that the god              me              is sending us a fair wind .         i am .  oh .  yes .  trust me for a fair wind .  flat as a mill race the whole way  don   t you worry .             i meant mill pond .  i meant mill pond .          brutha clung to the mast .   after a while a sailor came and sat down on a coil of rope and looked at him interestedly .      you can let go  father     he said .     it stands up all by itself .         the sea   the waves       murmured brutha carefully  although there was nothing left to throw up .   the sailor spat thoughtfully .      aye     he said .     they got to be that shape  see  so   s to fit into the sky .         but the boat   s creaking .         aye .  it does that .         you mean this isn   t a storm .      the sailor sighed  and walked away .   after a while  brutha risked letting go .  he had never felt so ill in his life .   it wasn   t just the seasickness .  he didn   t know where he was .  and brutha had always known where he was .  where he was  and the existence of om  had been the only two certainties in his life .   it was something he shared with tortoises .  watch any tortoise walking  and periodically it will stop while it files away the memories of the journey so far .  not for nothing  elsewhere in the multiverse  are the little traveling devices controlled by electric thinking engines called    turtles .      brutha knew where he was by remembering where he had been   by the unconscious counting of footsteps and the noting of landmarks .  somewhere inside his head was a thread of memory which  if you had wired it directly to whatever controlled his feet  would cause brutha to amble back through the little pathways of his life all the way to the place he was born .       out of contact with the ground  on the mutable surface of the sea  the thread flapped loose .   in his box  om tossed and shook to brutha   s motion as brutha staggered across the moving deck and reached the rail .   to anyone except the novice  the boat was clipping through the waves on a good sailing day .  seabirds wheeled in its wake .  away to one side   port or starboard or one of those directions   a school of flying fish broke the surface in an attempt to escape the attentions of some dolphins .  brutha stared at the gray shapes as they zigzagged under the keel in a world where they never had to count at all        ah  brutha     said vorbis .     feeding the fishes  i see .         no  lord     said brutha .     i   m being sick  lord .      he turned .   there was sergeant simony  a muscular young man with the deadpan expression of the truly professional soldier .  he was standing next to someone brutha vaguely recognized as the number one salt or whatever his title was .  and there was the exquisitor  smiling .      him .  him .     screamed the voice of the tortoise .      our young friend is not a good sailor     said vorbis .      him .  him .  i   d know him anywhere .         lord  i wish i wasn   t a sailor at all     said brutha .  he felt the box trembling as om bounced around inside .      kill him .  find something sharp .  push him overboard .         come with us to the prow  brutha     said vorbis .     there are many interesting things to be seen  according to the captain .      the captain gave the frozen smirk of those caught between a rock and a hard place .  vorbis could always supply both .   brutha trailed behind the other three  and risked a whisper .      what   s the matter .         him .  the bald one .  push him over the side .      vorbis half turned  caught brutha   s embarrassed attention  and smiled .      we will have our minds broadened  i am sure     he said .  he turned back to the captain  and pointed to a large bird gliding down the face of the waves .      the pointless albatross     said the captain promptly .     flies from the hub to the ri       he faltered .  but vorbis was gazing with apparent affability at the view .      he turned me over in the sun .  look at his mind .         from one pole of the world to the other  every year     said the captain .  he was sweating slightly .      really .     said vorbis .     why .           no one knows .         excepting the god  of course     said vorbis .   the captain   s face was a sickly yellow .      of course .  certainly     he said .      brutha .     shouted the tortoise .     are you listening to me .         and over there .     said vorbis .   the sailor followed his extended arm .      oh .  flying fish     he said .     but they don   t really fly     he added quickly .     they just build up speed in the water and glide a little way .         one of the god   s marvels     said vorbis .     infinite variety  eh .         yes  indeed     said the captain .  relief was crossing his face now  like a friendly army .      and the things down there .     said the exquisitor .      them .  porpoises     said the captain .     sort of a fish .         do they always swim around ships like this .         often .  certainly .  especially in the waters off ephebe .      vorbis leaned over the rail  and said nothing .  simony was staring at the horizon  his face absolutely immobile .  this left a gap in the conversation which the captain  very stupidly  sought to fill .      they   ll follow a ship for days     he said .      remarkable .     another pause  a tar pit of silence ready to snare the mastodons of unthinking comment .  earlier exquisitors had shouted and ranted confessions out of people .  vorbis never did that .  he just dug deep silences in front of them .      they seem to like them     said the captain .  he glanced nervously at brutha  who was trying to shut the tortoise   s voice out of his head .  there was no help there .     vorbis came to his aid instead .      this must be very convenient on long voyages     he said .      uh .  yes .     said the captain .      from the provisions point of view     said vorbis .      my lord  i don   t quite           it must be like having a traveling larder     said vorbis .   the captain smiled .     oh no  lord .  we don   t eat them .         surely not .  they look quite wholesome to me .         oh  but you know the old saying  lord           saying .         oh  they say that after they die  the souls of dead sailors become        the captain saw the abyss ahead  but the sentence had plunged on with a horrible momentum of its own .   for a while there was no sound but the zip of the waves  the distant splash of the porpoises  and the heaven shaking thundering of the captain   s heart .   vorbis leaned back on the rail .      but of course we are not prey to such superstitions     he said lazily .      well  of course     said the captain  clutching at this straw .     idle sailor talk .  if ever i hear it again i shall have the man flog        vorbis was looking past his ear .      i say .  yes  you there .     he said .   one of the sailors nodded .      fetch me a harpoon     said vorbis .   the man looked from him to the captain and then scuttled off obediently .      but  ah  uh  but your lordship should not  uh  ha  attempt such sport     said the captain .     ah .  uh .  a harpoon is a dangerous weapon in untrained hands  i am afraid you might do yourself an injury             but i will not be using it     said vorbis .   the captain hung his head and held out his hand for the harpoon .   vorbis patted him on the shoulder .      and then     he said     you shall entertain us to lunch .  won   t he  sergeant .      simony saluted .     just as you say  sir .         yes .          brutha lay on his back among sails and ropes somewhere under the decking .  it was hot  and the air smelled of all air anywhere that has ever come into contact with bilges .   brutha hadn   t eaten all day .  initially he   d been too ill to .  then he just hadn   t .      but being cruel to animals doesn   t mean he   s a   bad person     he ventured  the harmonics of his tone suggesting that even he didn   t believe this .  it had been quite a small porpoise .      he turned me on to my back     said om .      yes  but humans are more important than animals     said brutha .      this is a point of view often expressed by humans     said om .      chapter ix  verse    of the book of       brutha began .      who cares what any book says .     screamed the tortoise .   brutha was shaken .      but you never told any of the prophets that people should be kind to animals     he said .     i don   t remember anything about that .  not when you were   bigger .  you don   t want people to be kind to animals because they   re animals  you just want people to be kind to animals because one of them might be you .           that   s not a bad idea .         besides  he   s been kind to me .  he didn   t have to be .         you think that .  is that what you think .  have you looked at the man   s mind .         of course i haven   t .  i don   t know how to .         you don   t .         no .  humans can   t do        brutha paused .  vorbis seemed to do it .  he only had to look at someone to know what wicked thoughts they harbored .  and grandmother had been the same .      humans can   t do it  i   m sure     he said .     we can   t read minds .         i don   t mean reading them  i mean looking at them     said om .     just seeing the shape of them .  you can   t read a mind .  you might as well try and read a river .  but seeing the shape   s easy .  witches can do it  no trouble .            the way of the witch shall be as a path strewn with thorns        said brutha .      ossory .     said om .      yes .  but of course you   d know     said brutha .      never heard it before in my life     said the tortoise bitterly .     it was what you might call an educated guess .         whatever you say     said brutha     i still know that you can   t truly be om .  the god would not talk like that about his chosen ones .         i never chose anyone     said om .     they chose themselves .         if you   re really om  stop being a tortoise .         i told you  i can   t .  you think i haven   t tried .  three years .  most of that time i thought i was a tortoise .         then perhaps you were .  maybe you   re just a tortoise who thinks he   s a god .         nah .  don   t try philosophy again .  start thinking like that and you end up thinking maybe you   re just a butterfly dreaming it   s a whelk or something .  no .  one day all i had on my mind was the amount of walking necessary to get to the nearest plant with decent low growing leaves  the next   i had all this memory filling up my head .  three years before the shell .  no  don   t you tell me i   m a tortoise with big ideas .      brutha hesitated .  he knew it was wicked to ask  but he wanted to know what the memory was .  anyway  could it be wicked .  if the god was sitting there talking to you  could you say anything truly wicked .  face to face .  somehow  that didn   t seem so bad as saying something wicked when he was up on a cloud or something .      as far as i can recall     said om     i   d intended to be a big white bull .         trampling the infidel     said brutha .      not my basic intention  but no doubt some trampling could have been arranged .  or a swan  i thought .  something impressive .  three years later  i wake up and it turns out i   ve been a tortoise .  i mean  you don   t get much lower .     careful  careful   you need his help  but don   t tell him everything .  don   t tell him what you suspect .      when did you start think   when did you remember all this .     said brutha  who found the phenomenon of forgetting a strange and fascinating one  as other men might find the idea of flying by flapping your arms .      about two hundred feet above your vegetable garden     said om     which is not a point where it   s fun to become sapient  i   m here to tell you .         but why .     said brutha .     gods don   t have to stay tortoises unless they want to .         i don   t know     lied om .   if he works it out himself i   m done for  he thought .  this is a chance in a million .  if i get it wrong  it   s back to a life where happiness is a leaf you can reach .   part of him screamed  i   m a god .  i don   t have to think like this .  i don   t have to put myself in the power of a human .   but another part  the part that could remember exactly what being a tortoise for three years had been like  whispered  no .  you have to .  if you want to be up there again .  he   s stupid and gormless and he   s not got a drop of ambition in his big flabby body .  and this is what you   ve got to work with     the god part said  vorbis would have been better .  be rational .  a mind like that could do anything .   he turned me on my back .   no  he turned a tortoise on its back .   yes .  me .   no .  you   re a god .   yes  but a persistently tortoise shaped one .   if he had known you were a god     but om remembered vorbis   s absorbed expression  in a pair of gray eyes in front of a mind as impenetrable as a steel ball .  he   d never seen a mind shaped like that on anything walking upright .  there was someone who probably would turn a god on his back  just to see what would happen .  someone who   d overturn the universe  without thought of consequence  for the sake of the knowledge of what happened when the universe was flat on its back     but what he had to work with was brutha  with a mind as incisive as a meringue .  and if brutha found out that     or if brutha died        how are you feeling .     said om .      ill .           snuggle down under the sails a bit more     said om .     you don   t want to catch a chill .      there   s got to be someone else  he thought .  it can   t be just him who   the rest of the thought was so terrible he tried to block it from his mind  but he couldn   t .      it can   t be just him who believes in me .   really in me .  not in a pair of golden horns .  not in a great big building .  not in the dread of hot iron and knives .  not in paying your temple dues because everyone else does .  just in the fact that the great god om really exists .   and now he   s got himself involved with the most unpleasant mind i   ve ever seen  someone who kills people to see if they die .  an eagle kind of person if ever there was one     om was aware of a mumbling .   brutha was lying facedown on the deck .      what are you doing .     said om .   brutha turned his head .      praying .         that   s good .  what for .         you don   t know .         oh .      if brutha dies     the tortoise shuddered in its shell .  if brutha died  then it could already hear in its mind   s ear the soughing of the wind in the deep  hot places of the desert .   where the small gods went .       where do gods come from .  where do they go .   some attempt to answer this was made by the religious philosopher koomi of smale in his book ego video liber deorum  which translates into the vernacular roughly as gods  a spotter   s guide .     people said there had to be a supreme being because otherwise how could the universe exist  eh .   and of course there clearly had to be  said koomi  a supreme being .  but since the universe was a bit of a mess  it was obvious that the supreme being hadn   t in fact made it .  if he had made it he would  being supreme  have made a much better job of it  with far better thought given  taking an example at random  to thinks like the design of the common nostril .  or  to put it another way  the existence of a badly put together watch proved the existence of a blind watchmaker .  you only had to look around to see that there was room for improvement practically everywhere .   this suggested that the universe had probably been put together in a bit of a rush by an underling while the supreme being wasn   t looking  in the same way that boy scouts    association minutes are done on office photocopiers all over the country .   so  reasoned koomi  it was not a good idea to address any prayers to a supreme being .  it would only attract his attention and might cause trouble .   and yet there seemed to be a lot of lesser gods around the place .  koomi   s theory was that gods come into being and grow and flourish because they are believed in .  belief itself is the food of the gods .  initially  when mankind lived in small primitive tribes  there were probably millions of gods .  now there tended to be only a few very important ones   local gods of thunder and love  for example  tended to run together like pools of mercury as the small primitive tribes joined up and became huge  powerful primitive tribes with more sophisticated weapons .  but any god could join .  any god could start small .  any god could grow in stature as its believers increased .  and dwindle as they decreased .  it was like a great big game of ladders and snakes .   gods liked games  provided they were winning .   koomi   s theory was largely based on the good old gnostic heresy  which tends to turn up all over the multiverse whenever men get up off their knees and start thinking for two minutes together  although the shock of the sudden altitude tends to mean the thinking is a little whacked .  but it upsets priests  who tend to vent their displeasure in traditional ways .   when the omnian church found out about koomi  they displayed him in every town within the church   s empire to demonstrate the essential flaws in his argument .   there were a lot of towns  so they had to cut him up quite small .       ragged clouds ripped across the skies .  the sails creaked in the rising wind  and om could hear the shouts of the sailors as they tried to outrun the storm .   it was going to be a big storm  even by the mariners    standards .  white water crowned the waves .   brutha snored in his nest .   om listened to the sailors .  they were not men who dealt in sophistries .  someone had killed a porpoise  and everyone knew what that meant .  it meant that there was going to be a storm .  it meant that the ship was going to be sunk .  it was simple cause and effect .  it was worse than women aboard .  it was worse than albatrosses .   om wondered if tortoises could swim .  turtles could  he was pretty sure .  but those buggers had the shell for it .   it would be too much to ask  even if a god had anyone to ask  that a body designed for trundling around a dry wilderness had any hydrodynamic properties other than those necessary to sink to the bottom .   oh  well .  nothing else for it .  he was still a god .  he had rights .   he slid down a coil of rope and crawled carefully to the edge of the swaying deck  wedging his shell against a stanchion so that he could see down into the roiling water .   then he spoke in a voice audible to nothing that was mortal .   nothing happened for a while .  then one wave rose higher than the rest  and changed shape as it rose .  water poured upward  filling an invisible mold  it was humanoid  but obviously only because it wanted to be .  it could as easily have been a waterspout  or an undertow .  the sea is always powerful .  so many people believe in it .  but it seldom answers prayers .   the water shape rose level with the deck and kept pace with om .   it developed a face  and opened a mouth .      well .     it said .      greetings  oh queen of       om began .   the watery eyes focused .      but you are just a small god .  and you dare to summon me .      the wind howled in the rigging .      i have believers     said om .     so i have the right .      there was the briefest of pauses .  then the sea queen said     one believer .         one or many does not matter here     said om .     i have rights .         and what rights do you demand  little tortoise .     said the queen of the sea .      save the ship     said om .     the queen was silent .      you have to grant the request     said om .     it   s the rules .         but i can name my price     said the sea queen .      that   s the rules  too .         and it will be high .         it will be paid .      the column of water began to collapse back into the waves .      i will consider this .      om stared down into the white sea .  the ship rolled  sliding him back down the deck  and then rolled back .  a flailing foreclaw hooked itself around the stanchion as om   s shell spun around  and for a moment both hind legs paddled helplessly over the waters .   and then om was shaken free .   something white swept down toward him as he see sawed over the edge  and he bit it .   brutha yelled and pulled his hand up  with om trailing on the end of it .      you didn   t have to bite .      the ship pitched into a wave and flung him to the deck .  om let go and rolled away .   when brutha got to his feet  or at least to his hands and knees  he saw the crewmen standing around him .  two of them grabbed him by the elbows as a wave crashed over the ship .      what are you doing .      they were trying to avoid looking at his face .  they dragged him toward the rail .   somewhere in the scuppers om screamed at the sea queen .      it   s the rules .  the rules .      four sailors had got hold of brutha now .  om could hear  above the roaring of the storm  the silence of the desert .      wait     said brutha .      it   s nothing personal     said one of the sailors .     we don   t want to do this .         i don   t want you to do it either     said brutha .     is that any help .         the sea wants a life     said the oldest sailor .     yours is nearest .  okay  get his           can i make my peace with my god .         what .         if you   re going to kill me  can i pray to my god first .         it   s not us that   s killing you     said the sailor .     it   s the sea .            the hand that does the deed is guilty of the crime        said brutha .     ossory  chapter lvi  verse    .      the sailors looked at one another .  at a time like this  it was probably not wise to antagonize any god .  the ship skidded down the side of a wave .      you   ve got ten seconds     said the oldest sailor .     that   s ten seconds more than many men get .      brutha lay down on the deck  helped considerably by another wave that slammed into the timbers .   om was dimly aware of the prayer  to his surprise .  he couldn   t make out the words  but the prayer itself was an itch at the back of his mind .      don   t ask me     he said  trying to get upright     i   m out of options        the ship smacked down        on to a calm sea .   the storm still raged  but only around a widening circle with the ship in the middle .  the lightning  stabbing at the sea  surrounded them like the bars of a cage .     the circle lengthened ahead of them .  now the ship sped down a narrow channel of calm between gray walls of storm a mile high .  electric fire raged overhead .   and then was gone .   behind them  a mountain of grayness squatted on the sea .  they could hear the thunder dying away .   brutha got uncertainly to his feet  swaying wildly to compensate for a motion that was no longer there .      now i       he began .   he was alone .  the sailors had fled .      om .     said brutha .      over here .      brutha fished his god out of the seaweed .      you said you couldn   t do anything .     he said accusingly .      that wasn   t m       om paused .  there will be a price  he thought .  it won   t be cheap .  it can   t be cheap .  the sea queen is a god .  i   ve crushed a few towns in my time .  holy fire  that kind of thing .  if the price isn   t high  how can people respect you .      i made arrangements     he said .   tidal waves .  a ship sunk .  a couple of towns disappearing under the sea .  it   ll be something like that .  if people don   t respect then they won   t fear  and if they don   t fear  how can you get them to believe .   seems unfair  really .  one man killed a porpoise .  of course  it doesn   t matter to the queen who gets thrown overboard  just as it didn   t matter to him which porpoise he killed .  and that   s unfair  because it was vorbis who did it .  he makes people do things they shouldn   t do     what am i thinking about .  before i was a tortoise  i didn   t even know what unfair meant         the hatches opened .  people came on deck and hung on the rail .  being on deck in stormy weather always has the possibility of being washed overboard  but that takes on a rosy glow after hours below decks with frightened horses and seasick passengers .   there were no more storms .  the ship plowed on in favorable winds  under a clear sky  in a sea as empty of life as the hot desert .   the days passed uneventfully .  vorbis stayed below decks for most of the time .   the crew treated brutha with cautious respect .  news like brutha spreads quickly .   the coast here was dunes  with the occasional barren salt marsh .  a heat haze hung over the land .  it was the kind of coast where shipwrecked landfall is more to be dreaded than drowning .  there were no seabirds .  even the birds that had been trailing the ship for scraps had vanished .      no eagles     said om .  there was that to be said about it .   toward the evening of the fourth day the unedifying panorama was punctuated by a glitter of light  high on the dune sea .  it flashed with a sort of rhythm .  the captain  whose face now looked as if sleep had not been a regular nighttime companion  called brutha over .      his   your   the deacon told me to watch out for this     he said .     you go and fetch him now .      vorbis had a cabin somewhere near the bilges  where the air was as thick as thin soup .  brutha knocked .      enter .         there were no portholes down here .  vorbis was sitting in the dark .      yes  brutha .         the captain sent me to fetch you  lord .  something   s shining in the desert .         good .  now  brutha .  attend .  the captain has a mirror .  you will ask to borrow it .         er   what is a mirror  lord .         an unholy and forbidden device     said vorbis .     which regretfully can be pressed into godly service .  he will deny it  of course .  but a man with such a neat beard and tiny mustache is vain  and a vain man must have his mirror .  so take it .  and stand in the sun and move the mirror so that it shines the sun towards the desert .  do you understand .         no  lord     said brutha .      your ignorance is your protection  my son .  and then come back and tell me what you see .          om dozed in the sun .  brutha had found him a little space near the pointy end where he could get sun with little danger of being seen by the crew   and the crew were jittery enough at the moment not to go looking for trouble in any case .   a tortoise dreams        for millions of years .   it was the dreamtime .  the unformed time .   the small gods chittered and whirred in the wilderness places  and the cold places  and the deep places .  they swarmed in the darkness  without memory but driven by hope and lust for the one thing  the one thing a god craves   belief .   there are no medium sized trees in the deep forest .  there are only the towering ones  whose canopy spreads across the sky .  below  in the gloom  there   s light for nothing but mosses and ferns .  but when a giant falls  leaving a little space   then there   s a race   between the trees on either side  who want to spread out  and the seedlings below  who race to grow up .   sometimes  you can make your own space .   forests were a long way from the wilderness .  the nameless voice that was going to be om drifted on the wind on the edge of the desert  trying to be heard among countless others  trying to avoid being pushed into the center .  it may have whirled for millions of years   it had nothing with which to measure time .  all it had was hope  and a certain sense of the presence of things .  and a voice .   then there was a day .  in a sense  it was the first day .   om had been aware of the shepherd for some ti   for a while .  the flock had been wandering closer and closer .  the rains had been sparse .  forage was scarce .  hungry mouths propelled hungry legs further into the rocks  searching out the hitherto scorned clumps of sun seared grass .   they were sheep  possibly the most stupid animal in the universe with the possible exception of the duck .  but even their uncomplicated minds couldn   t hear the voice  because sheep don   t listen .   there was a lamb  though .  it had strayed a little way .  om saw to it that it strayed a little further .  around a rock .  down the slope .  into the crevice .   its bleating drew the mother .   the crevice was well hidden and the ewe was  after all  content now that she had her lamb .  she saw no reason to bleat  even when the shepherd wandered about the rocks calling  cursing  and  eventually  pleading .  the shepherd had a hundred sheep  and it might have been surprising that he was prepared to spend days searching for one sheep  in fact  it was because he was the kind of man prepared to spend days looking for a lost sheep that he had a hundred sheep .   the voice that was going to be om waited .   it was on the evening of the second day that he scared up a partridge that had been nesting near the crevice  just as the shepherd was wandering by .   it wasn   t much of a miracle  but it was good enough for the shepherd .  he made a cairn of stones at the spot and  next day  brought his whole flock into the area .  and in the heat of the afternoon he lay down to sleep   and om spoke to him  inside his head .   three weeks later the shepherd was stoned to death by the priests of ur gilash  who was at that time the chief god in the area .  but they were too late .  om already had a hundred believers  and the number was growing     only a mile away from the shepherd and his flock was a goatherd and his herd .  the merest accident of micro geography had meant that the first man to hear the voice of om  and who gave om his view of humans  was a shepherd and not a goatherd .  they have quite different ways of looking at the world  and the whole of history might have been different .   for sheep are stupid  and have to be driven .  but goats are intelligent  and need to be led .       ur gilash  thought om .  ah  those were the days   when ossory and his followers had broken into the temple and smashed the altar and had thrown the priestesses out of the window to be torn apart by wild dogs  which was the correct way of doing things  and there had been a mighty wailing and gnashing of feet and the followers of om had lit their campfires in the crumbled halls of gilash just as the prophet had said  and that counted even though he   d said it only five minutes earlier  when they were only looking for the firewood  because everyone agreed a prophecy is a prophecy and no one said you had to wait a long time for it to come true .   great days .  great days .  every day fresh converts .  the rise of om had been unstoppable     he jerked awake .   old ur gilash .  weather god  wasn   t he .  yes .  no .  maybe one of your basic giant spider gods .  something like that .  whatever happened to him .   what happened to me .  how does it happen .  you hang around the astral planes  going with the flow  enjoy the rhythms of the universe  you think that all the  you know  humans are getting on with the believing back down there  you decide to go and stir them up a bit and then   a tortoise .  it   s like going to the bank and finding the money   s been leaking out through a hole .  the first you know is when you stroll down looking for a handy mind  and suddenly you   re a tortoise and there   s no power left to get out .   three years of looking up at practically everything     old ur gilash .  perhaps he was hanging on as a lizard somewhere  with some old hermit as his only believer .  more likely he had been blown out into the desert .  a small god was lucky to get one chance .   there was something wrong .  om couldn   t quite put his finger on it  and not only because he didn   t have a finger .  gods rose and fell like bits of onion in a boiling soup  but this time was different .  there was something wrong this time     he   d forced out ur gilash .  fair enough .  law of the jungle .  but no one was challenging him       where was brutha .      brutha .          brutha was counting the flashes of light off the desert .      it   s a good thing i had a mirror  yes .     said the captain hopefully .     i expect his lordship won   t mind about the mirror because it turned out to be useful .         i don   t think he thinks like that     said brutha  still counting .      no .  i don   t think he does either     said the captain gloomily .      seven  and then four .         it   ll be the quisition for me     said the captain .   brutha was about to say     then rejoice that your soul shall be purified .     but he didn   t .  and he didn   t know why he didn   t .      i   m sorry about that     he said .   a veneer of surprise overlaid the captain   s grief .      you people usually say something about how the quisition is good for the soul     he said .      i   m sure it is     said brutha .   the captain was watching his face intently .      it   s flat  you know     he said quietly .     i   ve sailed out into the rim ocean .  it   s flat  and i   ve seen the edge  and it moves .  not the edge .  i mean   what   s down there .  they can cut my head off but it will still move .         but it will stop moving for you     said brutha .     so i should be careful to whom you speak  captain .      the captain leaned closer .      the turtle moves .     he hissed  and darted away .      brutha .      guilt jerked brutha upright like a hooked fish .  he turned around  and sagged with relief .  it wasn   t vorbis  it was only god .     he padded over to the place in front of the mast .  om glared up at him .      yes .     said brutha .      you never come and see me     said the tortoise .     i know you   re busy     it added sarcastically     but a quick prayer would be nice  even .         i checked you first thing this morning     said brutha .      and i   m hungry .         you had a whole melon rind last night .         and who had the melon  eh .         no  he didn   t     said brutha .     he eats stale bread and water .         why doesn   t he eat fresh bread .         he waits for it to get stale .         yes .  i expect he does     said the tortoise .      om .         what .         the captain just said something odd .  he said the world is flat and has an edge .         yes .  so what .         but  i mean  we know the world is a ball  because        the tortoise blinked .      no  it   s not     he said .     who said it   s a ball .         you did     said brutha .  then he added     according to book one of the septateuch  anyway .      i   ve never thought like this before  he thought .  i   d never have said    anyway .         why   d the captain tell me something like that .     he said .     it   s not normal conversation .         i told you  i never made the world     said om .     why should i make the world .  it was here already .  and if i did make a world  i wouldn   t make it a ball .  people   d fall off .  all the sea   d run off the bottom .           not if you told it to stay on .         hah .  will you hark at the man .         besides  the sphere is a perfect shape     said brutha .     because in the book of           nothing amazing about a sphere     said the tortoise .     come to that  a turtle is a perfect shape .         a perfect shape for what .         well  the perfect shape for a turtle  to start with     said om .     if it was shaped like a ball  it   d be bobbing to the surface the whole time .         but it   s a heresy to say the world is flat     said brutha .      maybe  but it   s true .         and it   s really on the back of a giant turtle .         that   s right .         in that case     said brutha triumphantly     what does the turtle stand on .      the tortoise gave him a blank stare .      it doesn   t stand on anything     it said .     it   s a turtle  for heaven   s sake .  it swims .  that   s what turtles are for .         i   er   i think i   d better go and report to vorbis     said brutha .     he goes very calm if he   s kept waiting .  what did you want me for .  i   ll try and bring you some more food after supper .         how are you feeling .     said the tortoise .      i   m feeling all right  thank you .         eating properly  that sort of thing .         yes  thank you .         pleased to hear it .  run along now .  i mean  i   m only your god .     om raised its voice as brutha hurried off .     and you might visit more often .      and pray louder  i   m fed up with straining .     he shouted .       vorbis was still sitting in his cabin when brutha puffed along the passage and knocked on the door .  there was no reply .  after a while  brutha pushed the door open .   vorbis did not appear to read .  obviously he wrote  because of the famous letters  but no one ever saw him do it .  when he was alone he spent a lot of time staring at the wall  or prostrate in prayer .  vorbis could humble himself in prayer in a way that made the posturings of power mad emperors look subservient .      um     said brutha  and tried to pull the door shut again .   vorbis waved one hand irritably .  then he stood up .  he did not dust off his robe .      do you know  brutha     he said     i do not think there is a single person in the citadel who would dare to interrupt me at prayer .  they would fear the quisition .  everyone fears the quisition .  except you  it appears .  do you fear the quisition .      brutha looked into the black on black eyes .  vorbis looked into a round pink face .  there was a special face that people wore when they spoke to an exquisitor .  it was flat and expressionless and glistened slightly  and even a half trained exquisitor could read the barely concealed guilt like a book .  brutha just looked out of breath but then  he always did .  it was fascinating .      no  lord     he said .      why not .         the quisition protects us  lord .  it is written in ossory  chapter vii  verse        vorbis put his head on one side .      of course it is .  but have you ever thought that the quisition could be wrong .         no  lord     said brutha .      but why not .           i do not know why  lord vorbis .  i just never have .      vorbis sat down at a little writing table  no more than a board that folded down from the hull .      and you are right  brutha     he said .     because the quisition cannot be wrong .  things can only be as the god wishes them .  it is impossible to think that the world could run in any other way  is this not so .      a vision of a one eyed tortoise flickered momentarily in brutha   s mind .   brutha had never been any good at lying .  the truth itself had always seemed so incomprehensible that complicating things even further had always been beyond him .      so the septateuch teaches us     he said .      where there is punishment  there is always a crime     said vorbis .     sometimes the crime follows the punishment  which only serves to prove the foresight of the great god .         that   s what my grandmother used to say     said brutha automatically .      indeed .  i would like to know more about this formidable lady .         she used to give me a thrashing every morning because i would certainly do something to deserve it during the day     said brutha .      a most complete understanding of the nature of mankind     said vorbis  with his chin on one hand .     were it not for the deficiency of her sex  it sounds as though she would have made an excellent inquisitor .      brutha nodded .  oh  yes .  yes  indeed .      and now     said vorbis  with no change in his tone     you will tell me what you saw in the desert .         uh .  there were six flashes .  and then a pause of about five heartbeats .  and then eight flashes .  and another pause .  and two flashes .        vorbis nodded thoughtfully .      three quarters     he said .     all praise to the great god .  he is my staff and guide through the hard places .  and you may go .      brutha hadn   t expected to be told what the flashes meant  and wasn   t going to enquire .  the quisition asked the questions .  they were known for it .       next day the ship rounded a headland and the bay of ephebe lay before it  with the city a white smudge on the horizon which time and distance turned into a spilling of blindingly white houses  all the way up a rock .   it seemed of considerable interest to sergeant simony .  brutha had not exchanged a word with him .  fraternization between clergy and soldiers was not encouraged  there was a certain tendency to unholiness about soldiers     brutha  left to his own devices again as the crew made ready for port  watched the soldier carefully .  most soldiers were a bit slovenly and generally rude to minor clergy .  simony was different .  apart from anything else  he gleamed .  his breastplate hurt the eyes .  his skin looked scrubbed .   the sergeant stood at the prow  staring fixedly as the city drew nearer .  it was unusual to see him very far away from vorbis .  wherever vorbis stood there was the sergeant  hand on sword  eyes scanning the surroundings for   what .   and always silent  except when spoken to .  brutha tried to be friends .      looks very   white  doesn   t it .     he said .     the city .  very white .  sergeant simony .      the sergeant turned slowly  and stared at brutha .   vorbis   s gaze was dreadful .  vorbis looked through your head to the sins inside  hardly interested in you except as a vehicle for your sins .  but simony   s glance was pure  simple hatred .   brutha stepped back .      oh .  i   m sorry     he muttered .  he walked back somberly to the blunt end  and tried to keep out of the soldier   s way .   anyway  there were more soldiers  soon enough     the ephebians were expecting them .  soldiers lined the quay  weapons held in a way that stopped just short of being a direct insult .  and there were a lot of them .   brutha trailed along  the voice of the tortoise insinuating itself in his head .      so the ephebians want peace  do they .     said om .     doesn   t look like that .  doesn   t look like we   re going to lay down the law to a defeated enemy .  looks like we took a pasting and don   t want to take any more .  looks like we   re suing for peace .  that   s what it looks like to me .         in the citadel everyone said it was a glorious victory     said brutha .  he found he could talk now with his lips hardly moving at all  om seemed able to pick up his words as they reached his vocal cords .   ahead of him  simony shadowed the deacon  staring suspiciously at each ephebian guard .      that   s a funny thing     said om .     winners never talk about glorious victories .  that   s because they   re the ones who see what the battlefield looks like afterward .  it   s only the losers who have glorious victories .      brutha didn   t know what to reply .     that doesn   t sound like god talk     he hazarded .      it   s this tortoise brain .         what .         don   t you know anything .  bodies aren   t just handy things for storing your mind in .  your shape affects how you think .  it   s all this morphology that   s all over the place .         what .      om sighed .     if i don   t concentrate  i think like a tortoise .         what .  you mean slowly .         no .  tortoises are cynics .  they always expect the worst .         why .         i don   t know .  because it often happens to them  i suppose .      brutha stared around at ephebe .  guards with helmets crested with plumes that looked like horses    tails gone rogue marched on either side of the column .  a few ephebian citizens watched idly from the roadside .  they looked surprisingly like the people at home  and not like two legged demons at all .      they   re people     he said .      full marks for comparative anthropology .         brother nhumrod said ephebians eat human flesh     said brutha .     he wouldn   t tell lies .      a small boy regarded brutha thoughtfully while excavating a nostril .  if it was a demon in human form  it was an extremely good actor .   at intervals along the road from the docks were white stone statues .  brutha had never seen statues before .  apart from the statues of the septarchs  of course  but that wasn   t the same thing .      what are they .         well  the tubby one with the toga is tuvelpit  the god of wine .  they call him smimto in tsort .  and the broad with the hairdo is astoria  goddess of love .  a complete bubblehead .  the ugly one is offler the crocodile god .  not a local boy .  he   s klatchian originally  but the ephebians heard about him and thought he was a good idea .  note the teeth .  good teeth .  good teeth .  then the one with the snakepit hairdo is           you talk about them as if they were real     said brutha .      they are .         there is no other god but you .  you told ossory that .         well .  you know .  i exaggerated a bit .  but they   re not that good .  there   s one of    em that sits around playing a flute most of the time and chasing milkmaids .  i don   t call that very divine .  call that very divine .  i don   t .      the road wound up steeply around the rocky hill .  most of the city seemed to be built on outcrops or was cut into the actual rock itself  so that one man   s patio was another man   s roof .  the roads were really a series of shallow steps  accessible to a man or a donkey but sudden death to a cart .  ephebe was a pedestrian place .   more people watched them in silence .  so did the statues of the gods .  the ephebians had gods in the same way that other cities had rats .   brutha got a look at vorbis   s face .  the exquisitor was staring straight ahead of himself .  brutha wondered what the man was seeing .   it was all so new .   and devilish  of course .  although the gods in the statues didn   t look much like demons   but he could hear the voice of nhumrod pointing out that this very fact made them even more demonic .  sin crept up on you like a wolf in a sheep   s skin .   one of the goddesses had been having some very serious trouble with her dress  brutha noticed  if brother nhumrod had been present  he would have had to hurry off for some very serious lying down .        petulia  goddess of negotiable affection     said om .     worshiped by the ladies of the night and every other time as well  if you catch my meaning .      brutha   s mouth dropped open .      they   ve got a goddess for painted jezebels .         why not .  very religious people i understand .  they   re used to being on their   they spend so much time looking at the   look  belief is where you find it .  specialization .  that   s safe  see .  low risk  guaranteed returns .  there   s even a god of lettuce somewhere .  i mean  it   s not as though any one else is likely to try to become a god of lettuce .  you just find a lettuce growing community and hang on .  thunder gods come and go  but it   s you they turn to every time when there   s a bad attack of lettuce fly .  you   ve got to   uh   hand it to petulia .  she spotted a gap in the market and filled it .         there   s a god of lettuce .         why not .  if enough people believe  you can be god of anything        om stopped himself and waited to see if brutha had noticed .  but brutha seemed to have something else on his mind .      that   s not right .  not treating people like that .  ow .      he   d walked into the back of a subdeacon .  the party had halted  partly because the ephebian escort had stopped too  but mainly because a man was running down the street .   he was quite old  and in many respects resembled a frog that had been dried out for quite some time .  something about him generally made people think of the word    spry     but  at the moment  they would be much more likely to think of the words    mother naked    and possibly also    dripping wet    and would be one hundred percent accurate  too .  although there was the beard .  it was a beard you could camp out in .   the man thudded down the street without any apparent self consciousness and stopped outside a potter   s shop .  the potter didn   t seem concerned at being addressed by a little wet naked man  in fact  none of the people in the street had given him a second glance .      i   d like a number nine pot and some string  please     said the old man .      yes sir  mr .  legibus .     the potter reached under his counter and pulled out a towel .  the naked man took it in an absent minded way .  brutha got the feeling that this had happened to both of them before .      and a lever of infinite length and  um  an immovable place to stand     said legibus  drying himself off .      what you see is what i got  sir .  pots and general household items  but a bit short on axiomatic mechanisms .         well  have you got a piece of chalk .         got some right here from last time     said the potter .   the little naked man took the chalk and started to draw triangles on the nearest bit of wall .  then he looked down .      why haven   t i got any clothes on .     he said .      we   ve been having our bath again  haven   t we .     said the potter .      i left my clothes in the bath .         i think you probably had an idea while you were in the bath .     prompted the potter .      that   s right .  that   s right .  got this splendid idea for moving the world around .     said legibus .     simple lever principle .  should work perfectly .  it   s just a matter of getting the technical details sorted out .           that   s nice .  we can move somewhere warm for the winter     said the potter .      can i borrow the towel .         it   s yours anyway  mr .  legibus .         is it .         i said  you left it here last time .  remember .  when you had that idea for the lighthouse .         fine .  fine     said legibus  wrapping the towel around himself .  he drew a few more lines on the wall .     fine .  okay .  i   ll send someone down later to collect the wall .      he turned and appeared to see the omnians for the first time .  he peered forward and then shrugged .      hmm     he said  and wandered away .   brutha tugged at the cloak of one of the ephebian soldiers .      excuse me  but why did we stop .     he said .      philosophers have right of way     said the soldier .      what   s a philosopher .     said brutha .      someone who   s bright enough to find a job with no heavy lifting     said a voice in his head .      an infidel seeking the just fate he shall surely receive     said vorbis .     an inventor of fallacies .  this cursed city attracts them like a dung heap attracts flies .         actually  it   s the climate     said the voice of the tortoise .     think about it .  if you   re inclined to leap out of your bath and run down the street every time you think you   ve got a bright idea  you don   t want to do it somewhere cold .  if you do do it somewhere cold  you die out .  that   s natural selection  that is .  ephebe   s known for its philosophers .  it   s better than street theater .         what  a lot of old men running around the streets with no clothes on .     said brutha  under his breath  as they were marched onward .        more or less .  if you spend your whole time thinking about the universe  you tend to forget the less important bits of it .  like your pants .  and ninety nine out of a hundred ideas they come up with are totally useless .         why doesn   t anyone lock them away safely  then .  they don   t sound much use to me     said brutha .      because the hundredth idea     said om     is generally a humdinger .         what .         look up at the highest tower on the rock .      brutha looked up .  at the top of the tower  secured by metal bands  was a big disc that glittered in the morning light .      what is it .     he whispered .      the reason why omnia hasn   t got much of a fleet any more     said om .     that   s why it   s always worth having a few philosophers around the place .  one minute it   s all is truth beauty and is beauty truth  and does a falling tree in the forest make a sound if there   s no one there to hear it  and then just when you think they   re going to start dribbling one of    em says  incidentally  putting a thirty foot parabolic reflector on a high place to shoot the rays of the sun at an enemy   s ships would be a very interesting demonstration of optical principles     he added .     always coming up with amazing new ideas  the philosophers .  the one before that was some intricate device that demonstrated the principles of leverage by incidentally hurling balls of burning sulphur two miles .  then before that  i think  there was some kind of an underwater thing that shot sharpened logs into the bottom of ships .      brutha stared at the disc again .  he hadn   t understood more than one third of the words in the last statement .      well     he said     does it .           does what .         make a sound .  if it falls down when no one   s there to hear it .         who cares .      the party had reached a gateway in the wall that ran around the top of the rock in much the same way that a headband encircles a head .  the ephebian captain stopped  and turned .      the   visitors   must be blindfolded     he said .      that is outrageous .     said vorbis .     we are here on a mission of diplomacy .         that is not my business     said the captain .     my business is to say  if you go through this gate you go blindfolded .  you don   t have to be blindfolded .  you can stay outside .  but if you want to go through  you got to wear a blindfold .  this is one of them life choices .      one of the subdeacons whispered in vorbis   s ear .  he held a brief sotto voce conversation with the leader of the omnian guard .      very well     he said     under protest .      the blindfold was quite soft  and totally opaque .  but as brutha was led        ten paces along a passage  and then left five paces  then diagonally forward and left three and a half paces  and right one hundred and three paces  down three steps  and turned around seventeen and one quarter times  and forward nine paces  and left one pace  and forward nineteen paces  and pause three seconds  and right two paces  and back two paces  and left two paces  and turned three and a half times  and wait one second  and up three steps  and right twenty paces  and turned around five and a quarter times  and left fifteen paces  and forward seven paces  and right eighteen paces  and up seven steps  and diagonally forward  and pause two seconds  right four paces  and down a slope that went down a meter every ten paces for thirty paces  and then turned around seven and a half times  and forward six paces        he wondered what good it was supposed to do .   the blindfold was removed in an open courtyard  made of some white stone that turned the sunlight into a glare .  brutha blinked .   bowmen lined the yard .  their arrows were pointing downwards  but their manner suggested that pointing horizontally could happen any minute .   another bald man was waiting for them .  ephebe seemed to have an unlimited supply of skinny bald men wearing sheets .  this one smiled  with his mouth alone .   no one likes us much  brutha thought .      i trust you will excuse this minor inconvenience     said the skinny man .     my name is aristocrates .  i am secretary to the tyrant .  please ask your men to put down their weapons .      vorbis drew himself up to his full height .  he was a head taller than the ephebian .  pale though his complexion normally was  it had gone paler .      we are entitled to retain our arms .     he said .     we are an emissary to a foreign land .         but not a barbarian one     said aristocrates mildly .     weapons will not be required here .         barbarian .     said vorbis .     you burned our ships .      aristocrates held up a hand .      this is a discussion for later     he said .     my pleasant task now is to show you to your quarters .  i am sure you would like to rest a little after your journey .  you are  of course  at liberty to wander anywhere you wish in the palace .  and if there is anywhere where we do not wish you to wander  the guards will be sure to inform you with speed and tact .           and we can leave the palace .     said vorbis coldly .   aristocrates shrugged .      we do not guard the gateway except in times of war     he said .     if you can remember the way  you are free to use it .  but vague perambulations in the labyrinth are unwise  i must warn you .  our ancestors were sadly very suspicious and put in many traps out of distrust  we keep them well greased and primed  of course  merely out of a respect for tradition .  and now  if you would care to follow me        the omnians kept together as they followed aristocrates through the palace .  there were fountains .  there were gardens .  here and there groups of people sat around doing nothing very much except talking .  the ephebians seemed to have only a shaky grasp of the concepts of    inside    and    outside      except for the palace   s encircling labyrinth  which was very clear on the subject .      danger attends us at every turn     said vorbis quietly .     any man who breaks rank or fraternizes in any way will explain his conduct to the inquisitors .  at length .      brutha looked at a woman filling a jug from a well .  it did not look like a very military act .   he was feeling that strange double feeling again .  on the surface there were the thoughts of brutha  which were exactly the thoughts that the citadel would have approved of .  this was a nest of infidels and unbelievers  its very mundanity a subtle cloak for the traps of wrong thinking and heresy .  it might be bright with sunlight  but in reality it was a place of shadows .   but down below were the thoughts of the brutha that watched brutha from the inside     vorbis looked wrong here .  sharp and unpleasant .  and any city where potters didn   t worry at all when naked  dripping wet old men came and drew triangles on their walls was a place brutha wanted to find out more about .  he felt like a big empty jug .  the thing to do with something empty was fill it up .      are you doing something to me .     he whispered .   in his box  om looked at the shape of brutha   s mind .  then he tried to think quickly .      no     he said  and that at least was the truth .  had this ever happened before .   had it been like this back in the first days .  it must have been .  it was all so hazy now .  he couldn   t remember the thoughts he   d had then  just the shape of the thoughts .  everything had been highly colored  everything had been growing every day   he had been growing every day  thoughts and the mind that was thinking them were developing at the same speed .  easy to forget things from those times .  it was like a fire trying to remember the shape of its flames .  but the feeling   he could remember that .   he wasn   t doing anything to brutha .  brutha was doing it to himself .  brutha was beginning to think in godly ways .  brutha was starting to become a prophet .   om wished he had someone to talk to .  someone who understood .   this was ephebe  wasn   t it .  where people made a living trying to understand .       the omnians were to be housed in little rooms around a central courtyard .  there was a fountain in the middle  in a very small grove of sweet smelling pine trees .  the soldiers nudged one another .  people think that professional soldiers think a lot about fighting  but serious professional soldiers think a lot more about food and a warm place to sleep  because these are two things that are generally hard to get  whereas fighting tends to turn up all the time .   there was a bowl of fruit in brutha   s cell  and a plate of cold meat .  but first things first .  he fished the god out of the box .      there   s fruit     he said .     what   re these berries .         grapes     said om .     raw material for wine .         you mentioned that word before .  what does it mean .      there was a cry from outside .      brutha .         that   s vorbis .  i   ll have to go .      vorbis was standing in the middle of his cell .      have you eaten anything .     he demanded .      no  lord .         fruit and meat  brutha .  and this is a fast day .  they seek to insult us .         um .  perhaps they don   t know that it is a fast day .     brutha hazarded .      ignorance is itself a sin     said vorbis .      ossory vii  verse       said brutha automatically .   vorbis smiled and patted brutha   s shoulder .      you are a walking book  brutha .  the septateuch perambulatus .      brutha looked down at his sandals .   he   s right  he thought .  and i had forgotten .  or at least  not wanted to remember .   and then he heard his own thoughts echoed back to him  it   s fruit and meat and bread  that   s all .  that   s all it is .  fast days and feast days and prophets    days and bread days   who cares .  a god whose only concern about food now is that it   s low enough to reach .   i wish he wouldn   t keep patting my shoulder .   vorbis turned away .        shall i remind the others .     brutha said .      no .  our ordained brothers will not  of course  require reminding .  as for soldiers   a little license  perhaps  is allowable this far from home        brutha wandered back to his cell .   om was still on the table  staring fixedly at the melon .      i nearly committed a terrible sin     said brutha .     i nearly ate fruit on a fruitless day .         that   s a terrible thing  a terrible thing     said om .     now cut the melon .         but it is forbidden .     said brutha .      no it   s not     said om .     cut the melon .         but it was the eating of fruit that caused passion to invade the world     said brutha .      all it caused was flatulence     said om .     cut the melon .         you   re tempting me .         no i   m not .  i   m giving you permission .  special dispensation .  cut the damn melon .         only a bishop or higher is allowed to giv       brutha began .  and then he stopped .   om glared at him .      yes .  exactly     he said .     and now cut the melon .     his tone softened a bit .     if it makes you feel any better  i shall declare that it is bread .  i happen to be the god in this immediate vicinity .  i can call it what i damn well like .  it   s bread .  right .  now cut the damn melon .         loaf     corrected brutha .      right .  and give me a slice without any seeds in it .      brutha did so  a bit carefully .      and eat up quick     said om .      in case vorbis finds us .         because you   ve got to go and find a philosopher     said om .  the fact that his mouth was full didn   t make any difference to his voice in brutha   s mind .     you know  melons grow wild in the wilderness .  not big ones like this .  little green jobs .  skin like leather .  can   t bite through    em .  the years i   ve spent eating dead leaves a goat   d spit out  right next to a crop of melons .  melons should have thinner skins .  remember that .         find a philosopher .         right .  someone who knows how to think .  someone who can help me stop being a tortoise .         but   vorbis might want me .         you   re just going for a stroll .  no problem .  and hurry up .  there   s other gods in ephebe .  i don   t want to meet them right now .  not looking like this .      brutha looked panicky .      how do i find a philosopher .     he said .      around here .  throw a brick  i should think .          the labyrinth of ephebe is ancient and full of one hundred and one amazing things you can do with hidden springs  razor sharp knives  and falling rocks .  there isn   t just one guide through it .  there are six  and each one knows his way through one sixth of the labyrinth .  every year they have a special competition  when they do a little redesigning .  they vie with one another to see who can make his section even more deadly than the others to the casual wanderer .  there   s a panel of judges  and a small prize .   the furthest anyone ever got through the labyrinth without a guide was nineteen paces .  well  more or less .  his head rolled a further seven paces  but that probably doesn   t count .   at each changeover point there is a small chamber without any traps at all .  what it does contain is a small bronze bell .  these are the little waiting rooms where visitors are handed on to the next guide .  and here and there  set high in the tunnel roof over the more ingenious traps  are observation windows  because guards like a good laugh as much as anyone else .   all of this was totally lost on brutha  who padded amiably along the tunnels and corridors without really thinking much about it  and at last pushed open the gate into the late evening air .   it was fragrant with the scent of flowers .  moths whirred through the gloom .      what do philosophers look like .     said brutha     when they   re not having a bath  i mean .         they do a lot of thinking     said om .     look for someone with a strained expression .         that might just mean constipation .         well  so long as they   re philosophical about it        the city of ephebe surrounded them .  dogs barked .  somewhere a cat yowled .  there was that general susurration of small comfortable sounds that shows that  out there  a lot of people are living their lives .   and then a door burst open down the street and there was the cracking noise of a quite large wine amphora being broken over someone   s head .   a skinny old man in a toga picked himself up from the cobbles where he had landed  and glared at the doorway .      i   m telling you  listen  a finite intellect  right  cannot by means of comparison reach the absolute truth of things  because being by nature indivisible  truth excludes the concepts of    more    or    less    so that nothing but truth itself can be the exact measure of truth .  you bastards     he said .   someone from inside the building said     oh yeah .  sez you .        the old man ignored brutha but  with great difficulty  pulled a cobblestone loose and hefted it in his hand .   then he dived back through the doorway .  there was a distant scream of rage .      ah .  philosophy     said om .   brutha peered cautiously around the door .   inside the room two groups of very nearly identical men in togas were trying to hold back two of their colleagues .  it is a scene repeated a million times a day in bars around the multiverse   both would be fighters growled and grimaced at one another and fought to escape the restraint of their friends  only of course they did not fight too hard  because there is nothing worse than actually succeeding in breaking free and suddenly finding yourself all alone in the middle of the ring with a madman who is about to hit you between the eyes with a rock .      yep     said om     that   s philosophy  right enough .         but they   re fighting .         a full and free exchange of opinions  yes .      now that brutha could get a clearer view  he could see that there were one or two differences between the men .  one had a shorter beard  and was very red in the face  and was waggling a finger accusingly .      he bloody well accused me of slander .     he was shouting .      i didn   t .     shouted the other man .      you did .  you did .  tell    em what you said .         look  i merely suggested  to indicate the nature of paradox  right  that if xeno the ephebian said     all ephebians are liars              see .  see .  he did it again .            no  no  listen  listen   then  since xeno is himself an ephebian  this would mean that he himself is a liar and therefore        xeno made a determined effort to break free  dragging four desperate fellow philosophers across the floor .      i   m going to lay one right on you  pal .      brutha said     excuse me  please .      the philosophers froze .  then they turned to look at brutha .  they relaxed by degrees .  there was a chorus of embarrassed coughs .      are you all philosophers .     said brutha .   the one called xeno stepped forward  adjusting the hang of his toga .      that   s right     he said .     we   re philosophers .  we think  therefore we am .         are     said the luckless paradox manufacturer automatically .   xeno spun around .     i   ve just about had it up to here with you  ibid .     he roared .  he turned back to brutha .     we are  therefore we am     he said confidently .     that   s it .      several of the philosophers looked at one another with interest .      that   s actually quite interesting     one said .     the evidence of our existence is the fact of our existence  is that what you   re saying .         shut up     said xeno  without looking around .      have you been fighting .     said brutha .   the assembled philosophers assumed various expressions of shock and horror .      fighting .  us .  we   re philosophers     said ibid  shocked .      my word  yes     said xeno .      but you were       brutha began .   xeno waved a hand .        the cut and thrust of debate     he said .      thesis plus antithesis equals hysteresis     said ibid .     the stringent testing of the universe .  the hammer of the intellect upon the anvil of fundamental truth           shut up     said xeno .     and what can we do for you  young man .         ask them about gods     om prompted .      uh  i want to find out about gods     said brutha .   the philosophers looked at one another .      gods .     said xeno .     we don   t bother with gods .  huh .  relics of an outmoded belief system  gods .      there was a rumble of thunder from the clear evening sky .      except for blind io the thunder god     xeno went on  his tone hardly changing .   lightning flashed across the sky .      and cubal the fire god     said xeno .   a gust of wind rattled the windows .      flatulus the god of the winds  he   s all right too     said xeno .   an arrow materialized out of the air and hit the table by xeno   s hand .      fedecks the messenger of the gods  one of the all time greats     said xeno .   a bird appeared in the doorway .  at least  it looked vaguely like a bird .  it was about a foot high  black and white  with a bent beak and an expression that suggested that whatever it was it really dreaded ever happening to it had already happened .      what   s that .     said brutha .      a penguin     said the voice of om inside his head .      patina the goddess of wisdom .  one of the best     said xeno .     the penguin croaked at him and waddled off into the darkness .   the philosophers looked very embarrassed .  then ibid said     foorgol the god of avalanches .  where   s the snowline .         two hundred miles away     said someone .   they waited .  nothing happened .      relic of an outmoded belief system     said xeno .   a wall of freezing white death did not appear anywhere in ephebe .      mere unthinking personification of a natural force     said one of the philosophers  in a louder voice .  they all seemed to feel a lot better about this .      primitive nature worship .         wouldn   t give you tuppence for him .         simple rationalization of the unknown .         hah .  a clever fiction  a bogey to frighten the weak and stupid .      the words rose up in brutha .  he couldn   t stop himself .      is it always this cold .     he said .     it seemed very chilly on my way here .      the philosophers all moved away from xeno .      although if there   s one thing you can say about foorgal     said xeno     it   s that he   s a very understanding god .  likes a joke as much as the next   man .      he looked both ways  quickly .  after a while the philosophers relaxed  and seemed to completely forget about brutha .   and only now did he really have time to take in the room .  he had never seen a tavern before in his life  but that was what it was .  the bar ran along one side of the room .  behind it were the typical trappings of an ephebian bar   the stacks of wine jars  racks of amphorae  and the cheery pictures of vestal virgins on cards of salted peanuts and goat jerky  pinned up in the hope that there really were people in the world who would slatheringly buy more and more packets of nuts they didn   t want in order to look at a cardboard nipple .      what   s all this stuff .     brutha whispered .      how should i know .     said om .     let me out so   s i can see .      brutha unfastened the box and lifted the tortoise out .  one rheumy eye looked around .      oh .  typical tavern     said om .     good .  mine   s a saucer of whatever they were drinking .         a tavern .  a place were alcohol is drunk .         i very much intend this to be the case  yes .         but   but   the septateuch  no less than seventeen times  adjures us most emphatically to refrain from           beats the hell out of me why     said om .     see that man cleaning the mugs .  you say unto him  give me a           but it mocks the mind of man  says the prophet ossory .  and           i   ll say this one more time .  i never said it .  now talk to the man .      in fact the man talked to brutha .  he appeared magically on the other side of the bar  still wiping a mug .      evening  sir     he said .     what   ll it be .         i   d like a drink of water  please     said brutha  very deliberately .      and something for the tortoise .         wine .     said the voice of om .      i don   t know     said brutha .     what do tortoises usually drink .         the ones we have in here normally have a drop of milk with some bread in it     said the barman .        you get a lot of tortoises .     said brutha loudly  trying to drown out om   s outraged screams .      oh  a very useful philosophical animal  your average tortoise .  outrunning metaphorical arrows  beating hares in races   very handy .         uh   i haven   t got any money     said brutha .   the barman leaned towards him .     tell you what     he said .     declivities has just bought a round .  he won   t mind .         bread and milk .         oh .  thank you .  thank you very much .         oh  we get all sorts in here     said the barman  leaning back .     stoics .  cynics .  big drinkers  the cynics .  epicureans .  stochastics .  anamaxandrites .  epistemologists .  peripatetics .  synoptics .  all sorts .  that   s what i always say .  what i always say is      he picked up another mug and started to dry it      it takes all sorts to make a world .         bread and milk .     shouted om .     you   ll feel my wrath for this  right .  now ask him about gods .         tell me     said brutha  sipping his mug of water     do any of them know much about gods .         you   d want a priest for that sort of thing     said the barman .      no  i mean about   what gods are   how gods came to exist   that sort of thing     said brutha  trying to get to grips with the barman   s peculiar mode of conversation .      gods don   t like that sort of thing     said the barman .     we get that in here some nights  when someone   s had a few .  cosmic speculation about whether gods really exist .  next thing  there   s a bolt of lightning through the roof with a note wrapped around it saying    yes  we do    and a pair of sandals with smoke coming out .  that sort of thing  it takes all the interest out of metaphysical speculation .         not even fresh bread     muttered om  nose deep in his saucer .      no  i know gods exist all right     said brutha  hurriedly .     i just want to find out more about   them .      the barman shrugged .      then i   d be obliged if you don   t stand next to anything valuable     he said     still  it   ll all be the same in a hundred years .     he picked up another mug and started to polish it .      are you a philosopher .     said brutha .      it kind of rubs off on you after a while     said the barman .      this milk   s off     said om .     they say ephebe is a democracy .  this milk ought to be allowed to vote .         i don   t think     said brutha carefully     that i   m going to find what i want here .  um .  mr .  drink seller .         yes .         what was that bird that walked in when the goddess      he tasted the unfamiliar word      of wisdom was mentioned .         bit of a problem there     said the barman .     bit of an embarrassment .         sorry .         it was     said the barman     a penguin .         is it a wise sort of bird  then .         no .  not a lot     said the barman .     not known for its wisdom .  second most confused bird in the world .  can only fly underwater  they say .         then why           we don   t like to talk about it     said the barman .     it upsets people .  bloody sculptor     he added  under his breath .     down the other end of the bar the philosophers had started fighting again .   the barman leaned forward .     if you haven   t got any money     he said     i don   t think you   re going to get much help .  talk isn   t cheap around here .         but they just       brutha began .      there   s the expenditure on soap and water  for a start .  towels .  flannels .  loofahs .  pumice stones .  bath salts .  it all adds up .      there was a gurgling noise from the saucer .  om   s milky head turned to brutha .      you   ve got no money at all .     he said .      no     said brutha .      well  we   ve got to have a philosopher     said the tortoise flatly .     i can   t think and you don   t know how to .  we   ve got to find someone who does it all the time .         of course  you could try old didactylos     said the barman .     he   s about as cheap as they come .         doesn   t use expensive soap .     said brutha .      i think it could be said without fear of contradiction     said the barman solemnly     that he doesn   t use any soap at all whatsoever in any way .         oh .  well .  thank you     said brutha .      ask him where this man lives     om commanded .      where can i find mr .  didactylos .     said brutha .      in the palace courtyard .  next door to the library .  you can   t miss him .  just follow your nose .         we just came       brutha said  but his inner voice prompted him not to complete the sentence .     we   ll just be going then .         don   t forget your tortoise     said the barman .     there   s good eating on one of them .         may all your wine turn to water .     om shrieked .        will it .     said brutha  as they stepped out into the night .      no .         tell me again .  why exactly are we looking for a philosopher .     said brutha .      i want to get my power back     said om .      but everyone believes in you .         if they believed in me they could talk to me .  i could talk to them .  i don   t know what   s gone wrong .  no one is worshiping any other gods in omnia  are they .         they wouldn   t be allowed to     said brutha .     the quisition would see to that .         yeah .  it   s hard to kneel if you have no knees .      brutha stopped in the empty street .      i don   t understand you .         you   re not supposed to .  the ways of gods aren   t supposed to be understandable to men .         the quisition keeps us on the path of truth .  the quisition works for the greater glory of the church .         and you believe that  do you .     said the tortoise .   brutha looked  and found that certainty had gone missing .  he opened and shut his mouth  but there were no words to be said .      come on     said om  as kindly as he could manage .     let   s get back .          in the middle of the night om awoke .  there were noises from brutha   s bed .   brutha was praying again .   om listened curiously .  he could remember prayers .  there had been a lot of them  once .  so many that he couldn   t make out an individual prayer even if he had felt inclined to  but that didn   t matter  because what mattered was the huge cosmic susurration of thousands of praying  believing minds .  the words weren   t worth listening to  anyway .   humans .  they lived in a world where the grass continued to be green and the sun rose every day and flowers regularly turned into fruit  and what impressed them .  weeping statues .  and wine made out of water .  a mere quantum mechanistic tunnel effect  that   d happen anyway if you were prepared to wait zillions of years .  as if the turning of sunlight into wine  by means of vines and grapes and time and enzymes  wasn   t a thousand times more impressive and happened all the time     well  he couldn   t even do the most basic of god tricks now .  thunderbolts with about the same effect as the spark off a cat   s fur  and you could hardly smite anyone with one of those .  he had smitten good and hard in his time .  now he could just about walk through water and feed the one .   brutha   s prayer was a piccolo tune in a world of silence .   om waited until the novice was quiet again and then unfolded his legs and walked out  rocking from side to side  into the dawn .       the ephebians walked through the palace courtyards  surrounding the omnians almost  but not quite  in the manner of a prisoners    escort .   brutha could see that vorbis was boiling with fury .  a small vein on the side of the exquisitor   s bald temple was throbbing .   as if feeling brutha   s eyes on him  vorbis turned his head .      you seem ill at ease this morning  brutha     he said .      sorry  lord .           you seem to be looking into every corner .  what are you expecting to find .         uh .  just interested  lord .  everything   s new .         all the so called wisdom of ephebe is not worth one line from the least paragraph in the septateuch     said vorbis .      may we not study the works of the infidel in order to be more alert to the ways of heresy .     said brutha  surprised at himself .      ah .  a persuasive argument  brutha  and one that the inquisitors have heard many times  if a little indistinctly in many cases .      vorbis glowered at the back of the head of aristocrates  who was leading the party .     it is but a small step from listening to heresy to questioning established truth  brutha .  heresy is often fascinating .  therein lies its danger .         yes  lord .         hah .  and not only do they carve forbidden statues  but they can   t even do it properly .      brutha was no expert  but even he had to agree that this was true .  now the novelty of them had worn off  the statues that decorated every niche in the palace did have a certain badly made look .  brutha was pretty sure he   d just passed one with two left arms .  another one had one ear larger than the other .  it wasn   t that someone had set out to carve ugly gods .  they had clearly been meant to be quite attractive statues .  but the sculptor hadn   t been much good at it .      that woman there appears to be holding a penguin     said vorbis .      patina  goddess of wisdom     said brutha automatically  and then realized he   d said it .      i  er  heard someone mention it     he added .        indeed .  and what remarkably good hearing you must have     said vorbis .   aristocrates paused outside an impressive doorway and nodded at the party .      gentlemen     he said     the tyrant will see you now .         you will recall everything that is said     whispered vorbis .   brutha nodded .   the doors swung open .   all over the world there were rulers with titles like the exalted  the supreme  and lord high something or other .  only in one small country was the ruler elected by the people  who could remove him whenever they wanted   and they called him the tyrant .   the ephebians believed that every man should have the vote .   every five years someone was elected to be tyrant  provided he could prove that he was honest  intelligent  sensible  and trustworthy .  immediately after he was elected  of course  it was obvious to everyone that he was a criminal madman and totally out of touch with the view of the ordinary philosopher in the street looking for a towel .  and then five years later they elected another one just like him  and really it was amazing how intelligent people kept on making the same mistakes .   candidates for the tyrantship were elected by the placing of black or white balls in various urns  thus giving rise to a well known comment about politics .   the tyrant was a fat little man with skinny legs  giving people the impression of an egg that was hatching upside down .  he was sitting alone in the middle of the marble floor  in a chair surrounded by scrolls and scraps of paper .  his feet didn   t touch the marble  and his face was pink .   aristocrates whispered something in his ear .  the tyrant looked up from his paperwork .      ah  the omnian delegation     he said  and a smile flashed across his face like something small darting across a stone .     do be seated  all of you .      he looked down again .      i am deacon vorbis of the citadel quisition     said vorbis coldly .   the tyrant looked up and gave him another lizard smile .      yes  i know     he said .     you torture people for a living .  please be seated  deacon vorbis .  and your plump young friend who seems to be looking for something .  and the rest of you .  some young women will be along in a moment with grapes and things .  this generally happens .  it   s very hard to stop it  in fact .      there were benches in front of the tyrant   s chair .  the omnians sat down .  vorbis remained standing .   the tyrant nodded .     as you wish     he said .      this is intolerable .     snapped vorbis .     we have been treated           much better than you would have treated us     said the tyrant mildly .     you sit or you stand  my lord  because this is ephebe and indeed you may stand on your head for all i care  but don   t expect me to believe that if it was i  seeking peace in your citadel  i would be encouraged to do anything but grovel on what was left of my stomach .  be seated or be upstanding  my lord  but be quiet .  i have nearly finished .         finished what .     said vorbis .      the peace treaty     said the tyrant .        but that is what we are here to discuss     said vorbis .      no     said the tyrant .  the lizard scuttled again     that is what you are here to sign .          om took a deep breath and then pushed himself forward .   it was quite a steep flight of steps .  he felt every one as he bumped down  but at least he was upright at the bottom .   he was lost  but being lost in ephebe was preferable to being lost in the citadel .  at least there were no obvious cellars .   library  library  library     there was a library in the citadel  brutha had said .  he   d described it  so om had some idea of what he was looking for .   there would be a book in it .       peace negotiations were not going well .      you attacked us .     said vorbis .      i would call it preemptive defense     said the tyrant .     we saw what happened to istanzia and betrek and ushistan .         they saw the truth of om .         yes     said the tyrant .     we believe they did  eventually .         and they are now proud members of the empire .         yes     said the tyrant .     we believe they are .  but we like to remember them as they were .  before you sent them your letters  that put the minds of men in chains .         that set the feet of men on the right road     said vorbis .      chain letters     said the tyrant .     the chain letter to the ephebians .  forget your gods .  be subjugated .  learn to fear .  do not break the chain   the last people who did woke up one morning to find fifty thousand armed men on their lawn .      vorbis sat back .      what is it you fear .     he said .     here in your desert  with your   gods .  is it not that  deep in your souls  you know that your gods are as shifting as your sand .         oh  yes     said the tyrant .     we know that .  that   s always been a point in their favor .  we know about sand .  and your god is a rock   and we know about rock .          om stumped along a cobbled alley  keeping to the shade as much as possible .   there seemed to be a lot of courtyards .  he paused at the point where the alley opened into yet another of them .   there were voices .  mainly there was one voice  petulant and reedy .   this was the philosopher didactylos .   although one of the most quoted and popular philosophers of all time  didactylos the ephebian never achieved the respect of his fellow philosophers .  they felt he wasn   t philosopher material .  he didn   t bathe often enough or  to put it another way  at all .  and he philosophized about the wrong sorts of things .  and he was interested in the wrong sorts of things .  dangerous things .  other philosophers asked questions like  is truth beauty  and is beauty truth .  and  is reality created by the observer .  but didactylos posed the famous philosophical conundrum     yes  but what   s it really all about  then  when you get right down to it  i mean really .      his philosophy was a mixture of three famous schools   the cynics  the stoics  and the epicureans   and summed up all three of them in his famous phrase     you can   t trust any bugger further than you can throw him  and there   s nothing you can do about it  so let   s have a drink .  mine   s a double  if you   re buying .  thank you .  and a packet of nuts .  her left bosom is nearly uncovered  eh .  two more packets  then .      many people have quoted from his famous meditations      it   s a rum old world all right .  but you   ve got to laugh  haven   t you .  nil illegitimo carborundum is what i say .  the experts don   t know everything .  still  where would we be if we were all the same .      om crawled closer to the voice  bringing himself around the corner of the wall so that he could see into a small courtyard .   there was a very large barrel against the far wall .  various debris around it   broken wine amphorae  gnawed bones  and a couple of lean to shacks made out of rough boards   suggested that it was someone   s home .  and this impression was given some weight by the sign chalked on a board and stuck to the wall over the barrel .   it read       didactylos and nephew  practical philosophers      no proposition too large     we can do your thinking for you         special rates after   pm  fresh axioms every day      in front of the barrel  a short man in a toga that must have once been white  in the same way that once all continents must have been joined together  was kicking another one who was on the ground .      you lazy bugger .      the younger one sat up .      honest  uncle           i turn my back for half an hour and you go to sleep on the job .         what job .  we haven   t had anything since mr .  piloxi the farmer last week           how d   you know .  how d   you know .  while you were snoring dozens of people could   ve been goin    past  every one of    em in need of a pers   nal philosophy .            and he only paid in olives .         i shall prob   ly get a good price for them olives .         they   re rotten  uncle .         nonsense .  you said they were green .         yes  but they   re supposed to be black .      in the shadows  the tortoise   s head turned back and forth like a spectator   s at a tennis match .   the young man stood up .      mrs .  bylaxis came in this morning     he said .     she said the proverb you did for her last week has stopped working .      didactylos scratched his head .      which one was that .     he said .      you gave her    it   s always darkest before dawn .            nothing wrong with that .  damn good philosophy .         she said she didn   t feel any better .  anyway  she said she   d stayed up all night because of her bad leg and it was actually quite light just before dawn  so it wasn   t true .  and her leg still dropped off .  so i gave her part exchange on    still  it does you good to laugh .         didactylos brightened up a bit .      shifted that one  eh .           she said she   d give it a try .  she gave me a whole dried squid for it .  she said i looked like i needed feeding up .         right .  you   re learning .  that   s lunch sorted out at any rate .  see  urn .  told you it would work if we stuck at it .         i don   t call one dried squid and a box of greasy olives much of a return  master .  not for two weeks    thinking .         we got three obols for doing that proverb for old grillos the cobbler .         no we didn   t .  he brought it back .  his wife didn   t like the color .         and you gave him his money back .         yes .         what  all of it .         yes .         can   t do that .  not after he   s put wear and tear on the words .  which one was it .            it   s a wise crow that knows which way the camel points .            i put a lot of work in on that one .         he said he couldn   t understand it .         i don   t understand cobbling  but i know a good pair of sandals when i wears    em .      om blinked his one eye .  then he looked at the shapes of the minds in front of him .   the one called urn was presumably the nephew  and had a fairly normal sort of mind  even if it did seem to have too many circles and angles in it .  but didactylos   s mind bubbled and flashed like a potful of electric eels on full boil .  om had never seen anything like it .  brutha   s thoughts took eons to slide into place  it was like watching mountains colliding  didactylos   s thoughts chased after one another with a whooshing noise .  no wonder he was bald .  hair would have burned off from the inside .     om had found a thinker .   a cheap one  too  by the sound of it .   he looked up at the wall behind the barrel .  further along was an impressive set of marble steps leading up to some bronze doors  and over the doors  made of metal letters set in the stone  was the word librvm .   he   d spent too much time looking .  urn   s hand clamped itself on to his shell  and he heard didactylos   s voice say     hey   there   s good eating on one of these things            brutha cowered .      you stoned our envoy .     shouted vorbis .     an unarmed man .         he brought it upon himself     said the tyrant .     aristocrates was there .  he will tell you .      the tall man nodded and stood up .      by tradition anyone may speak in the marketplace     he began .      and be stoned .     vorbis demanded .   aristocrates held up a hand .      ah     he said     anyone can say what they like in the square .  we have another tradition  though  called free listening .  unfortunately  when people dislike what they hear  they can become a little   testy .         i was there too     said another advisor .     your priest got up to speak and at first everything was fine  because people were laughing .  and then he said that om was the only real god  and everyone went quiet .  and then he pushed over a statue of tuvelpit  the god of wine .  that   s when the trouble started .         are you proposing to tell me he was struck by lightning .     said vorbis .   vorbis was no longer shouting .  his voice was level  without passion .  the thought rose in brutha   s mind  this is how the exquisitors speak .  when the inquisitors have finished  the exquisitors speak        no .  by an amphora .  tuvelpit was in the crowd  you see .         and striking honest men is considered proper godly behavior  is it .         your missionary had said that people who did not believe in om would suffer endless punishment .  i have to tell you that the crowd considered this rude .         and so they threw stones at him           not many .  they only hurt his pride .  and only after they   d run out of vegetables .         they threw vegetables .         when they couldn   t find any more eggs .         and when we came to remonstrate           i am sure sixty ships intended more than remonstrating     said the tyrant .     and we have warned you  lord vorbis .  people find in ephebe what they seek .  there will be more raids on your coast .  we will harass your ships .  unless you sign .         and passage through ephebe .     said vorbis .   the tyrant smiled .      across the desert .  my lord  if you can cross the desert  i am sure you can go anywhere .     the tyrant looked away from vorbis and towards the sky  visible between the pillars .      and now i see it is nearing noon     he said .     and the day heats up .  doubtless you will wish to discuss our   uh   proposals with your colleagues .  may i suggest we meet again at sunset .      vorbis appeared to give this some consideration .      i think     he said eventually     that our deliberations may take longer .  shall we say   tomorrow morning .        the tyrant nodded .      as you wish .  in the meantime  the palace is at your disposal .  there are many fine temples and works of art should you wish to inspect them .  when you require meals  mention the fact to the nearest slave .         slave is an ephebian word .  in om we have no word for slave     said vorbis .      so i understand     said the tyrant .     i imagine that fish have no word for water .     he smiled the fleeting smile again .     and there are the baths and the library  of course .  many fine sights .  you are our guests .      vorbis inclined his head .      i pray     he said     that one day you will be a guest of mine .         and what sights i shall see     said the tyrant .   brutha stood up  knocking over his bench and going redder with embarrassment .   he thought  they lied about brother murduck .  they beat him within an inch of his life  vorbis said  and flogged him the rest of the way .  and brother nhumrod said he saw the body  and it was really true .  just for talking .  people who would do that sort of thing deserve   punishment .  and they keep slaves .  people forced to work against their will .  people treated like animals .  and they even call their ruler a tyrant .   and why isn   t any of this exactly what it seems .   why don   t i believe any of it .   why do i know it isn   t true .   and what did he mean about fish not having a word for water .       the omnians were half escorted  half led back to their compound .  another bowl of fruit was waiting on the table in brutha   s cell  with some more fish and a loaf of bread .     there was also a man  sweeping the floor .      um     said brutha .     are you a slave .         yes  master .         that must be terrible .      the man leaned on his broom .     you   re right .  it   s terrible .  really terrible .  d   you know  i only get one day off a week .      brutha  who had never heard the words    day off    before  and who was in any case unfamiliar with the concept  nodded uncertainly .      why don   t you run away .     he said .      oh  done that     said the slave .     ran away to tsort once .  didn   t like it much .  came back .  run away for a fortnight in djelibeybi every winter  though .         do you get brought back .     said brutha .      huh .     said the slave .     no  i don   t .  miserable skin flint  aristocrates .  i have to come back by myself .  hitching lifts on ships  that kind of thing .         you come back .         yeah .  abroad   s all right to visit  but you wouldn   t want to live there .  anyway  i   ve only got another four years as a slave and then i   m free .  you get the vote when you   re free .  and you get to keep slaves .     his face glazed with the effort of recollection as he ticked off points on his fingers .     slaves get three meals a day  at least one with meat .  and one free day a week .  and two weeks being allowed to run away every year .  and i don   t do ovens or heavy lifting  and worldly wise repartee only by arrangement .         yes  but you   re not free     said brutha  intrigued despite himself .      what   s the difference .         er   you don   t get any days off .     brutha scratched his head .     and one less meal .           really .  i think i   ll give freedom a miss then  thanks .         er   have you seen a tortoise anywhere around here .     said brutha .      no .  and i cleaned under the bed .         have you seen one anywhere else today .         you want one .  there   s good eating on a           no .  no .  it   s all right           brutha .      it was vorbis   s voice .  brutha hurried out into the courtyard and into vorbis   s cell .      ah  brutha .         yes  lord .      vorbis was sitting cross legged on the floor  staring at the wall .      you are a young man visiting a new place     said vorbis .     no doubt there is much you wish to see .         there is .     said brutha .  vorbis was using the exquisitor voice again   a level monotone  a voice like a strip of dull steel .      you may go where you wish .  see new things  brutha .  learn everything you can .  you are my eyes and ears .  and my memory .  learn about this place .         er .  really  lord .         have i impressed you with my use of careless language  brutha .         no  lord .         go away .  fill yourself .  and be back by sunset .         er .  even the library .     said brutha .      ah .  yes  the library .  the library that they have here .  of course .  crammed with useless and dangerous and evil knowledge .  i can see it in my mind  brutha .  can you imagine that .         no  lord vorbis .         your innocence is your shield  brutha .  no .  by all means go to the library .  i have no fear of any effect on you .         lord vorbis .         yes .         the tyrant said that they hardly did anything to brother murduck        silence unrolled its restless length .   vorbis said     he lied .         yes .     brutha waited .  vorbis continued to stare at the wall .  brutha wondered what he saw there .  when nothing else appeared to be forthcoming  he said     thank you .      he stepped back a bit before he went out  so that he could squint under the deacon   s bed .       he   s probably in trouble  brutha thought as he hurried through the palace .  everyone wants to eat tortoises .   he tried to look everywhere while avoiding the friezes of unclad nymphs .   brutha was technically aware that women were a different shape from men  he hadn   t left the village until he was twelve  by which time some of his contemporaries were already married .  and omnianism encouraged early marriage as a preventive against sin  although any activity involving any part of the human anatomy between neck and knees was more or less sinful in any case .   brutha wished he was a better scholar so he could ask his god why this was .   then he found himself wishing his god was a more intelligent god so it could answer .   he hasn   t screamed for me  he thought .  i   m sure i would have heard .  so maybe no one   s cooking him .   a slave polishing one of the statues directed him to the library .  brutha pounded down an aisle of pillars .   when he reached the courtyard in front of the library it was crowded with philosophers  all craning to look at something .  brutha could hear the usual petulant squabbling that showed that philosophical discourse was under way .   in this case      i   ve got ten obols here says it can   t do it again .         talking money .  that   s something you don   t hear every day  xeno .         yeah .  and it   s about to say goodbye .         look  don   t be stupid .  it   s a tortoise .  it   s just doing a mating dance        there was a breathless pause .  then a sort of collective sigh .      there .         that   s never a right angle .         come on .  i   d like to see you do better in the circumstances .         what   s it doing now .         the hypotenuse  i think .         call that a hypotenuse .  it   s wiggly .         it   s not wiggly .  it   s drawing it straight and you   re looking at it in a wiggly way .         i   ll bet thirty obols it can   t do a square .         here   s forty obols says it can .      there was another pause  and then a cheer .      yeah .         that   s more of a parallelogram  if you ask me     said a petulant voice .      listen  i knows a square when i sees one .  and that   s a square .         all right .  double or nothing then .  bet it can   t do a dodecagon .         hah .  you bet it couldn   t do a septagon just now .           double or nothing .  dodecagon .  worried  eh .  feeling a bit avis domestica .  cluck cluck .         it   s a shame to take your money        there was another pause .      ten sides .  ten sides .  hah .         told you it wasn   t any good .  whoever heard of a tortoise doing geometry .         another daft idea  didactylos .         i said so all along .  it   s just a tortoise .         there   s good eating on one of those things        the mass of philosophers broke up  pushing past brutha without paying him much attention .  he caught a glimpse of a circle of damp sand  covered with geometrical figures .  om was sitting in the middle of them .  behind him was a very grubby pair of philosophers  counting out a pile of coins .      how did we do  urn .     said didactylos .      we   re fifty two obols up  master .         see .  every day things improve .  pity it didn   t know the difference between ten and twelve  though .  cut one of its legs off and we   ll have a stew .         cut off a leg .         well  a tortoise like that  you don   t eat it all at once .      didactylos turned his face towards a plump young man with splayed feet and a red face  who was staring at the tortoise .      yes .     he said .      the tortoise does know the difference between ten and twelve     said the fat boy .      damn thing just lost me eighty obols     said didactylos .      yes .  but tomorrow       the boy began  his eyes glazing as if he was carefully repeating something he   d just heard       tomorrow   you should be able to get odds of at least three to one .      didactylos   s mouth dropped open .      give me the tortoise  urn     he said .   the apprentice philosopher reached down and picked up om  very carefully .      you know  i thought right at the start there was something funny about this creature     said didactylos .     i said to urn  there   s tomorrow   s dinner  and then he says no  it   s dragging its tail in the sand and doing geometry .  that doesn   t come natural to a tortoise  geometry .      om   s eye turned to brutha .      i had to     he said .     it was the only way to get his attention .  now i   ve got him by the curiosity .  when you   ve got    em by the curiosity  their hearts and minds will follow .         he   s a god     said brutha .      really .  what   s his name .     said the philosopher .      don   t tell him .  don   t tell him .  the local gods   ll hear .         i don   t know     said brutha .   didactylos turned om over .      the turtle moves     said urn thoughtfully .      what .     said brutha .      master did a book     said urn .      not really a book     said didactylos modestly .     more a scroll .  just a little thing i knocked off .         saying that the world is flat and goes through space on the back of a giant turtle .     said brutha .      have you read it .     didactylos   s gaze was unmoving .     are you a slave .         no     said brutha .     i am a           don   t mention my name .  call yourself a scribe or something .              scribe     said brutha weakly .      yeah     said urn .     i can see that .  the telltale callus on the thumb where you hold the pen .  the inkstains all over your sleeves .      brutha glanced at his left thumb .     i haven   t           yeah     said urn  grinning .     use your left hand  do you .         er  i use both     said brutha .     but not very well  everyone says .         ah     said didactylos .     ambi sinister .         what .         he means incompetent with both hands     said om .      oh .  yes .  that   s me .     brutha coughed politely .     look   i   m looking for a philosopher .  um .  one that knows about gods .      he waited .   then he said     you aren   t going to say they   re a relic of an outmoded belief system .      didactylos  still running his fingers over om   s shell  shook his head .      nope .  i like my thunderstorms a long way off .         oh .  could you stop turning him over and over .  he   s just told me he doesn   t like it .         you can tell how old they are by cutting them in half and counting the rings     said didactylos .      um .  he hasn   t got much of a sense of humor  either .         you   re omnian  by the sound of it .         yes .         here to talk about the treaty .         i do the listening .         and what do you want to know about gods .      brutha appeared to be listening .   eventually he said     how they start .  how they grow .  and what happens to them afterwards .        didactylos put the tortoise into brutha   s hands .      costs money  that kind of thinking     he said .      let me know when we   ve used more than fifty two obols    worth     said brutha .  didactylos grinned .      looks like you can think for yourself     he said .     got a good memory .         no .  not exactly a good one .         right .  right .  come on into the library .  it   s got an earthed copper roof  you know .  gods really hate that sort of thing .      didactylos reached down beside him and picked up a rusty iron lantern .   brutha looked up at the big white building .      that   s the library .     he said .      yes     said didactylos .     that   s why it   s got librvm carved over the door in such big letters .  but a scribe like you   d know that  of course .          the library of ephebe was   before it burned down   the second biggest on the disc .   not as big as the library in unseen university  of course  but that library had one or two advantages on account of its magical nature .  no other library anywhere  for example  has a whole gallery of unwritten books   books that would have been written if the author hadn   t been eaten by an alligator around chapter    and so on .  atlases of imaginary places .  dictionaries of illusory words .  spotters    guides to invisible things .  wild thesauri in the lost reading room .  a library so big that it distorts reality and has opened gateways to all other libraries  everywhere and everywhen     and so unlike the library at ephebe  with its four or five hundred volumes .  many of them were scrolls  to save their readers the fatigue of having to call a slave every time they wanted a page turned .  each one lay in its own pigeonhole  though .  books shouldn   t be kept too close together  otherwise they interact in strange and unforeseeable ways .   sunbeams lanced through the shadows  as palpable as pillars in the dusty air .   although it was the least of the wonders in the library  brutha couldn   t help noticing a strange construction in the aisles .  wooden laths had been fixed between the rows of stone shelves about two meters from the floor  so that they supported a wider plank of no apparent use whatsoever .  its underside had been decorated with rough wooden shapes .      the library     announced didactylos .   he reached up .  his fingers gently brushed the plank over his head .   it dawned on brutha .      you   re blind aren   t you .     he said .      that   s right .         but you carry a lantern .         it   s all right     said didactylos .     i don   t put any oil in it .         a lantern that doesn   t shine for a man that doesn   t see .         yeah .  works perfectly .  and of course it   s very philosophical .         and you live in a barrel .         very fashionable  living in a barrel     said didactylos  walking forward briskly  his fingers only occasionally touching the raised patterns on the plank .     most of the philosophers do it .  it shows contempt and disdain for worldly things .  mind you  legibus has got a sauna in his .  it   s amazing the kind of things you can think of in it  he says .        brutha looked around .  scrolls protruded from their racks like cuckoos piping the hour .      it   s all so   i never met a philosopher before i came here     he said .     last night  they were all           you got to remember there   s three basic approaches to philosophy in these parts     said didactylos .     tell him  urn .         there   s the xenoists     said urn promptly .     they say the world is basically complex and random .  and there   s the ibidians .  they say the world is basically simple and follows certain fundamental rules .         and there   s me     said didactylos  pulling a scroll out of its rack .      master says basically it   s a funny old world     said urn .      and doesn   t contain enough to drink     said didactylos .      and doesn   t contain enough to drink .         gods     said didactylos  half to himself .  he pulled out another scroll .     you want to know about gods .  here   s xeno   s reflections  and old aristocrates    platitudes  and ibid   s bloody stupid discourses  and legibus   s geometries and hierarch   s theologies        didactylos   s fingers danced across the racks .  more dust filled the air .      these are all books .     said brutha .      oh  yes .  everyone writes    em here .  you just can   t stop the buggers .         and people can read them .     said brutha .   omnia was based on one book .  and here were   hundreds        well  they can if they want     said urn .     but no one comes in here much .  these aren   t books for reading .  they   re more for writing .           wisdom of the ages  this     said didactylos .     got to write a book  see  to prove you   re a philosopher .  then you get your scroll and free official philosopher   s loofah .      the sunlight pooled on a big stone table in the center of the room .  urn unrolled the length of a scroll .  brilliant flowers glowed in the golden light .      orinjcrates    on the nature of plants     said didactylos .     six hundred plants and their uses           they   re beautiful     whispered brutha .      yes  that is one of the uses of plants     said didactylos .     and one which old orinjcrates neglected to notice  too .  well done .  show him philo   s bestiary  urn .      another scroll unrolled .  there were dozens of pictures of animals  thousands of unreadable words .      but   pictures of animals   it   s wrong   isn   t it wrong to           pictures of just about everything in there     said didactylos .   art was not permitted in omnia .      and this is the book didactylos wrote     said urn .   brutha looked down at a picture of a turtle .  there were   elephants  they   re elephants  his memory supplied  from the fresh memories of the bestiary sinking indelibly into his mind   elephants on its back  and on them something with mountains and a waterfall of an ocean around its edge        how can this be .     said brutha .     a world on the back of a tortoise .  why does everyone tell me this .  this can   t be true .         tell that to the mariners     said didactylos .     everyone who   s ever sailed the rim ocean knows it .  why deny the obvious .         but surely the world is a perfect sphere  spinning about the sphere of the sun  just as the septateuch tells us     said brutha .     that seems so   logical .  that   s how things ought to be .         ought .     said didactylos .     well  i don   t know about ought .  that   s not a philosophical word .         and   what is this       brutha murmured  pointing to a circle under the drawing of the turtle .      that   s a plan view     said urn .      map of the world     said didactylos .      map .  what   s a map .         it   s a sort of picture that shows you where you are     said didactylos .   brutha stared in wonderment .     and how does it know .         hah .         gods     prompted om again .     we   re here to ask about gods .         but is all this true .     said brutha .   didactylos shrugged .     could be .  could be .  we are here and it is now .  the way i see it is  after that  everything tends towards guesswork .         you mean you don   t know it   s true .     said brutha .      i think it might be     said didactylos .     i could be wrong .  not being certain is what being a philosopher is all about .         talk about gods     said om .      gods     said brutha weakly .   his mind was on fire .  these people made all these books about things  and they weren   t sure .  but he   d been sure  and brother nhumrod had been sure  and deacon vorbis had a sureness you could bend horseshoes around .  sureness was a rock .   now he knew why  when vorbis spoke about ephebe  his face was gray with hatred and his voice was tense as a wire .  if there was no truth  what was there left .  and these bumbling old men spent their time kicking away the pillars of the world  and they   d nothing to replace them with but uncertainty .  and they were proud of this .   urn was standing on a small ladder  fishing among the shelves of scrolls .  didactylos sat opposite brutha  his blind gaze still apparently fixed on him .      you don   t like it  do you .     said the philosopher .   brutha had said nothing .      you know     said didactylos conversationally     people   ll tell you that us blind people are the real business where the other senses are concerned .  it   s not true  of course .  the buggers just say it because it makes them feel better .  it gets rid of the obligation to feel sorry for us .  but when you can   t see you do learn to listen more .  the way people breathe  the sounds their clothes make        urn reappeared with another scroll .      you shouldn   t do this     said brutha wretchedly .     all this       his voice trailed off .      i know about sureness     said didactylos .  now the light  irascible tone had drained out of his voice .     i remember  before i was blind  i went to omnia once .  this was before the borders were closed  when you still let people travel .  and in your citadel i saw a crowd stoning a man to death in a pit .  ever seen that .         it has to be done     brutha mumbled .     so the soul can be shriven and           don   t know about the soul .  never been that kind of a philosopher     said didactylos .     all i know is  it was a horrible sight .         the state of the body is not           oh  i   m not talking about the poor bugger in the pit     said the philosopher .     i   m talking about the people throwing the stones .  they were sure all right .  they were sure it wasn   t them in the pit .  you could see it in their faces .  so glad it wasn   t them that they were throwing just as hard as they could .      urn hovered  looking uncertain .      i   ve got abraxas   s on religion     he said .      old    charcoal    abraxas     said didactylos  suddenly cheerful again .     struck by lightning fifteen times so far  and still not giving up .  you can borrow this one overnight if you want .  no scribbling comments in the margins  mind you  unless they   re interesting .         this is it .     said om .     come on  let   s leave this idiot .      brutha unrolled the scroll .  there weren   t even any pictures .  crabbed writing filled it  line after line .      he spent years researching it     said didactylos .     went out into the desert  talked to the small gods .  talked to some of our gods  too .  brave man .  he says gods like to see an atheist around .  gives them something to aim at .      brutha unrolled a bit more of the scroll .  five minutes ago he would have admitted that he couldn   t read .  now the best efforts of the inquisitors couldn   t have forced it out of him .  he held it up in what he hoped was a familiar fashion .      where is he now .     he said .      well  someone said they saw a pair of sandals with smoke coming out just outside his house a year or two back     said didactylos .     he might have  you know  pushed his luck .         i think     said brutha     that i   d better be going .  i   m sorry to have intruded on your time .         bring it back when you   ve finished with it     said didactylos .      is that how people read in omnia .     said urn .      what .           upside down .      brutha picked up the tortoise  glared at urn  and strode as haughtily as possible out of the library .      hmm     said didactylos .  he drummed his fingers on the tables .      it was him i saw in the tavern last night     said urn .     i   m sure  master .         but the omnians are staying here in the palace .         that   s right  master .         but the tavern is outside .         yes .         then he must have flown over the wall  do you think .         i   m sure it was him  master .         then   maybe he came later .  maybe he hadn   t gone in when you saw him .         it can only be that  master .  the keepers of the labyrinth are unbribable .      didactylos clipped urn across the back of the head with his lantern .      stupid boy .  i   ve told you about that sort of statement .         i mean  they are not easily bribable  master .  not for all the gold in omnia  for example .         that   s more like it .         do you think that tortoise was a god  master .         he   s going to be in big trouble in omnia if he is .  they   ve got a bastard of a god there .  did you ever read old abraxas .         no  master .         very big on gods .  big gods man .  always smelled of burnt hair .  naturally resistant .          om crawled slowly along the length of a line .      stop walking up and down like that     he said     i can   t concentrate .         how can people talk like that .     brutha asked the empty air .     acting as if they   re glad they don   t know things .  finding out more and more things they don   t know .  it   s like children proudly coming to show you a full potty .      om marked his place with a claw .      but they find things out     he said .     this abraxas was a thinker and no mistake .  i didn   t know some of this stuff .  sit down .      brutha obeyed .      right     said om .     now   listen .  do you know how gods get power .         by people believing in them     said brutha .     millions of people believe in you .      om hesitated .   all right  all right .  we are here and it is now .  sooner or later he   ll find out for himself        they don   t believe     said om .      but           it   s happened before     said the tortoise .     dozens of times .  d   you know abraxas found the lost city of ee .  very strange carvings  he says .  belief  he says .  belief shifts .  people start out believing in the god and end up believing in the structure .         i don   t understand     said brutha .      let me put it another way     said the tortoise .     i am your god  right .         yes .         and you   ll obey me .         yes .         good .  now take a rock and go and kill vorbis .        brutha didn   t move .      i   m sure you heard me     said om .      but he   ll   he   s   the quisition would           now you know what i mean     said the tortoise .     you   re more afraid of him than you are of me  now .  abraxas says here     around the godde there forms a shelle of prayers and ceremonies and buildings and priestes and authority  until at last the godde dies .  ande this maye notte be noticed .            that can   t be true .         i think it is .  abraxas says there   s a kind of shellfish that lives in the same way .  it makes a bigger and bigger shell until it can   t move around any more  and so it dies .         but   but   that means   the whole church           yes .      brutha tried to keep hold of the idea  but the sheer enormity of it kept wrenching it from his mental grasp .      but you   re not dead     he managed .      next best thing     said om .     and you know what .  no other small god is trying to usurp me .  did i ever tell you about old ur gilash .  no .  he was the god back in what   s now omnia before me .  not much of one .  basically a weather god .  or a snake god .  something  anyway .  it took years to get rid of him  though .  wars and everything .  so i   ve been thinking        brutha said nothing .      om still exists     said the tortoise .     i mean the shell .  all you   d have to do is get people to understand .      brutha still said nothing .      you can be the next prophet     said om .      i can   t .  everyone knows vorbis will be the next prophet .         ah  but you   ll be official .           no .         no .  i am your god .         and i am my me .  i   m not a prophet .  i can   t even write .  i can   t read .  no one will listen to me .      om looked him up and down .      i must admit you   re not the chosen one i would have chosen     he said .      the great prophets had vision     said brutha .     even if they   even if you didn   t talk to them  they had something to say .  what could i say .  i haven   t got anything to say to anyone .  what could i say .         believe in the great god om     said the tortoise .      and then what .         what do you mean  and then what .      brutha looked out glumly at the darkening courtyard .      believe in the great god om or be stricken with thunderbolts     he said .      sounds good to me .         is that how it always has to be .      the last rays of the sun glinted off the statue in the center of the courtyard .  it was vaguely feminine .  there was a penguin perched on one shoulder .      patina  goddess of wisdom     said brutha .     the one with a penguin .  why a penguin .         can   t imagine     said om hurriedly .      nothing wise about penguins  is there .         shouldn   t think so .  unless you count the fact that you don   t get them in omnia .  pretty wise of them .         brutha .         that   s vorbis     said brutha  standing up .     shall i leave you here .         yes .  there   s still some melon .  i mean loaf .      brutha wandered out into the dusk .     vorbis was sitting on a bench under a tree  as still as a statue in the shadows .   certainty  brutha thought .  i used to be certain .  now i   m not so sure .      ah  brutha .  you will accompany me on a little stroll .  we will take the evening air .         yes  lord .         you have enjoyed your visit to ephebe .      vorbis seldom asked a question if a statement would do .      it has been   interesting .      vorbis put one hand on brutha   s shoulder and used the other to haul himself up on his staff .      and what do you think of it .     he asked .      they have many gods  and they don   t pay them much attention     said brutha .     and they search for ignorance .         and they find it in abundance  be sure of that     said vorbis .   he pointed his staff into the night .     let us walk     he said .   there was the sound of laughter  somewhere in the darkness  and the clatter of pans .  the scent of evening opening flowers hung thickly in the air .  the stored heat of daytime radiating from the stones  made the night seem like a fragrant soup .      ephebe looks to the sea     said vorbis after a while .     you see the way it is built .  all on the slope of a hill facing the sea .  but the sea is mutable .  nothing lasting comes from the sea .  whereas our dear citadel looks towards the high desert .  and what do we see there .      instinctively brutha turned  and looked over the rooftops to the black bulk of the desert against the sky .      i saw a flash of light     he said .     and again .  on the slope .           ah .  the light of truth     said vorbis .     so let us go forth to meet it .  take me to the entrance to the labyrinth  brutha .  you know the way .         my lord .     said brutha .      yes  brutha .         i would like to ask you a question .         do so .         what happened to brother murduck .      there was the merest suggestion of hesitation in the rhythm of vorbis   s stick on the cobbles .  then the exquisitor said     truth  good brutha  is like the light .  do you know about light .         it   comes from the sun .  and the moon and stars .  and candles .  and lamps .         and so on     said vorbis  nodding .     of course .  but there is another kind of light .  a light that fills even the darkest of places .  this has to be .  for if this meta light did not exist  how could darkness be seen .      brutha said nothing .  this sounded too much like philosophy .      and so it is with truth     said vorbis .     there are some things which appear to be the truth  which have all the hallmarks of truth  but which are not the real truth .  the real truth must sometimes be protected by a labyrinth of lies .      he turned to brutha .     do you understand me .         no  lord vorbis .         i mean  that which appears to our senses is not the fundamental truth .  things that are seen and heard and done by the flesh are mere shadows of a deeper reality .  this is what you must understand as you progress in the church .         but at the moment  lord  i know only the trivial truth  the truth available on the outside     said brutha .  he felt as though he was at the edge of a pit .      that is how we all begin     said vorbis kindly .      so did the ephebians kill brother murduck .     brutha persisted .  now he was inching out over the darkness .      i am telling you that in the deepest sense of the truth they did .  by their failure to embrace his words  by their intransigence  they surely killed him .         but in the trivial sense of the truth     said brutha  picking every word with the care an inquisitor might give to his patient in the depths of the citadel     in the trivial sense  brother murduck died  did he not  in omnia  because he had not died in ephebe  had been merely mocked  but it was feared that others in the church might not understand the  the deeper truth  and thus it was put about that the ephebians had killed him in  in the trivial sense  thus giving you  and those who saw the truth of the evil of ephebe  due cause to launch a   a just retaliation .      they walked past a fountain .  the deacon   s steel shod staff clicked in the night .      i see a great future for you in the church     said vorbis  eventually .     the time of the eighth prophet is coming .  a time of expansion  and great opportunity for those true in the service of om .      brutha looked into the pit .   if vorbis was right  and there was a kind of light that made darkness visible  then down there was its opposite  the darkness where no light could ever reach  darkness that blackened light .  he thought of blind didactylos and his empty lantern .   he heard himself say     and with people like the ephebians  there is no truce .  no treaty can be held binding  if it is between people like the ephebians and those who follow a deeper truth .      vorbis nodded .     when the great god is with us     he said     who can stand against us .  you impress me  brutha .      there was more laughter in the darkness  and the twang of stringed instruments .      a feast     sneered vorbis .     the tyrant invited us to a feast .  i sent some of the party  of course .  even their generals are in there .  they think themselves safe behind their labyrinth  as a tortoise thinks himself safe in his shell  not realizing it is a prison .  onward .      the inner wall of the labyrinth loomed out of the darkness .  brutha leaned against it .  from far above came the chink of metal on metal as a sentry went on his rounds .   the gateway to the labyrinth was wide open .  the ephebians had never seen the point of stopping people entering .  up a short side tunnel the guide for the first sixth of the way slumbered on a bench  a candle guttering beside him .  above his alcove hung the bronze bell that would be traversers of the maze used to summon him .  brutha slipped past .      brutha .         yes  lord .         lead the way through the labyrinth .  i know you can .         lord           this is an order  brutha     said vorbis  pleasantly .   there is no hope for it  brutha thought .  it is an order .      then tread where i tread  lord     he whispered .     not more than one step behind me .         yes  brutha .         if i step around a place on the floor for no reason  you step around it too .           yes  brutha .      brutha thought  perhaps i could do it wrong .  no .  i took vows and things .  you can   t just disobey .  the whole world ends if you start thinking like that     he let his sleeping mind take control .  the way through the labyrinth unrolled in his head like a glowing wire .      diagonally forward and right three and a half paces  and left sixty three paces  pause two seconds   where a steely swish in the darkness suggested that one of the guardians had devised something that won him a prize   and up three steps     i could run forward  he thought .  i could hide  and he   d walk into one of the pits or a deadfall or something  and then i could sneak back to my room and who would ever know .   i would .      forward nine paces  and right one pace  and forward nineteen paces  and left two paces     there was a light ahead .  not the occasional white glow of moonlight from the slits in the roof  but yellow lamplight  dimming and brightening as its owner came nearer .      someone   s coming     he whispered .     it must be one of the guides .      vorbis had vanished .   brutha hovered uncertainly in the passageway as the light bobbed nearer .   an elderly voice said     that you  number four .      the light came around a corner .  it half illuminated an old man  who walked up to brutha and raised the candle to his face .      where   s number four .     he said  peering around brutha .     a figure appeared behind the man  from out of a side passage .  brutha had the briefest glimpse of vorbis  his face strangely peaceful  as he gripped the head of his staff  twisted and pulled .  sharp metal glittered for a moment in the candlelight .   then the light went out .   vorbis   s voice said     take the lead again .      trembling  brutha obeyed .  he felt the soft flesh of an outflung arm under his sandal for a moment .   the pit  he thought .  look into vorbis   s eyes  and there   s the pit .  and i   m in it with him .   i   ve got to remember about fundamental truth .   no more guides were patrolling the labyrinth .  after a mere million years  the night air blew cool on his face  and brutha stepped out under the stars .      well done .  can you remember the way to the gate .         yes  lord vorbis .      the deacon pulled his hood over his face .      carry on .      there were a few torches lighting the streets  but ephebe was not a city that stayed awake in darkness .  a couple of passersby paid them no attention .      they guard their harbor     said vorbis  conversational .     but the way to the desert   everyone knows that no one can cross the desert .  i am sure you know that  brutha .         but now i suspect that what i know is not the truth     said brutha .      quite so .  ah .  the gate .  i believe it had two guards yesterday .         i saw two .         and now it is night and the gate is shut .  but there will be a watchman .  wait here .      vorbis disappeared into the gloom .  after a while there was a muffled conversation .  brutha stared straight ahead of him .   the conversation was followed by muffled silence .  after a while brutha started to count to himself .   after ten  i   ll go back .   another ten  then .   all right .  make it thirty .  and then i   ll        ah  brutha .  let us go .      brutha swallowed his heart again  and turned slowly .      i did not hear you  lord     he managed .      i walk softly .         is there a watchman .         not now .  come help me with the bolts .      a small wicket gate was set into the main gate .  brutha  his mind numb with hatred  shoved the bolts aside with the heel of his hand .  the door opened with barely a creak .   outside there was the occasional light of a distant farm  and crowding darkness .   then the darkness poured in .       hierarchy  vorbis said later .  the ephebians didn   t think in terms of hierarchies .   no army could cross the desert .  but maybe a small army could get a quarter of the way  and leave a cache of water .  and do that several times .  and another small army could use part of that cache to go further  maybe reach halfway  and leave a cache .  and another small army     it had taken months .  a third of the men had died  of heat and dehydration and wild animals and worse things  the worse things that the desert held     you had to have a mind like vorbis   s to plan it .   and plan it early .  men were already dying in the desert before brother murduck went to preach  there was already a beaten track when the omnian fleet burned in the bay before ephebe .   you had to have a mind like vorbis   s to plan your retaliation before your attack .       it was over in less than an hour .  the fundamental truth was that the handful of ephebian guards in the palace had no chance at all .       vorbis sat upright in the tyrant   s chair .  it was approaching midnight .   a collection of ephebian citizens  the tyrant among them  had been herded in front of him .   he busied himself with some paperwork and then looked up with an air of mild surprise  as if he   d been completely unaware that fifty people were waiting in front of him at crossbow point .      ah     he said  and flashed a little smile .      well     he said     i am pleased to say that we can now dispense with the peace treaty .  quite unnecessary .  why prattle of peace when there is no more war .  ephebe is now a diocese of omnia .  there will be no argument .      he threw a paper on to the floor .      there will be a fleet here in a few days .  there will be no opposition  while we hold the palace .  your infernal mirror is even now being smashed .      he steepled his fingers and looked at the assembled ephebians .      who built it .      the tyrant looked up .      it was an ephebian construction     he said .      ah     said vorbis     democracy .  i forgot .  then who      he signaled one of the guards  who handed him a sack      wrote this .      a copy of de chelonian mobile was flung on to the marble floor .   brutha stood beside the throne .  it was where he had been told to stand .   he   d looked into the pit and now it was him .  everything around him was happening in some distant circle of light  surrounded by darkness .  thoughts chased one another around his head .   did the cenobiarch know about this .  did anyone else know about the two kinds of truth .  who else knew that vorbis was fighting both sides of a war  like a child playing with soldiers .  was it really wrong if it was for the greater glory of        a god who was a tortoise .  a god that only brutha believed in .   who did vorbis talk to when he prayed .   through the mental storm brutha heard vorbis   s level tones     if the philosopher who wrote this does not own up  the entirety of you will be put to the flame .  do not doubt that i mean it .      there was a movement in the crowd  and the sound of didactylos   s voice .      let go .  you heard him .  anyway   i always wanted a chance to do this        a couple of servants were pushed aside and the philosopher stumped out of the crowd  his barren lantern held defiantly over his head .   brutha watched the philosopher pause for a moment in the empty space  and then turn very slowly until he was directly facing vorbis .  he took a few steps forward then  and held the lantern out as he appeared to regard the deacon critically .        hmm     he said .      you are the   perpetrator .     said vorbis .      indeed .  didactylos is my name .         you are blind .         only as far as vision is concerned  my lord .         yet you carry a lantern     said vorbis .     doubtless for some catchword reason .  probably you   ll tell me you   re looking for an honest man .         i don   t know  my lord .  perhaps you could tell me what he looks like .         i should strike you down now     said vorbis .      oh  certainly .      vorbis indicated the book .          these lies .  this scandal .  this   this lure to drag the minds of men from the path of true knowledge .  you dare to stand before me and declare      he pushed the book with a toe      that the world is flat and travels through the void on the back of a giant turtle .      brutha held his breath .   so did history .   affirm your belief  brutha thought .  just once  someone please stand up to vorbis .  i can   t .  but someone     he found his eyes swiveling toward simony  who stood on the other side of vorbis   s chair .  the sergeant looked transfixed  fascinated .   didactylos drew himself up to his full height .  he half turned and for a moment his blank gaze passed across brutha .  the lantern was extended at arm   s length .      no     he said .      when every honest man knows that the world is a sphere  a perfect shape  bound to spin around the sphere of the sun as man orbits the central truth of om     said vorbis     and the stars        brutha leaned forward  heart pounding .        my lord .     he whispered .      what .     snapped vorbis .      he said    no        said brutha .      that   s right     said didactylos .   vorbis sat absolutely motionless for a moment .  then his jaw moved a fraction  as if he was rehearsing some words under his breath .      you deny it .     he said .      let it be a sphere     said didactylos .     no problem with a sphere .  no doubt special arrangements are made for everything to stay on .  and the sun can be another larger sphere  a long way off .  would you like the moon to orbit the world or the sun .  i advise the world .  more hierarchical  and a splendid example to us all .      brutha was seeing something he   d never seen before .  vorbis was looking bewildered .      but you wrote   you said the world is on the back of a giant turtle .  you gave the turtle a name .      didactylos shrugged .     now i know better     he said .     who ever heard of a turtle ten thousand miles long .  swimming through the emptiness of space .  hah .  for stupidity .  i am embarrassed to think of it now .      vorbis shut his mouth .  then he opened it again .      this is how an ephebian philosopher behaves .     he said .   didactylos shrugged again .     it is how any true philosopher behaves     he said .     one must always be ready to embrace new ideas  take account of new proofs .  don   t you agree .  and you have brought us many new points      a gesture seemed to take in  quite by accident  the omnian bowmen around the room      for me to ponder .  i can always be swayed by powerful argument .         your lies have already poisoned the world .         then i shall write another book     said didactylos calmly .     think how it will look   proud didactylos swayed by the arguments of the omnians .  a full retraction .  hmm .  in fact  with your permission  lord   i know you have much to do  looting and burning and so on   i will retire to my barrel right away and start work on it .  a universe of spheres .  balls spinning through space .  hmm .  yes .  with your permission  lord  i will write you more balls than you can imagine        the old philosopher turned and  very slowly  walked towards the exit .   vorbis watched him go .   brutha saw him half raise his hand to signal the guards  and then lower it again .   vorbis turned to the tyrant .      so much for your       he began .      coo ee .      the lantern sailed through the doorway and shattered against vorbis   s skull .      nevertheless   the turtle moves .      vorbis leapt to his feet .      i       he screamed  and then got a grip on himself .  he waved irritably at a couple of the guards .     i want him caught .  now .  and   brutha .      brutha could hardly hear him for the rush of blood in his ears .  didactylos had been a better thinker than he   d thought .      yes  lord .         you will take a party of men  and you will take them to the library   and then  brutha  you will burn the library .          didactylos was blind  but it was dark .  the pursuing guards could see  except that there was nothing to see by .  and they hadn   t spent their lives wandering the twisty  uneven and above all many stepped lanes of ephebe .         eight  nine  ten  eleven     muttered the philosopher  bounding up a pitch dark flight of steps and haring around a corner .      argh  ow  that was my knee     muttered most of the guards  in a heap about halfway up .   one made it to the top  though .  by starlight he could just make out the skinny figure  bounding madly along the street .  he raised his crossbow .  the old fool wasn   t even dodging     a perfect target .   there was a twang .   the guard looked puzzled for a moment .  the bow toppled from his hands  firing itself as it hit the cobbles and sending its bolt ricocheting off a statue .  he looked down at the feathered shaft sticking out of his chest  and then at the figure detaching itself from the shadows .      sergeant simony .     he whispered .      i   m sorry     said simony .     i really am .  but the truth is important .      the soldier opened his mouth to give his opinion of the truth and then slumped forward .   he opened his eyes .   simony was walking away .  everything looked lighter .  it was still dark .  but now he could see in the darkness .  everything was shades of gray .  and the cobbles under his hand had somehow become a coarse black sand .   he looked up .   on your feet  private ichlos .   he stood up sheepishly .  now he was more than just a soldier  an anonymous figure to chase and be killed and be no more than a shadowy bit player in other people   s lives .  now he was dervi ichlos  aged thirty eight  comparatively blameless in the general scheme of things  and dead .   he raised a hand to his lips uncertainly .      you   re the judge .     he said .   not me .   ichlos looked at the sands stretching away .  he knew instinctively what he had to do .  he was far less sophisticated than general fri   it  and took more notice of songs he   d learned in his childhood .  besides  he had an advantage .  he   d had even less religion than the general .   judgment is at the end of the desert .   ichlos tried to smile .      my mum told me about this     he said .     when you   re dead  you have to walk a desert .  and you see everything properly  she said .  and remember everything right .      death studiously did nothing to indicate his feelings either way .      might meet a few friends on the way  eh .     said the soldier .   possibly .   ichlos set out .  on the whole  he thought  it could have been worse .       urn clambered across the shelves like a monkey  pulling books out of their racks and throwing them down to the floor .      i can carry about twenty     he said .     but which twenty .         always wanted to do that     murmured didactylos happily .     upholding truth in the face of tyranny and so on .  hah .  one man  unafraid of the           what to take .  what to take .     shouted urn .      we don   t need grido   s mechanics     said didactylos .     hey  i wish i could have seen the look on his face .  damn good shot  considering .  i just hope someone wrote down what i           principles of gearing .  theory of water expansion .     shouted urn .     but we don   t need ibid   s civics or gnomon   s ectopia  that   s for sure           what .  they belong to all mankind .     snapped didactylos .      then if all mankind will come and help us carry them  that   s fine     said urn .     but if it   s just the two of us  i prefer to carry something useful .         useful .  books on mechanisms .         yes .  they can show people how to live better .         and these show people how to be people     said didactylos .     which reminds me .  find me another lantern .  i feel quite blind without one        the library door shook to a thunderous knocking .  it wasn   t the knocking of people who expected the door to be opened .      we could throw some of the others into the        the hinges leapt out of the walls .  the door thudded down .   soldiers scrambled over it  swords drawn .      ah  gentlemen     said didactylos .     pray don   t disturb my circles .      the corporal in charge looked at him blankly  and then down at the floor .      what circles .     he said .      hey  how about giving me a pair of compasses and coming back in  say  half an hour .         leave him  corporal     said brutha .   he stepped over the door .      i said leave him .         but i got orders to           are you deaf .  if you are  the quisition can cure that     said brutha  astonished at the steadiness of his own voice .      you don   t belong to the quisition     said the corporal .      no .  but i know a man who does     said brutha .     you are to search the palace for books .  leave him with me .  he   s an old man .  what harm can he do .      the corporal looked hesitantly from brutha to his prisoners .      very good  corporal .  i will take over .      they all turned .      did you hear me .     said sergeant simony  pushing his way forward .      but the deacon told us           corporal .         yes  sergeant .         the deacon is far away .  i am right here .         yes  sergeant .         go .         yes  sergeant .      simony cocked an ear as the soldiers marched away .   then he stuck his sword in the door and turned to didactylos .  he made a fist with his left hand and brought his right hand down on it  palm extended .      the turtle moves     he said .      that all depends     said the philosopher  cautiously .      i mean i am   a friend     he said .      why should we trust you .     said urn .      because you haven   t got any choice     said sergeant simony briskly .      can you get us out of here .     said brutha .   simony glared at him .     you .     he said .     why should i get you out of here .  you   re an inquisitor .     he grasped his sword .     brutha backed away .      i   m not .         on the ship  when the captain sounded you  you just said nothing     said simony .     you   re not one of us .         i don   t think i   m one of them  either     said brutha .     i   m one of mine .      he gave didactylos an imploring look  which was a wasted effort  and turned it towards urn instead .      i don   t know about this soldier     he said .     all i know is that vorbis means to have you killed and he will burn your library .  but i can help .  i worked it out on the way here .         and don   t listen to him     said simony .  he dropped on one knee in front of didactylos  like a supplicant .     sir  there are   some of us   who know your book for what it is   see  i have a copy        he fumbled inside his breastplate .      we copied it out     said simony .     one copy .  that   s all we had .  but it   s been passed around .  some of us who could read  read it to the others .  it makes so much sense .         er       said didactylos .     what .      simony waved his hands in excitement .     because we know it   i   ve been to places that   it   s true .  there is a great turtle .  the turtle does move .  we don   t need gods .         urn .  no one   s stripped the copper off the roof  have they .     said didactylos .      don   t think so .         remind me not to talk to this chap outside  then .         you don   t understand .     said simony .     i can save you .  you have friends in unexpected places .  come on .  i   ll just kill this priest          he gripped his sword .  brutha backed away .      no .  i can help  too .  that   s why i came .  when i saw you in front of vorbis i knew what i could do .         what can you do .     sneered urn .      i can save the library .         what .  put it on your back and run away .     sneered simony .      no .  i don   t mean that .  how many scrolls are there .         about seven hundred     said didactylos .      how many of them are important .         all of them .     said urn .      maybe a couple of hundred     said didactylos  mildly .      uncle .         all the rest is just wind and vanity publishing     said didactylos .      but they   re books .         i may be able to take more than that     said brutha slowly .     is there a way out .         there   could be     said didactylos .      don   t tell him .     said simony .      then all your books will burn     said brutha .  he pointed to simony .     he said you haven   t got a choice .  so you haven   t got anything to lose  have you .         he   s a       simony began .      everyone shut up     said didactylos .  he stared past brutha   s ear .      there may be a way out     he said .     what do you intend .         i don   t believe this .     said urn .     there   s omnians here and you   re telling them there   s another way out .         there   s tunnels all through this rock     said didactylos .      maybe  but we don   t tell people .           i   m inclined to trust this person     said didactylos .     he   s got an honest face .  speaking philosophically .         why should we trust him .         anyone stupid enough to expect us to trust him in these circumstances must be trustworthy     said didactylos .     he   d be too stupid to be deceitful .         i can walk out of here right now     said brutha .     and where will your library be then .         you see .     said simony .      just when things apparently look dark  suddenly we have unexpected friends everywhere     said didactylos .     what is your plan  young man .         i haven   t got one     said brutha .     i just do things  one after the other .         and how long will doing things one after another take you .         about ten minutes  i think .      simony glared at brutha .      now get the books     said brutha .     and i shall need some light .         but you can   t even read .     said urn .      i   m not going to read them .     brutha looked blankly at the first scroll  which happened to be de chelonian mobile .      oh .  my god     he said .      something wrong .     said didactylos .      could someone fetch my tortoise .          simony trotted through the palace .  no one was paying him much attention .  most of the ephebian guard was outside the labyrinth  and vorbis had made it clear to anyone who was thinking of venturing inside just what would happen to the palace   s inhabitants .  groups of omnian soldiers were looting in a disciplined sort of way .     besides  he was returning to his quarters .   there was a tortoise in brutha   s room .  it was sitting on the table  between a rolled up scroll and a gnawed melon rind and  insofar as it was possible to tell with tortoises  was asleep .  simony grabbed it without ceremony  rammed it into his pack  and hurried back towards the library .   he hated himself for doing it .  the stupid priest had ruined everything .  but didactylos had made him promise  and didactylos was the man who knew the truth .   all the way there he had the impression that someone was trying to attract his attention .          you can remember them just by looking .     said urn .      yes .         the whole scroll .         yes .         i don   t believe you .         the word librvm outside this building has a chip in the top of the first letter     said brutha .     xeno wrote reflections  and old aristocrates wrote platitudes  and didactylos thinks ibid   s discourses are bloody stupid .  there are six hundred paces from the tyrant   s throne room to the library .  there is a           he   s got a good memory  you   ve got to grant him that     said didactylos .     show him some more scrolls .         how will we know he   s remembered them .     urn demanded  unrolling a scroll of geometrical theorems .     he can   t read .  and even if he could read  he can   t write .         we shall have to teach him .      brutha looked at a scroll full of maps .  he shut his eyes .  for a moment the jagged outline glowed against the inside of his eyelids  and then he felt them settle into his mind .  they were still there somewhere   he could bring them back at any time .  urn unrolled another scroll .  pictures of animals .  this one  drawings of plants and lots of writing .  this one  just writing .  this one  triangles and things .  they settled down in his memory .  after a while  he wasn   t even aware of the scroll unrolling .  he just had to keep looking .   he wondered how much he could remember  but that was stupid .  you just remembered everything you saw .  a tabletop  or a scroll full of writing .  there was as much information in the grain and coloring of the wood as there was in xeno   s reflections .   even so  he was conscious of a certain heaviness of mind  a feeling that if he turned his head sharply then memory would slosh out of his ears .   urn picked up a scroll at random and unrolled it part way .      describe what an ambiguous puzuma looks like     he demanded .      don   t know     said brutha .  he blinked .      so much for mr .  memory     said urn .      he can   t read  boy .  that   s not fair     said the philosopher .      all right .  i mean   the fourth picture in the third scroll you saw     said urn .      a four legged creature facing left     said brutha .     a large head similar to a cat   s and broad shoulders with the body tapering towards the hindquarters .  the body is a pattern of dark and light squares .  the ears are very small and laid flat against the head .  there are six whiskers .  the tail is stubby .  only the hind feet are clawed  three claws on each foot .  the fore feet are about the same length as the head and held up against the body .  a band of thick hair             that was fifty scrolls ago     said urn .     he saw the whole scroll for a second or two .      they looked at brutha .  brutha blinked again .      you know everything .     said urn .      i don   t know .         you   ve got half the library in your head .         i feel   a   bit            the library of ephebe was a furnace .  the flames burned blue where the melted copper roof dripped on to the shelves .   all libraries  everywhere  are connected by the bookworm holes in space created by the strong space time distortions found around any large collections of books .   only a very few librarians learn the secret  and there are inflexible rules about making use of the fact .  because it amounts to time travel  and time travel causes big problems .   but if a library is on fire  and down in the history books as having been on fire     there was a small pop  utterly unheard among the crackling of the bookshelves  and a figure dropped out of nowhere on to a small patch of unburned floor in the middle of the library .   it looked ape like  but it moved in a very purposeful way .  long simian arms beat out the flames  pulled scrolls off the shelves  and stuffed them into a sack .  when the sack was full  it knuckled back into the middle of the room   and vanished  with another pop .   this has nothing to do with the story .   nor does the fact that  some time later  scrolls thought to have been destroyed in the great ephebian library fire turned up in remarkably good condition in the library of unseen university in ankh morpork .   but it   s nice to know  even so .       brutha awoke with the smell of the sea in his nostrils .   at least it was what people think of as the smell of the sea  which is the stink of antique fish and rotten seaweed .   he was in some sort of shed .  such light as managed to come through its one unglazed window was red  and flickered .  one end of the shed was open to the water .  the ruddy light showed a few figures clustered around something there .   brutha gently probed the contents of his memory .  everything seemed to be there  the library scrolls neatly arranged .  the words were as meaningless to him as any other written word  but the pictures were interesting .  more interesting than most things in his memory  anyway .   he sat up  carefully .      you   re awake  then     said the voice of om  in his head .     feel a bit full  do we .  feel a bit like a stack of shelves .  feel like we   ve got big notices saying    silencios .     all over the place inside our head .  what did you go and do that for .         i   don   t know .  it seemed like   the next thing to do .  where are you .         your soldier friend has got me in his pack .  thanks for looking after me so carefully  by the way .      brutha managed to get to his feet .  the world revolved around him for a moment  adding a third astronomical theory to the two currently occupying the minds of local thinkers .   he peered out of the window .  the red light was coming from fires all over ephebe  but there was one huge glow over the library .      guerrilla activity     said om .     even the slaves are fighting .  can   t understand why .  you think they   d jump at the chance to be revenged on their masters  eh .         i suppose a slave in ephebe has the chance to be free     said brutha .   there was a hiss from the other end of the shed  and a metallic  whirring noise .  brutha heard urn say     there .  i told you .  just a block in the tubes .  lets get some more fuel in .      brutha tottered towards the group .   they were clustered around a boat .  as boats went  it was of normal shape   a pointed end in front  a flat end at the back .  but there was no mast .  what there was  was a large  copper colored ball  hanging in a wooden framework toward the back of the boat .  there was an iron basket underneath it  in which someone had already got a good fire going .   and the ball was spinning in its frame  in a cloud of steam .      i   ve seen that     he said .     in de chelonian mobile .  there was a drawing .         oh  it   s the walking library     said didactylos .     yes .  you   re right .  illustrating the principle of reaction .  i never asked urn to build a big one .  this is what comes of thinking with your hands .         i took it around the lighthouse one night last week     said urn .     no problems at all .         ankh morpork is a lot further than that     said simony .      yes  it is five times further than the distance between ephebe and omnia     said brutha solemnly .     there was a scroll of maps     he added .     steam rose in scalding clouds from the whirring ball .  now he was closer  brutha could see that half a dozen very short oars had been joined together in a star shaped pattern behind the copper globe  and hung over the rear of the boat .  wooden cogwheels and a couple of endless belts filled the intervening space .  as the globe spun  the paddles thrashed at the air .      how does it work .     he said .      very simple     said urn .     the fire makes           we haven   t got time for this     said simony .         makes the water hot and so it gets angry     said the apprentice philosopher .     so it rushes out of the globe through these four little nozzles to get away from the fire .  the plumes of steam push the globe around  and the cogwheels and legibus   s screw mechanism transfer the motion to the paddles which turn  pushing the boat through the water .         very philosophical     said didactylos .   brutha felt that he ought to stand up for omnian progress .      the great doors of the citadel weigh tons but are opened solely by the power of faith     he said .     one push and they swing open .         i should very much like to see that     said urn .   brutha felt a faint sinful twinge of pride that omnia still had anything he could be proud of .      very good balance and some hydraulics  probably .         oh .      simony thoughtfully prodded the mechanism with his sword .      have you thought of all the possibilities .     he said .   urn   s hands began to weave through the air .     you mean mighty ships plowing the wine dark sea with no       he began .        on land  i was thinking     said simony .     perhaps   on some sort of cart           oh  no point in putting a boat on a cart .      simony   s eyes gleamed with the gleam of a man who had seen the future and found it covered with armor plating .      hmm     he said .      it   s all very well  but it   s not philosophy     said didactylos .      where   s the priest .         i   m here  but i   m not a           how   re you feeling .  you went out like a candle back there .         i   m   better now .         one minute upright  next minute a draft excluder .         i   m much better .         happen a lot  does it .         sometimes .         remembering the scrolls okay .         i   think so .  who set fire to the library .      urn looked up from the mechanism .      he did     he said .   brutha stared at didactylos .      you set fire to your own library .         i   m the only one qualified     said the philosopher .     besides  it keeps it out of the way of vorbis .         what .         suppose he   d read the scrolls .  he   s bad enough as it is .  he   d be a lot worse with all that knowledge inside him .         he wouldn   t have read them     said brutha .      oh  he would .  i know that type     said didactylos .     all holy piety in public  and all peeled grapes and self indulgence in private .           not vorbis     said brutha  with absolute certainty .     he wouldn   t have read them .         well  anyway     said didactylos     if it had to be done  i did it .      urn turned away from the bow of the boat  where he was feeding more wood into the brazier under the globe .      can we all get on board .     he said .   brutha eased his way on a rough bench seat amid ships  or whatever it was called .  the air smelled of hot water .      right     said urn .  he pulled a lever .  the spinning paddles hit the water  there was a jerk and then  steam hanging in the air behind it  the boat moved forward .      what   s the name of this vessel .     said didactylos .   urn looked surprised .      name .     he said .     it   s a boat .  a thing  of the nature of things .  it doesn   t need a name .         names are more philosophical     said didactylos  with a trace of sulkiness .     and you should have broken an amphora of wine over it .         that would have been a waste .      the boat chugged out of the boathouse and into the dark harbor .  away to one side  an ephebian galley was on fire .  the whole of the city was a patchwork of flame .      but you   ve got an amphora on board .     said didactylos .      yes .         pass it over  then .      white water trailed behind the boat .  the paddles churned .      no wind .  no rowers .     said simony .     do you even begin to understand what you have here  urn .           absolutely .  the operating principles are amazingly simple     said urn .      that wasn   t what i meant .  i meant the things you could do with this power .      urn pushed another log on the fire .      it   s just the transforming of heat into work     he said .     i suppose   oh  the pumping of water .  mills that can grind even when the wind isn   t blowing .  that sort of thing .  is that what you had in mind .      simony the soldier hesitated .      yeah     he said .     something like that .      brutha whispered     om .         yes .         are you all right .         it smells like a soldier   s knapsack in here .  get me out .      the copper ball spun madly over the fire .  it gleamed almost as brightly as simony   s eyes .   brutha tapped him on the shoulder .      can i have my tortoise .      simony laughed bitterly .      there   s good eating on one of these things     he said  fishing out om .      everyone says so     said brutha .  he lowered his voice to a whisper .      what sort of place is ankh .         a city of a million souls     said the voice of om     many of them occupying bodies .  and a thousand religions .  there   s even a temple to the small gods .  sounds like a place where people don   t have trouble believing things .  not a bad place for a fresh start  i think .  with my brains and your   with my brains  we should soon be in business again .         you don   t want to go back to omnia .           no point     said the voice of om .     it   s always possible to overthrow an established god .  people get fed up  they want a change .  but you can   t overthrow yourself  can you .         who   re you talking to  priest .     said simony .      i   er   was praying .         hah .  to om .  you might as well pray to that tortoise .         yes .         i am ashamed for omnia     said simony .     look at us .  stuck in the past .  held back by repressive monotheism .  shunned by our neighbors .  what good has our god been to us .  gods .  hah .         steady on  steady on     said didactylos .     we   re on seawater and that   s highly conductive armor you   re wearing .         oh  i say nothing about other gods     said simony quickly .     i have not the right .  but om .  a bogeyman for the quisition .  if he exists  let him strike me down here and now .      simony drew his sword and held it up at arm   s length .   om sat peacefully on brutha   s lap .     i like this boy     he said .     he   s almost as good as a believer .  it   s like love and hate  know what i mean .      simony sheathed his sword again .      thus i refute om     he said .      yes  but what   s the alternative .         philosophy .  practical philosophy .  like urn   s engine there .  it could drag omnia kicking and screaming into the century of the fruitbat .         kicking and screaming     said brutha .      by any means necessary     said simony .   he beamed at them .      don   t worry about him     said om .     we   ll be far away .  just as well  too .  i don   t think omnia   s going to be a popular country when news of last night   s work gets about .         but it was vorbis   s fault .     said brutha out loud .     he started the whole thing .  he sent poor brother murduck  and then he had him killed so he could blame it on the ephebians .  he never intended any peace treaty .  he just wanted to get into the palace .         beats me how he managed that  too     said urn .     no one ever got through the labyrinth without a guide .  how did he do it .      didactylos   s blind eyes sought out brutha .      can   t imagine     he said .  brutha hung his head .      he really did all that .     said simony .      yes .         you idiot .  you total sandhead .     screamed om .      and you   d tell this to other people .     said simony  insistently .      i suppose so .         you   d speak out against the quisition .      brutha stared miserably into the night .  behind them  the flames of ephebe had merged into one orange spark .      all i can say is what i remember     he said .      we   re dead     said om .     throw me over the side  why don   t you .  this bonehead will want to take us back to omnia .      simony rubbed his chin thoughtfully .      vorbis has many enemies     he said     in certain circumstances .  better he should be killed  but some would call that murder .  or even martyrdom .  but a trial   if there was evidence   if they even thought there could be evidence           i can see his mind working .     om screamed .     we   d all be safe if you   d shut up .           vorbis on trial     simony mused .   brutha blanched at the thought .  it was the kind of thought that was almost impossible to hold in the mind .  it was the kind of thought that made no sense .  vorbis on trial .  trials were things that happened to other people .   he remembered brother murduck .  and the soldiers who had been lost in the desert .  and all the things that had been done to people  even to brutha .      tell him you can   t remember .     om yelled .     tell him you can   t recall .         and if he was on trial     said simony     he   d be found guilty .  no one would dare do anything else .      thoughts always moved slowly through brutha   s mind  like icebergs .  they arrived slowly and left slowly and when they were there they occupied a lot of space  much of it below the surface .   he thought  the worst thing about vorbis isn   t that he   s evil  but that he makes good people do evil .  he turns people into things like himself .  you can   t help it .  you catch it off him .   there was no sound but the slosh of water against the unnamed boat   s hull and the spinning of the philosophical engine .      we   d be caught if we returned to omnia     said brutha slowly .      we can land away from the ports     said simony eagerly .      ankh morpork .     shouted om .      first we should take mr .  didactylos to ankh morpork     said brutha .     then   i   ll come back to omnia .         you can damn well leave me there too .     said om .     i   ll soon find some believers in ankh morpork  don   t you worry  they believe anything there .           never seen ankh morpork     said didactylos .     still  we live and learn .  that   s what i always say .     he turned to face the soldier .     kicking and screaming .         there   s some exiles in ankh     said simony .     don   t worry .  you   ll be safe there .         amazing .     said didactylos .     and to think  this morning  i didn   t even know i was in danger .      he sat back in the boat .      life in this world     he said     is  as it were  a sojourn in a cave .  what can we know of reality .  for all we see of the true nature of existence is  shall we say  no more than bewildering and amusing shadows cast upon the inner wall of the cave by the unseen blinding light of absolute truth  from which we may or may not deduce some glimmer of veracity  and we as troglodyte seekers of wisdom can only lift our voices to the unseen and say  humbly     go on  do deformed rabbit   it   s my favorite .             vorbis stirred the ashes with his foot .      no bones     he said .   the soldiers stood silently .  the fluffy gray flakes collapsed and blew a little way in the dawn breeze .      and the wrong sort of ash     said vorbis .   the sergeant opened his mouth to say something .      be assured i know that of which i speak     said vorbis .   he wandered over to the charred trapdoor  and prodded it with his toe .      we followed the tunnel     said the sergeant  in the tones of one who hopes against experience that sounding helpful will avert the wrath to come .     it comes out near the docks .         but if you enter it from the docks it does not come out here     vorbis mused .  the smoking ashes seemed to hold an endless fascination for him .     the sergeant   s brow wrinkled .      understand .     said vorbis .     the ephebians wouldn   t build a way out that was a way in .  the minds that devised the labyrinth would not work like that .  there would be   valves .  sequences of trigger stones  perhaps .  trips that trip only one way .  whirring blades that come out of unexpected walls .         ah .         most intricate and devious  i have no doubt .      the sergeant ran a dry tongue over his lips .  he could not read vorbis like a book  because there had never been a book like vorbis .  but vorbis had certain habits of thought that you learned  after a while .      you wish me to take the squad and follow it up from the docks     he said hollowly .      i was just about to suggest it     said vorbis .      yes  lord .      vorbis patted the sergeant on the shoulder .      but do not worry .     he said cheerfully .     om will protect the strong in faith .         yes  lord .         and the last man can bring me a full report .  but first   they are not in the city .         we have searched it fully  lord .         and no one left by the gate .  then they left by sea .         all the ephebian war vessels are accounted for  lord vorbis .         this bay is lousy with small boats .         with nowhere to go but the open sea  sir .      vorbis looked out at the circle sea .  it filled the world from horizon to horizon .  beyond lay the smudge of the sto plains and the ragged line of the ramtops  all the way to the towering peaks that the heretics called the hub but which was  he knew  the pole  visible around the curve of the world only because of the way light bent in atmosphere  just as it did in water   and he saw a smudge of white  curling over the distant ocean .   vorbis had very good eyesight  from a height .   he picked up a handful of gray ash  which had once been dykeri   s principles of navigation  and let it drift through his fingers .      om has sent us a fair wind     he said .     let us get down to the docks .      hope waved optimistically in the waters of the sergeant   s despair .      you won   t be wanting us to explore the tunnel  lord .     he said .      oh  no .  you can do that when we return .          urn prodded at the copper globe with a piece of wire while the unnamed boat wallowed in the waves .      can   t you beat it .     said simony  who was not up to speed on the difference between machines and people .      it   s a philosophical engine     said urn .     beating won   t help .         but you said machines could be our slaves     said simony .      not the beating sort     said urn .     the nozzles are bunged up with salt .  when the water rushes out of the globe it leaves the salt behind .         why .         i don   t know .  water likes to travel light .         we   re becalmed .  can you do anything about it .         yes  wait for it to cool down and then clean it out and put some more water in it .      simony looked around distractedly .      but we   re still in sight of the coast .           you might be     said didactylos .  he was sitting in the middle of the boat with his hands crossed on the top of his walking stick  looking like an old man who doesn   t often get taken out for an airing and is quite enjoying it .      don   t worry .  no one could see us out here     said urn .  he prodded at the mechanism .     anyway  i   m a bit worried about the screw .  it was invented to move water along  not move along on water .         you mean it   s confused .     said simony .      screwed up     said didactylos happily .   brutha lay in the pointed end  looking down at the water .  a small squid siphoned past  just under the surface .  he wondered what it was        and knew it was the common bottle squid  of the class cephalopoda  phylum mollusca  and that it had an internal cartilaginous support instead of a skeleton and a well developed nervous system and large  image forming eyes that were quite similar to vertebrate eyes .   the knowledge hung in the forefront of his mind for a moment  and then faded away .      om .     brutha whispered .      what .         what   re you doing .         trying to get some sleep .  tortoises need a lot of sleep  you know .      simony and urn were bent over the philosophical engine .  brutha stared at the globe        a sphere of radius r  which therefore had a volume v          pi  rrr  and surface area a     pi  rr        oh  my god           what now .     said the voice of the tortoise .   didactylos   s face turned towards brutha  who was clutching at his head .        what   s a pi .      didactylos reached out a hand and steadied brutha .      what   s the matter .     said om .      i don   t know .  it   s just words .  i don   t know what   s in the books .  i can   t read .         getting plenty of sleep is vital     said om .     it builds a healthy shell .      brutha sagged to his knees in the rocking boat .  he felt like a householder coming back unexpectedly and finding the old place full of strangers .  they were in every room  not menacing  but just filling the space with their thereness .      the books are leaking .         i don   t see how that can happen     said didactylos .     you said you just looked at them .  you didn   t read them .  you don   t know what they mean .         they know what they mean .         listen .  they   re just books  of the nature of books     said didactylos .     they   re not magical .  if you could know what books contained just by looking at them  urn there would be a genius .         what   s the matter with him .     said simony .      he thinks he knows too much .         no .  i don   t know anything .  not really know     said brutha .     i just remembered that squids have an internal cartilaginous support .         i can see that would be a worry     said simony .     huh .  priests .  mad  the lot of them .         no .  i don   t know what cartilaginous means .         skeletal connective tissue     said didactylos .     think of bony and leathery at the same time .      simony snorted .     well  well     he said     we live and learn  just like you said .           some of us even do it the other way around     said didactylos .      is that supposed to mean something .         it   s philosophy     said didactylos .     and sit down  boy .  you   re making the boat rock .  we   re overloaded as it is .         it   s being buoyed upward by a force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid     muttered brutha  sagging .      hmm .         except that i don   t know what buoyed means .      urn looked up from the sphere .     we   re ready to start again     he said .     just bale some water in here with your helmet  mister .         and then we shall go again .         well  we can start getting up steam     said urn .  he wiped his hands on his toga .      y   know     said didactylos     there are different ways of learning things .  i   m reminded of the time when old prince lasgere of tsort asked me how he could become learned  especially since he hadn   t got any time for this reading business .  i said to him     there is no royal road to learning  sire     and he said to me     bloody well build one or i shall have your legs chopped off .  use as many slaves as you like .     a refreshingly direct approach  i always thought .  not a man to mince words .  people  yes .  but not words .         why didn   t he chop your legs off .     said urn .      i built him his road .  more or less .         how .  i thought that was just a metaphor .         you   re learning  urn .  so i found a dozen slaves who could read and they sat in his bedroom at night whispering choice passages to him while he slept .         did that work .           don   t know .  the third slave stuck a six inch dagger in his ear .  then after the revolution the new ruler let me out of prison and said i could leave the country if i promised not to think of anything on the way to the border .  but i don   t believe there was anything wrong with the idea in principle .      urn blew on the fire .      takes a little while to heat up the water     he explained .   brutha lay back in the bow again .  if he concentrated  he could stop the knowledge flowing .  the thing to do was avoid looking at things .  even a cloud        devised by natural philosophy as a means of occasioning shade on the surface of the world  thus preventing overheating        caused an intrusion .  om was fast asleep .   knowing without learning  thought brutha .  no .  the other way around .  learning without knowing         nine tenths of om dozed in his shell .  the rest of him drifted like a fog in the real world of the gods  which is a lot less interesting than the three dimensional world inhabited by most of humanity .   he thought  we   re a little boat .  she   ll probably not even notice us .  there   s the whole of the ocean .  she can   t be everywhere .   of course  she   s got many believers .  but we   re only a little boat     he felt the minds of inquisitive fishes nosing around the end of the screw .  which was odd  because in the normal course of things fishes were not known for their        greetings     said the queen of the sea .      ah .           i see you   re still managing to exist  little tortoise .         hanging in there     said om .     no problems .      there was a pause which  if it were taking place between two people in the human world  would have been spent in coughing and looking embarrassed .  but gods are never embarrassed .      i expect     said om guardedly     you are looking for your price .         this vessel and everyone in it     said the queen .     but your believer can be saved  as is the custom .         what good are they to you .  one of them   s an atheist .         hah .  they all believe  right at the end .         that doesn   t seem       om hesitated .     fair .      now the sea queen paused .      what   s fair .         like   underlying justice .     said om .  he wondered why he said it .      sounds a human idea to me .         they   re inventive  i   ll grant you .  but what i meant was   i mean   they   ve done nothing to deserve it .         deserve .  they   re human .  what   s deserve got to do with it .      om had to concede this .  he wasn   t thinking like a god .  this bothered him .      it   s just           you   ve been relying on one human for too long  little god .         i know .  i know .     om sighed .  minds leaked into one another .  he was seeing too much from a human point of view .     take the boat  then .  if you must .  i just wish it was           fair .     said the sea queen .  she moved forward .  om felt her all around him .        there   s no such thing     she said .     life   s like a beach .  and then you die .      then she was gone .   om let himself retreat into the shell of his shell .      brutha .         yes .         can you swim .      the globe started to spin .   brutha heard urn say     there .  soon be on our way .         we   d better be .     this was simony .     there   s a ship out there .         this thing goes faster than anything with sails or oars .      brutha looked across the bay .  a sleek omnian ship was passing the lighthouse .  it was still a long way off  but brutha stared at it with a dread and expectation that magnified better than telescopes .      it   s moving fast     said simony .     i don   t understand it   there   s no wind .      urn looked around at the flat calm .      there can   t be wind there and not here     he said .      i said  can you swim .     the voice of the tortoise was insistent in brutha   s head .      i don   t know     said brutha .      do you think you could find out quickly .      urn looked upwards .      oh     he said .   clouds had massed over the unnamed boat .  they were visibly spinning .      you   ve got to know .     shouted om .     i thought you had a perfect memory .         we used to splash around in the big cistern in the village     whispered brutha .     i don   t know if that counts .      mist whipped off the surface of the sea .  brutha   s ears popped .  and still the omnian ship came on  flying across the waves .      what do you call it when you   ve got a dead calm surrounded by winds       urn began .      hurricane .     said didactylos .   lightning crackled between sky and sea .  urn yanked at the lever that lowered the screw into the water .  his eyes glowed almost as brightly as the lightning .      now there   s a power     he said .     harnessing the lightning .  the dream of mankind .      the unnamed boat surged forward .      is it .  it   s not my dream     said didactylos .     i always dream of a giant carrot chasing me through a field of lobsters .         i mean metaphorical dream  master     said urn .      what   s a metaphor .     said simony .   brutha said     what   s a dream .      a pillar of lightning laced the mist .  secondary lightnings sparked off the spinning globe .      you can get it from cats     said urn  lost in a philosophical world  as the boat left a white wake behind it .     you stroke them with a rod of amber  and you get tiny lightnings   if i could magnify that a million times  no man would ever be a slave again and we could catch it in jars and do away with the night        lightning struck a few yards away .      we   re in a boat with a large copper ball in the middle of a body of salt water     said didactylos .     thanks  urn .         and the temples of the gods would be magnificently lit  of course     said urn quickly .   didactylos tapped his stick on the hull .     it   s a nice idea  but you   d never get enough cats     he said .  the sea surged up .      jump into the water .     om shouted .        why .     said brutha .   a wave almost overturned the boat .  rain hissed on the surface of the sphere  sent up a scalding spray .      i haven   t got time to explain .  jump overboard .  it   s for the best .  trust me .      brutha stood up  holding the sphere   s framework to steady himself .      sit down .     said urn .      i   m just going out     said brutha .     i may be some time .      the boat rocked under him as he half jumped  half fell into the boiling sea .   lightning struck the sphere .   as brutha bobbed to the surface he saw  for a moment  the globe glowing white hot and the unnamed boat  its screw almost out of the water  skimming away through the mists like a comet .  it vanished in the clouds and rain .  a moment later  above the noise of the storm  there was a muffled    boom .      brutha raised his hand .  om broke the surface  blowing seawater out of his nostrils .      you said it would be for the best .     screamed brutha .      well .  we   re still alive .  and hold me out of the water .  tortoises can   t swim .         but they might be dead .         do you want to join them .      a wave submerged brutha .  for a moment the world was a dark green curtain  ringing in his ears .      i can   t swim with one hand .     he shouted  as he broke surface again .      we   ll be saved .  she wouldn   t dare .         what do you mean .      another wave slapped at brutha  and suction dragged at his robes .        om .         yes .         i don   t think i can swim            gods are not very introspective .  it has never been a survival trait .  the ability to cajole  threaten  and terrify has always worked well enough .  when you can flatten entire cities at a whim  a tendency toward quiet reflection and seeing things from the other fellow   s point of view is seldom necessary .   which had led  across the multiverse  to men and women of tremendous brilliance and empathy devoting their entire lives to the service of deities who couldn   t beat them at a quiet game of dominoes .  for example  sister sestina of quirm defied the wrath of a local king and walked unharmed across a bed of coals and propounded a philosophy of sensible ethics on behalf of a goddess whose only real interest was in hairstyles  and brother zephilite of klatch left his vast estates and his family and spent his life ministering to the sick and poor on behalf of the invisible god f   rum  generally considered unable  should he have a backside  to find it with both hands  should he have hands .  gods never need to be very bright when there are humans around to be it for them .   the sea queen was considered fairly dumb even by other gods .  but there was a certain logic to her thoughts  as she moved deep below the storm tossed waves .  the little boat had been a tempting target   but here was a bigger one  full of people  sailing right into the storm .   this one was fair game .   the sea queen had the attention span of an onion bahji .   and  by and large  she created her own sacrifices .  and she believed in quantity .       the fin of god plunged from wave crest to wave trough  the gale tearing at its sails .  the captain fought his way through waist high water to the prow  where vorbis stood clutching the rail  apparently oblivious to the fact that the ship was wallowing half submerged .      sir .  we must reef sail .  we can   t outrun this .      green fire crackled on the tops of the masts .  vorbis turned .  the light was reflected in the pit of his eyes .      it is all for the glory of om     he said .     trust is our sail  and glory is our destination .      the captain had had enough .  he was unsteady on the subject of religion  but felt fairly confident that after thirty years he knew something about the sea .      the ocean floor is our destination .     he shouted .   vorbis shrugged .     i did not say there would not be stops along the way     he said .   the captain stared at him and then fought his way back across the heaving deck .  what he knew about the sea was that storms like this didn   t just happen .  you didn   t just sail from calm water into the midst of a raging hurricane .  this wasn   t the sea .  this was personal .   lightning struck the mainmast .  there was a scream from the darkness as a mass of torn sail and rigging crashed on to the deck .   the captain half swam  half climbed up the ladder to the wheel  where the helmsman was a shadow in the spray and the eerie storm glow .      we   ll never make it alive .      correct .      we   ll have to abandon ship .      no .  we will take it with us .  it   s a nice ship .   the captain peered closer in the murk .      is that you  bosun coplei .        would you like another guess .   the hull hit a submerged rock and ripped open .  lightning struck the remaining mast and  like a paper boat that had been too long in the water  the fin of god folded up .  baulks of timber splintered and fountained up into the whirling sky     and there was a sudden  velvety silence .   the captain found that he had acquired a recent memory .  it involved water  and a ringing in his ears  and the sensation of cold fire in his lungs .  but it was fading .  he walked over to the rail  his footsteps loud in the quietness  and looked over the side .  despite the fact that the recent memory included something about the ship being totally smashed  it now seemed to be whole again .  in a way .      uh     he said     we appear to have run out of sea .      yes .      and land  too .      the captain tapped the rail .  it was grayish  and slightly transparent .      uh .  is this wood .      morphic memory .      sorry .      you were a sailor .  you have heard a ship referred to as a living thing .      oh  yes .  you can   t spend a night on a ship without feeling that it has a sou        yes .   the memory of fin of god sailed on through the silence .  there was the distant sighing of wind  or of the memory of wind .  the blown out corpses of dead gales .      uh     said the ghost of the captain     did you just say    were    .      yes .      i thought you did .        the captain stared down .  the crew was assembling on deck  looking up at him with anxious eyes .   he looked down further .  in front of the crew the ship   s rats had assembled .  there was a tiny robed shape in front of them .   it said  squeak .   he thought  even rats have a death     death stood aside and beckoned to the captain .   you have the wheel .      but   but where are we going .      who knows .   the captain gripped the spokes helplessly .     but   there   s no stars that i recognize .  no charts .  what are the winds here .  where are the currents .      death shrugged .   the captain turned the wheel aimlessly .  the ship glided on through the ghost of a sea .   then he brightened up .  the worst had already happened .  it was amazing how good it felt to know that .  and if the worst had already happened        where   s vorbis .     he growled .   he survived .      did he .  there   s no justice .      there   s just me .   death vanished .   the captain turned the wheel a bit  for the look of the thing .  after all  he was still captain and this was still  in a way  a ship .      mr .  mate .      the mate saluted .      sir .         um .  where shall we go now .      the mate scratched his head .      well  cap   n  i did hear as the heathen klatch have got this paradise place where there   s drinking and singing and young women with bells on and   you know   regardless .      the mate looked hopefully at his captain .      regardless  eh .     said the captain thoughtfully .      so i did hear .      the captain felt that he might be due some regardless .      any idea how you get there .         i think you get given instructions when you   re alive     said the mate .      oh .         and there   re some barbarians up toward the hub     said the mate  relishing the word     who reckon they go to a big hall where there   s all sorts to eat and drink .         and women .         bound to be .      the captain frowned .     it   s a funny thing     he said     but why is it that the heathens and the barbarians seem to have the best places to go when they die .         a bit of a poser  that     agreed the mate .     i s   pose it makes up for    em   enjoying themselves all the time when they   re alive  too .     he looked puzzled .  now that he was dead  the whole thing sounded suspicious .      i suppose you   ve no idea of the way to that paradise either .     said the captain .      sorry  cap   n .         no harm in searching  though .      the captain looked over the side .  if you sailed for long enough  you were bound to strike a shore .  and no harm in searching .   a movement caught his eye .  he smiled .  good .  a sign .  maybe it was all for the best  after all     accompanied by the ghosts of dolphins  the ghost of a ship sailed on         seagulls never ventured this far along the desert coast .  their niche was filled by the scalbie  a member of the crow family that the crow family would be the first to disown and never talked about in company .  it seldom flew  but walked everywhere in a sort of lurching hop .  its distinctive call put listeners in mind of a malfunctioning digestive system .  it looked like other birds looked after an oil slick .  nothing ate scalbies  except other scalbies .  scalbies ate things that made a vulture sick .  scalbies would eat vulture sick .  scalbies ate everything .   one of them  on this bright new morning  sidled across the flea hopping sand  pecking aimlessly at things in case pebbles and bits of wood had become edible overnight .  in the scalbie   s experience  practically anything became edible if it was left for long enough .  it came across a mound lying on the tideline  and gave it a tentative jab with its beak .   the mound groaned .   the scalbie backed away hurriedly and turned its attention to a small domed rock beside the mound .  it was pretty certain this hadn   t been there yesterday  either .  it essayed an exploratory peck .   the rock extruded a head and said     bugger off  you evil sod .      the scalbie leapt backward and then made a kind of running jump  which was the nearest any scalbie ever bothered to come to actual flight  on to a pile of sun bleached driftwood .  things were looking up .  if this rock was alive  then eventually it would be dead .   the great god om staggered over to brutha and butted him in the head with its shell until he groaned .      wake up  lad .  rise and shine .  huphuphup .  all ashore who   s going ashore .        brutha opened an eye .      wha    happened .     he said .      you   re alive is what happened     said om .  life   s a beach  he remembered .  and then you die .   brutha pulled himself into a kneeling position .   there are beaches that cry out for brightly colored umbrellas .   there are beaches that speak of the majesty of the sea .   but this beach wasn   t like that .  it was merely a barren hem where the land met the ocean .  driftwood piled up on the high tide line  scoured by the wind .  the air buzzed with unpleasant small insects .  there was a smell that suggested that something had rotted away  a long time ago  somewhere where the scalbies couldn   t find it .  it was not a good beach .      oh .  god .         better than drowning     said om encouragingly .      i wouldn   t know .     brutha looked along the beach .     is there any water to drink .         shouldn   t think so     said om .      ossory v  verse    says that you made living water flow from the dry desert     said brutha .      that was by way of being artistic license     said om .      you can   t even do that .         no .      brutha looked at the desert again .  behind the driftwood lines  and a few patches of grass that appeared to be dying even while it grew  the dunes marched away .      which way to omnia .     he said .      we don   t want to go to omnia     said om .   brutha stared at the tortoise .  then he picked him up .      i think it   s this way     he said .   om   s legs waggled frantically .      what do you want to go to omnia for .     he said .        i don   t want to     said brutha .     but i   m going anyway .          the sun hung high above the beach .   or possibly it didn   t .   brutha knew things about the sun now .  they were leaking into his head .  the ephebians had been very interested in astronomy .  expletius had proved that the disc was ten thousand miles across .  febrius  who   d stationed slaves with quick reactions and carrying voices all across the country at dawn  had proved that light traveled at about the same speed as sound .  and didactylos had reasoned that  in that case  in order to pass between the elephants  the sun had to travel at least thirty five thousand miles in its orbit every day or  to put it another way  twice as fast as its own light .  which meant that mostly you could only ever see where the sun had been  except twice every day when it caught up with itself  and this meant that the whole sun was a faster than light particle  a tachyon or  as didactylos put it  a bugger .   it was still hot .  the lifeless sea seemed to steam .   brutha trudged along  directly above the only piece of shadow for hundreds of miles .  even om had stopped complaining .  it was too hot .   here and there fragments of wood rolled in the scum at the edge of the sea .   ahead of brutha the air shimmered over the sand .  in the middle of it was a dark blob .   he regarded it dispassionately as he approached  incapable of any real thought .  it was nothing more than a reference point in a world of orange heat  expanding and contracting in the vibrating haze .   closer to  it turned out to be vorbis .     the thought took a long time to seep through brutha   s mind .   vorbis .   not with a robe .  all torn off .  just his singlet with .  the nails sewn in .  blood all .  over one leg .  torn by .  rocks .  vorbis .   vorbis .   brutha slumped to his knees .  on the high tide line  a scalbie gave a croak .      he   s still   alive     brutha managed .      pity     said om .      we should do something   for him .         yes .  maybe you can find a rock and stove his head in     said om .      we can   t just leave him here .         watch us .         no .      brutha got his hand under the deacon and tried to lift him .  to his dull surprise  vorbis weighed almost nothing .  the deacon   s robe had concealed a body that was just skin stretched over bone .  brutha could have broken him with bare hands .      what about me .     whined om .   brutha slung vorbis over his shoulder .      you   ve got four legs     he said .      i am your god .         yes .  i know .     brutha trudged on along the beach .      what are you going to do with him .         take him to omnia     said brutha thickly .     people must know .  what he did .         you   re mad .  you   re mad .  you think you   re going to carry him to omnia .         don   t know .  going to try .           you .  you .     om pounded a claw on the sand .     millions of people in the world and it had to be you .  stupid .  stupid .      brutha was becoming a wavering shape in the haze .      that   s it .     shouted om .     i don   t need you .  you think i need you .  i don   t need you .  i can soon find another believer .  no problem about that .      brutha disappeared .      and i   m not chasing after you .     om screamed .       brutha watched his feet dragging one in front of the other .   he was past the point of thinking now .  what drifted through his frying brain were disjointed images and fragments of memory .   dreams .  they were pictures in your head .  coaxes had written a whole scroll about them .  the superstitious thought they were messages sent by god  but really they were created by the brain itself  thrown up as it nightly sorted and filed the experiences of the day .  brutha never dreamed .  so sometimes   blackout  while the mind did the filing .  it filed all the books .  now he knew without learning     that was dreams .   god .  god needed people .  belief was the food of the gods .  but they also needed a shape .  gods became what people believed they ought to be .  so the goddess of wisdom carried a penguin .  it could have happened to any god .  it should have been an owl .  everyone knew that .  but one bad sculptor who had only ever had an owl described to him makes a mess of a statue  belief steps in  next thing you know the goddess of wisdom is lumbered with a bird that wears evening dress the whole time and smells of fish .     you gave a god its shape  like a jelly fills a mold .   gods often became your father  said abraxas the agnostic .  gods became a big beard in the sky  because when you were three years old that was your father .   of course abraxas survived   this thought arrived sharp and cold  out of the part of his own mind that brutha could still call his own .  gods didn   t mind atheists  if they were deep  hot  fiery atheists like simony  who spend their whole life not believing  spend their whole life hating gods for not existing .  that sort of atheism was a rock .  it was nearly belief     sand .  it was what you found in deserts .  crystals of rock  sculpted into dunes .  gordo of tsort said that sand was worn down mountains but irexes had found that sandstone was stone pressed out of sand  which suggested that grains were the fathers of mountains     every one a little crystal .  and all of them getting bigger     much bigger     quietly  without realizing it  brutha stopped falling forward and lay still .          bugger off .      the scalbie took no notice .  this was interesting .  it was getting to see whole new stretches of sand it had never seen before and  of course  there was the prospect  even the certainty  of a good meal at the end of it all .   it had perched on om   s shell .   om stumped along the sand  pausing occasionally to shout at his passenger .   brutha had come this way .   but here one of the outcrops of rocks  littering the desert like islands in a sea  stretched right down to the water   s edge .  he   d never have been able to climb it .  the footprints in the sand turned inland  toward the deep desert .      idiot .      om struggled up the side of a dune  digging his feet in to stop himself slaloming backward .   on the far side of the dune the tracks became a long groove  where brutha must have fallen .  om retracted his legs and tobogganed down it .   the tracks veered here .  he must have thought that he could walk around the next dune and find the rock again on the other side .  om knew about deserts  and one of the things he knew was that this kind of logical thinking had been previously applied by a thousand bleached  lost skeletons .   nevertheless  he plodded after the tracks  grateful for the brief shade of the dune now that the sun was sinking .   around the dune and  yes  here they zigzagged awkwardly up a slope about ninety degrees away from where they should be heading .  guaranteed .  that was the thing about deserts .  they had their own gravity .  they sucked you into the center .       brutha crawled forward  vorbis held unsteadily by one limp arm .  he didn   t dare stop .  his grandmother would hit him again .  and there was master nhumrod  too  drifting in and out of vision .      i am really disappointed in you  brutha .  mmm .         want   water              water     said nhumrod .     trust in the great god .      brutha concentrated .  nhumrod vanished .      great god .     he said .   somewhere there was some shade .  the desert couldn   t go on forever .       the sun set fast .  for a while  om knew  heat would radiate off the sand and his own shell would store it  but that would soon go and then there would be the bitterness of a desert night .   stars were already coming on when he found brutha .  vorbis had been dropped a little way away .   om pulled himself level with brutha   s ear .      hey .      there was no sound  and no movement .  om butted brutha gently in the head and then looked at the cracked lips .   there was a pecking noise behind him .   the scalbie was investigating brutha   s toes  but its explorations were interrupted when a tortoise jaw closed around its foot .      i old oo  ugger ogg .      the scalbie gave a burp of panic and tried to fly away  but it was hindered by a determined tortoise hanging on to one leg .  om was bounced along the sand for a few feet before he let go .   he tried to spit  but tortoise mouths aren   t designed for the job .      i hate all birds     he said  to the evening air .   the scalbie watched him reproachfully from the top of a dune .  it ruffled its handful of greasy feathers with the air of one who was prepared to wait all night  if necessary .  as long as it took .   om crawled back to brutha .  well  there was still breathing going on .   water     the god gave it some thought .  smiting the living rock .  that was one way .  getting water to flow   no problem .  it was just a matter of molecules and vectors .  water had a natural tendency to flow .  you just have to see to it that it flowed here instead of there .  no problem at all to a god in the peak of condition .   how did you tackle it from a tortoise perspective .   the tortoise dragged himself to the bottom of the dune and then walked up and down for a few minutes .  finally he selected a spot and began digging .       this wasn   t right .  it had been fiery hot .  now he was freezing .   brutha opened his eyes .  desert stars  brilliant white  looked back at him .  his tongue seemed to fill his mouth .  now  what was it     water .   he rolled over .  there had been voices in his head  and now there were voices outside his head .  they were faint  but they were definitely there  echoing quietly over the moonlit sands .   brutha crawled painfully toward the foot of the dune .  there was a mound there .  in fact  there were several mounds .  the muffled voice was coming from one of them .  he pulled himself closer .   there was a hole in the mound .  somewhere far underground  someone was swearing .  the words were unclear as they echoed backward and forward up the tunnel  but the general effect was unmistakable .   brutha flopped down  and watched .   after a few minutes there was movement at the mouth of the hole and om emerged  covered with what  if this wasn   t a desert  brutha would have called mud .      oh  it   s you     said the tortoise .     tear off a bit of your robe and pass it over .      dreamlike  brutha obeyed .      turnin    around down there     said om     is no picnic  let me tell you .        he took the rag in his jaws  backed around carefully  and disappeared down the hole .  after a couple of minutes he was back  still dragging the rag .   it was soaked .  brutha let the liquid dribble into his mouth .  it tasted of mud  and sand  and cheap brown dye  and slightly of tortoise  but he would have drunk a gallon of it .  he could have swam in a pool of it .   he tore off another strip for om to take down .   when om re emerged  brutha was kneeling beside vorbis .      sixteen feet down .  sixteen bloody feet .     shouted om .     don   t waste it on him .  isn   t he dead yet .         he   s got a fever .         put him out of our misery .         we   re still taking him back to omnia .         you think we   ll get there .  no food .  no water .         but you found water .  water in the desert .         nothing miraculous about that     said om .     there   s a rainy season near the coast .  flash floods .  wadis .  dried up riverbeds .  you get aquifers     he added .      sounds like a miracle to me     croaked brutha .     just because you can explain it doesn   t mean it   s not still a miracle .         well  there   s no food down there  take it from me     said om .     nothing to eat .  nothing in the sea  if we can find the sea again .  i know the desert .  rocky ridges you have to go around .  everything turning you out of your path .  dunes that move in the night   lions   other things           gods .      what do you want to do  then .     said brutha .     you said better alive than dead .  you want to go back to ephebe .  we   ll be popular there  you think .      om was silent .     brutha nodded .      fetch more water  then .          it was better traveling at night  with vorbis over one shoulder and om under one arm .   at this time of year        the glow in the sky over there is the aurora corealis  the hublights  where the magical field of the discworld constantly discharges itself among the peaks of cori celesti  the central mountain .  and at this time of year the sun rises over the desert in ephebe and over the sea in omnia  so keep the hublights on the left and the sunset glow behind you        did you ever go to cori celesti .     said brutha .   om  who had been nodding off in the cold  woke up with a start .      huh .         it   s where the gods live .         hah .  i could tell you stories     said om darkly .      what .         think they   re so bloody elite .         you didn   t live up there  then .         no .  got to be a thunder god or something .  got to have a whole parcel of worshipers to live on nob hill .  got to be an anthropomorphic personification  one of them things .         not just a great god  then .      well  this was the desert .  and brutha was going to die .      may as well tell you     muttered om .     it   s not as though we   re going to survive   see  every god   s a great god to someone .  i never wanted to be that great .  a handful of tribes  a city or two .  it   s not much to ask  is it .         there   s two million people in the empire     said brutha .        yeah .  pretty good  eh .  started off with nothing but a shepherd hearing voices in his head  ended up with two million people .         but you never did anything with them     said brutha .      like what .         well   tell them not to kill one another  that sort of thing           never really given it much thought .  why should i tell them that .      brutha sought for something that would appeal to god psychology .      well  if people didn   t kill one another  there   d be more people to believe in you .     he suggested .      it   s a point     om conceded .     interesting point .  sneaky .      brutha walked along in silence .  there was a glimmer of frost on the dunes .      have you ever heard     he said     of ethics .         somewhere in howondaland  isn   t it .         the ephebians were very interested in it .         probably thinking about invading .         they seemed to think about it a lot .         long term strategy  maybe .         i don   t think it   s a place  though .  it   s more to do with how people live .         what  lolling around all day while slaves do the real work .  take it from me  whenever you see a bunch of buggers puttering around talking about truth and beauty and the best way of attacking ethics  you can bet your sandals it   s because dozens of other poor buggers are doing all the real work around the place while those fellows are living like              gods .     said brutha .   there was a terrible silence .        i was going to say kings     said om  reproachfully .      they sound a bit like gods .         kings     said om emphatically .      why do people need gods .     brutha persisted .      oh  you   ve got to have gods     said om  in a hearty  no nonsense voice .      but it   s gods that need people     said brutha .     to do the believing .  you said .      om hesitated .     well  okay     he said .     but people have got to believe in something .  yes .  i mean  why else does it thunder .         thunder     said brutha  his eyes glazing slightly     i don   t           is caused by clouds banging together  after the lightning stroke  there is a hole in the air  and thus the sound is engendered by the clouds rushing to fill the hole and colliding  in accordance with strict cumulodynamic principles .         your voice goes funny when you   re quoting     said om .     what does engendered mean .         i don   t know .  no one showed me a dictionary .         anyway  that   s just an explanation     said om .     it   s not a reason .         my grandmother said thunder was caused by the great god om taking his sandals off     said brutha .     she was in a funny mood that day .  nearly smiled .         metaphorically accurate     said om .     but i never did thundering .  demarcation  see .  bloody i   ve got a big hammer blind io up on nob hill does all the thundering .         i thought you said there were hundreds of thunder gods     said brutha .      yeah .  and he   s all of    em .  rationalization .  a couple of tribes join up  they   ve both got thunder gods  right .  and the gods kind of run together   you know how amoebas split .         no .         well  it   s like that  only the other way .         i still don   t see how one god can be a hundred thunder gods .  they all look different           false noses .         what .         and different voices .  i happen to know io   s got seventy different hammers .  not common knowledge  that .  and it   s just the same with mother goddesses .  there   s only one of    em .  she just got a lot of wigs and of course it   s amazing what you can do with a padded bra .      there was absolute silence in the desert .  the stars  smeared slightly by high altitude moisture  were tiny  motionless rosettes .   away toward what the church called the top pole  and which brutha was coming to think of as the hub  the sky flickered .   brutha put om down  and laid vorbis on the sand .   absolute silence .   nothing for miles  except what he had brought with him .  this must have been how the prophets felt  when they went into the desert to find   whatever it was they found  and talk to   whoever they talked to .   he heard om  slightly peevish  say     people   ve got to believe in something .  might as well be gods .  what else is there .      brutha laughed .      you know     he said     i don   t think i believe in anything any more .         except me .         oh  i know you exist     said brutha .  he felt om relax a little .     there   s something about tortoises .  tortoises i can believe in .  they seem to have a lot of existence in one place .  it   s gods in general i   m having difficulty with .         look  if people stop believing in gods  they   ll believe in anything     said om .     they   ll believe in young urn   s steam ball .  anything at all .         hmm .      a green glow in the sky indicated that the light of dawn was chasing frantically after its sun .   vorbis groaned .      i don   t know why he won   t wake up     said brutha .     i can   t find any broken bones .         how do you know .         one of the ephebian scrolls was all about bones .  can   t you do anything for him .         why .         you   re a god .         well  yes .  if i was strong enough  i could probably strike him with lightning .         i thought io did the lightning .         no  just the thunder .  you   re allowed to do as much lightning as you like but you have to contract for the thundering .      now the horizon was a broad golden band .      how about rain .     said brutha .     how about something useful .      a line of silver appeared at the bottom of the gold .  sunlight was racing towards brutha .      that was a very hurtful remark     said the tortoise .     a remark calculated to wound .      in the rapidly growing light brutha saw one of the rock islands a little way off .  its sand blasted pillars offered nothing but shade  but shade  always available in large quantities in the depths of the citadel  was now in short supply here .      caves .     said brutha .      snakes .         but still caves .         in conjunction with snakes .         poisonous snakes .         guess .          the unnamed boat clipped along gently  the wind filling urn   s robe attached to a mast made out of bits of the sphere   s framework bound together with simony   s sandal thongs .      i think i know what went wrong     said urn .     a mere overspeed problem .         overspeed .  we left the water .     said simony .      it needs some sort of governor device     said urn  scratching a design on the side of the boat .     something that   d open the valve if there was too much steam .  i think i could do something with a pair of revolving balls .         it   s funny you should say that     said didactylos .     when i felt us leave the water and the sphere exploded i distinctly felt my           that bloody thing nearly killed us .     said simony .      so the next one will be better     said urn  cheerfully .  he scanned the distant coastline .      why don   t we land somewhere along here .     he said .      the desert coast .     said simony .     what for .  nothing to eat  nothing to drink  easy to lose your way .  omnia   s the only destination in this wind .  we can land this side of the city .  i know people .  and those people know people .  all across omnia  there   s people who know people .  people who believe in the turtle .           you know  i never meant for people to believe in the turtle     said didactylos unhappily .     it   s just a big turtle .  it just exists .  things just happen that way .  i don   t think the turtle gives a damn .  i just thought it might be a good idea to write things down and explain things a bit .         people sat up all night  on guard  while other people made copies     said simony  ignoring him .     passing them from hand to hand .  everyone making a copy and passing it on .  like a fire spreading underground .         would this be lots of copies .     said didactylos cautiously .      hundreds .  thousands .         i suppose it   s too late to ask for  say  a five percent royalty .     said didactylos  looking hopeful for a moment .     no .  probably out of the question  i expect .  no .  forget i even asked .      a few flying fish zipped out of the waves  pursued by a dolphin .      can   t help feeling a bit sorry for that young brutha     said didactylos .      priests are expendable     said simony .     there   s too many of them .         he had all our books     said urn .      he   ll probably float with all that knowledge in him     said didactylos .      he was mad  anyway     said simony .     i saw him whispering to that tortoise .         i wish we still had it .  there   s good eating on one of those things     said didactylos .       it wasn   t much of a cave  just a deep hollow carved by the endless desert winds and  a long time ago  even by water .  but it was enough .     brutha knelt on the stony floor and raised the rock over his head .   there was a buzzing in his ears and his eyeballs felt as though they were set in sand .  no water since sunset and no food for a hundred years .  he had to do it .      i   m sorry     he said  and brought the rock down .   the snake had been watching him intently but in its early morning torpor it was too slow to dodge .  the cracking noise was a sound that brutha knew his conscience would replay to him  over and over again .      good     said om  beside him .     now skin it  and don   t waste the juice .  save the skin  too .         i didn   t want to do it     said brutha .      look at it this way     said om     if you   d walked in the cave without me to warn you  you   d be lying on the floor now with a foot the size of a wardrobe .  do unto others before they do unto you .         it   s not even a very big snake     said brutha .      and then while you   re writhing there in indescribable agony  you imagine all the things you would have done to that damn snake if you   d got to it first     said om .     well  your wish has been granted .  don   t give any to vorbis     he added .      he   s running a bad fever .  he keeps muttering .         do you really think you   ll get him back to the citadel and they   ll believe you .     said om .      brother nhumrod always said i was very truthful     said brutha .  he smashed the rock on the cave wall to create a crude cutting edge  and gingerly started dismembering the snake .     anyway  there isn   t anything else i can do .  i couldn   t just leave him .         yes you could     said om .      to die in the desert .           yes .  it   s easy .  much easier than not leaving him to die in the desert .         no .         this is how they do things in ethics  is it .     said om sarcastically .      i don   t know .  it   s how i   m doing it .          the unnamed boat bobbed in a gully between the rocks .  there was a low cliff beyond the beach .  simony climbed back down it  to where the philosophers were huddling out of the wind .      i know this area     he said .     we   re a few miles from the village where a friend lives .  all we have to do is wait till nightfall .         why   re you doing all this .     said urn .     i mean  what   s the point .         have you ever heard of a country called istanzia .     said simony .     it wasn   t very big .  it had nothing anyone wanted .  it was just a place for people to live .         omnia conquered it fifteen years ago     said didactylos .      that   s right .  my country     said simony .     i was just a kid then .  but i won   t forget .  nor will others .  there   s lots of people with a reason to hate the church .         i saw you standing close to vorbis     said urn .     i thought you were protecting him .         oh  i was  i was     said simony .     i don   t want anyone to kill him before i do .      didactylos wrapped his toga around himself and shivered .       the sun was riveted to the copper dome of the sky .  brutha dozed in the cave .  in his own corner  vorbis tossed and turned .     om sat waiting in the cave mouth .   waited expectantly .   waited in dread .   and they came .   they came out from under scraps of stone  and from cracks in the rock .  they fountained up from the sand  they distilled out of the wavering sky .  the air was filled with their voices  as faint as the whispering of gnats .   om tensed .   the language he spoke was not like the language of the high gods .  it was hardly language at all .  it was a mere modulation of desires and hungers  without nouns and with only a few verbs .      want     om replied  mine .   there were thousands of them .  he was stronger  yes  he had a believer  but they filled the sky like locusts .  the longing poured down on him with the weight of hot lead .  the only advantage  the only advantage  was that the small gods had no concept of working together .  that was a luxury that came with evolution .      want     mine .   the chittering became a whine .   but you can have the other one  said om    .  dull  hard  enclosed  shut in     i know  said om .  but this one  mine .   the psychic shout echoed around the desert .  the small gods fled .   except for one .   om was aware that it had not been swarming with the others  but had been hovering gently over a piece of sun bleached bone .  it had said nothing .   he turned his attention on it .     you .  mine .   i know  said the small god .  it knew speech  real god speech  although it talked as though every word had been winched from the pit of memory .   who are you .  said om .   the small god stirred .   there was a city once  said the small god .  not just a city .  an empire of cities .  i  i  i remember there were canals  and gardens .  there was a lake .  they had floating gardens on the lake  i recall .  i  i .  and there were temples .  such temples as you may dream of .  great pyramid temples that reached to the sky .  thousands were sacrificed .  to the greater glory .   om felt sick .  this wasn   t just a small god .  this was a small god who hadn   t always been small     who were you .   and there were temples .  i  i  me .  such temples as you may dream of .  great pyramid temples that reached to the sky .  the glory of .  thousands were sacrificed .  me .  to the greater glory .   and there were temples .  me  me  me .  greater glory .  such glory temples as you may dream of .  great pyramid dream temples that reached to the sky .  me  me .  sacrificed .  dream .  thousands were sacrificed .  to me the greater sky glory .   you were their god .  om managed .   thousands were sacrificed .  to the greater glory .   can you hear me .   thousands sacrificed greater glory .  me  me  me .   what was your name .  shouted om .   name .   a hot wind blew over the desert  shifting a few grains of sand .  the echo of a lost god blew away  tumbling over and over  until it vanished among the rocks .     who were you .   there was no answer .   that   s what happens  om thought .  being a small god was bad  except at the time you hardly knew that it was bad because you only barely knew anything at all  but all the time there was something which was just possibly the germ of hope  the knowledge and belief that one day you might be more than you were now .   but how much worse to have been a god  and to now be no more than a smoky bundle of memories  blown back and forth across the sand made from the crumbled stones of your temples     om turned around and  on stumpy legs  walked purposefully back into the cave until he came to brutha   s head  which he butted .      wst .         just checking you   re still alive .         fgfl .         right .      om staggered back to his guard position at the mouth of the cave .   there were said to be oases in the desert  but they were never in the same place twice .  the desert wasn   t mappable .  it ate map makers .   so did the lions .  om could remember them .  scrawny things  not like the lions of the howondaland veldt .  more wolf than lion  more hyena than either .  not brave  but with a kind of vicious  rangy cowardice that was much more dangerous     lions .   oh  dear     he had to find lions .   lions drank .       brutha awoke as the afternoon light dragged across the desert .  his mouth tasted of snake .   om was butting him on the foot .      come on  come on  you   re missing the best of the day .         is there any water .     brutha murmured thickly .      there will be .  only five miles off .  amazing luck .      brutha pulled himself up .  every muscle ached .      how do you know .         i can sense it .  i am a god  you know .         you said you could only sense minds .      om cursed .  brutha didn   t forget things .      it   s more complicated than that     lied om .     trust me .  come on  while there   s some twilight .  and don   t forget mister vorbis .      vorbis was curled up .  he looked at brutha with unfocused eyes  stood up like a man still asleep when brutha helped him .      i think he might have been poisoned     said brutha .     there   s sea creatures with stings .  and poisonous corals .  he keeps moving his lips  but i can   t make out what he   s trying to say .         bring him along     said om .     bring him along .  oh  yes .         you wanted me to abandon him last night     said brutha .      did i .     said om  his very shell radiating innocence .     well  maybe i   ve been to ethics .  had a change of heart .  i can see he   s with us for a purpose now .  good old vorbis .  bring him along .          simony and the two philosophers stood on the clifftop  looking across the parched farmlands of omnia to the distant rock of the citadel .  two of them looking  anyway .      give me a lever and a place to stand  and i   d smash that place like an egg     said simony  leading didactylos down the narrow path .      looks big     said urn .      see the gleam .  those are the doors .         look massive .         i was wondering     said simony     about the boat .  the way it moved .  something like that could smash the doors  right .         you   d have to flood the valley     said urn .      i mean if it was on wheels .         hah  yes     said urn  sarcastically .  it had been a long day .     yes  if i had a forge and half a dozen blacksmiths and a lot of help .  wheels .  no problem .  but           we shall have to see     said simony     what we can do .          the sun was on the horizon when brutha  his arm around vorbis   s shoulders  reached the next rock island .  it was bigger than the one with the snake .  the wind had carved the stones into gaunt  unlikely shapes  like fingers .  there were even plants lodging in crevices in the rock .      there   s water somewhere     said brutha .      there   s always water  even in the worst deserts     said om .     one  oh  maybe two inches of rain a year .         i can smell something     said brutha  as his feet stopped treading on sand and crunched up the limestone scree around the boulders .     something rank .         hold me over your head .      om scanned the rocks .      right .  now bring me down again .  and head for that rock that looks like   that looks very unexpected  really .      brutha stared .     it does  too     he croaked  eventually .     amazing to think it was carved by the wind .         the wind god has a sense of humor     said om .     although it   s pretty basic .      near the foot of the rock huge slabs had fallen over the years  forming a jagged pile with  here and there  shadowy openings .      that smell       brutha began .      probably animals come to drink the water     said om .   brutha   s foot kicked against something yellow white  which bounced away among the rocks making a noise like a sackful of coconuts .  in the stifling empty silence of the desert  it echoed loudly .      what was that .         definitely not a skull     lied om .     don   t worry           there   s bones everywhere .         well .  what did you expect .  this is a desert .  people die here .  it   s a very popular occupation in this vicinity .      brutha picked up a bone .  he was  as he well knew  stupid .  but people didn   t gnaw their own bones after they died .      om           there   s water here .     shouted om .     we need it .  but   there   s probably one or two drawbacks .         what kind of drawbacks .         as in natural hazards .         like    .         well  you know lions .     said om desperately .      there   s lions here .         well   slightly .         slightly lions .           only one lion .         only one              generally a solitary creature .  most to be feared are the old males  who are forced into the most inhospitable regions by their younger rivals .  they are evil tempered and cunning and in their extremity have lost all fear of man        the memory faded  letting go of brutha   s vocal cords .      that kind .     brutha finished .      it won   t take any notice of us once it   s fed     said om .      yes .         they go to sleep .         after feeding    .      brutha looked around at vorbis  who was slumped against a rock .      feeding .     he repeated .      it   ll be a kindness     said om .      to the lion  yes .  you want to use him as bait .         he   s not going to survive the desert .  anyway  he   s done much worse to thousands of people .  he   ll be dying for a good cause .         a good cause .         i like it .      there was a growl  from somewhere in the stones .  it wasn   t loud  but it was a sound with sinews in it .  brutha backed away .      we don   t just throw people to the lions .         he does .         yes .  i don   t .         all right  we   ll get on top of a slab and when the lion starts on him you can brain it with a rock .  he   ll probably get away with an arm or a leg .  he   ll never miss it .         no .  you can   t do that to people just because they   re helpless .           you know  i can   t think of a better time .      there was another growl from the rock pile .  it sounded closer .   brutha looked down desperately at the scattered bones .  among them  half hidden by debris  was a sword .  it was old  and not well made  and scoured by sand .  he picked it up gingerly by the blade .      other end     said om .      i know .         can you use one .         i don   t know .         i really hope you   re a fast learner .      the lion emerged  slowly .   desert lions  it has been said  are not like the lions of the veldt .  they had been  when the great desert had been verdant woodland .   then there had been time to lie around for most of the day  looking majestic  in between regular meals of goat .    but the woodland had become scrubland  the scrubland had become  well  poorer scrubland  and the goats and the people and  eventually  even the cities  went away .   the lions stayed .  there   s always something to eat  if you   re hungry enough .  people still had to cross the desert .  there were lizards .  there were snakes .  it wasn   t much of an ecological niche  but the lions were hanging on to it like grim death  which was what happened to most people who met a desert lion .   someone had already met this one .   its mane was matted .  ancient scars criss crossed its pelt .  it dragged itself towards brutha  back legs trailing uselessly .      it   s hurt     said brutha .      oh  good .  and there   s plenty of eating on one of those     said om .     a bit stringy  but        the lion collapsed  its toast rack chest heaving .  a spear was protruding from its flank .  flies  which can always find something to eat in any desert  flew up in a swarm .   brutha put down the sword .  om stuck his head in his shell .      oh no     he murmured .     twenty million people in this world  and the only one who believes in me is a suicide           we can   t just leave it     said brutha .      we can .  we can .  it   s a lion .  you leave lions alone .      brutha knelt down .  the lion opened one crusted yellow eye  too weak even to bite him .      you   re going to die  you   re going to die .  i   m not going to find anyone to believe in me out here        brutha   s knowledge of animal anatomy was rudimentary .  although some of the inquisitors had an enviable knowledge of the insides of the human body that is denied to all those who are not allowed to open it while it   s still working  medicine as such was frowned upon in omnia .  but somewhere  in every village  was someone who officially didn   t set bones and who didn   t know a few things about certain plants  and who stayed out of reach of the quisition because of the fragile gratitude of their patients .  and every peasant picked up a smattering of knowledge .  acute toothache can burn through all but the strongest in faith .   brutha grasped the spear haft .  the lion growled as he moved it .        can   t you speak to it .     said brutha .      it   s an animal .         so are you .  you could try to calm it down .  because if it gets excited        om snapped into concentration .   in fact the lion   s mind contained nothing but pain  a spreading nebula of the stuff  overcoming even the normal background hunger .  om tried to encircle the pain  make it flow away   and not to think about what would happen if it went .  by the feel of things  the lion had not eaten for days .   the lion grunted as brutha withdrew the spearhead .      omnian     he said .     it hasn   t been there long .  it must have met the soldiers when they were on the way to ephebe .  they must have passed close by .     he tore another strip from his robe  and tried to clean the wound .      we want to eat it  not cure it .     shouted om .     what   re you thinking of .  you think it   s going to be grateful .         it wanted to be helped .         and soon it will want to be fed  have you thought about that .         it   s looking pathetically at me .         probably never seen a week   s meals all walking around on one pair of legs before .      that wasn   t true  om reflected .  brutha was shedding weight like an ice cube  out here in the desert .  that kept him alive .  the boy was a two legged camel .   brutha crunched towards the rock pile  shards and bones shifting under his feet .  the boulders formed a maze of half open tunnels and caves .  by the smell  the lion had lived there for a long time  and had quite often been ill .     he stared at the nearest cave for some time .      what   s so fascinating about a lion   s den .     said om .      the way it   s got steps down into it  i think     said brutha .       didactylos could feel the crowd .  it filled the barn .      how many are there .     he said .      hundreds .     said urn .     they   re even sitting on the rafters .  and   master .         yes .         there   s even one or two priests .  and dozens of soldiers .         don   t worry     said simony  joining them on the makeshift platform made of fig barrels .     they are turtle believers  just like you .  we have friends in unexpected places .         but i don   t       didactylos began  helplessly .      there isn   t anyone here who doesn   t hate the church with all their soul     said simony .      but that   s not           they   re just waiting for someone to lead them .         but i never           i know you won   t let us down .  you   re a man of reason .  urn  come over here .  there   s a blacksmith i want you to meet        didactylos turned his face to the crowd .  he could feel the hot  hushed silence of their stares .       each drop took minutes .   it was hypnotic .  brutha found himself staring at each developing drip .  it was almost impossible to see it grow  but they had been growing and dripping for thousands of years .      how .     said om .        water seeps down after the rains     said brutha .     it lodges in the rocks .  don   t gods know these things .         we don   t need to .     om looked around .     let   s go .  i hate this place .         it   s just an old temple .  there   s nothing here .         that   s what i mean .      sand and rubble half filled it .  light lanced in through the broken roof high above  on to the slope that they had climbed down .  brutha wondered how many of the wind carved rocks in the desert had once been buildings .  this one must have been huge  perhaps a mighty tower .  and then the desert had come .   there were no whispering voices here .  even the small gods kept away from abandoned temples  for the same reason that people kept away from graveyards .  the only sound was the occasional plink of the water .   it dripped into a shallow pool in front of what looked like an altar .  from the pool it had worn a groove in the slabs of the floor all the way to a round pit  which appeared to be bottomless .  there were a few statues  all of them toppled  they were heavy proportioned  lacking any kind of detail  each one a child   s clay model chiseled in granite .  the distant walls had once been covered with some kind of bas relief  but it had crumbled away except in a few places  which showed strange designs that mainly consisted of tentacles .      who were the people who lived here .     said brutha .      i don   t know .         what god did they worship .         i don   t know .         the statues are made of granite  but there   s no granite near here .         they were very devout  then .  they dragged it all the way .           and the altar block is covered in grooves .         ah .  extremely devout .  that would be to let the blood run off .         you really think they did human sacrifice .         i don   t know .  i want to get out of here .         why .  there   s water and it   s cool           because   a god lived here .  a powerful god .  thousands worshiped it .  i can feel it .  you know .  it comes out of the walls .  a great god .  mighty were his dominions and magnificent was his word .  armies went forth in his name and conquered and slew .  that kind of thing .  and now no one  not you  not me  no one  even knows who the god was or his name or what he looked like .  lions drink in the holy places and those little squidgy things with eight legs  there   s one by your foot  what d   you call    em  the ones with the antennae  crawl beneath the altar .  now do you understand .         no     said brutha .      don   t you fear death .  you   re a human .      brutha considered this .  a few feet away .  vorbis stared mutely at the patch of sky .      he   s awake .  he   s just not speaking .         who cares .  i didn   t ask you about him .         well   sometimes   when i   m on catacomb duty   it   s the kind of place where you can   t help   i mean  all the skulls and things   and and the book says           there you are     said om  a note of bitter triumph in his voice .     you don   t know .  that   s what stops everyone going mad  the uncertainty of it  the feeling that it might work out all right after all .  but it   s different for gods .  we do know .  you know that story about the sparrow flying through a room .         no .         everyone knows it .           not me .         about life being like a sparrow flying through a room .  nothing but darkness outside .  and it flies through the room and there   s just a moment of warmth and light .         there are windows open .     said brutha .      can   t you imagine what it   s like to be that sparrow  and know about the darkness .  to know that afterward there   ll be nothing to remember  ever  except that one moment of the light .         no .         no .  of course you can   t .  but that   s what it   s like  being a god .  and this place   it   s a morgue .      brutha looked around at the ancient  shadowy temple .      well   do you know what it   s like  being human .      om   s head darted into his shell for a moment  the nearest he was capable of to a shrug .      compared to a god .  easy .  get born .  obey a few rules .  do what you   re told .  die .  forget .      brutha stared at him .      is something wrong .      brutha shook his head .  then he stood up and walked over to vorbis .   the deacon had drunk water from brutha   s cupped hands .  but there was a switched off quality about him .  he walked  he drank  he breathed .  or something did .  his body did .  the dark eyes opened  but appeared to be looking at nothing that brutha could see .  there was no sense that anyone was looking out through them .  brutha was certain that if he walked away  vorbis would sit on the cracked flagstones until he very gently fell over .  vorbis    body was present  but the whereabouts of his mind was probably not locatable on any normal atlas .     it was just that  here and now and suddenly  brutha felt so alone that even vorbis was good company .      why do you bother with him .  he   s had thousands of people killed .         yes  but perhaps he thought you wanted it .         i never said i wanted that .         you didn   t care     said brutha .      but i           shut up .      om   s mouth opened in astonishment .      you could have helped people     said brutha .     but all you did was stamp around and roar and try to make people afraid .  like   like a man hitting a donkey with a stick .  but people like vorbis made the stick so good  that   s all the donkey ends up believing in .         that could use some work  as a parable     said om sourly .      this is real life i   m talking about .         it   s not my fault if people misuse the           it is .  it has to be .  if you muck up people   s minds just because you want them to believe in you  what they do is all your fault .      brutha glared at the tortoise  and then stamped off toward the pile of rubble that dominated one end of the ruined temple .  he rummaged around in it .      what are you looking for .         we   ll need to carry water     said brutha .      there won   t be anything     said om .     people just left .  the land ran out and so did the people .  they took everything with them .  why bother to look .      brutha ignored him .  there was something under the rocks and sand .      why worry about vorbis .     om whined .     in a hundred years    time  he   ll be dead anyway .  we   ll all be dead .      brutha tugged at the piece of curved pottery .  it came away  and turned out to be about two thirds of a wide bowl  broken right across .  it had been almost as wide as brutha   s outstretched arms  but had been too broken for anyone to loot .   it was useful for nothing .  but it had once been useful for something .  there were embossed figures around its rim .  brutha peered at them  for want of something to distract himself  while om   s voice droned on in his head .   the figures looked more or less human .  and they were engaged in religion .  you could tell by the knives  it   s not murder if you do it for a god  .  in the center of the bowl was a larger figure  obviously important  some kind of god they were doing it for        what .     he said .      i said  in a hundred years    time we   ll all be dead .      brutha stared at the figures around the bowl .  no one knew who their god was  and they were gone .  lions slept in the holy places and        chilopoda aridius  the common desert centipede  his memory resident library supplied        scuttled beneath the altar .      yes     said brutha .     we will .     he raised the bowl over his head  and turned .   om ducked into his shell .      but here       brutha gritted his teeth as he staggered under the weight .     and now        he threw the bowl .  it landed against the altar .  fragments of ancient pottery fountained up  and clattered down again .  the echoes boomed around the temple .         we are alive .        he picked up om  who had withdrawn completely into his shell .      and we   ll make it home .  all of us     he said .     i know it .         it   s written  is it .     said om  his voice muffled .      it is said .  and if you argue   a tortoise shell is a pretty good water container  i expect .         you wouldn   t .         who knows .  i might .  in a hundred years    time we   ll all be dead  you said .         yes .  yes .     said om desperately .     but here and now           right .          didactylos smiled .  it wasn   t something that came easily to him .  it wasn   t that he was a somber man  but he could not see the smiles of others .  it took several dozen muscle movements to smile  and there was no return on his investment .   he   d spoken many times to crowds in ephebe  but they were invariably made up of other philosophers  whose shouts of    bloody daft .         you   re making it up as you go along .     and other contributions to the debate always put him at his ease .  that was because no one really paid any attention .  they were just working out what they were going to say next .   but this crowd put him in mind of brutha .  their listening was like a huge pit waiting for his words to fill it .  the trouble was that he was talking in philosophy  but they were listening in gibberish .      you can   t believe in great a   tuin     he said .     great a   tuin exists .  there   s no point in believing in things that exist .           someone   s put up their hand     said urn .      yes .         sir  surely only things that exist are worth believing in .     said the enquirer  who was wearing a uniform of a sergeant of the holy guard .      if they exist  you don   t have to believe in them     said didactylos .     they just are .     he sighed .     what can i tell you .  what do you want to hear .  i just wrote down what people know .  mountains rise and fall  and under them the turtle swims onward .  men live and die  and the turtle moves .  empires grow and crumble  and the turtle moves .  gods come and go  and still the turtle moves .  the turtle moves .      from the darkness came a voice     and that is really true .      didactylos shrugged .     the turtle exists .  the world is a flat disc .  the sun turns around it once every day  dragging its light behind it .  and this will go on happening  whether you believe it is true or not .  it is real .  i don   t know about truth .  truth is a lot more complicated than that .  i don   t think the turtle gives a bugger whether it   s true or not  to tell you the truth .      simony pulled urn to one side as the philosopher went on talking .      this isn   t what they came to hear .  can   t you do anything .         sorry .     said urn .      they don   t want philosophy .  they want a reason to move against the church .  now .  vorbis is dead  the cenobiarch is gaga  the hierarchy are busy stabbing one another in the back .  the citadel is like a big rotten plum .         still a few wasps in it  though     said urn .     you said you   ve only got a tenth of the army .           but they   re free men     said simony .     free in their heads .  they   ll be fighting for more than fifty cents a day .      urn looked down at his hands .  he often did that when he was uncertain about anything  as if they were the only things he was sure of in all the world .      they   ll get the odds down to three to one before the rest know what   s happening     said simony grimly .     did you talk to the blacksmith .         yes .         can you do it .         i   think so .  it wasn   t what i           they tortured his father .  just for having a horseshoe hanging up in his forge  when everyone knows that smiths have to have their little rituals .  and they took his son off into the army .  but he   s got a lot of helpers .  they   ll work through the night .  all you have to do is tell them what you want .         i   ve made some sketches           good     said simony .     listen  urn .  the church is run by people like vorbis .  that   s how it all works .  millions of people have died for   for nothing but lies .  we can stop all that        didactylos had stopped talking .      he   s muffed it     said simony .     he could have done anything with them .  and he just told them a lot of facts .  you can   t inspire people with facts .  they need a cause .  they need a symbol .          they left the temple just before sundown .  the lion had crawled into the shade of some rocks  but stood up unsteadily to watch them go .      it   ll track us     moaned om .     they do that .  for miles and miles .         we   ll survive .           i wish i had your confidence .         ah  but i have a god to have faith in .         there   ll be no more ruined temples .         there   ll be something else .         and not even snake to eat .         but i walk with my god .         not as a snack  though .  and you   re walking the wrong way  too .         no .  i   m still heading away from the coast .         that   s what i mean .         how far can a lion go with a spear wound like that in him .         what   s that got to do with anything .         everything .      and  half an hour later  a black shadowy line on the silver moonlit desert  there were the tracks .      the soldiers came this way .  we just have to follow the tracks back .  if we head where they   ve come from  we   ll get where we   re going .         we   ll never do it .         we   re traveling light .         oh  yeah .  they were burdened by all the food and water they had to carry     said om bitterly .     how lucky for us we haven   t got any .      brutha glanced at vorbis .  he was walking unaided now  provided that you gently turned him around whenever you needed to change direction .   but even om had to admit that the tracks were some comfort .  in a way they were alive  in the same way that an echo is alive .  people had been this way  not long ago .  there were other people in the world .  someone  somewhere  was surviving .   or not .  after an hour or so they came across a mound beside the track .  there was a helmet atop it  and a sword stuck in the sand .      a lot of soldiers died to get here quickly     said brutha .   whoever had taken enough time to bury their dead had also drawn a symbol in the sand of the mound .  brutha half expected it to be a turtle  but the desert wind had not quite eroded the crude shape of a pair of horns .      i don   t understand that     said om .     they don   t really believe i exist  but they go and put something like that on a grave .         it   s hard to explain .  i think it   s because they believe they exist     said brutha .     it   s because they   re people  and so was he .      he pulled the sword out of the sand .      what do you want that for .         might be useful .         against who .         might be useful .      an hour later the lion  who was limping after brutha  also arrived at the grave .  it had lived in the desert for sixteen years  and the reason it had lived so long was that it had not died  and it had not died because it never wasted handy protein .  it dug .   humans have always wasted handy protein ever since they started wondering who had lived in it .   but  on the whole  there are worse places to be buried than inside a lion .       there were snakes and lizards on the rock islands .  they were probably very nourishing and every one was  in its own way  a taste explosion .   there was no more water .   but there were plants   more or less .  they looked like groups of stones  except where a few had put up a central flower spike that was a brilliant pink and purple in the dawn light .      where do they get the water from .         fossil seas .         water that   s turned to stone .         no .  water that sank down thousands of years ago .  right down in the bedrock .         can you dig down to it .         don   t be stupid .      brutha glanced from the flower to the nearest rock island .      honey     he said .      what .          the bees had a nest high on the side of a spire of rock .  the buzzing could be heard from ground level .  there was no possible way up .      nice try     said om .   the sun was up .  already the rocks were warm to the touch .     get some rest     said om  kindly .     i   ll keep watch .         watch for what .         i   ll watch and find out .      brutha led vorbis into the shade of a large boulder  and gently pushed him down .  then he lay down too .   the thirst wasn   t too bad yet .  he   d drunk from the temple pool until he squelched as he walked .  later on  they might find a snake   when you considered what some people in the world had  life wasn   t too bad .   vorbis lay on his side  his black on black eyes staring at nothing .   brutha tried to sleep .     he had never dreamed .  didactylos had been quite excited about that .  someone who remembered everything and didn   t dream would have to think slowly  he said .  imagine a heart   he said  that was nearly all memory  and had hardly any beats to spare for the everyday purposes of thinking .  that would explain why brutha moved his lips while he thought .   so this couldn   t have been a dream .  it must have been the sun .   he heard om   s voice in his head .  the tortoise sounded as though he was holding a conversation with people brutha could not hear .   mine .   go away .   no .   mine .   both of them .   mine .   brutha turned his head .   the tortoise was in a gap between two rocks  neck extended and weaving from side to side .  there was another sound  a sort of gnat like whining  that came and went   and promises in his head .   they flashed past   faces talking to him  shapes  visions of greatness  moments of opportunity  picking him up  taking him high above the world  all this was his  he could do anything  all he had to do was believe  in me  in me  in me     an image formed in front of him .  there  on a stone beside him  was a roast pig surrounded by fruit  and a mug of beer so cold the air was frosting on the sides .   mine .   brutha blinked .  the voices faded .  so did the food .   he blinked again .   there were strange after images  not seen but felt .  perfect though his memory was  he could not remember what the voices had said or what the other pictures had been .  all that lingered was a memory of roast pork and cold beer .      that   s because they don   t know what to offer you     said om   s voice  quietly .     so they try to offer you anything .  generally they start with visions of food and carnal gratification .         they got as far as the food     said brutha .      good job i overcame them  then     said om .     no telling what they might have achieved with a young man like yourself .      brutha raised himself on his elbows .   vorbis had not moved .      were they trying to get through to him  too .         i suppose so .  wouldn   t work .  nothing gets in  nothing gets out .  never seen a mind so turned in on itself .         will they be back .         oh  yes .  it   s not as if they   ve got anything else to do .         when they do     said brutha  feeling lightheaded     could you wait until they   ve shown me visions of carnal gratification .         very bad for you .         brother nhumrod was very down on them .  but i think perhaps we should know our enemies  yes .      brutha   s voice faded to a croak .      i could have done with the vision of the drink     he said  wearily .     the shadows were long .  he looked around in amazement .      how long were they trying .         all day .  persistent devils  too .  thick as flies .      brutha learned why at sunset .   he met st .  ungulant the anchorite  friend of all small gods .  everywhere .          well  well  well     said st .  ungulant .     we don   t get very many visitors up here .  isn   t that so  angus .      he addressed the air beside him .   brutha was trying to keep his balance  because the cartwheel rocked dangerously every time he moved .  they   d left vorbis seated on the desert twenty feet below  hugging his knees and staring at nothing .   the wheel had been nailed flat on top of a slim pole .  it was just wide enough for one person to lie uncomfortably .  but st .  ungulant looked designed to lie uncomfortably .  he was so thin that even skeletons would say     isn   t he thin .     he was wearing some sort of minimalist loin cloth  insofar as it was possible to tell under the beard and hair .   it had been quite hard to ignore st .  ungulant  who had been capering up and down at the top of his pole shouting    coo ee .     and    over here .     there was a slightly smaller pole a few feet away  with an old fashioned half moon cut out on the door privy on it .  just because you were an anchorite  st .  ungulant said  didn   t mean you had to give up everything .   brutha had heard of anchorites  who were a kind of one way prophet .  they went out into the desert but did not come back  preferring a hermit   s life of dirt and hardship and dirt and holy contemplation and dirt .  many of them liked to make life even more uncomfortable for themselves by being walled up in cells or living  quite appropriately  at the top of a pole .  the omnian church encouraged them  on the basis that it was best to get madmen as far away as possible where they couldn   t cause any trouble and could be cared for by the community  insofar as the community consisted of lions and buzzards and dirt .      i was thinking of adding another wheel     said st .  ungulant     just over there .  to catch the morning sun  you know .      brutha looked around him .  nothing but flat rock and sand stretched away on every side .      don   t you get the sun everywhere all the time .     he said .      but it   s much more important in the morning     said st .  ungulant .     besides  angus says we ought to have a patio .         he could barbecue on it     said om  inside brutha   s head .      um     said brutha .     what   religion   are you a saint of  exactly .      an expression of embarrassment crossed the very small amount of face between st .  ungulant   s eyebrows and his mustache .      uh .  none  really .  that was all rather a mistake     he said .     my parents named me sevrian thaddeus ungulant  and then one day  of course  most amusing  someone drew attention to the initials .  after that  it all seemed rather inevitable .      the wheel rocked slightly .  st .  ungulant   s skin was almost blackened by the desert sun .      i   ve had to pick up herming as i went along  of course     he said .     i taught myself .  i   m entirely self taught .  you can   t find a hermit to teach you herming  because of course that rather spoils the whole thing .         er   but there   s   angus .     said brutha  staring at the spot where he believed angus to be  or at least where he believed st .  ungulant believed angus to be .      he   s over here now     said the saint sharply  pointing to a different part of the wheel .     but he doesn   t do any of the herming .  he   s not  you know  trained .  he   s just company .  my word  i   d have gone quite mad if it wasn   t for angus cheering me up all the time .         yes   i expect you would     said brutha .  he smiled at the empty air  in order to show willing .      actually  it   s a pretty good life .  the hours are rather long but the food and drink are extremely worthwhile .      brutha had a distinct feeling that he knew what was going to come next .      beer cold enough .     he said .      extremely frosty     said st .  ungulant  beaming .      and the roast pig .      st .  ungulant   s smile was manic .      all brown and crunchy round the edges  yes     he said .      but i expect  er   you eat the occasional lizard or snake  too .         funny you should say that .  yes .  every once in a while .  just for a bit of variety .         and mushrooms  too .     said om .      any mushrooms in these parts .     said brutha innocently .   st .  ungulant nodded happily .      after the annual rains  yes .  red ones with yellow spots .  the desert becomes really interesting after the mushroom season .           full of giant purple singing slugs .  talking pillars of flame .  exploding giraffes .  that sort of thing .     said brutha carefully .      good heavens  yes     said the saint .     i don   t know why .  i think they   re attracted by the mushrooms .      brutha nodded .      you   re catching on  kid     said om .      and i expect sometimes you drink   water .     said brutha .      you know  it   s odd  isn   t it     said st .  ungulant .     there   s all this wonderful stuff to drink but every so often i get this  well  i can only call it a craving  for a few sips of water .  can you explain that .         it must be   a little hard to come by     said brutha  still talking very carefully  like someone playing a fifty pound fish on a fifty one pound breaking strain fishing line .      strange  really     said st .  ungulant .     when ice cold beer is so readily available  too .         where  uh  do you get it .  the water .     said brutha .      you know the stone plants .         the ones with the big flowers .         if you cut open the fleshy part of the leaves  there   s up to half a pint of water     said the saint .     it tastes like weewee  mind you .         i think we could manage to put up with that     said brutha  through dry lips .  he backed toward the rope ladder that was the saint   s contact with the ground .      are you sure you won   t stay .     said st .  ungulant .     it   s wednesday .  we get sucking pig plus chef   s selection of sun drenched dew fresh vegetables on wednesdays .         we  uh  have lots to do     said brutha  halfway down the swaying ladder .      sweets from the trolley .           i think perhaps        st .  ungulant looked down sadly at brutha helping vorbis away across the wilderness .      and afterward there   s probably mints .     he shouted  through cupped hands .     no .      soon the figures were mere dots on the sand .      there may be visions of sexual grati   no  i tell a lie  that   s fridays       st .  ungulant murmured .   now that the visitors had gone  the air was once again filled with the zip and whine of the small gods .  there were billions of them .   st .  ungulant smiled .   he was  of course  mad .  he   d occasionally suspected this .  but he took the view that madness should not be wasted .  he dined daily on the food of the gods  drank the rarest vintages  ate fruits that were not only out of season but out of reality .  having to drink the occasional mouthful of brackish water and chew the odd lizard leg for medicinal purposes was a small price to pay .   he turned back to the laden table that shimmered in the air .  all this   and all the little gods wanted was someone to know about them  someone to even believe that they existed .   there was jelly and ice cream today  too .      all the more for us  eh  angus .      yes  said angus .       the fighting was over in ephebe .  it hadn   t lasted long  especially when the slaves joined in .  there were too many narrow streets  too many ambushes and  above all  too much terrible determination .  it   s generally held that free men will always triumph over slaves  but perhaps it all depends on your point of view .   besides  the ephebian garrison commander had declared somewhat nervously that slavery would henceforth be abolished  which infuriated the slaves .  what would be the point of saving up to become free if you couldn   t own slaves afterwards .  besides  how   d they eat .   the omnians couldn   t understand  and uncertain people fight badly .  and vorbis had gone .  certainties seemed less certain when those eyes were elsewhere .   the tyrant was released from his prison .  he spent his first day of freedom carefully composing messages to the other small countries along the coast .   it was time to do something about omnia .       brutha sang .   his voice echoed off the rocks .  flocks of scalbies shook off their lazy pedestrian habits and took off frantically  leaving feathers behind in their rush to get airborne .  snakes wriggled into cracks in the stone .   you could live in the desert .  or at least survive     getting back to omnia could only be a matter of time .  one more day     vorbis trooped along a little behind him .  he said nothing and  when spoken to  gave no sign that he had understood what had been said to him .   om  bumping along in brutha   s pack  began to feel the acute depression that steals over every realist in the presence of an optimist .   the strained strains of claws of iron shall rend the ungodly faded away .  there was a small rockslide  some way off .      we   re alive     said brutha .      for now .         and we   re close to home .         yes .           i saw a wild goat on the rocks back there .         there   s still a lot of    em about .         goats .         gods .  and the ones we had back there were the puny ones  mind you .         what do you mean .      om sighed .     it   s reasonable  isn   t it .  think about it .  the stronger ones hang around the edge  where there   s prey   i mean  people .  the weak ones get pushed out to the sandy places  where people hardly ever go           the strong gods     said brutha  thoughtfully .     gods that know about being strong .         that   s right .         not gods that know what it feels like to be weak           what .  they wouldn   t last five minutes .  it   s a god eat god world .         perhaps that explains something about the nature of gods .  strength is hereditary .  like sin .      his face clouded .      except that   it isn   t .  sin  i mean .  i think  perhaps  when we get back  i shall talk to some people .         oh  and they   ll listen  will they .         wisdom comes out of the wilderness  they say .         only the wisdom that people want .  and mushrooms .      when the sun was starting to climb brutha milked a goat .  it stood patiently while om soothed its mind .  and om didn   t suggest killing it  brutha noticed .   then they found shade again .  there were bushes here  low growing  spiky  every tiny leaf barricaded behind its crown of thorns .   om watched for a while  but the small gods on the edge of the wilderness were more cunning and less urgent .  they   d be here  probably at noon  when the sun turned the landscape into a hellish glare .  he   d hear them .  in the meantime  he could eat .   he crawled through the bushes  their thorns scraping harmlessly along his shell .  he passed another tortoise  which wasn   t inhabited by a god and gave him that vague stare that tortoises employ when they   re deciding whether something is there to be eaten or made love to  which are the only things on a normal tortoise mind .  he avoided it  and found a couple of leaves it had missed .   periodically he   d stomp back through the gritty soil and watch the sleepers .   and then he saw vorbis sit up  look around him in a slow methodical way  pick up a stone  study it carefully  and then bring it down sharply on brutha   s head .   brutha didn   t even groan .   vorbis got up and strode directly toward the bushes that hid om .  he tore the branches aside  regardless of the thorns  and pulled out the tortoise om had just met .   for a moment it was held up  legs moving slowly  before the deacon threw it overarm into the rocks .   then he picked up brutha with some effort  slung him across his shoulders  and set off towards omnia .   it happened in seconds .   om fought to stop his head and legs retracting automatically into his shell  a tortoise   s instinctive panic reaction .   vorbis was already disappearing around some rocks .   he disappeared .   om started to move forward and then ducked into his shell as a shadow skimmed over the ground .  it was a familiar shadow  and one filled with tortoise dread .     the eagle swept down and towards the spot where the stricken tortoise was struggling and  with barely a pause in the stoop  snatched the reptile and soared back up into the sky with long  lazy sweeps of its wings .   om watched it until it became a dot  and then looked away as a smaller dot detached itself and tumbled over and over toward the rocks below .   the eagle descended slowly  preparing to feed .   a breeze rattled the thornbushes and stirred the sand .  om thought he could hear the taunting  mocking voices of all the small gods .       st .  ungulant  on his bony knees  smashed open the hard swollen leaf of a stone plant .   nice lad  he thought .  talked to himself a lot  but that was only to be expected .  the desert took some people like that  didn   t it  angus .   yes  said angus .   angus didn   t want any of the brackish water .  he said it gave him wind .      please yourself     said st .  ungulant .     well  well .  here   s a little treat .      you didn   t often get chilopoda aridius out here in the open desert  and here were three  all under one rock .   funny how you felt like a little nibble  even after a good meal of petit porc r  ti avec pommes de terre nouvelles et l  gumes du jour et bi  re glac  e avec figment de l   imagination .   he was picking the legs of the second one out of his tooth when the lion padded to the top of the nearest dune behind him .   the lion was feeling odd sensations of gratitude .  it felt it should catch up with the nice food that had tended to it and  well  refrain from eating it in some symbolic way .  and now here was some more food  hardly paying it any attention .  well  it didn   t owe this one anything     it padded forward  then lumbered up into a run .   oblivious to his fate  st .  ungulant started on the third centipede .   the lion leapt     and things would have looked very bad for st .  ungulant if angus hadn   t caught it right behind the ear with a rock .       brutha was standing in the desert  except that the sand was as black as the sky and there was no sun  although everything was brilliantly lit .   ah  he thought .  so this is dreaming .   there were thousands of people walking across the desert .  they paid him no attention .  they walked as if completely unaware that they were in the middle of a crowd .   he tried to wave at them  but he was nailed to the spot .  he tried to speak  and the words evaporated in his mouth .   and then he woke up .       the first thing he saw was the light  slanting through a window .  against the light was a pair of hands  raised in the sign of the holy horns .   with some difficulty  his head screaming pain at him  brutha followed the hands along a pair of arms to where they joined not far under the bowed head of        brother nhumrod .      the master of novices looked up .      brutha .         yes .         om be praised .        brutha craned his neck to look around .      is he here .            here .  how do you feel .         i        his head ached  his back felt as though it was on fire  and there was a dull pain in his knees .      you were very badly sunburned     said nhumrod .     and that was a nasty knock on the head you had in the fall .         what fall .            fall .  from the rocks .  in the desert .  you were with the prophet     said nhumrod .     you walked with the prophet .  one of my novices .         i remember   the desert       said brutha  touching his head gingerly .     but   the   prophet    .            prophet .  people are saying you could be made a bishop  or even an iam     said nhumrod .     there   s a precedent  you know .  the most holy st .  bobby was made a bishop because he was in the desert with the prophet ossory  and he was a donkey .         but i don   t   remember   any prophet .  there was just me and        brutha stopped .  nhumrod was beaming .      vorbis .         he most graciously told me all about it     said nhumrod .     i was privileged to be in the place of lamentation when he arrived .  it was just after the sestine prayers .  the cenobiarch was just departing   well  you know the ceremony .  and there was vorbis .  covered in dust and leading a donkey .  i   m afraid you were across the back of the donkey .         i don   t remember a donkey     said brutha .         donkey .  he   d picked it up at one of the farms .  there was quite a crowd with him .        nhumrod was flushed with excitement .      and he   s declared a month of jhaddra  and double penances  and the council has given him the staff and the halter  and the cenobiarch has gone off to the hermitage in skant .         vorbis is the eighth prophet     said brutha .         prophet .  of course .         and   was there a tortoise .  has he mentioned anything about a tortoise .            tortoise .  what have tortoises got to do with anything .     nhumrod   s expression softened .     but  of course  the prophet said the sun had affected you .  he said you were raving   excuse me   about all sorts of strange things .         he did .         he sat by your bed for three days .  it was   inspiring .         how long   since we came back .            back .  almost a week .         a week .         he said the journey exhausted you very much .      brutha stared at the wall .      and he left orders that you were to be brought to him as soon as you were fully conscious     said nhumrod .     he was very definite about that .     his tone of voice suggested that he wasn   t quite sure of brutha   s state of consciousness  even now .     do you think you can walk .  i can get some novices to carry you  if you   d prefer .         i have to go and see him now .            now .  right away .  i expect you   ll want to thank him .          brutha had known about these parts of the citadel only by hearsay .  brother nhumrod had never seen them  either .  although he had not been specifically included in the summons  he had come nevertheless  fussing importantly around brutha as two sturdy novices carried him in a kind of sedan chair normally used by the more crumbling of the senior clerics .   in the center of the citadel  behind the temple  was a walled garden .  brutha looked at it with an expert eye .  there wasn   t an inch of natural soil on the bare rock   every spadeful that these shady trees grew in must have been carried up by hand .   vorbis was there  surrounded by bishops and iams .  he looked around as brutha approached .      ah  my desert companion     he said  amiably .     and brother nhumrod  i believe .  my brothers  i should like you to know that i have it in mind to raise our brutha to archbishophood .      there was a very faint murmur of astonishment from the clerics  and then a clearing of a throat .  vorbis looked at bishop treem  who was the citadel   s archivist .      well  technically he is not yet even ordained     said bishop treem  doubtfully .     but of course we all know there has been a precedent .         ossory   s ass     said brother nhumrod promptly .  he put his hand over his mouth and went red with shame and embarrassment .   vorbis smiled .      good brother nhumrod is correct     he said .     who had also not been ordained  unless the qualifications were somewhat relaxed in those days .      there was a chorus of nervous laughs  such as there always is from people who owe their jobs and possibly their lives to a whim of the person who has just cracked the not very amusing line .      although the donkey was only made a bishop     said bishop    deathwish    treem .      a role for which it was highly qualified     said vorbis sharply .     and now  you will all leave .  including subdeacon nhumrod     he added .  nhumrod went from red to white at this sudden preferment .     but archbishop brutha will remain .  we wish to talk .      the clergy withdrew .   vorbis sat down on a stone chair under an elder tree .  it was huge and ancient  quite unlike its short lived relatives outside the garden  and its berries were ripening .   the prophet sat with his elbows on the stone arms of the chair  his hands interlocked in front of him  and gave brutha a long  slow stare .      you are   recovered .     he said  eventually .      yes  lord     said brutha .     but  lord  i cannot be a bishop  i cannot even           i assure you the job does not require much intelligence     said vorbis .     if it did  bishops would not be able to do it .      there was another long silence .   when vorbis next spoke  it was as if every word was being winched up from a great depth .      we spoke once  did we not  of the nature of reality .         yes .         and about how often what is perceived is not that which is fundamentally true .         yes .      another pause .  high overhead  an eagle circled  looking for tortoises .        i am sure you have confused memories of our wanderings in the wilderness .         no .         it is only to be expected .  the sun  the thirst  the hunger           no  lord .  my memory does not confuse readily .         oh  yes .  i recall .         so do i  lord .      vorbis turned his head slightly  looking sidelong at brutha as if he was trying to hide behind his own face .      in the desert  the great god om spoke to me .         yes  lord .  he did .  every day .         you have a mighty if simple faith  brutha .  when it comes to people  i am a great judge .         yes  lord .  lord .         yes  my brutha .         nhumrod said you led me through the desert  lord .         remember what i said about fundamental truth  brutha .  of course you do .  there was a physical desert  indeed  but also a desert of the soul .  my god led me  and i led you .         ah .  yes .  i see .      overhead  the spiraling dot that was the eagle appeared to hang motionless in the air for a moment .  then it folded its wings and fell        much was given to me in the desert  brutha .  much was learned .  now i must tell the world .  that is the duty of a prophet .  to go where others have not been  and bring back the truth of it .         faster than the wind  its whole brain and body existing only as a mist around the sheer intensity of its purpose        i did not expect it to be this soon .  but om guided my steps .  and now that we have the cenobiarchy  we shall   make use of it .      somewhere out on the hillsides the eagle swooped  picked something up  and strove for height        i   m just a novice  lord vorbis .  i am not a bishop  even if everyone calls me one .         you will get used to it .      it sometimes took a long time for an idea to form in brutha   s mind  but one was forming now .  it was something about the way vorbis was sitting  something about the edge in his voice .   vorbis was afraid of him .   why me .  because of the desert .  who would care .  for all i know  it was always like this   probably it was ossory   s ass that carried him in the wilderness  who found the water  who kicked a lion to death .   because of ephebe .  who would listen .  who would care .  he is the prophet and the cenobiarch .  he could have me killed just like that .  anything he does is right .  anything he says is true .   fundamentally true .      i have something to show you that may amuse you     said vorbis  standing up .     can you walk .         oh  yes .  nhumrod was just being kind .  it   s mainly sunburn .      as they moved away  brutha saw something he hadn   t noticed before .  there were members of the holy guard  armed with bows  in the garden .  they were in the shade of trees  or amongst bushes   not too obvious  but not exactly hidden .   steps led from the garden to the maze of underground tunnels and rooms that underlay the temple and  indeed  the whole of the citadel .  noiselessly  a couple of guards fell in behind them at a respectful distance .     brutha followed vorbis through the tunnels to the artificers    quarter  where forges and workshops clustered around one wide  deep light well .  smoke and fumes billowed up around the hewn rock walls .   vorbis walked directly to a large alcove that glowed red with the light of forge fires .  several workers were clustered around something wide and curved .      there     said vorbis .     what do you think .      it was a turtle .   the iron founders had done a pretty good job  even down to the patterning on the shell and the scales on the legs .  it was about eight feet long .   brutha heard a rushing noise in his ears as vorbis spoke .      they speak poisonous gibberish about turtles  do they not .  they think they live on the back of a great turtle .  well  let them die on one .      now brutha could see the shackles attached to each iron leg .  a man  or a woman  could with great discomfort lie spread eagled on the back of the turtle and be chained firmly at the wrists and ankles .   he bent down .  yes  there was the firebox underneath .  some aspects of quisition thinking never changed .   that much iron would take ages to heat up to the point of pain .  much time  therefore  to reflect on things        what do you think .     said vorbis .   a vision of the future flashed across brutha   s mind .      ingenious     he said .      and it will be a salutary lesson for all others tempted to stray from the path of true knowledge     said vorbis .      when do you intend to  uh  demonstrate it .         i am sure an occasion will present itself     said vorbis .   when brutha straightened up  vorbis was staring at him so intently that it was as if he was reading brutha   s thoughts off the back of his head .      and now  please leave     said vorbis .     rest as much as you can   my son .          brutha walked slowly across the place  deep in unaccustomed thought .      afternoon  your reverence .         you know already .      cut me own hand off dhblah beamed over the top of his lukewarm ice cold sherbet stand .      heard it on the grapevine     he said .     here  have a slab of klatchian delight .  free .  onna stick .      the place was more crowded than usual .  even dhblah   s hot cakes were selling like hot cakes .      busy today     said brutha  hardly thinking about it .      time of the prophet  see     said dhblah     when the great god is manifest in the world .  and if you think it   s busy now  you won   t be able to swing a goat here in a few days    time .         what happens then .         you all right .  you look a bit peaky .         what happens then .         the laws .  you know .  the book of vorbis .  i suppose       dhblah leaned toward brutha   you wouldn   t have a hint  would you .  i suppose the great god didn   t happen to say anything of benefit to the convenience food industry .         i don   t know .  i think he   d like people to grow more lettuce .         really .         it   s only a guess .      dhblah grinned evilly .     ah  yes  but it   s your guess .  a nod   s as good as a poke with a sharp stick to a deaf camel  as they say .  i know where i can get my hands on a few acres of well irrigated land  funnily enough .  perhaps i ought to buy now  ahead of the crowd .         can   t see any harm in it  mr .  dhblah .      dhblah sidled closer .  this was not hard .  dhblah sidled everywhere .  crabs thought he walked sideways .      funny thing     he said .     i mean   vorbis .         funny .     said brutha .      makes you think .  even ossory must have been a man who walked around  just like you and me .  got wax in his ears  just like ordinary people .  funny thing .         what is .         the whole thing .      dhblah gave brutha another conspiratorial grin and then sold a footsore pilgrim a bowl of hummus that he would come to regret .   brutha wandered down to his dormitory .  it was empty at this time of day  hanging around dormitories being discouraged in case the presence of the rock hard mattresses engendered thoughts of sin .  his few possessions were gone from the shelf by his bunk .  probably he had a room of his own somewhere  although no one had told him .   brutha felt totally lost .   he lay down on the bunk  just in case  and offered up a prayer to om .  there was no reply .  there had been no reply for almost all of his life  and that hadn   t been too bad  because he   d never expected one .  and before  there   d always been the comfort that perhaps om was listening and simply not deigning to say anything .   now  there was nothing to hear .   he might as well be talking to himself  and listening to himself .   like vorbis .     that thought wouldn   t go away .  mind like a steel ball  om had said .  nothing got in or out .  so all vorbis could hear were the distant echoes of his own soul .  and out of the distant echoes he would forge a book of vorbis  and brutha suspected he knew what the commandments would be .  there would be talk of holy wars and blood and crusades and blood and piety and blood .   brutha got up  feeling like a fool .  but the thoughts wouldn   t go away .   he was a bishop  but he didn   t know what bishops did .  he   d only seen them in the distance  drifting along like earthbound clouds .  there was only one thing he felt he knew how to do .   some spotty boy was hoeing the vegetable garden .  he looked at brutha in amazement when he took the hoe  and was stupid enough to try to hang on to it for a moment .      i am a bishop  you know     said brutha .     anyway  you aren   t doing it right .  go and do something else .      brutha jabbed viciously at the weeds around the seedlings .  only away a few weeks and already there was a haze of green on the soil .   you   re a bishop .  for being good .  and here   s the iron turtle .  in case you   re bad .  because        there were two people in the desert  and om spoke to one of them .   it had never occurred to brutha like that before .   om had spoken to him .  admittedly  he hadn   t said the things that the great prophets said he said .  perhaps he   d never said things like that     he worked his way along to the end of the row .  then he tidied up the bean vines .   lu tze watched brutha carefully from his little shed by the soil heaps .       it was another barn .  urn was seeing a lot of barns .   they   d started with a cart  and invested a lot of time in reducing its weight as much as possible .  gearing had been a problem .  he   d been doing a lot of thinking about gears .  the ball wanted to spin much faster than the wheels wanted to turn .  that was probably a metaphor for something or other .      and i can   t get it to go backward     he said .      don   t worry     said simony .     it won   t have to go backward .  what about armor .      urn waved a distracted hand around his workshop .      this is a village forge .     he said .     this thing is twenty feet long .  zacharos can   t make plates bigger than a few feet across .  i   ve tried nailing them on a framework  but it just collapses under the weight .      simony looked at the skeleton of the steam car and the pile of plates stacked beside it .      ever been in a battle  urn .     he said .      no .  i   ve got flat feet .  and i   m not very strong .         do you know what a tortoise is .      urn scratched his head .     okay .  the answer isn   t a little reptile in a shell  is it .  because you know i know that .         i mean a shield tortoise .  when you   re attacking a fortress or a wall  and the enemy is dropping everything he   s got on you  every man holds his shield overhead so that it   kind of   slots into all the shields around it .  can take a lot of weight .         overlapping     murmured urn .      like scales     said simony .   urn looked reflectively at the cart .      a tortoise     he said .      and the battering ram .     said simony .        oh  that   s no problem     said urn  not paying much attention .     tree trunk bolted to the frame .  big iron rammer .  they   re only bronze doors  you say .         yes .  but very big .         then they   re probably hollow .  or cast bronze plates on wood .  that   s what i   d do .         not solid bronze .  everyone says they   re solid bronze .         that   s what i   d say  too .         excuse me  sirs .      a burly man stepped forward .  he wore the uniform of the palace guards .      this is sergeant fergmen     said simony .     yes  sergeant .         the doors is reinforced with klatchian steel .  because of all the fighting in the time of the false prophet zog .  and they opens outwards only .  like lock gates on a canal  you understand .  if you push on    em  they only locks more firmly together .         how are they opened  then .     said urn .      the cenobiarch raises his hand and the breath of god blows them open     said the sergeant .      in a logical sense  i meant .         oh .  well  one of the deacons goes behind a curtain and pulls a lever .  but   when i was on guard down in the crypts  sometimes  there was a room   there was gratings and things   well  you could hear water gushing           hydraulics     said urn .     thought it would be hydraulics .         can you get in .     said simony .      to the room .  why not .  no one bothers with it .         could he make the doors open .     said simony .      hmm .     said urn .     urn was rubbing his chin reflectively with a hammer .  he seemed to be lost in a world of his own .      i said  could fergmen make these hydra haulics work .         hmm .  oh .  shouldn   t think so     said urn  vaguely .      could you .         what .         could you make them work .         oh .  probably .  it   s just pipes and pressures  after all .  um .      urn was still staring thoughtfully at the steam cart .  simony nodded meaningfully at the sergeant  indicating that he should go away  and then tried the mental inter planetary journey necessary to get to whatever world urn was in .   he tried looking at the cart  too .      how soon can you have it all finished .         hmm .         i said           late tomorrow night .  if we work through tonight .         but we   ll need it for the next dawn .  we won   t have time to see if it works .         it   ll work first time     said urn .      really .         i built it .  i know about it .  you know about swords and spears and things .  i know about things that go round and round .  it will work first time .         good .  well  there are other things i   ve got to do           right .      urn was left alone in the barn .  he looked reflectively at his hammer  and then at the iron cart .   they didn   t know how to cast bronze properly here .  their iron was pathetic  just pathetic .  their copper .  it was terrible .  they seemed to be able to make steel that shattered at a blow .  over the years the quisition had weeded out all the good smiths .   he   d done the best he could  but        just don   t ask me about the second or third time     he said quietly to himself .       vorbis sat in the stone chair in his garden  papers strewn around him .      well .      the kneeling figure did not look up .  two guards stood over it  with drawn swords .      the turtle people   the people are plotting something     it said  the voice shrill with terror .      of course they are .  of course they are     said vorbis .     and what is this plot .         there is some kind of   when you are confirmed as cenobiarch   some kind of device  some machine that goes by itself   it will smash down the doors of the temple        the voice faded away .      and where is this device now .     said vorbis .      i don   t know .  they   ve bought iron from me .  that   s all i know .         an iron device .         yes .     the man took a deep breath   half breath  half gulp .     people say   the guards said   you have my father in prison and you might   i plead        vorbis looked down at the man .      but you fear     he said     that i might have you thrown into the cells as well .  you think i am that sort of person .  you fear that i may think  this man has associated with heretics and blasphemers in familiar circumstances        the man continued to stare fixedly at the ground .  vorbis   s fingers curled gently around his chin and raised his head until they were eye to eye .      what you have done is a good thing     he said .  he looked at one of the guards .     is this man   s father still alive .         yes  lord .         still capable of walking .      the inquisitor shrugged .     ye es  lord .         then release him this instant  put him in the charge of his dutiful son here  and send them both back home .      the armies of hope and fear fought in the informant   s eyes .      thank you  lord     he said .      go in peace .      vorbis watched one of the guards escort the man from the garden .  then he waved a hand vaguely at one of the head inquisitors .      do we know where he lives .         yes  lord .         good .      the inquisitor hesitated .      and this   device  lord .         om has spoken to me .  a machine that goes by itself .  such a thing is against all reason .  where are its muscles .  where is its mind .         yes  lord .      the inquisitor  whose name was deacon cusp  had got where he was today  which was a place he wasn   t sure right now that he wanted to be  because he liked hurting people .  it was a simple desire  and one that was satisfied in abundance within the quisition .  and he was one of those who were terrified in a very particular way by vorbis .  hurting people because you enjoyed it   that was understandable .  vorbis just hurt people because he   d decided that they should be hurt  without passion  even with a kind of hard love .   in cusp   s experience  people didn   t make things up  ultimately  not in front of an exquisitor .  of course there were no such things as devices that moved by themselves  but he made a mental note to increase the guard        however     said vorbis     there will be a disturbance during the ceremony tomorrow .         lord .         i have   special knowledge     said vorbis .      of course  lord .         you know the breaking strain of sinews and muscles  deacon cusp .      cusp had formed an opinion that vorbis was somewhere on the other side of madness .  ordinary madness he could deal with .  in his experience there were quite a lot of mad people in the world  and many of them became even more insane in the tunnels of the quisition .  but vorbis had passed right through that red barrier and had built some kind of logical structure on the other side .  rational thoughts made out of insane components        yes  lord     he said .      i know the breaking strain of people .          it was night  and cold for the time of year .   lu tze crept through the gloom of the barn  sweeping industriously .  sometimes he took a rag from the recesses of his robe and polished things .   he polished the outside of the moving turtle  which loomed low and menacing in the shadows .     and he swept his way toward the forge  where he watched for a while .   it takes extreme concentration to pour good steel .  no wonder gods have always clustered around isolated smithies .  there are so many things that can go wrong .  a slight mis mix of ingredients  a moment   s lapse     urn  who was almost asleep on his feet  grunted as he was nudged awake and something was put in his hands .   it was a cup of tea .  he looked into the little round face of lu tze .      oh     he said .     thank you .  thank you very much .      nod  smile .      nearly done     said urn  more or less to himself .     just got to let it cool now .  got to let it cool really slowly .  otherwise it crystallizes  you see .      nod  smile  nod .   it was good tea .      s   not    n important cast anyway     said urn  swaying .     jus    the control levers        lu tze caught him carefully and steered him to a seat on a heap of charcoal .  then he went and watched the forge for a while .  the bar of steel was glowing in the mold .   he poured a bucket of cold water over it  watched the great cloud of steam spread and disperse  and then put his broom over his shoulder and ran away hurriedly .   people to whom lu tze was a vaguely glimpsed figure behind a very slow broom would have been surprised at his turn of speed  especially in a man six thousand years old who ate nothing but brown rice and drank only green tea with a knob of rancid butter in it .   a little way away from the citadel   s main gates he stopped running and started sweeping .  he swept up to the gates  swept around the gates themselves  nodded and smiled at a soldier who glared at him and then realized that it was only the daft old sweeper  polished one of the handles of the gates  and swept his way by passages and cloisters to brutha   s vegetable garden .   he could see a figure crouched among the melons .   lu tze found a rug and padded back out into the garden  where brutha was sitting hunched up with his hoe over his knees .   lu tze had seen many agonized faces in his time  which was a longer time than most whole civilizations managed to see .  brutha   s was the worst .  he tugged the rug over the bishop   s shoulders .      i can   t hear him     said brutha hoarsely .     it may mean that he   s too far away .  i keep on thinking that .  he might be out there somewhere .  miles away .      lu tze smiled and nodded .      it   ll happen all over again .  he never told anyone to do anything .  or not to do anything .  he didn   t care .      lu tze nodded and smiled again .  his teeth were yellow .  they were in fact his two hundredth set .      he should have cared .      lu tze disappeared into his corner again and returned with a shallow bowl full of some kind of tea .  he nodded and smiled and proffered it until brutha took it and had a sip .  it tasted like hot water with a lavender bag in it .      you don   t understand anything i   m talking about  do you .     said brutha .      not much     said lu tze .      you can talk .      lu tze put a wisened finger to his lips .      big secret     he said .   brutha looked at the little man .  how much did he know about him .  how much did anyone know about him .      you talk to god     said lu tze .      how do you know that .         signs .  man who talk to god have difficult life .         you   re right .     brutha stared at lu tze over the cup .     why are you here .     he said .     you   re not omnian .  or ephebian .         grew up near hub .  long time ago .  now lu tze a stranger everywhere he goes .  best way .  learned religion in temple at home .  now go where job is .         carting soil and pruning plants .         sure .  never been bishop or high panjandrum .  dangerous life .  always be man who cleans pews or sweeps up behind altar .  no one bother useful man .  no one bother small man .  no one remember name .         that   s what i was going to do .  but it doesn   t work for me .         then find other way .  i learn in temple .  taught by ancient master .  when trouble  always remember wise words of ancient and venerable master .         what were they .         ancient master say     that boy there .  what you eating .  hope you brought enough for everybody .     ancient master say     you bad boy .  why you no do homework .     ancient master say     what boy laughing .  no tell what boy laughing  whole dojo stay in after school .     when remember these wise words  nothing seems so bad .         what shall i do .  i can   t hear him .         you do what you must .  i learn anything  it you have to walk it all alone .      brutha hugged his knees .        but he told me nothing .  where   s all this wisdom .  all the other prophets came back with commandments .         where they get them .         i   suppose they made them up .         you get them from same place .             you call this philosophy .     roared didactylos  waving his stick .   urn cleaned pieces of the sand mold from the lever .      well   natural philosophy     he said .   the stick whanged down on the moving turtle   s flanks .      i never taught you this sort of thing .     shouted the philosopher .     philosophy is supposed to make life better .         this will make it better for a lot of people     said urn  calmly .     it will help overthrow a tyrant .         and then .     said didactylos .      and then what .         and then you   ll take it to bits  will you .     said the old man .     smash it up .  take the wheels off .  get rid of all those spikes .  burn the plans .  yes .  when it   s served its purpose  yes .         well       urn began .      aha .         aha what .  what if we do keep it .  it   ll be a   a deterrent to other tyrants .         you think tyrants won   t build    em too .         well   i can build bigger ones .     urn shouted .   didactylos sagged .     yes     he said .     no doubt you can .  so that   s all right  then .  my word .  and to think i was worrying .  and now   i think i   ll go and have a rest somewhere        he looked hunched up  and suddenly old .        master .     said urn .      don   t    master    me     said didactylos  feeling his way along the barn walls to the door .     i can see you know every bloody thing there is to know about human nature now .  hah .          the great god om slid down the side of an irrigation ditch and landed on his back in the weeds at the bottom .  he righted himself by gripping a root with his mouth and hauling himself over .   the shape of brutha   s thoughts flickered back and forth in his mind .  he couldn   t make out any actual words  but he didn   t need to  any more than you needed to see the ripples to know which way the river flowed .   occasionally  when he could see the citadel as a gleaming dot in the twilight  he   d try shouting his own mind back as loudly as he could      wait .  wait .  you don   t want to do that .  we can go to ankh morpork .  land of opportunity .  with my brains and your   with you  the world is our mollusk .  why throw it all away        and then he   d slide into another furrow .  once or twice he saw the eagle  forever circling .      why put your hand into a grinder .  this place deserves vorbis .  sheep deserve to be led .      it had been like this when his very first believer had been stoned to death .  of course  by then he had dozens of other believers .  but it had been a wrench .  it had been upsetting .  you never forgot your first believer .  they gave you shape .   tortoises are not well equipped for cross country navigation .  they need longer legs or shallower ditches .   om estimated that he was doing less than a fifth of a mile an hour in a direct line  and the citadel was at least twenty miles away .  occasionally he made good time between the trees in an olive grove  but that was more than pulled back by rocky ground and field walls .   all the time  as his legs whirred  brutha   s thoughts buzzed in his head like a distant bee .   he tried shouting in his mind again .      what   ve you got .  he   s got an army .  you   ve got an army .  how many divisions have you got .      but thoughts like that needed energy  and there was a limit to the amount of energy available in one tortoise .  he found a bunch of fallen grapes and gobbled them until the juice covered his head  but it didn   t make a lot of difference .   and then there was nightfall .  nights here weren   t as cold as the desert  but they weren   t as warm as the day .  he   d slow down at night as his blood cooled .  he wouldn   t be able to think as fast .  or walk as fast .   he was losing heat already .  heat meant speed .   he pulled himself up on to an anthill        you   re going to die .  you   re going to die .         and slid down the other side .       preparations for the inauguration of the cenobiarch prophet began many hours before the dawn .  firstly  and not according to ancient tradition  there was a very careful search of the temple by deacon cusp and some of his colleagues .  there was a prowling for tripwires and a poking of odd corners for hidden archers .  although it was against the thread  deacon cusp had his head screwed on .  he also sent a few squads into the town to round up the usual suspects .  the quisition always found it advisable to leave a few suspects at large .  then you knew where to find them when you needed them .   after that a dozen lesser priests arrived to shrive the premises and drive out all afreets  djinns  and devils .  deacon cusp watched them without comment .  he   d never had any personal dealings with supernatural entities  but he knew what a well placed arrow would do to an unexpecting stomach .   someone tapped him on the rib cage .  he gasped at the sudden linkage of real life into the chain of thought  and reached instinctively for his dagger .      oh     he said .   lu tze nodded and smiled and indicated with his broom that deacon cusp was standing on a patch of floor that he  lu tze  wished to sweep .      hello  you ghastly little yellow fool     said deacon cusp .   nod  smile .      never say a bloody word  do you .     said deacon cusp .   smile  smile .      idiot .      smile .  smile .  watch .       urn stood back .      now     he said     you sure you   ve got it all .         easy     said simony  who was sitting in the turtle   s saddle .      tell me again     said urn .      we stoke up the firebox     said simony .     then when the red needle points to xxvi  turn the brass tap  when the bronze whistle blows  pull the big lever .  and steer by pulling the ropes .         right     said urn .  but he still looked doubtful .     it   s a precision device     he said .      and i am a professional soldier     said simony .     i   m not a superstitious peasant .           fine  fine .  well   if you   re sure        they   d had time to put a few finishing touches to the moving turtle .  there were serrated edges to the shell and spikes on the wheels .  and of course the waste steam pipe   he was a little uncertain about the waste steam pipe        it   s merely a device     said simony .     it does not present a problem .         give us an hour  then .  you should just get to the temple by the time we get the doors open .         right .  understood .  off you go .  sergeant fergmen knows the way .      urn looked at the steam pipe and bit his lip .  i don   t know what effect it   s going to have on the enemy  he thought  but it scares the hells out of me .       brutha woke up  or at least ceased trying to sleep .  lu tze had gone .  probably sweeping somewhere .   he wandered through the deserted corridors of the novice section .  it would be hours before the new cenobiarch was crowned .  there were dozens of ceremonies to be undertaken first .  everyone who was anyone would be in the place and the surrounding piazzas  and so would the even greater number of people who were no one very much .  the sestinas were empty  the endless prayers left unsung .  the citadel might have been dead  were it not for the huge indefinable background roar of tens of thousands of people being silent .  sunlight filtered down through the light wells .   brutha had never felt more alone .  the wilderness had been a feast of fun compared to this .  last night   last night  with lu tze  it had all seemed so clear .  last night he had been in a mood to confront vorbis there and then .  last night there seemed to be a chance .  anything was possible last night .  that was the trouble with last nights .  they were always followed by this mornings .   he wandered out into the kitchen level  and then into the outside world .  there were one or two cooks around  preparing the ceremonial meal of meat  bread  and salt  but they paid him no attention at all .   he sat down outside one of the slaughterhouses .  there was  he knew  a back gate somewhere around .  probably no one would stop him  today  if he walked out .  today they would be looking for unwanted people walking in .   he could just walk away .  the wilderness had seemed quite pleasant  apart from the thirst and hunger .  st .  ungulant with his madness and his mushrooms seemed to have life exactly right .  it didn   t matter if you fooled yourself provided you didn   t let yourself know it  and did it well .  life was so much simpler  in the desert .   but there were a dozen guards by the gate .  they had an unsympathetic look .  he went back to his seat  which was tucked away in a corner  and stared gloomily at the ground .   if om was alive  surely he could send a sign .   a grating by brutha   s sandals lifted itself up a few inches and slid aside .  he stared at the hole .   a hooded head appeared  stared back  and disappeared again .  there was a subterranean whispering .  the head reappeared  and was followed by a body .  it pulled itself on to the cobbles .  the hood was pushed back .  the man grinned conspiratorially at brutha  put his finger to his lips and then  without warning  launched himself at him with violent intent .   brutha rolled across the cobbles and raised his hands frantically as he saw the gleam of metal .  one filthy hand clamped against his mouth .  a knifeblade made a dramatic and very final silhouette against the light        no .         why not .  we said the first thing we   ll do  we   ll kill all the priests .         not that one .      brutha dared to swivel his eyes sideways .  although the second figure rising from the hole was also wearing a filthy robe  there was no mistaking the paintbrush hairstyle .   he tried to say    urn .         shut up  you     said the other man  pressing the knife to his throat .      brutha .     said urn .     you   re alive .      brutha moved his eyes from his captor to urn in a way which he hoped would indicate that it was too soon to make any commitment on this point .      he   s all right     said urn .      all right .  he   s a priest .         but he   s on our side .  aren   t you  brutha .      brutha tried to nod  and thought  i   m on everyone   s side .  it   d be nice if  just for once  someone was on mine .   the hand was unclamped from his mouth  but the knife remained resting on his throat .  brutha   s normally careful thought processes ran like quicksilver .      the turtle moves .     he ventured .   the knife was withdrawn  with obvious reluctance .      i don   t trust him     said the man .     we should shove him down the hole at least .         brutha   s one of us     said urn .      that   s right .  that   s right     said brutha .     which ones are you .        urn leaned closer .      how   s your memory .         unfortunately  it is fine .         good .  good .  uh .  it would be a good idea to stay out of trouble  d   you hear   if anything happens .  remember the turtle .  well  of course you would .         what things .      urn patted him on the shoulder  making brutha think for a moment of vorbis .  vorbis  who never touched another person inside his head  was a great toucher with his hands .      best if you don   t know what   s happening     said urn .      but i don   t know what   s happening     said brutha .      good .  that   s the way .      the burly man gestured with his knife towards the tunnels that led into the rock .      are we going  or what .     he demanded .   urn ran after him and then stopped briefly and turned .      be careful     he said .     we need what   s in your head .      brutha watched them go .      so do i     he murmured .   and then he was alone again .   but he thought  hold on .  i don   t have to be .  i   m a bishop .  at least i can watch .  om   s gone and soon the world will end  so at least i might as well watch it happen .   sandals flapping  brutha set off towards the place .   bishops move diagonally .  that   s why they often turn up where the kings don   t expect them to be .          you godawful idiot .  don   t go that way .      the sun was well up now .  in fact it was probably setting  if didactylos   s theories about the speed of light were correct  but in matters of relativity the point of view of the observer is very important  and from om   s point of view the sun was a golden ball in a flaming orange sky .   he pulled himself up another slope  and stared blearily at the distant citadel .  in his mind   s eye  he could hear the mocking voices of all small gods .   they didn   t like a god who had failed .  they didn   t like that at all .  it let them all down .  it reminded them of mortality .  he   d be thrust out into the deep desert  where no one would ever come .  ever .  until the end of the world .   he shivered in his shell .       urn and fergmen walked nonchalantly through the tunnels of the citadel  using the kind of nonchalant walk which  had there been anyone to take an interest in it  would have drawn detailed and arrow sharp attention to them within seconds .  but the only people around were those with vital jobs to do .  besides  it was not a good idea to stare too hard at the guards  in case they stared back .   simony had told urn he   d agreed to this .  he couldn   t quite remember doing so .  the sergeant knew a way into the citadel  that was sensible .  and urn knew about hydraulics .  fine .  now he was walking through these dry tunnels with his toolbelt clinking .  there was a logical connection  but it had been made by someone else .   fergmen turned a corner and stopped by a large grille  which stretched from floor to ceiling .  it was very rusty .  it might once have been a door   there was a suggestion of hinges  rusted into the stone .  urn peered through the bars .  beyond  in the gloom  there were pipes .      eureka     he said .      going to have a bath  then .     said fergmen .        just keep watch .      urn selected a short crowbar from his belt and inserted it between the grille and the stonework .  give me a foot of good steel and a wall to brace   my   foot   against   the grille ground forward and then popped out with a leaden sound   and i can change the world     he stepped inside the long  dark  damp room  and gave a whistle of admiration .   no one had done any maintenance for   well  for as long as it took iron hinges to become a mass of crumbling rust   but all this still worked .   he looked up at lead and iron buckets bigger than he was  and a tangle of man sized pipes .   this was the breath of god .   probably the last man who knew how it worked had been tortured to death years before .  or as soon as it was installed .  killing the creator was a traditional method of patent protection .   there were the levers and there  hanging over pits in the rock floor  were the two sets of counterweights .  probably it   d only take a few hundred gallons of water to swing the balance either way .  of course  the water   d have to be pumped up        sergeant .      fergmen peered around the door .  he looked nervous  like an atheist in a thunderstorm .      what .      urn pointed .      there   s a big shaft through the wall there  see .  at the bottom of the gear chain .         the what .         the big knobbly wheels .           oh .  yeah .         where does the shaft go to .         don   t know .  there   s the big treadmill of correction through there .      ah .   the breath of god was ultimately the sweat of men .  didactylos would have appreciated the joke  urn thought .   he was aware of a sound that had been there all the time but was only now penetrating through his concentration .  it was tinny and faint and full of echoes  but it was voices .  from the pipes .   the sergeant  to judge by his expression  had heard them too .   urn put his ear to the metal .  there was no possibility of making out words  but the general religious rhythm was familiar enough .      it   s just the service going on in the temple     he said .     it   s probably resonating off the doors and the sound   s being carried down the pipes .      fergmen did not look reassured .      no gods are involved in any way     urn translated .  he turned his attention to the pipes again .      simple principle     said urn  more to himself than to fergmen .     water pours into the reservoirs on the weights  disturbing the equilibrium .  one lot of weights descends and the other rises up the shaft in the wall .  the weight of the door is immaterial .  as the bottom weights descend  these buckets here tip over  pouring the water out .  probably quite a smooth action .  perfect equilibrium at either end of the movement  too .  nicely thought out .      he caught fergmen   s expression .      water goes in and out and the doors swing open     he translated .     so all we   ve got to do is wait for   what did he say the sign would be .           they   ll blow a trumpet when they   re through the main gate     said fergmen  pleased to be of service .      right .     urn eyed the weights and the reservoirs overhead .  the bronze pipes dripped with corrosion .      but perhaps we   d better just check that we know what we   re doing     he said .     it probably takes a minute or two before the doors start moving .     he fumbled under his robe and produced something that looked  to fergmen   s eye  very much like a torture instrument .  this must have communicated itself to urn  who said very slowly and kindly     this is an ad just ab ble span ner .         yes .         it   s for twisting nuts off .      fergmen nodded miserably .      yes .     he said .      and this is a bottle of penetrating oil .         oh  good .         just give me a leg up  will you .  it   ll take time to unhook the linkage to the valve  so we might as well make a start .     urn heaved himself into the ancient machinery while  above  the ceremony droned on .       cut me own hand off dhblah was all for new prophets .  he was even in favor of the end of the world  if he could get the concession to sell religious statues  cut price icons  rancid sweetmeats  fermenting dates  and putrescent olives on a stick to any watching crowds .   subsequently  this was his testament .  there never was a book of the prophet brutha  but an enterprising scribe  during what came to be called the renovation  did assemble some notes  and dhblah had this to say      i .  i was standing right by the statue of ossory  right  when i noticed brutha just beside me .  everyone was keeping away from him because of him being a bishop and they do things to you if you jostle bishops .      ii .  i said to him  hello  your graciousness  and offered him a yogurt practically free .      iii .  he responded  no .      iv .  i said  it   s very healthy  it   s a live yogurt .      v .  he said  yes  he could see .      vi .  he was staring at the doors .  this was about the time of the third gong  right  so we all knew we   d got hours to wait .  he was looking a bit down and it   s not as if he even ate the yogurt  which i admit was on the hum a bit  what with the heat .  i mean  it was more alive than usual .  i mean  i had to keep hitting it with a spoon to stop it getting out of the   all right .  i was just explaining about the yogurt .  all right .  i mean  you want to put a bit of color in  don   t you .  people like a bit of color .  it was green .      vii .  he just stood there  staring .  so i said  got a problem  your reverence .  upon which he vouchsafed  i cannot hear him .  i said  what is this he to whom what you refer .  he said  if he was here  he would send me a sign .      viii .  there is no truth whatsoever in the rumor that i ran away at this juncture .  it was just the pressure of the crowd .  i have never been a friend of the quisition .  i might have sold them food  but i always charged them extra .      ix .  anyway  right  then he pushed through the line of guards what was holding the crowd back and stood right in front of the doors  and they weren   t sure what to do about bishops  and i heard him say something like  i carried you in the desert  i believed all my life  just give me this one thing .      x .  something like that  anyway .  how about some yogurt .  bargain offer .  onna stick .          om lifted himself over a creeper clad wall by grasping tendrils in his beak and hauling himself up by the neck muscles .  then he fell down the other side .  the citadel was as far away as ever .   brutha   s mind was flaming like a beacon in om   s senses .  there   s a streak of madness in everyone who spends quality time with gods  and it was driving the boy now .      it   s too soon .     om yelled .     you need followers .  it can   t be just you .  you can   t do it by yourself .  you have to get disciples first .          simony turned to look down the length of the turtle .  thirty men were crouched under the shell  looking very apprehensive .   a corporal saluted .      the needle   s there  sergeant .      the brass whistle whistled .   simony picked up the steering ropes .  this was what war should be  he thought .  no uncertainty .  a few more turtles like this  and no one would ever fight again .      stand by     he said .   he pulled the big lever hard .   the brittle metal snapped in his hand .   give anyone a lever long enough and they can change the world .  it   s unreliable levers that are the problem .       in the depths of the temple   s hidden plumbing  urn grasped a bronze pipe firmly with his spanner and gave the nut a cautious turn .  it resisted .  he changed position  and grunted as he used more pressure .   with a sad little metal sound  the pipe twisted   and broke       water gushed out  hitting him in the face .  he dropped the tool and tried to block the flow with his fingers  but it spurted around his hands and gurgled down the channel towards one of the weights .      stop it .  stop it .     he shouted .      what .     said fergmen  several feet below him .      stop the water .         how .         the pipe   s broken .         i thought that   s what we wanted to do .         not yet .         stop shouting  mister .  there   s guards around .      urn let the water gush for a moment as he struggled out of his robe  and then he rammed the sodden material into the pipe .  it shot out again with some force and slapped wetly against the lead funnel  sliding down until it blocked the tube that led to the weights .  the water piled up behind it and then spilled over on to the floor .   urn glanced at the weight .  it hadn   t begun to move .  he relaxed slightly .  now  provided there was still enough water to make the weight drop        both of you   stand still .      he looked around  his mind going numb .   there was a heavy set man in a black robe standing in the stricken doorway .  behind him  a guard held a sword in a meaningful manner .      who are you .  why are you here .      urn hesitated for only a moment .   he gestured with his spanner .      well  it   s the seating  innit     he said .     you   ve got shocking seepage around the seating .  amazing it holds together .      the man stepped into the room .  he glared uncertainly at urn for a moment and then turned his attention to the gushing pipe .  and then back to urn .      but you   re not       he began .   he spun around as fergmen hit the guard hard with a length of broken pipe .  when he turned back  urn   s spanner caught him full in the stomach .  urn wasn   t strong  but it was a long spanner  and the well known principles of leverage did the rest .  he doubled up and then sagged backwards against one of the weights .   what happened next happened in frozen time .  deacon cusp grabbed at the weight for support .  it sank down  ponderously  his extra poundage adding to the weight of the water .  he clawed higher .  it sank further  dropping below the lip of the pit .  he sought for balance again  but this time it was against fresh air  and he tumbled on top of the falling weight .   urn saw his face staring up at him as the weight fell into the gloom .   with a lever  he could change the world .  it had certainly changed it for deacon cusp .  it had made it stop existing .   fergmen was standing over the guard  his pipe raised .      i know this one     he said .     i   m going to give him a           never mind about that .         but        above them linkage clanked into action .  there was a distant creaking of bronze against bronze .      let   s get out of here     said urn .     only the gods know what   s happening up there .          and blows rained on the unmoving moving turtle   s carapace .      damn .  damn .  damn .     shouted simony  thumping it again .     move .  i command you to move .  can you understand plain ephebian .  move .      the unmoving machine leaked steam and sat there .       and om pulled himself up the slope of a small hill .  so it came to this  then .  there was only one way to get to the citadel now .   it was a million to one chance  with any luck .       and brutha stood in front of the huge doors  oblivious to the crowd and the muttering guards .  the quisition could arrest anyone  but the guards weren   t certain what happened to you if you apprehended an archbishop  especially one so recently favored by the prophet .   just a sign  brutha thought  in the loneliness of his head .   the doors trembled  and swung slowly outwards .   brutha stepped forward .  he wasn   t fully conscious now  not in any coherent way as understood by normal people .  just one part of him was still capable of looking at the state of his own mind and thinking  perhaps the great prophets felt like this all the time .   the thousands inside the temple were looking around in confusion .  the choirs of lesser iams paused in their chant .  brutha walked on up the aisle  the only one with a purpose in the suddenly bewildered throng .   vorbis was standing in the center of the temple  under the vault of the dome .  guards hurried toward brutha  but vorbis raised a hand in a gentle but very positive movement .   now brutha could take in the scene .  there was the staff of ossory  and abbys   s cloak  and the sandals of cena .  and  supporting the dome  the massive statues of the first four prophets .  he   d never seen them .  he   d heard about them every day of his childhood .   and what did they mean now .  they didn   t mean anything .  nothing meant anything  if vorbis was prophet .  nothing meant anything  if the cenobiarch was a man who   d heard nothing in the inner spaces of his own head but his own thoughts .   he was aware that vorbis   s gesture had not only halted the guards  although they surrounded him like a hedge .  it had also filled the temple with silence .  into which vorbis spoke .      ah .  my brutha .  we had looked for you in vain .  and now even you are here        brutha stopped a few feet away .  the moment of   whatever it had been   that had propelled him through the doors had drained away .   now all there was  was vorbis .   smiling .   the part of him still capable of thought was thinking  there is nothing you can say .  no one will listen .  no one will care .  it doesn   t matter what you tell people about ephebe  and brother murduck  and the desert .  it won   t be fundamentally true .   fundamentally true .  that   s what the world is  with vorbis in it .   vorbis said     there is something wrong .  something you wish to say .      the black on black eyes filled the world  like two pits .   brutha   s mind gave up  and brutha   s body took over .  it brought his hand back and raised it  oblivious to the sudden rush forward of the guards .   he saw vorbis turn his cheek  and smile .   brutha stopped  and lowered his hand .     he said     no  i won   t .      then  for the first and only time  he saw vorbis really enraged .  there had been times before when the deacon had been angry  but it had been something driven by the brain  switched on and off as the need arose .  this was something else  something out of control .  and it flashed across his face only for a moment .   as the hands of the guards closed on him  vorbis stepped forward and patted him on the shoulder .  he looked brutha in the eye for a moment and then said softly      thrash him within an inch of his life and burn him the rest of the way .      an iam began to speak  but stopped when he saw vorbis   s expression .      do it now .          a world of silence .  no sound up here  except the rush of wind through the feathers .   up here the world is round  bordered by a band of sea .  the viewpoint is from horizon to horizon  the sun is closer .   and yet  looking down  looking for shapes      down in the farmland on the edge of the wilderness        on a small hill      a tiny moving dome  ridiculously exposed     no sound but the rush of wind through feathers as the eagle pulls in its wings and drops like an arrow  the world spinning around the little moving shape that is the focus of all the eagle   s attention .   closer and        talons down          grip      and rise         brutha opened his eyes .   his back was merely agonizing .  he   d long ago got used to switching off pain .   but he was spread eagled on a surface  his arms and legs chained to something he couldn   t see .  sky above .  the towering frontage of the temple to one side .   by turning his head a little he could see the silent crowd .  and the brown metal of the iron turtle .  he could smell smoke .   someone was just tightening the shackles on his hand .  brutha looked over at the inquisitor .  now  what was it he had to say .  oh  yes .      the turtle moves .     he mumbled .   the man sighed .      not this one  friend     he said .       the world spun under om as the eagle sought for shell cracking height  and his mind was besieged by the tortoise   s existential dread of being off the ground .  and brutha   s thoughts  bright and clear this close to death     i   m on my back and getting hotter and i   m going to die     careful  careful .  concentrate  concentrate .  it   ll let go any second     om stuck out his long scrawny neck  stared at the body just above him  picked what he hoped was about the right spot  plunged his beak through the brown feathers between the talons  and gripped .   the eagle blinked .  no tortoise had ever done that to an eagle  anywhere else in history .     om   s thoughts arrived in the little silvery world of its mind      we don   t want to hurt one another  now do we .      the eagle blinked again .   eagles have never evolved much imagination or fore thought  beyond that necessary to know that a turtle smashes when you drop it on the rocks .  but it was forming a mental picture of what happened when you let go of a heavy tortoise that was still intimately gripping an essential bit of you .   its eyes watered .   another thought crept into its mind .      now .  you play  uh  ball with me  i   ll play   ball with you .  understand .  this is important .  this is what i want you to do        the eagle soared on a thermal off the hot rocks  and sped towards the distant gleam of the citadel .   no tortoise had ever done this before .  no tortoise in the whole universe .  but no tortoise had ever been a god  and knew the unwritten motto of the quisition  cuius testiculos habes  habeas cardia et cerebellum .   when you have their full attention in your grip  their hearts and minds will follow .       urn pushed his way through the crowds  with fergmen trailing behind .  that was the best and the worst of civil war  at least at the start   everyone wore the same uniform .  it was much easier when you picked enemies who were a different color or at least spoke with a funny accent .  you could call them    gooks    or something .  it made things easier .   hey  urn thought .  this is nearly philosophy .  pity i probably won   t live to tell anyone .   the big doors were ajar .  the crowd was silent  and very attentive .  he craned forward to see  and then looked up at the soldier beside him .   it was simony .      i thought           it didn   t work     said simony  bitterly .      did you    .         we did everything .  something broke .         it must be the steel they make here     said urn .     the link pins on           that doesn   t matter now     said simony .   the flat tones of his voice made urn follow the eyes of the crowd .   there was another iron turtle there   a proper model of a turtle  mounted on a sort of open gridwork of metal bars in which a couple of inquisitors were even now lighting a fire .  and chained to the back of the turtle        who   s that .         brutha .         what .         i don   t know what happened .  he hit vorbis  or didn   t hit him .  or something .  enraged him anyway .  vorbis stopped the ceremony  right there and then .      urn glanced at the deacon .  not cenobiarch yet  so uncrowned .  among the iams and bishops standing uncertainly in the open doorway  his bald head gleamed in the morning light .      come on  then     said urn .      come on what .         we can rush the steps and save him .         there   s more of them than there are of us     said simony .      well  haven   t there always been .  there   s not magically more of them than there are of us just because they   ve got brutha  are there .        simony grabbed his arm .      think logically  will you .     he said .     you   re a philosopher  aren   t you .  look at the crowd .      urn looked at the crowd .      well .         they don   t like it .     simon turned .     look  brutha   s going to die anyway .  but this way it   ll mean something .  people don   t understand  really understand  about the shape of the universe and all that stuff  but they   ll remember what vorbis did to a man .  right .  we can make brutha   s death a symbol for people  don   t you see .      urn stared at the distant figure of brutha .  it was naked  except for a loin cloth .      a symbol .     he said .  his throat was dry .      it has to be .      he remembered didactylos saying the world was a funny place .  and  he thought distantly  it really was .  here people were about to roast someone to death  but they   d left his loin cloth on  out of respectability .  you had to laugh .  otherwise you   d go mad .      you know     he said  turning to simony .     now i know vorbis is evil .  he burned my city .  well  the tsorteans do it sometimes  and we burn theirs .  it   s just war .  it   s all part of history .  and he lies and cheats and claws power for himself  and lots of people do that  too .  but do you know what   s special .  do you know what it is .         of course     said simony .     it   s what he   s doing to           it   s what he   s done to you .         what .         he turns other people into copies of himself .      simony   s grip was like a vice .     you   re saying i   m like him .           once you said you   d cut him down     said urn .     now you   re thinking like him           so we rush them  then .     said simony .     i   m sure of   maybe four hundred on our side .  so i give the signal and a few hundred of us attack thousands of them .  and he dies anyway and we die too .  what difference does that make .      urn   s face was gray with horror now .      you mean you don   t know .     he said .   some of the crowd looked around curiously at him .      you don   t know .     he said .       the sky was blue .  the sun wasn   t high enough yet to turn it into omnia   s normal copper bowl .   brutha turned his head again  towards the sun .  it was about a width above the horizon  although if didactylos   s theories about the speed of light were correct  it was really setting  thousands of years in the future .   it was eclipsed by the head of vorbis .      hot yet  brutha .     said the deacon .      warm .         it will get warmer .      there was a disturbance in the crowd .  someone was shouting .  vorbis ignored it .      nothing you want to say .     he said .     can   t you manage even a curse .  not even a curse .         you never heard om     said brutha .     you never believed .  you never  ever heard his voice .  all you heard were the echoes inside your own mind .         really .  but i am the cenobiarch and you are going to burn for treachery and heresy     said vorbis .     so much for om  perhaps .           there will be justice     said brutha .     if there is no justice  there is nothing .      he was aware of a small voice in his head  too faint yet to distinguish words .      justice .     said vorbis .  the idea seemed to enrage him .  he spun around to the crowd of bishops .     did you hear him .  there will be justice .  om has judged .  through me .  this is justice .      there was a speck in the sun now  speeding toward the citadel .  and the little voice was saying left left left up up left right a bit up left   the mass of metal under him was getting uncomfortably hot .      he comes now     said brutha .   vorbis waved his hand to the great facade of the temple .     men built this .  we built this     he said .     and what did om do .  om comes .  let him come .  let him judge between us .         he comes now     brutha repeated .     the god .      people looked apprehensively upward .  there was that moment  just one moment  when the world holds its breath and against all experience waits for a miracle .      up left now  when i say three  one  two  three        vorbis .     croaked brutha .      what .     snapped the deacon .      you   re going to die .      it was hardly a whisper  but it bounced off the bronze doors and carried across the place     it made people uneasy  although they couldn   t quite say why .   the eagle sped across the square  so low that people ducked .  then it cleared the roof of the temple and curved away towards the mountains .  the watchers relaxed .  it was only an eagle .  for a moment there  just for a moment       no one saw the tiny speck  tumbling down from the sky .   don   t put your faith in gods .  but you can believe in turtles .   a feeling of rushing wind in brutha   s mind  and a voice        obuggerbuggerbuggerhelpaarghnononoaargh buggernonoaargh     even vorbis got a grip of himself .  there had been just a moment  when he   d seen the eagle   but  no     he extended his arms and smiled beatifically at the sky .      i   m sorry     said brutha .   one or two people  who had been watching vorbis closely  said later that there was just time for his expression to change before two pounds of tortoise  traveling at three meters a second  hit him between the eyes .   it was a revelation .   and that does something to people watching .  for a start  they believe with all their heart .       brutha was aware of feet running up the steps  and hands pulling at the chains .   and then a voice   i .  he is mine .   the great god rose over the temple  billowing and changing as the belief of thousands of people flowed into him .  there were shapes there  of eagle headed men  and bulls  and golden horns  but they tangled and flamed and fused into one another .   four bolts of fire whirred out of the cloud and burst the chains holding brutha .   ii .  he is cenobiarch and prophet of prophets .   the voice of theophany rumbled off the distant mountains .     iii .  do i hear any objections .  no .  good .   the cloud had by now condensed into a shimmering golden figure  as tall as the temple .  it leaned down until its face was a few feet away from brutha  and in a whisper that boomed across the place said   iv .  don   t worry .  this is just the start .  you and me  kid .  people are going to find out what wailing and gnashing of teeth really is .   another shaft of flame shot out and struck the temple doors .  they slammed shut  and then the white hot bronze melted  erasing the commandments of the centuries .   v .  what shall it be  prophet .   brutha stood up  unsteadily .  urn supported him by one arm  and simony by the other .      mm .     he said  muzzily .  vi .  your commandments .      i thought they were supposed to come from you     said brutha .     i don   t know if i can think of any        the world waited .      how about    think for yourself    .     said urn  staring in horrified fascination at the manifestation .      no     said simony .     try something like    social cohesiveness is the key to progress .            can   t say it rolls off the tongue     said urn .      if i can be of any help     said cut me own hand off dhblah  from the crowd     something of benefit to the convenience food industry would be very welcome .         not killing people .  we could do with one like that     said someone else .      it   d be a good start     said urn .   they looked at the chosen one .  he shook himself free of their grip and stood alone  swaying a little .        no oo     said brutha .     no .  i thought like that once  but it wouldn   t .  not really .      now  he said .  only now .  just one point in history .  not tomorrow  not next month  it   ll always be too late unless it   s now .   they stared at him .      come on     said simony .     what   s wrong with it .  you can   t argue with it .         it   s hard to explain     said brutha .     but i think it   s got something to do with how people should behave .  i think   you should do things because they   re right .  not because gods say so .  they might say something different another time .      vii .  i like one about not killing  said om  from far above .   viii .  it   s got a good ring to it .  hurry up  i   ve got some smiting to do .      you see .     said brutha .     no .  no smiting .  no commandments unless you obey them too .      om thumped on the roof of the temple .  ix .  you order me .  here .  now .  me .      no .  i ask .      x .  that   s worse than ordering .      everything works both ways .      om thumped his temple again .  a wall caved in .  that part of the crowd that hadn   t managed to stampede from the place redoubled its efforts .   xi .  there must be punishment .  otherwise there will be no order .      no .      xii .  i do not need you .  i have believers enough now .      but only through me .  and  perhaps  not for long .  it will all happen again .  it   s happened before .  it happens all the time .  that   s why gods die .  they never believe in people .  but you have a chance .  all you need to do is   believe .      xiii .  what .  listen to stupid prayers .  watch over small children .  make it rain .      sometimes .  not always .  it could be a bargain .      xiv .  bargain .  i don   t bargain .  not with humans .      bargain now     said brutha .     while you have the chance .  or one day you   ll have to bargain with simony  or someone like him .  or urn  or someone like him .      xv .  i could destroy you utterly .      yes .  i am entirely in your power .      xvi .  i could crush you like an egg .      yes .      om paused .   then he said  xvii .  you can   t use weakness as a weapon .      it   s the only one i   ve got .      xviii .  why should i yield  then .      not yield .  bargain .  deal with me in weakness .  or one day you   ll have to bargain with someone in a position of strength .  the world changes .      xix .  hah .  you want a constitutional religion .      why not .  the other sort didn   t work .      om leaned on the temple  his temper subsiding .   chap .  ii v . i .  very well  then .  but only for a time .  a grin spread across the enormous  smoking face .  for one hundred years  yes .      and after a hundred years .      ii .  we shall see .      agreed .      a finger the length of a tree unfolded  descended  touched brutha .     iii .  you have a persuasive way .  you will need it .  a fleet approaches .      ephebians .     said simony .  iv .  and tsorteans .  and djelibeybians .  and klatchians .  every free country along the coast .  to stamp out omnia for good .  or bad .      you don   t have many friends  do you .     said urn .      even i don   t like us much  and i am us     said simony .  he looked up at the god .      will you help .      v .  you don   t even believe in me .      yes  but i   m a practical man .      vi .  and brave  too  to declare atheism before your god .      this doesn   t change anything  you know .     said simony .     don   t think you can get around me by existing .         no help     said brutha  firmly .      what .     said simony .     we   ll need a mighty army against that lot .         yes .  and we haven   t got one .  so we   ll do it another way .         you   re crazy .      brutha   s calmness was like a desert .      this may be the case .         we have to fight .         not yet .      simony clenched his fists in anger .      look   listen   we died for lies  for centuries we died for lies .     he waved a hand towards the god .     now we   ve got a truth to die for .         no .  men should die for lies .  but the truth is too precious to die for .      simony   s mouth opened and shut soundlessly as he sought for words .  finally  he found some from the dawn of his education .      i was told it was the finest thing to die for a god     he mumbled .      vorbis said that .  and he was   stupid .  you can die for your country or your people or your family  but for a god you should live fully and busily  every day of a long life .         and how long is that going to be .         we shall see .      brutha looked up at om .      you will not show yourself like this again .      chap .  iii v . i .  no .  once is enough .      remember the desert .      ii .  i will remember .      walk with me .      brutha went over to the body of vorbis and picked it up .      i think     he said     that they will land on the beach on the ephebian side of the forts .  they won   t use the rock shore and they can   t use the cliffs .  i   ll meet them there .     he glanced down at vorbis .     someone should .         you can   t mean you want to go by yourself .         ten thousand won   t be sufficient .  one might be enough .      he walked down the steps .   urn and simony watched him go .      he   s going to die     said simony .     he won   t even be a patch of grease on the sand .     he turned to om .     can you stop him .      iii .  it may be that i cannot .   brutha was already halfway across the place .      well  we   re not deserting him     said simony .     iv .  good .   om watched them go  too .  and then he was alone  except for the thousands watching him  crammed around the edges of the great square .  he wished he knew what to say to them .  that   s why he needed people like brutha .  that   s why all gods needed people like brutha .      excuse me .      the god looked down .  v .  yes .      um .  i can   t sell you anything  can i .      vi .  what is your name .      dhblah  god .      vii .  ah  yes .  and what is it you wish .   the merchant hopped anxiously from one foot to the other .      you couldn   t manage just a small commandment .  something about eating yogurt on wednesdays  say .  it   s always very difficult to shift  midweek .      viii .  you stand before your god and look for business opportunities .      we ell     said dhblah     we could come to an arrangement .  strike while the iron is hot  as the inquisitors say .  haha .  twenty percent .  how about it .  after expenses  of course        the great god om smiled .  ix .  i think you will make a little prophet  dhblah  he said .      right .  right .  that   s all i   m looking for .  just trying to make both ends hummus .      x .  tortoises are to be left alone .   dhblah put his head on one side .      doesn   t sing  does it .     he said .     but   tortoise necklaces   hmm   brooches  of course .  tortoise shel        xi .  no .      sorry  sorry .  see what you mean .  all right .  tortoise statues .  ye ess .  i thought about them .  nice shape .  incidentally  you couldn   t make a statue wobble every now and again  could you .  very good for business  wobbling statues .  the statue of ossory wobbles every fast of ossory  reg   lar .  by means of a small piston device operated in the basement  it is said .  but very good for the prophets  all the same .      xii .  you make me laugh  little prophet .  sell your tortoises  by all means .      tell you the truth     said dhblah     i   ve already drawn a few designs just now        om vanished .  there was a brief thunderclap .  dhblah looked reflectively at his sketches .         but i suppose i   ll have to take the little figure off them     he said  more or less to himself .       the shade of vorbis looked around .      ah .  the desert     he said .  the black sand was absolutely still under the starlit sky .  it looked cold .   he hadn   t planned on dying yet .  in fact   he couldn   t quite remember how he   d died        the desert     he repeated  and this time there was a hint of uncertainty .  he   d never been uncertain about anything in his   life .  the feeling was unfamiliar and terrifying .  did ordinary people feel like this .   he got a grip on himself .   death was impressed .  very few people managed this  managed to hold on to the shape of their old thinking after death .     death took no pleasure in his job .  it was an emotion he found hard to grasp .  but there was such a thing as satisfaction .      so     said vorbis .     the desert .  and at the end of the desert    .      judgment .      yes  yes  of course .      vorbis tried to concentrate .  he couldn   t .  he could feel certainty draining away .  and he   d always been certain .   he hesitated  like a man opening a door to a familiar room and finding nothing there but a bottomless pit .  the memories were still there .  he could feel them .  they had the right shape .  it was just that he couldn   t remember what they were .  there had been a voice    .  surely  there had been a voice .  but all he could remember was the sound of his own thoughts  bouncing off the inside of his own head .   now he had to cross the desert .  what could there be to fear     the desert was what you believed .   vorbis looked inside himself .   and went on looking .   he sagged to his knees .   i can see that you are busy  said death .      don   t leave me .  it   s so empty .      death looked around at the endless desert .  he snapped his fingers and a large white horse trotted up .   i see a hundred thousand people  he said  swinging himself into the saddle .      where .  where .      here .  with you .      i can   t see them .        death gathered up the reins .   nevertheless  he said .  his horse trotted forward a few steps .      i don   t understand .     screamed vorbis .   death paused .     you have perhaps heard the phrase  he said  that hell is other people .      yes .  yes  of course .      death nodded .  in time  he said  you will learn that it is wrong .       the first boats grounded in the shallows  and the troops leapt into shoulder high surf .   no one was quite sure who was leading the fleet .  most of the countries along the coast hated one another  not in any personal sense  but simply on a kind of historical basis .  on the other hand  how much leadership was necessary .  everyone knew where omnia was .  none of the countries in the fleet hated the others worse than they did omnia .  now it was necessary for it   not to exist .   general argavisti of ephebe considered that he was in charge  because although he didn   t have the most ships he was avenging the attack on ephebe .  but imperiator borvorius of tsort knew that he was in charge  because there were more tsortean ships than any others .  and admiral rham ap efan of djelibeybi knew that he was in charge  because he was the kind of person who always thought he was in charge of anything .  the only captain who did not  in fact  think that he was commanding the fleet was fasta benj  a fisherman from a very small nation of marsh dwelling nomads of whose existence all the other countries were in complete ignorance  and whose small reed boat had been in the path of the fleet and had got swept along .  since his tribe believed that there were only fifty one people in the world  worshiped a giant newt  spoke a very personal language which no one else understood  and had never seen metal or fire before  he was spending a lot of time wearing a puzzled grin .   clearly they had reached a shore  not of proper mud and reeds  but of very small gritty bits .  he lugged his little reed boat up the sand  and sat down with interest to see what the men in the feathery hats and shiny fish scale vests were going to do next .   general argavisti scanned the beach .      they must have seen us coming     he said .     so why would they let us establish a beachhead .      heat haze wavered over the dunes .  a dot appeared  growing and contracting in the shimmering air .   more troops poured ashore .   general argavisti shaded his eyes against the sun .      fella   s just standing there     he said .      could be a spy     said borvorius .      don   t see how he could be a spy in his own country     said argavisti .     anyway  if he was a spy he   d be creepin    around .  that   s how you can tell .      the figure had stopped at the foot of the dunes .  there was something about it that drew the eye .  argavisti had faced many an opposing army  and this was normal .  one patiently waiting figure was not .  he found he kept turning to look at it .      s   carrying something     he said eventually .     sergeant .  go and bring that man here .      a few minutes later the sergeant returned .      says he   ll meet you in the middle of the beach  sir     he reported .        didn   t i tell you to bring him here .         he didn   t want to come  sir .         you   ve got a sword  haven   t you .         yessir .  prodded him a bit  but he dint want to move  sir .  and he   s carrying a dead body  sir .         on a battlefield .  it   s not bring your own  you know .         and   sir .         what .         says he   s probably the cenobiarch  sir .  wants to talk about a peace treaty .         oh  he does .  peace treaty .  we know about peace treaties with omnia .  go and tell   no .  take a couple of men and bring him here .      brutha walked back between the soldiers  through the organized pandemonium of the camp .  i ought to feel afraid  he thought .  i was always afraid in the citadel .  but not now .  this is through fear and out the other side .   occasionally one of the soldiers would give him a push .  it   s not allowed for an enemy to walk freely into a camp  even if he wants to .   he was brought before a trestle table  behind which sat half a dozen large men in various military styles  and one small olive skinned man who was gutting a fish and grinning hopefully at everyone .      well  now     said argavisti     cenobiarch of omnia  eh .      brutha dropped vorbis   s body on to the sand .  their gaze followed it .      i know him       said borvorius .     vorbis .  someone killed him at last  eh .  and will you stop trying to sell me fish .  does anyone know who this man is .     he added  indicating fasta benj .        it was a tortoise     said brutha .      was it .  not surprised .  never did trust them  always creeping around .  look  i said no fish .  he   s not one of mine  i know that .  is he one of yours .      argavisti waved a hand irritably .     who sent you  boy .         no one .  i came by myself .  but you could say i come from the future .         are you a philosopher .  where   s your sponge .         you   ve come to wage war on omnia .  this would not be a good idea .         from omnia   s point of view  yes .         from everyone   s .  you will probably defeat us .  but not all of us .  and then what will you do .  leave a garrison .  forever .  and eventually a new generation will retaliate .  why you did this won   t mean anything to them .  you   ll be the oppressors .  they   ll fight .  they might even win .  and there   ll be another war .  and one day people will say  why didn   t they sort it all out  back then .  on the beach .  before it all started .  before all those people died .  now we have that chance .  aren   t we lucky .      argavisti stared at him .  then he nudged borvorius .      what did he say .      borvorius  who was better at thinking than the others  said     are you talking about surrender .         yes .  if that   s the word .      argavisti exploded .      you can   t do that .         someone will have to .  please listen to me .  vorbis is dead .  he   s paid .         not enough .  what about your soldiers .  they tried to sack our city .         do your soldiers obey your orders .           certainly .         and they   d cut me down here and now if you commanded it .         i should say so .         and i   m unarmed     said brutha .   the sun beat down on an awkward pause .      when i say they   d obey       argavisti began .      we were not sent here to parley     said borvorius abruptly .     vorbis   s death changes nothing fundamental .  we are here to see that omnia is no longer a threat .         it is not .  we will send materials and people to help rebuild ephebe .  and gold  if you like .  we will reduce the size of our army .  and so on .  consider us beaten .  we will even open omnia to whatever other religions wish to build holy places here .      a voice echoed in his head  like the person behind you who says     put the red queen on the black king     when you think you have been playing all by yourself     i .  what .      this will encourage   local effort     said brutha .  ii .  other gods .  here .      there will be free trade along the coast .  i wish to see omnia take its place among its fellow nations .      iii .  i heard you mention other gods .      its place is at the bottom     said borvorius .      no .  that won   t work .      iv .  could we please get back to the matter of  other gods .      will you please excuse me a moment .     said brutha  brightly .     i need to pray .      even argavisti raised no objection as brutha walked off a little way up the beach .  as st .  ungulant preached to any who would listen  there were plus points in being a madman .  people hesitated to stop you  in case it made things worse .      yes .     said brutha  under his breath .  v .  i don   t seem to recall any discussion about other gods being worshiped in omnia .      ah  but it   ll work for you     said brutha .     people will soon see that those other ones are no good at all  won   t they .     he crossed his fingers behind his back .   vi .  this is religion  boy .  not comparison bloody shopping .  you shall not subject your god to market forces .      i   m sorry .  i can see that you would be worried about        vii .  worried .  me .  by a bunch of primping women and muscle bound posers in curly beards .      fine .  is that settled  then .      viii .  they won   t last five minutes .    what .      and now i   d better go and talk to these men one more time .      his eye was caught by a movement among the dunes .      oh  no     he said .     the idiots        he turned and ran desperately toward the beached fleet .      no .  it   s not like that .  listen .  listen .      but they had seen the army  too .   it looked impressive  perhaps more impressive than it really was .  when news gets through that a huge enemy fleet has beached with the intent of seriously looting  pillaging  and   because they are from civilized countries   whistling and making catcalls at the women and impressing them with their flash bloody uniforms and wooing them away with their flash bloody consumer goods  i don   t know  show them a polished bronze mirror and it goes right to their heads  you   d think there was something wrong with the local lads   then people either head for the hills or pick up some handy  swingable object  get granny to hide the family treasures in her drawers  and prepare to make a fight of it .   and  in the lead  the iron cart .  steam poured out of its funnel .  urn must have got it working again .      stupid .  stupid .     brutha shouted  to the world in general  and carried on running .   the fleet was already forming battle lines  and its commander  whichever he was  was amazed to see an apparent attack by one man .   borvorius caught him as he plunged towards a line of spears .      i see     he said .     keep us talking while your soldiers got into position  eh .         no .  i didn   t want that .      borvorius   s eyes narrowed .  he had not survived the many wars of his life by being a stupid man .      no     he said     maybe you didn   t .  but it doesn   t matter .  listen to me  my innocent little priest .  sometimes there has to be a war .  things go too far for words .  there   s   other forces .  now   go back to your people .  maybe we   ll both be alive when all this is over and then we can talk .  fight first  talk after .  that   s how it works  boy .  that   s history .  now  go back .      brutha turned away .  i .  shall i smite them .      no .      ii .  i could make them as dust .  just say the  word .      no .  that   s worse than war .        iii .  but you said a god must protect his people        what would we be if i told you to crush honest men .      iv .  not stuck full of arrows .      no .      the omnians were assembling among the dunes .  a lot of them had clustered around the iron shielded cart .  brutha looked at it through a mist of despair .      didn   t i say i   d go down there alone .     he said .   simony  who was leaning against the turtle  gave him a grim smile .      did it work .     he said .      i think   it didn   t .         i knew it .  sorry you had to find out .  things have a way of wanting to happen  see .  sometimes you get people facing off and   that   s it .         but if only people would           yeah .  you could use that as a commandment .      there was a clanging noise  and a hatch opened on the side of the turtle .  urn emerged  backward  holding a spanner .      what is this thing .     said brutha .      it   s a machine for fighting     said simony .     the turtle moves  eh .         for fighting ephebians .     said brutha .   urn turned around .      what .     he said .      you   ve built this   this thing   to fight ephebians .         well   no   no     said urn  looking bewildered .     we   re fighting ephebians .         everyone     said simony .      but i never   i   m an   i never        brutha looked at the spiked wheels and the saw edged plates around the edge of the turtle .        it   s a device that goes by itself     said urn .     we were going to use it for   i mean   look  i never wanted it to           we need it now     said simony .      which we .         what comes out of the big long spout thing at the front .     said brutha .      steam     said urn dully .     it   s connected to the safety valve .         oh .         it comes out very hot     said urn  sagging even more .      oh .         scalding  in fact .      brutha   s gaze drifted from the steam funnel to the rotating knives .      very philosophical     he said .      we were going to use it against vorbis     said urn .      and now you   re not .  it   s going to be used against ephebians .  you know  i used to think i was stupid  and then i met philosophers .      simony broke the silence by patting brutha on the shoulder .      it will all work out     he said .     we won   t lose .  after all     he smiled encouragingly     we have god on our side .      brutha turned .  his fist shot out .  it wasn   t a scientific blow  but it was hard enough to spin simony around .  he clutched his chin .      what was that for .  isn   t this what you wanted .         we get the gods we deserve     said brutha     and i think we don   t deserve any .  stupid .  stupid .  the sanest man i   ve met this year lives up a pole in the desert .  stupid .  i think i ought to join him .        i .  why .      gods and men  men and gods     said brutha .     everything happens because things have happened before .  stupid .      ii .  but you are the chosen one .      choose someone else .      brutha strode off through the ragged army .  no one tried to stop him .  he reached the path that led up to the cliffs  and did not even turn to look at the battle lines .      aren   t you going to watch the battle .  i need someone to watch the battle .      didactylos was sitting on a rock  his hands folded on his stick .      oh  hello     said brutha  bitterly .     welcome to omnia .         it helps if you   re philosophical about it     said didactylos .      but there   s no reason to fight .         yes there is .  honor and revenge and duty and things like that .         do you really think so .  i thought philosophers were supposed to be logical .      didactylos shrugged .      well  the way i see it  logic is only a way of being ignorant by numbers .         i thought it would all be over when vorbis was dead .      didactylos stared into his inner world .      it takes a long time for people like vorbis to die .  they leave echoes in history .         i know what you mean .         how   s urn   s steam machine .     said didactylos .      i think he   s a bit upset about it     said brutha .     didactylos cackled and banged his stick on the ground .      hah .  he   s learning .  everything works both ways .         it should do     said brutha .       something like a golden comet sped across the sky of the discworld .  om soared like an eagle  buoyed up by the freshness  by the strength of the belief .  for as long as it lasted  anyway .  belief this hot  this desperate  never lasted long .  human minds could not sustain it .  but while it did last  he was strong .   the central spire of cori celesti rises up from the mountains at the hub  ten vertical miles of green ice and snow  topped by the turrets and domes of dunmanifestin .   there the gods of the discworld live .   at the least  any god who is anybody .  and it is strange that  although it takes years of effort and work and scheming for a god to get there  once there they never seem to do a lot apart from drink too much and indulge in a little mild corruption .  many systems of government follow the same broad lines .   they play games .  they tend to be very simple games  because gods are easily bored by complicated things .  it is strange that  while small gods can have one aim in mind for millions of years  are in fact one aim  large gods seem to have the attention span of the common mosquito .   and style .  if the gods of the discworld were people they would think that three plaster ducks is a bit avant garde .   there was a double door at the end of the main hall .   it rocked to a thunderous knocking .     the gods looked up vaguely from their various preoccupations  shrugged and turned away .   the doors burst inward .   om strode through the debris  looking around with the air of one who has a search to complete and not a lot of time to do it in .      right     he said .   io  god of thunder  looked up from his throne and waved his hammer threateningly .      who are you .      om strode toward the throne  picked up io by his toga  and gave a quick jab with his forehead .   hardly anyone really believes in thunder gods any more        ow .         listen  friend .  i   ve got no time for talking to some pantywaister in a sheet .  where   s the gods of ephebe and tsort .      io  clutching at his nose  waved vaguely towards the center of the hall .      you nidn   t naf to ndo dat .     he said reproachfully .   om strode across the hall .   in the center of the room was what at first looked like a round table  and then looked like a model of the discworld  turtle  elephants and all  and then in some undefinable way looked like the real discworld  seen from far off yet brought up close to .  there was something subtly wrong about the distances  a feeling of vast space curled up small .  but possibly the real discworld wasn   t covered with a network of glowing lines  hovering just above the surface .  or perhaps miles above the surface .   om hadn   t seen this before  but he knew what it was .  both a wave and a particle  both a map and the place mapped .  if he focused on the tiny glittering dome on top of the tiny cori celesti  he would undoubtedly see himself  looking down on an even smaller model   and so on  down to the point where the universe coiled up like the tail of an ammonite  a kind of creature that lived millions of years ago and never believed in any gods at all     the gods clustered around it  watching intently .   om elbowed aside a minor goddess of plenty .   there were dice floating just above the world  and a mess of little clay figures and gaming counters .  you didn   t need to be even slightly omnipotent to know what was going on .      he hid by nose .      om turned around .      i never forget a face  friend .  just take yours away  right .  while you still have some left .      he turned back to the game .      s   cuse me     said a voice by his waist .  he looked down at a very large newt .      yes .         you not supposed do that here .  no smiting .  not up here .  it the rules .  you want fight  you get your humans fight his humans .         who   re you .         p   tang p   tang  me .         you   re a god .         definite .         yeah .  how many worshipers have you got .         fifty one .      the newt looked at him hopefully  and added     is that lots .  can   t count .        it pointed at a rather crudely molded figure on the beach in omnia and said     but got a stake .      om looked at the figure of the little fisherman .      when he dies  you   ll have fifty worshipers     he said .      that more or less than fifty one .         a lot less .         definite .         yes .         no one tell me that .      there were several dozen gods watching the beach .  om vaguely remembered the ephebian statues .  there was the goddess with the badly carved owl .  yes .   om rubbed his head .  this wasn   t god like thinking .  it seemed simpler when you were up here .  it was all a game .  you forgot that it wasn   t a game down there .  people died .  bits got chopped off .  we   re like eagles up here  he thought .  sometimes we show a tortoise how to fly .   then we let go .   he said  to the occult world in general     there   s people going to die down there .      a tsortean god of the sun did not even bother to look around .      that   s what they   re for     he said .  in his hand he was holding a dice box that looked very much like a human skull with rubies in the eye sockets .      ah  yes     said om .     i forgot that  for a moment .     he looked at the skull  and then turned to the little goddess of plenty .      what   s this  love .  a cornucopia .  can i have a look .  thanks .      om emptied some of the fruit out .  then he nudged the newt god .        if i was you  friend  i   d find something long and hefty     he said .      is one less than fifty one .     said p   tang p   tang .      it   s the same     said om  firmly .  he eyed the back of the tsortean god   s head .      but you have thousands     said the newt god .     you fight for thousands .      om rubbed his forehead .  i spent too long down there  he thought .  i can   t stop thinking at ground level .      i think     he said     i think  if you want thousands  you have to fight for one .     he tapped the solar god on the shoulder .     hey  sunshine .      when the god looked around  om broke the cornucopia over his head .       it wasn   t a normal thunderclap .  it stuttered like the shyness of supernovas  great ripping billows of sound that tore up the sky .  sand fountained up and whirled across the recumbent bodies lying facedown on the beach .  lightning stabbed down  and sympathetic fire leapt from spear tip and sword point .   simony looked up at the booming darkness .      what the hell   s happening .     he nudged the body next to him .   it was argavisti .  they stared at one another .   more thunder smashed across the sky .  waves climbed up one another to rip into the fleet .  hull drifted with awful grace into hull  giving the bass line of the thunder a counterpoint of groaning wood .   a broken spar thudded into the sand by simony   s head .      we   re dead if we stay here     he said .     come on .      they staggered through the spray and sand  amidst groups of cowering and praying soldiers  fetching up against something hard  half covered .   they crawled into the calm under the turtle .   other people had already had the same idea .  shadowy figures sat or sprawled in the darkness .  urn sat dejectedly on his toolbox .  there was a hint of gutted fish .      the gods are angry     said borvorius .      bloody furious     said argavisti .      i   m not that happy myself     said simony .     gods .  huh .         this is no time for impiety     said rham ap efan .   there was a shower of grapes outside .      can   t think of a better one     said simony .   a piece of cornucopia shrapnel bounced off the roof of the turtle  which rocked on its spiked wheels .      but why be angry with us .     said argavisti .     we   re doing what they want .      borvorius tried to smile .     gods  eh .     he said .     can   t live with    em  can   t live without    em .      someone nudged simony  and passed him a soggy cigarette .  it was a tsortean soldier .  despite himself  he took a puff .      it   s good tobacco     he said .     the stuff we grow tastes like camel   s droppings .      he passed it along to the next hunched figure .   thank you .   borvorius produced a flask from somewhere .      will you go to hell if you have a drop of spirit .     he said .      so it seems     said simony  absently .  then he noticed the flask .     oh  you mean alcohol .  probably .  but who cares .  i won   t be able to get near the fire for priests .  thanks .           pass it around .      thank you .   the turtle rocked to a thunderbolt .      g   n y   himbe bo .      they all looked at the pieces of raw fish  and fasta benj   s hopeful expression .      i could rake some of the coals out of the firebox from here     said urn  after a while .   someone tapped simony on the shoulder  creating a strange tingling sensation .   thank you .  i have to go .   as he took it he was aware of the rush of air  a sudden breath in the universe .  he looked around in time to see a wave lift a ship out of the water and smash it against the dunes .   a distant scream colored the wind .   the soldiers stared .      there were people under there     said argavisti .   simony dropped the flask .      come on     he said .   and no one  as they hauled on timbers in the teeth of the gale  as urn applied everything he knew about levers  as they used their helmets as shovels to dig under the wreckage  asked who it was they were digging for  or what kind of uniform they   d been wearing .   fog rolled in on the wind  hot and flashing with electricity  and still the sea pounded down .   simony hauled on a spar  and then found the weight lessen as someone grasped the other end .  he looked up into brutha   s eyes .      don   t say anything     said brutha .      gods are doing this to us .         don   t say anything .           i   ve got to know .         it   s better than us doing this to us  isn   t it .         there   s still people who never got off the ships .         no one ever said it was going to be nice .      simony pulled aside some planking .  there was a man there  armor and leathers so stained as to be unrecognizable  but alive .      listen     said simony  as the wind whipped at him     i   m not giving in .  you   ve haven   t won .  i   m not doing this for any sort of god  whether they exist or not .  i   m doing it for other people .  and stop smiling like that .      a couple of dice dropped on to the sand .  they sparkled and crackled for a while and then evaporated .   the sea calmed .  the fog went ragged and curled into nothingness .  there was still a haze in the air  but the sun was at least visible again  if only as a brighter area in the dome of the sky .   once again  there was the sensation of the universe drawing breath .   the gods appeared  transparent and shimmering in and out of focus .  the sun glinted off a hint of golden curls  and wings  and lyres .   when they spoke  they spoke in unison  their voices drifting ahead or trailing behind the others  as always happens when a group of people are trying to faithfully repeat something they   ve been told to say .   om was in the throng  standing right behind the tsortean god of thunder with a faraway expression on his face .  it was noticeable  if only to brutha  that the thunder god   s right arm disappeared up behind his own back in a way that  if such a thing could be imagined  would suggest that someone was twisting it to the edge of pain .     what the gods said was heard by each combatant in his own language  and according to his own understanding .  it boiled down to   i .  this is not a game .  ii .  here and now  you are alive .       and then it was over .          you   d make a good bishop     said brutha .      me .     said didactylos .     i   m a philosopher .         good .  it   s about time we had one .         and an ephebian .         good .  you can think up a better way of ruling the country .  priests shouldn   t do it .  they can   t think about it properly .  nor can soldiers .         thank you     said simony .   they were sitting in the cenobiarch   s garden .  far overhead an eagle circled  looking for anything that wasn   t a tortoise .      i like the idea of democracy .  you have to have someone everyone distrusts     said brutha .     that way  everyone   s happy .  think about it .  simony .         yes .         i   m making you head of the quisition .         what .         i want it stopped .  and i want it stopped the hard way .         you want me to kill all the inquisitors .  right .         no .  that   s the easy way .  i want as few deaths as possible .  those who enjoyed it  perhaps .  but only those .  now   where   s urn .      the moving turtle was still on the beach  wheels buried in the sand blown about by the storm .  urn had been too embarrassed to try to unearth it .        the last i saw  he was tinkering with the door mechanism     said didactylos .     never happier than when he   s tinkering with things .         yes .  we shall have to find things to keep him occupied .  irrigation .  architecture .  that sort of thing .         and what are you going to do .     said simony .      i   ve got to copy out the library     said brutha .      but you can   t read and write     said didactylos .      no .  but i can see and draw .  two copies .  one to keep here .         plenty of room when we burn the septateuch     said simony .      no burning of anything .  you have to take a step at a time     said brutha .  he looked out at the shimmering line of the desert .  funny .  he   d been as happy as he   d ever been in the desert .      and then       he began .      yes .      brutha lowered his eyes  to the farmlands and villages around the citadel .  he sighed .      and then we   d better get on with things     he said .     every day .          fasta benj rowed home  in a thoughtful frame of mind .   it had been a very good few days .  he   d met a lot of new people and sold quite a lot of fish .  p   tang p   tang  with his lesser servants  had talked personally to him  making him promise not to wage war on some place he   d never heard of .  he   d agreed .      some of the new people had shown him this amazing way of making lightning .  you hit this rock with this piece of hard stuff and you got little bits of lightning which dropped on to dry stuff which got red and hot like the sun .  if you put more wood on it got bigger and if you put a fish on it got black but if you were quick it didn   t get black but got brown and tasted better than anything he   d ever tasted  although this was not difficult .  and he   d been given some knives not made out of rock and cloth not made out of reeds and  all in all  life was looking up for fasta benj and his people .   he wasn   t sure why lots of people would want to hit pacha moj   s uncle with a big rock  but it definitely escalated the pace of technological progress .       no one  not even brutha  noticed that old lu tze wasn   t around any more .  not being noticed  either as being present or absent  is part of a history monk   s stock in trade .   in fact he   d packed his broom and his bonsai mountains and had gone by secret tunnels and devious means to the hidden valley in the central peaks  where the abbot was waiting for him .  the abbot was playing chess in the long gallery that overlooked the valley .  fountains bubbled in the gardens  and swallows flew in and out of the windows .      all went well .     said the abbot  without looking up .      very well  lord     said lu tze .     i had to nudge things a little  though .         i wish you wouldn   t do that sort of thing     said the abbot  fingering a pawn .     you   ll overstep the mark one day .           it   s the history we   ve got these days     said lu tze .     very shoddy stuff  lord .  i have to patch it up all the time           yes  yes           we used to get much better history in the old days .         things were always better than they are now .  it   s in the nature of things .         yes  lord .  lord .      the abbot looked up in mild exasperation .      er   you know the books say that brutha died and there was a century of terrible warfare .         you know my eyesight isn   t what it was  lu tze .         well   it   s not entirely like that now .         just so long as it all turns out all right in the end     said the abbot .      yes  lord     said the history monk .      there are a few weeks before your next assignment .  why don   t you have a little rest .         thank you  lord .  i thought i might go down to the forest and watch a few falling trees .         good practice .  good practice .  mind always on the job  eh .      as lu tze left  the abbot glanced up at his opponent .      good man  that     he said .     your move .      the opponent looked long and hard at the board .   the abbot waited to see what long term  devious strategies were being evolved .  then his opponent tapped a piece with a bony finger .   remind me again  he said .  how the little horse shaped ones move .       eventually brutha died  in unusual circumstances .   he had reached a great age  but this at least was not unusual in the church .  as he said  you had to keep busy  every day .   he rose at dawn  and wandered over to the window .  he liked to watch the sunrise .   they hadn   t got around to replacing the temple doors .  apart from anything else  even urn hadn   t been able to think of a way of removing the weirdly contorted heap of molten metal .  so they   d just built steps over them .  and after a year or two people had quite accepted it  and said it was probably a symbol .  not of anything  exactly  but still a symbol .  definitely symbolic .   but the sun did shine off the copper dome of the library .  brutha made a mental note to enquire about the progress of the new wing .  there were too many complaints about overcrowding these days .   people came from everywhere to visit the library .  it was the biggest non magical library in the world .  half the philosophers of ephebe seemed to live there now  and omnia was even producing one or two of its own .  and even priests were coming to spend some time in it  because of the collection of religious books .  there were one thousand  two hundred and eighty three religious books in there now  each one   according to itself   the only book any man need ever read .  it was sort of nice to see them all together .  as didactylos used to say  you had to laugh .   it was while brutha was eating his breakfast that the subdeacon whose job it was to read him his appointments for the day  and tactfully make sure he wasn   t wearing his underpants on the outside  shyly offered him congratulations .      mmm .     said brutha  his gruel dripping off the spoon .        one hundred years     said the subdeacon .     since you walked in the desert  sir .         really .  i thought it was  mm  fifty years .  can   t be more than sixty years  boy .         uh  one hundred years  lord .  we had a look in the records .         really .  one hundred years .  one hundred years    time .     brutha laid down his spoon very carefully  and stared at the plain white wall opposite him .  the subdeacon found himself turning to see what it was the cenobiarch was looking at  but there was nothing  only the whiteness of the wall .      one hundred years     mused brutha .     mmm .  good lord .  i forgot .     he laughed .     i forgot .  one hundred years  eh .  but here and now  we        the subdeacon turned around .      cenobiarch .      he stepped closer  the blood draining from his face .      lord .      he turned and ran for help .   brutha   s body toppled forward almost gracefully  smacking into the table .  the bowl overturned  and gruel dripped down on to the floor .   and then brutha stood up  without a second glance at his corpse .      hah .  i wasn   t expecting you     he said .   death stopped leaning against the wall .   how fortunate you were .      but there   s still such a lot to be done        yes .  there always is .   brutha followed the gaunt figure through the wall where  instead of the privy that occupied the far side in normal space  there was          black sand .   the light was brilliant  crystalline  in a black sky filled with stars .      ah .  there really is a desert .  does everyone get this .     said brutha .   who knows .      and what is at the end of the desert .      judgment .   brutha considered this .      which end .      death grinned and stepped aside .   what brutha had thought was a rock in the sand was a hunched figure  sitting clutching its knees .  it looked paralyzed with fear .   he stared .      vorbis .     he said .   he looked at death .      but vorbis died a hundred years ago .      yes .  he had to walk it all alone .  all alone with himself .  if he dared .      he   s been here for a hundred years .      possibly not .  time is different here .  it is   more personal .      ah .  you mean a hundred years can pass like a few seconds .      a hundred years can pass like infinity .   the black on black eyes stared imploringly at brutha  who reached out automatically  without thinking   and then hesitated .   he was a murderer  said death .  and a creator of murderers .  a torturer .  without passion .  cruel .  callous .  compassionless .      yes .  i know .  he   s vorbis     said brutha .  vorbis changed people .  sometimes he changed them into dead people .  but he always changed them .  that was his triumph .   he sighed .      but i   m me     he said .   vorbis stood up  uncertainly  and followed brutha across the desert .   death watched them walk away .       about the author      terry pratchett is one of the most popular living authors in the world .  his first story was published when he was thirteen  and his first full
