years ago  to expatiate on the vicious addiction of the lower classes of society to sunday excursions  and were thus instrumental in calling forth occasional demonstrations of those extreme opinions on the subject  which are very generally received with derision  if not with contempt .   your elevated station  my lord  affords you countless opportunities of increasing the comforts and pleasures of the humbler classes of society  not by the expenditure of the smallest portion of your princely income  but by merely sanctioning with the influence of your example  their harmless pastimes  and innocent recreations .   that your lordship would ever have contemplated sunday recreations with so much horror  if you had been at all acquainted with the wants and necessities of the people who indulged in them  i cannot imagine possible .  that a prelate of your elevated rank has the faintest conception of the extent of those wants  and the nature of those necessities  i do not believe .   for these reasons  i venture to address this little pamphlet to your lordship s consideration .  i am quite conscious that the outlines i have drawn  afford but a very imperfect description of the feelings they are intended to illustrate  but i claim for them one merit  their truth and freedom from exaggeration .  i may have fallen short of the mark  but i have never overshot it  and while i have pointed out what appears to me  to be injustice on the part of others  i hope i have carefully abstained from committing it myself .   i am  my lord  your lordship s most obedient  humble servant  timothy sparks .  june       .                chapter i     as it is           there are few things from which i derive greater pleasure  than walking through some of the principal streets of london on a fine sunday  in summer  and watching the cheerful faces of the lively groups with which they are thronged .  there is something  to my eyes at least  exceedingly pleasing in the general desire evinced by the humbler classes of society  to appear neat and clean on this their only holiday .  there are many grave old persons  i know  who shake their heads with an air of profound wisdom  and tell you that poor people dress too well now a days  that when they were children  folks knew their stations in life better  that you may depend upon it  no good will come of this sort of thing in the end   and so forth  but i fancy i can discern in the fine bonnet of the working man s wife  or the feather bedizened hat of his child  no inconsiderable evidence of good feeling on the part of the man himself  and an affectionate desire to expend the few shillings he can spare from his week s wages  in improving the appearance and adding to the happiness of those who are nearest and dearest to him .  this may be a very heinous and unbecoming degree of vanity  perhaps  and the money might possibly be applied to better uses  it must not be forgotten  however  that it might very easily be devoted to worse  and if two or three faces can be rendered happy and contented  by a trifling improvement of outward appearance  i cannot help thinking that the object is very cheaply purchased  even at the expense of a smart gown  or a gaudy riband .  there is a great deal of very unnecessary cant about the over  dressing of the common people .  there is not a manufacturer or tradesman in existence  who would not employ a man who takes a reasonable degree of pride in the appearance of himself and those about him  in preference to a sullen  slovenly fellow  who works doggedly on  regardless of his own clothing and that of his wife and children  and seeming to take pleasure or pride in nothing .  the pampered aristocrat  whose life is one continued round of licentious pleasures and sensual gratifications  or the gloomy enthusiast  who detests the cheerful amusements he can never enjoy  and envies the healthy feelings he can never know  and who would put down the one and suppress the other  until he made the minds of his fellow beings as besotted and distorted as his own   neither of these men can by possibility form an adequate notion of what sunday really is to those whose lives are spent in sedentary or laborious occupations  and who are accustomed to look forward to it through their whole existence  as their only day of rest from toil  and innocent enjoyment .   the sun that rises over the quiet streets of london on a bright sunday morning  shines till his setting  on gay and happy faces .  here and there  so early as six o clock  a young man and woman in their best attire  may be seen hurrying along on their way to the house of some acquaintance  who is included in their scheme of pleasure for the day  from whence  after stopping to take  a bit of breakfast   they sally forth  accompanied by several old people  and a whole crowd of young ones  bearing large hand baskets full of provisions  and belcher handkerchiefs done up in bundles  with the neck of a bottle sticking out at the top  and closely packed apples bulging out at the sides   and away they hurry along the streets leading to the steam packet wharfs  which are already plentifully sprinkled with parties bound for the same destination .  their good humour and delight know no bounds  for it is a delightful morning  all blue over head  and nothing like a cloud in the whole sky  and even the air of the river at london bridge is something to them  shut up as they have been  all the week  in close streets and heated rooms .  there are dozens of steamers to all sorts of places   gravesend  greenwich  and richmond  and such numbers of people  that when you have once sat down on the deck  it is all but a moral impossibility to get up again  to say nothing of walking about  which is entirely out of the question .  away they go  joking and laughing  and eating and drinking  and admiring everything they see  and pleased with everything they hear  to climb windmill hill  and catch a glimpse of the rich corn fields and beautiful orchards of kent  or to stroll among the fine old trees of greenwich park  and survey the wonders of shooter s hill and lady james s folly  or to glide past the beautiful meadows of twickenham and richmond  and to gaze with a delight which only people like them can know  on every lovely object in the fair prospect around .  boat follows boat  and coach succeeds coach  for the next three hours  but all are filled  and all with the same kind of people  neat and clean  cheerful and contented .   they reach their places of destination  and the taverns are crowded  but there is no drunkenness or brawling  for the class of men who commit the enormity of making sunday excursions  take their families with them  and this in itself would be a check upon them  even if they were inclined to dissipation  which they really are not .  boisterous their mirth may be  for they have all the excitement of feeling that fresh air and green fields can impart to the dwellers in crowded cities  but it is innocent and harmless .  the glass is circulated  and the joke goes round  but the one is free from excess  and the other from offence  and nothing but good humour and hilarity prevail .   in streets like holborn and tottenham court road  which form the central market of a large neighbourhood  inhabited by a vast number of mechanics and poor people  a few shops are open at an early hour of the morning  and a very poor man  with a thin and sickly woman by his side  may be seen with their little basket in hand  purchasing the scanty quantity of necessaries they can afford  which the time at which the man receives his wages  or his having a good deal of work to do  or the woman s having been out charing till a late hour  prevented their procuring over night .  the coffee shops too  at which clerks and young men employed in counting houses can procure their breakfasts  are also open .  this class comprises  in a place like london  an enormous number of people  whose limited means prevent their engaging for their lodgings any other apartment than a bedroom  and who have consequently no alternative but to take their breakfasts at a coffee shop  or go without it altogether .  all these places  however  are quickly closed  and by the time the church bells begin to ring  all appearance of traffic has ceased .  and then  what are the signs of immorality that meet the eye .  churches are well filled  and dissenters  chapels are crowded to suffocation .  there is no preaching to empty benches  while the drunken and dissolute populace run riot in the streets .   here is a fashionable church  where the service commences at a late hour  for the accommodation of such members of the congregation   and they are not a few  as may happen to have lingered at the opera far into the morning of the sabbath  an excellent contrivance for poising the balance between god and mammon  and illustrating the ease with which a man s duties to both  may be accommodated and adjusted .  how the carriages rattle up  and deposit their richly  dressed burdens beneath the lofty portico .  the powdered footmen glide along the aisle  place the richly bound prayer books on the pew desks  slam the doors  and hurry away  leaving the fashionable members of the congregation to inspect each other through their glasses  and to dazzle and glitter in the eyes of the few shabby people in the free seats .  the organ peals forth  the hired singers commence a short hymn  and the congregation condescendingly rise  stare about them  and converse in whispers .  the clergyman enters the reading desk   a young man of noble family and elegant demeanour  notorious at cambridge for his knowledge of horse flesh and dancers  and celebrated at eton for his hopeless stupidity .  the service commences .  mark the soft voice in which he reads  and the impressive manner in which he applies his white hand  studded with brilliants  to his perfumed hair .  observe the graceful emphasis with which he offers up the prayers for the king  the royal family  and all the nobility  and the nonchalance with which he hurries over the more uncomfortable portions of the service  the seventh commandment for instance  with a studied regard for the taste and feeling of his auditors  only to be equalled by that displayed by the sleek divine who succeeds him  who murmurs  in a voice kept down by rich feeding  most comfortable doctrines for exactly twelve minutes  and then arrives at the anxiously expected  now to god   which is the signal for the dismissal of the congregation .  the organ is again heard  those who have been asleep wake up  and those who have kept awake  smile and seem greatly relieved  bows and congratulations are exchanged  the livery servants are all bustle and commotion  bang go the steps  up jump the footmen  and off rattle the carriages  the inmates discoursing on the dresses of the congregation  and congratulating themselves on having set so excellent an example to the community in general  and sunday pleasurers in particular .   enter a less orthodox place of religious worship  and observe the contrast .  a small close chapel with a white washed wall  and plain deal pews and pulpit  contains a closely packed congregation  as different in dress  as they are opposed in manner  to that we have just quitted .  the hymn is sung  not by paid singers  but by the whole assembly at the loudest pitch of their voices  unaccompanied by any musical instrument  the words being given out  two lines at a time  by the clerk .  there is something in the sonorous quavering of the harsh voices  in the lank and hollow faces of the men  and the sour solemnity of the women  which bespeaks this a strong hold of intolerant zeal and ignorant enthusiasm .  the preacher enters the pulpit .  he is a coarse  hard faced man of forbidding aspect  clad in rusty black  and bearing in his hand a small plain bible from which he selects some passage for his text  while the hymn is concluding .  the congregation fall upon their knees  and are hushed into profound stillness as he delivers an extempore prayer  in which he calls upon the sacred founder of the christian faith to bless his ministry  in terms of disgusting and impious familiarity not to be described .  he begins his oration in a drawling tone  and his hearers listen with silent attention .  he grows warmer as he proceeds with his subject  and his gesticulation becomes proportionately violent .  he clenches his fists  beats the book upon the desk before him  and swings his arms wildly about his head .  the congregation murmur their acquiescence in his doctrines  and a short groan  occasionally bears testimony to the moving nature of his eloquence .  encouraged by these symptoms of approval  and working himself up to a pitch of enthusiasm amounting almost to frenzy  he denounces sabbath breakers with the direst vengeance of offended heaven .  he stretches his body half out of the pulpit  thrusts forth his arms with frantic gestures  and blasphemously calls upon the deity to visit with eternal torments  those who turn aside from the word  as interpreted and preached by  himself .  a low moaning is heard  the women rock their bodies to and fro  and wring their hands  the preacher s fervour increases  the perspiration starts upon his brow  his face is flushed  and he clenches his hands convulsively  as he draws a hideous and appalling picture of the horrors preparing for the wicked in a future state .  a great excitement is visible among his hearers  a scream is heard  and some young girl falls senseless on the floor .  there is a momentary rustle  but it is only for a moment  all eyes are turned towards the preacher .  he pauses  passes his handkerchief across his face  and looks complacently round .  his voice resumes its natural tone  as with mock humility he offers up a thanksgiving for having been successful in his efforts  and having been permitted to rescue one sinner from the path of evil .  he sinks back into his seat  exhausted with the violence of his ravings  the girl is removed  a hymn is sung  a petition for some measure for securing the better observance of the sabbath  which has been prepared by the good man  is read  and his worshipping admirers struggle who shall be the first to sign it .   but the morning service has concluded  and the streets are again crowded with people .  long rows of cleanly dressed charity children  preceded by a portly beadle and a withered schoolmaster  are returning to their welcome dinner  and it is evident  from the number of men with beer trays who are running from house to house  that no inconsiderable portion of the population are about to take theirs at this early hour .  the bakers  shops in the humbler suburbs especially  are filled with men  women  and children  each anxiously waiting for the sunday dinner .  look at the group of children who surround that working man who has just emerged from the baker s shop at the corner of the street  with the reeking dish  in which a diminutive joint of mutton simmers above a vast heap of half browned potatoes .  how the young rogues clap their hands  and dance round their father  for very joy at the prospect of the feast  and how anxiously the youngest and chubbiest of the lot  lingers on tiptoe by his side  trying to get a peep into the interior of the dish .  they turn up the street  and the chubby  faced boy trots on as fast as his little legs will carry him  to herald the approach of the dinner to  mother  who is standing with a baby in her arms on the doorstep  and who seems almost as pleased with the whole scene as the children themselves  whereupon  baby  not precisely understanding the importance of the business in hand  but clearly perceiving that it is something unusually lively  kicks and crows most lustily  to the unspeakable delight of all the children and both the parents  and the dinner is borne into the house amidst a shouting of small voices  and jumping of fat legs  which would fill sir andrew agnew with astonishment  as well it might  seeing that baronets  generally speaking  eat pretty comfortable dinners all the week through  and cannot be expected to understand what people feel  who only have a meat dinner on one day out of every seven .   the bakings being all duly consigned to their respective owners  and the beer man having gone his rounds  the church bells ring for afternoon service  the shops are again closed  and the streets are more than ever thronged with people  some who have not been to church in the morning  going to it now  others who have been to church  going out for a walk  and others  let us admit the full measure of their guilt  going for a walk  who have not been to church at all .  i am afraid the smart servant of all work  who has been loitering at the corner of the square for the last ten minutes  is one of the latter class .  she is evidently waiting for somebody  and though she may have made up her mind to go to church with him one of these mornings  i don t think they have any such intention on this particular afternoon .  here he is  at last .  the white trousers  blue coat  and yellow waistcoat  and more especially that cock of the hat  indicate  as surely as inanimate objects can  that chalk farm and not the parish church  is their destination .  the girl colours up  and puts out her hand with a very awkward affectation of indifference .  he gives it a gallant squeeze  and away they walk  arm in arm  the girl just looking back towards her  place  with an air of conscious self importance  and nodding to her fellow servant who has gone up to the two pair of  stairs window  to take a full view of  mary s young man   which being communicated to william  he takes off his hat to the fellow  servant  a proceeding which affords unmitigated satisfaction to all parties  and impels the fellow servant to inform miss emily confidentially  in the course of the evening   that the young man as mary keeps company with  is one of the most genteelest young men as ever she see .    the two young people who have just crossed the road  and are following this happy couple down the street  are a fair specimen of another class of sunday  pleasurers .  there is a dapper smartness  struggling through very limited means  about the young man  which induces one to set him down at once as a junior clerk to a tradesman or attorney .  the girl no one could possibly mistake .  you may tell a young woman in the employment of a large dress  maker  at any time  by a certain neatness of cheap finery and humble following of fashion  which pervade her whole attire  but unfortunately there are other tokens not to be misunderstood  the pale face with its hectic bloom  the slight distortion of form which no artifice of dress can wholly conceal  the unhealthy stoop  and the short cough  the effects of hard work and close application to a sedentary employment  upon a tender frame .  they turn towards the fields .  the girl s countenance brightens  and an unwonted glow rises in her face .  they are going to hampstead or highgate  to spend their holiday afternoon in some place where they can see the sky  the fields  and trees  and breathe for an hour or two the pure air  which so seldom plays upon that poor girl s form  or exhilarates her spirits .   i would to god  that the iron hearted man who would deprive such people as these of their only pleasures  could feel the sinking of heart and soul  the wasting exhaustion of mind and body  the utter prostration of present strength and future hope  attendant upon that incessant toil which lasts from day to day  and from month to month  that toil which is too often protracted until the silence of midnight  and resumed with the first stir of morning .  how marvellously would his ardent zeal for other men s souls  diminish after a short probation  and how enlightened and comprehensive would his views of the real object and meaning of the institution of the sabbath become .   the afternoon is far advanced  the parks and public drives are crowded .  carriages  gigs  phaetons  stanhopes  and vehicles of every description  glide smoothly on .  the promenades are filled with loungers on foot  and the road is thronged with loungers on horseback .  persons of every class are crowded together  here  in one dense mass .  the plebeian  who takes his pleasure on no day but sunday  jostles the patrician  who takes his  from year s end to year s end .  you look in vain for any outward signs of profligacy or debauchery .  you see nothing before you but a vast number of people  the denizens of a large and crowded city  in the needful and rational enjoyment of air and exercise .   it grows dusk .  the roads leading from the different places of suburban resort  are crowded with people on their return home  and the sound of merry voices rings through the gradually darkening fields .  the evening is hot and sultry .  the rich man throws open the sashes of his spacious dining room  and quaffs his iced wine in splendid luxury .  the poor man  who has no room to take his meals in  but the close apartment to which he and his family have been confined throughout the week  sits in the tea garden of some famous tavern  and drinks his beer in content and comfort .  the fields and roads are gradually deserted  the crowd once more pour into the streets  and disperse to their several homes  and by midnight all is silent and quiet  save where a few stragglers linger beneath the window of some great man s house  to listen to the strains of music from within  or stop to gaze upon the splendid carriages which are waiting to convey the guests from the dinner party of an earl .   there is a darker side to this picture  on which  so far from its being any part of my purpose to conceal it  i wish to lay particular stress .  in some parts of london  and in many of the manufacturing towns of england  drunkenness and profligacy in their most disgusting forms  exhibit in the open streets on sunday  a sad and a degrading spectacle .  we need go no farther than st .  giles s  or drury lane  for sights and scenes of a most repulsive nature .  women with scarcely the articles of apparel which common decency requires  with forms bloated by disease  and faces rendered hideous by habitual drunkenness  men reeling and staggering along  children in rags and filth  whole streets of squalid and miserable appearance  whose inhabitants are lounging in the public road  fighting  screaming  and swearing  these are the common objects which present themselves in  these are the well known characteristics of  that portion of london to which i have just referred .   and why is it  that all well disposed persons are shocked  and public decency scandalised  by such exhibitions .   these people are poor  that is notorious .  it may be said that they spend in liquor  money with which they might purchase necessaries  and there is no denying the fact  but let it be remembered that even if they applied every farthing of their earnings in the best possible way  they would still be very  very poor .  their dwellings are necessarily uncomfortable  and to a certain degree unhealthy .  cleanliness might do much  but they are too crowded together  the streets are too narrow  and the rooms too small  to admit of their ever being rendered desirable habitations .  they work very hard all the week .  we know that the effect of prolonged and arduous labour  is to produce  when a period of rest does arrive  a sensation of lassitude which it requires the application of some stimulus to overcome .  what stimulus have they .  sunday comes  and with it a cessation of labour .  how are they to employ the day  or what inducement have they to employ it  in recruiting their stock of health .  they see little parties  on pleasure excursions  passing through the streets  but they cannot imitate their example  for they have not the means .  they may walk  to be sure  but it is exactly the inducement to walk that they require .  if every one of these men knew  that by taking the trouble to walk two or three miles he would be enabled to share in a good game of cricket  or some athletic sport  i very much question whether any of them would remain at home .   but you hold out no inducement  you offer no relief from listlessness  you provide nothing to amuse his mind  you afford him no means of exercising his body .  unwashed and unshaven  he saunters moodily about  weary and dejected .  in lieu of the wholesome stimulus he might derive from nature  you drive him to the pernicious excitement to be gained from art .  he flies to the gin shop as his only resource  and when  reduced to a worse level than the lowest brute in the scale of creation  he lies wallowing in the kennel  your saintly lawgivers lift up their hands to heaven  and exclaim for a law which shall convert the day intended for rest and cheerfulness  into one of universal gloom  bigotry  and persecution .                chapter ii     as sabbath bills would make it           the provisions of the bill introduced into the house of commons by sir andrew agnew  and thrown out by that house on the motion for the second reading  on the   th of may in the present year  by a majority of     may very fairly be taken as a test of the length to which the fanatics  of which the honourable baronet is the distinguished leader  are prepared to go .  no test can be fairer  because while on the one hand this measure may be supposed to exhibit all that improvement which mature reflection and long deliberation may have suggested  so on the other it may very reasonably be inferred  that if it be quite as severe in its provisions  and to the full as partial in its operation  as those which have preceded it and experienced a similar fate  the disease under which the honourable baronet and his friends labour  is perfectly hopeless  and beyond the reach of cure .  the proposed enactments of the bill are briefly these   all work is prohibited on the lord s day  under heavy penalties  increasing with every repetition of the offence .  there are penalties for keeping shops open  penalties for drunkenness  penalties for keeping open houses of entertainment  penalties for being present at any public meeting or assembly  penalties for letting carriages  and penalties for hiring them  penalties for travelling in steam  boats  and penalties for taking passengers  penalties on vessels commencing their voyage on sunday  penalties on the owners of cattle who suffer them to be driven on the lord s day  penalties on constables who refuse to act  and penalties for resisting them when they do .  in addition to these trifles  the constables are invested with arbitrary  vexatious  and most extensive powers  and all this in a bill which sets out with a hypocritical and canting declaration that  nothing is more acceptable to god than the true and sincere worship of him according to his holy will  and that it is the bounden duty of parliament to promote the observance of the lord s day  by protecting every class of society against being required to sacrifice their comfort  health  religious privileges  and conscience  for the convenience  enjoyment  or supposed advantage of any other class on the lord s day  .  the idea of making a man truly moral through the ministry of constables  and sincerely religious under the influence of penalties  is worthy of the mind which could form such a mass of monstrous absurdity as this bill is composed of .   the house of commons threw the measure out certainly  and by so doing retrieved the disgrace  so far as it could be retrieved  of placing among the printed papers of parliament  such an egregious specimen of legislative folly  but there was a degree of delicacy and forbearance about the debate that took place  which i cannot help thinking as unnecessary and uncalled for  as it is unusual in parliamentary discussions .  if it had been the first time of sir andrew agnew s attempting to palm such a measure upon the country  we might well understand  and duly appreciate  the delicate and compassionate feeling due to the supposed weakness and imbecility of the man  which prevented his proposition being exposed in its true colours  and induced this hon .  member to bear testimony to his excellent motives  and that noble lord to regret that he could not   although he had tried to do so  adopt any portion of the bill .  but when these attempts have been repeated  again and again  when sir andrew agnew has renewed them session after session  and when it has become palpably evident to the whole house that  his impudence of proof in every trial  kens no polite  and heeds no plain denial    it really becomes high time to speak of him and his legislation  as they appear to deserve  without that gloss of politeness  which is all very well in an ordinary case  but rather out of place when the liberties and comforts of a whole people are at stake .   in the first place  it is by no means the worst characteristic of this bill  that it is a bill of blunders  it is  from beginning to end  a piece of deliberate cruelty  and crafty injustice .  if the rich composed the whole population of this country  not a single comfort of one single man would be affected by it .  it is directed exclusively  and without the exception of a solitary instance  against the amusements and recreations of the poor .  this was the bait held out by the hon .  baronet to a body of men  who cannot be supposed to have any very strong sympathies in common with the poor  because they cannot understand their sufferings or their struggles .  this is the bait  which will in time prevail  unless public attention is awakened  and public feeling exerted  to prevent it .   take the very first clause  the provision that no man shall be allowed to work on sunday   that no person  upon the lord s day  shall do  or hire  or employ any person to do any manner of labour  or any work of his or her ordinary calling .   what class of persons does this affect .  the rich man .  no .  menial servants  both male and female  are specially exempted from the operation of the bill .   menial servants  are among the poor people .  the bill has no regard for them .  the baronet s dinner must be cooked on sunday  the bishop s horses must be groomed  and the peer s carriage must be driven .  so the menial servants are put utterly beyond the pale of grace   unless indeed  they are to go to heaven through the sanctity of their masters  and possibly they might think even that  rather an uncertain passport .   there is a penalty for keeping open  houses of entertainment .  now  suppose the bill had passed  and that half a dozen adventurous licensed victuallers  relying upon the excitement of public feeling on the subject  and the consequent difficulty of conviction  this is by no means an improbable supposition   had determined to keep their houses and gardens open  through the whole sunday afternoon  in defiance of the law .  every act of hiring or working  every act of buying or selling  or delivering  or causing anything to be bought or sold  is specifically made a separate offence  mark the effect .  a party  a man and his wife and children  enter a tea  garden  and the informer stations himself in the next box  from whence he can see and hear everything that passes .   waiter .   says the father .   yes .  sir .    pint of the best ale .    yes  sir .   away runs the waiter to the bar  and gets the ale from the landlord .  out comes the informer s note book  penalty on the father for hiring  on the waiter for delivering  and on the landlord for selling  on the lord s day .  but it does not stop here .  the waiter delivers the ale  and darts off  little suspecting the penalties in store for him .   hollo   cries the father   waiter .    yes  sir .    just get this little boy a biscuit  will you .    yes  sir .   off runs the waiter again  and down goes another case of hiring  another case of delivering  and another case of selling  and so it would go on ad infinitum  the sum and substance of the matter being  that every time a man or woman cried  waiter .   on sunday  he or she would be fined not less than forty shillings  nor more than a hundred  and every time a waiter replied   yes  sir   he and his master would be fined in the same amount  with the addition of a new sort of window duty on the landlord  to wit  a tax of twenty shillings an hour for every hour beyond the first one  during which he should have his shutters down on the sabbath .   with one exception  there are perhaps no clauses in the whole bill  so strongly illustrative of its partial operation  and the intention of its framer  as those which relate to travelling on sunday .  penalties of ten  twenty  and thirty pounds  are mercilessly imposed upon coach proprietors who shall run their coaches on the sabbath  one  two  and ten pounds upon those who hire  or let to hire  horses and carriages upon the lord s day  but not one syllable about those who have no necessity to hire  because they have carriages and horses of their own  not one word of a penalty on liveried coachmen and footmen .  the whole of the saintly venom is directed against the hired cabriolet  the humble fly  or the rumbling hackney coach  which enables a man of the poorer class to escape for a few hours from the smoke and dirt  in the midst of which he has been confined throughout the week  while the escutcheoned carriage and the dashing cab  may whirl their wealthy owners to sunday feasts and private oratorios  setting constables  informers  and penalties  at defiance .  again  in the description of the places of public resort which it is rendered criminal to attend on sunday  there are no words comprising a very fashionable promenade .  public discussions  public debates  public lectures and speeches  are cautiously guarded against  for it is by their means that the people become enlightened enough to deride the last efforts of bigotry and superstition .  there is a stringent provision for punishing the poor man who spends an hour in a news  room  but there is nothing to prevent the rich one from lounging away the day in the zoological gardens .   there is  in four words  a mock proviso  which affects to forbid travelling  with any animal  on the lord s day .  this  however  is revoked  as relates to the rich man  by a subsequent provision .  we have then a penalty of not less than fifty  nor more than one hundred pounds  upon any person participating in the control  or having the command of any vessel which shall commence her voyage on the lord s day  should the wind prove favourable .  the next time this bill is brought forward  which will no doubt be at an early period of the next session of parliament  perhaps it will be better to amend this clause by declaring  that from and after the passing of the act  it shall be deemed unlawful for the wind to blow at all upon the sabbath .  it would remove a great deal of temptation from the owners and captains of vessels .   the reader is now in possession of the principal enacting clauses of sir andrew agnew s bill  with the exception of one  for preventing the killing or taking of  fish  or other wild animals   and the ordinary provisions which are inserted for form s sake in all acts of parliament .  i now beg his attention to the clauses of exemption .   they are two in number .  the first exempts menial servants from any rest  and all poor men from any recreation  outlaws a milkman after nine o clock in the morning  and makes eating houses lawful for only two hours in the afternoon  permits a medical man to use his carriage on sunday  and declares that a clergyman may either use his own  or hire one .   the second is artful  cunning  and designing  shielding the rich man from the possibility of being entrapped  and affecting at the same time  to have a tender and scrupulous regard  for the interests of the whole community .  it declares   that nothing in this act contained  shall extend to works of piety  charity  or necessity .    what is meant by the word  necessity  in this clause .  simply this   that the rich man shall be at liberty to make use of all the splendid luxuries he has collected around him  on any day in the week  because habit and custom have rendered them  necessary  to his easy existence  but that the poor man who saves his money to provide some little pleasure for himself and family at lengthened intervals  shall not be permitted to enjoy it .  it is not  necessary  to him   heaven knows  he very often goes long enough without it .  this is the plain english of the clause .  the carriage and pair of horses  the coachman  the footman  the helper  and the groom  are  necessary  on sundays  as on other days  to the bishop and the nobleman  but the hackney coach  the hired gig  or the taxed cart  cannot possibly be  necessary  to the working man on sunday  for he has it not at other times .  the sumptuous dinner and the rich wines  are  necessaries  to a great man in his own mansion  but the pint of beer and the plate of meat  degrade the national character in an eating house .   such is the bill for promoting the true and sincere worship of god according to his holy will  and for protecting every class of society against being required to sacrifice their health and comfort on the sabbath .  instances in which its operation would be as unjust as it would be absurd  might be multiplied to an endless amount  but it is sufficient to place its leading provisions before the reader .  in doing so  i have purposely abstained from drawing upon the imagination for possible cases  the provisions to which i have referred  stand in so many words upon the bill as printed by order of the house of commons  and they can neither be disowned  nor explained away .   let us suppose such a bill as this  to have actually passed both branches of the legislature  to have received the royal assent  and to have come into operation .  imagine its effect in a great city like london .   sunday comes  and brings with it a day of general gloom and austerity .  the man who has been toiling hard all the week  has been looking towards the sabbath  not as to a day of rest from labour  and healthy recreation  but as one of grievous tyranny and grinding oppression .  the day which his maker intended as a blessing  man has converted into a curse .  instead of being hailed by him as his period of relaxation  he finds it remarkable only as depriving him of every comfort and enjoyment .  he has many children about him  all sent into the world at an early age  to struggle for a livelihood  one is kept in a warehouse all day  with an interval of rest too short to enable him to reach home  another walks four or five miles to his employment at the docks  a third earns a few shillings weekly  as an errand boy  or office messenger  and the employment of the man himself  detains him at some distance from his home from morning till night .  sunday is the only day on which they could all meet together  and enjoy a homely meal in social comfort  and now they sit down to a cold and cheerless dinner  the pious guardians of the man s salvation having  in their regard for the welfare of his precious soul  shut up the bakers  shops .  the fire blazes high in the kitchen chimney of these well fed hypocrites  and the rich steams of the savoury dinner scent the air .  what care they to be told that this class of men have neither a place to cook in  nor means to bear the expense  if they had .   look into your churches  diminished congregations  and scanty attendance .  people have grown sullen and obstinate  and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this  once in every seven .  and as you cannot make people religious by act of parliament  or force them to church by constables  they display their feeling by staying away .   turn into the streets  and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around .  the roads are empty  the fields are deserted  the houses of entertainment are closed .  groups of filthy and discontented looking men  are idling about at the street corners  or sleeping in the sun  but there are no decently dressed people of the poorer class  passing to and fro .  where should they walk to .  it would take them an hour  at least  to get into the fields  and when they reached them  they could procure neither bite nor sup  without the informer and the penalty .  now and then  a carriage rolls smoothly on  or a well mounted horseman  followed by a liveried attendant  canters by  but with these exceptions  all is as melancholy and quiet as if a pestilence had fallen on the city .   bend your steps through the narrow and thickly inhabited streets  and observe the sallow faces of the men and women who are lounging at the doors  or lolling from the windows .  regard well the closeness of these crowded rooms  and the noisome exhalations that rise from the drains and kennels  and then laud the triumph of religion and morality  which condemns people to drag their lives out in such stews as these  and makes it criminal for them to eat or drink in the fresh air  or under the clear sky .  here and there  from some half opened window  the loud shout of drunken revelry strikes upon the ear  and the noise of oaths and quarrelling  the effect of the close and heated atmosphere  is heard on all sides .  see how the men all rush to join the crowd that are making their way down the street  and how loud the execrations of the mob become as they draw nearer .  they have assembled round a little knot of constables  who have seized the stock in trade  heinously exposed on sunday  of some miserable walking stick seller  who follows clamouring for his property .  the dispute grows warmer and fiercer  until at last some of the more furious among the crowd  rush forward to restore the goods to their owner .  a general conflict takes place  the sticks of the constables are exercised in all directions  fresh assistance is procured  and half a dozen of the assailants are conveyed to the station house  struggling  bleeding  and cursing .  the case is taken to the police office on the following morning  and after a frightful amount of perjury on both sides  the men are sent to prison for resisting the officers  their families to the workhouse to keep them from starving  and there they both remain for a month afterwards  glorious trophies of the sanctified enforcement of the christian sabbath .  add to such scenes as these  the profligacy  idleness  drunkenness  and vice  that will be committed to an extent which no man can foresee  on monday  as an atonement for the restraint of the preceding day  and you have a very faint and imperfect picture of the religious effects of this sunday legislation  supposing it could ever be forced upon the people .   but let those who advocate the cause of fanaticism  reflect well upon the probable issue of their endeavours .  they may by perseverance  succeed with parliament .  let them ponder on the probability of succeeding with the people .  you may deny the concession of a political question for a time  and a nation will bear it patiently .  strike home to the comforts of every man s fireside  tamper with every man s freedom and liberty  and one month  one week  may rouse a feeling abroad  which a king would gladly yield his crown to quell  and a peer would resign his coronet to allay .   it is the custom to affect a deference for the motives of those who advocate these measures  and a respect for the feelings by which they are actuated .  they do not deserve it .  if they legislate in ignorance  they are criminal and dishonest  if they do so with their eyes open  they commit wilful injustice  in either case  they bring religion into contempt .  but they do not legislate in ignorance .  public prints  and public men  have pointed out to them again and again  the consequences of their proceedings .  if they persist in thrusting themselves forward  let those consequences rest upon their own heads  and let them be content to stand upon their own merits .   it may be asked  what motives can actuate a man who has so little regard for the comfort of his fellow beings  so little respect for their wants and necessities  and so distorted a notion of the beneficence of his creator .  i reply  an envious  heartless  ill  conditioned dislike to seeing those whom fortune has placed below him  cheerful and happy  an intolerant confidence in his own high worthiness before god  and a lofty impression of the demerits of others  pride  selfish pride  as inconsistent with the spirit of christianity itself  as opposed to the example of its founder upon earth .   to these may be added another class of men  the stern and gloomy enthusiasts  who would make earth a hell  and religion a torment  men who  having wasted the earlier part of their lives in dissipation and depravity  find themselves when scarcely past its meridian  steeped to the neck in vice  and shunned like a loathsome disease .  abandoned by the world  having nothing to fall back upon  nothing to remember but time mis spent  and energies misdirected  they turn their eyes and not their thoughts to heaven  and delude themselves into the impious belief  that in denouncing the lightness of heart of which they cannot partake  and the rational pleasures from which they never derived enjoyment  they are more than remedying the sins of their old career  and  like the founders of monasteries and builders of churches  in ruder days   establishing a good set claim upon their maker .                chapter iii     as it might be made           the supporters of sabbath bills  and more especially the extreme class of dissenters  lay great stress upon the declarations occasionally made by criminals from the condemned cell or the scaffold  that to sabbath breaking they attribute their first deviation from the path of rectitude  and they point to these statements  as an incontestable proof of the evil consequences which await a departure from that strict and rigid observance of the sabbath  which they uphold .  i cannot help thinking that in this  as in almost every other respect connected with the subject  there is a considerable degree of cant  and a very great deal of wilful blindness .  if a man be viciously disposed  and with very few exceptions  not a man dies by the executioner s hands  who has not been in one way or other a most abandoned and profligate character for many years  if a man be viciously disposed  there is no doubt that he will turn his sunday to bad account  that he will take advantage of it  to dissipate with other bad characters as vile as himself  and that in this way  he may trace his first yielding to temptation  possibly his first commission of crime  to an infringement of the sabbath .  but this would be an argument against any holiday at all .  if his holiday had been wednesday instead of sunday  and he had devoted it to the same improper uses  it would have been productive of the same results .  it is too much to judge of the character of a whole people  by the confessions of the very worst members of society .  it is not fair  to cry down things which are harmless in themselves  because evil disposed men may turn them to bad account .  who ever thought of deprecating the teaching poor people to write  because some porter in a warehouse had committed forgery .  or into what man s head did it ever enter  to prevent the crowding of churches  because it afforded a temptation for the picking of pockets .  when the book of sports  for allowing the peasantry of england to divert themselves with certain games in the open air  on sundays  after evening service  was published by charles the first  it is needless to say the english people were comparatively rude and uncivilised .  and yet it is extraordinary to how few excesses it gave rise  even in that day  when men s minds were not enlightened  or their passions moderated  by the influence of education and refinement .  that some excesses were committed through its means  in the remoter parts of the country  and that it was discontinued in those places  in consequence  cannot be denied  but generally speaking  there is no proof whatever on record  of its having had any tendency to increase crime  or to lower the character of the people .   the puritans of that time  were as much opposed to harmless recreations and healthful amusements as those of the present day  and it is amusing to observe that each in their generation  advance precisely the same description of arguments .  in the british museum  there is a curious pamphlet got up by the agnews of charles s time  entitled  a divine tragedie lately acted  or a collection of sundry memorable examples of god s judgements upon sabbath breakers  and other like libertines in their unlawful sports  happening within the realme of england  in the compass only of two yeares last past  since the booke  of sports  was published  worthy to be knowne and considered of all men  especially such who are guilty of the sinne  or archpatrons thereof .   this amusing document  contains some fifty or sixty veritable accounts of balls of fire that fell into churchyards and upset the sporters  and sporters that quarrelled  and upset one another  and so forth  and among them is one anecdote containing an example of a rather different kind  which i cannot resist the temptation of quoting  as strongly illustrative of the fact  that this blinking of the question has not even the recommendation of novelty .    a woman about northampton  the same day that she heard the booke for sports read  went immediately  and having   .  pence in her purse  hired a fellow to goe to the next towne to fetch a minstrell  who coming  she with others fell a dauncing  which continued within night  at which time shee was got with child  which at the birth shee murthering  was detected and apprehended  and being converted before the justice  shee confessed it  and withal told the occasion of it  saying it was her falling to sport on the sabbath  upon the reading of the booke  so as for this treble sinfull act  her presumptuous profaning of the sabbath  wh .  brought her adultory and that murther .  shee was according to the law both of god and man  put to death .  much sinne and misery followeth upon sabbath breaking .    it is needless to say  that if the young lady near northampton had  fallen to sport  of such a dangerous description  on any other day but sunday  the first result would probably have been the same  it never having been distinctly shown that sunday is more favourable to the propagation of the human race than any other day in the week .  the second result  the murder of the child  does not speak very highly for the amiability of her natural disposition  and the whole story  supposing it to have had any foundation at all  is about as much chargeable upon the book of sports  as upon the book of kings .  such  sports  have taken place in dissenting chapels before now  but religion has never been blamed in consequence  nor has it been proposed to shut up the chapels on that account .   the question  then  very fairly arises  whether we have any reason to suppose that allowing games in the open air on sundays  or even providing the means of amusement for the humbler classes of society on that day  would be hurtful and injurious to the character and morals of the people .   i was travelling in the west of england a summer or two back  and was induced by the beauty of the scenery  and the seclusion of the spot  to remain for the night in a small village  distant about seventy miles from london .  the next morning was sunday  and i walked out  towards the church .  groups of people  the whole population of the little hamlet apparently  were hastening in the same direction .  cheerful and good humoured congratulations were heard on all sides  as neighbours overtook each other  and walked on in company .  occasionally i passed an aged couple  whose married daughter and her husband were loitering by the side of the old people  accommodating their rate of walking to their feeble pace  while a little knot of children hurried on before  stout young labourers in clean round frocks  and buxom girls with healthy  laughing faces  were plentifully sprinkled about in couples  and the whole scene was one of quiet and tranquil contentment  irresistibly captivating .  the morning was bright and pleasant  the hedges were green and blooming  and a thousand delicious scents were wafted on the air  from the wild flowers which blossomed on either side of the footpath .  the little church was one of those venerable simple buildings which abound in the english counties  half overgrown with moss and ivy  and standing in the centre of a little plot of ground  which  but for the green mounds with which it was studded  might have passed for a lovely meadow .  i fancied that the old clanking bell which was now summoning the congregation together  would seem less terrible when it rung out the knell of a departed soul  than i had ever deemed possible before  that the sound would tell only of a welcome to calmness and rest  amidst the most peaceful and tranquil scene in nature .   i followed into the church  a low roofed building with small arched windows  through which the sun s rays streamed upon a plain tablet on the opposite wall  which had once recorded names  now as undistinguishable on its worn surface  as were the bones beneath  from the dust into which they had resolved .  the impressive service of the church of england was spoken  not merely read  by a grey  headed minister  and the responses delivered by his auditors  with an air of sincere devotion as far removed from affectation or display  as from coldness or indifference .  the psalms were accompanied by a few instrumental performers  who were stationed in a small gallery extending across the church at the lower end  over the door  and the voices were led by the clerk  who  it was evident  derived no slight pride and gratification from this portion of the service .  the discourse was plain  unpretending  and well adapted to the comprehension of the hearers .  at the conclusion of the service  the villagers waited in the churchyard  to salute the clergyman as he passed  and two or three  i observed  stepped aside  as if communicating some little difficulty  and asking his advice .  this  to guess from the homely bows  and other rustic expressions of gratitude  the old gentleman readily conceded .  he seemed intimately acquainted with the circumstances of all his parishioners  for i heard him inquire after one man s youngest child  another man s wife  and so forth  and that he was fond of his joke  i discovered from overhearing him ask a stout  fresh coloured young fellow  with a very pretty bashful looking girl on his arm   when those banns were to be put up .    an inquiry which made the young fellow more fresh coloured  and the girl more bashful  and which  strange to say  caused a great many other girls who were standing round  to colour up also  and look anywhere but in the faces of their male companions .   as i approached this spot in the evening about half an hour before sunset  i was surprised to hear the hum of voices  and occasionally a shout of merriment from the meadow beyond the churchyard  which i found  when i reached the stile  to be occasioned by a very animated game of cricket  in which the boys and young men of the place were engaged  while the females and old people were scattered about  some seated on the grass watching the progress of the game  and others sauntering about in groups of two or three  gathering little nosegays of wild roses and hedge flowers .  i could not but take notice of one old man in particular  with a bright eyed grand  daughter by his side  who was giving a sunburnt young fellow some instructions in the game  which he received with an air of profound deference  but with an occasional glance at the girl  which induced me to think that his attention was rather distracted from the old gentleman s narration of the fruits of his experience .  when it was his turn at the wicket  too  there was a glance towards the pair every now and then  which the old grandfather very complacently considered as an appeal to his judgment of a particular hit  but which a certain blush in the girl s face  and a downcast look of the bright eye  led me to believe was intended for somebody else than the old man   and understood by somebody else  too  or i am much mistaken .   i was in the very height of the pleasure which the contemplation of this scene afforded me  when i saw the old clergyman making his way towards us .  i trembled for an angry interruption to the sport  and was almost on the point of crying out  to warn the cricketers of his approach  he was so close upon me  however  that i could do nothing but remain still  and anticipate the reproof that was preparing .  what was my agreeable surprise to see the old gentleman standing at the stile  with his hands in his pockets  surveying the whole scene with evident satisfaction .  and how dull i must have been  not to have known till my friend the grandfather  who  by  the bye  said he had been a wonderful cricketer in his time  told me  that it was the clergyman himself who had established the whole thing  that it was his field they played in  and that it was he who had purchased stumps  bats  ball  and all .   it is such scenes as this  i would see near london  on a sunday evening .  it is such men as this  who would do more in one year to make people properly religious  cheerful  and contented  than all the legislation of a century could ever accomplish .   it will be said  it has been very often  that it would be matter of perfect impossibility to make amusements and exercises succeed in large towns  which may be very well adapted to a country population .  here  again  we are called upon to yield to bare assertions on matters of belief and opinion  as if they were established and undoubted facts .  that there is a wide difference between the two cases  no one will be prepared to dispute  that the difference is such as to prevent the application of the same principle to both  no reasonable man  i think  will be disposed to maintain .  the great majority of the people who make holiday on sunday now  are industrious  orderly  and well behaved persons .  it is not unreasonable to suppose that they would be no more inclined to an abuse of pleasures provided for them  than they are to an abuse of the pleasures they provide for themselves  and if any people  for want of something better to do  resort to criminal practices on the sabbath as at present observed  no better remedy for the evil can be imagined  than giving them the opportunity of doing something which will amuse them  and hurt nobody else .   the propriety of opening the british museum to respectable people on sunday  has lately been the subject of some discussion .  i think it would puzzle the most austere of the sunday legislators to assign any valid reason for opposing so sensible a proposition .  the museum contains rich specimens from all the vast museums and repositories of nature  and rare and curious fragments of the mighty works of art  in bygone ages  all calculated to awaken contemplation and inquiry  and to tend to the enlightenment and improvement of the people .  but attendants would be necessary  and a few men would be employed upon the sabbath .  they certainly would  but how many .  why  if the british museum  and the national gallery  and the gallery of practical science  and every other exhibition in london  from which knowledge is to be derived and information gained  were to be thrown open on a sunday afternoon  not fifty people would be required to preside over the whole  and it would take treble the number to enforce a sabbath bill in any three populous parishes .   i should like to see some large field  or open piece of ground  in every outskirt of london  exhibiting each sunday evening on a larger scale  the scene of the little country meadow .  i should like to see the time arrive  when a man s attendance to his religious duties might be left to that religious feeling which most men possess in a greater or less degree  but which was never forced into the breast of any man by menace or restraint .  i should like to see the time when sunday might be looked forward to  as a recognised day of relaxation and enjoyment  and when every man might feel  what few men do now  that religion is not incompatible with rational pleasure and needful recreation .   how different a picture would the streets and public places then present .  the museums  and repositories of scientific and useful inventions  would be crowded with ingenious mechanics and industrious artisans  all anxious for information  and all unable to procure it at any other time .  the spacious saloons would be swarming with practical men  humble in appearance  but destined  perhaps  to become the greatest inventors and philosophers of their age .  the labourers who now lounge away the day in idleness and intoxication  would be seen hurrying along  with cheerful faces and clean attire  not to the close and smoky atmosphere of the public  house but to the fresh and airy fields .  fancy the pleasant scene .  throngs of people  pouring out from the lanes and alleys of the metropolis  to various places of common resort at some short distance from the town  to join in the refreshing sports and exercises of the day  the children gambolling in crowds upon the grass  the mothers looking on  and enjoying themselves the little game they seem only to direct  other parties strolling along some pleasant walks  or reposing in the shade of the stately trees  others again intent upon their different amusements .  nothing should be heard on all sides  but the sharp stroke of the bat as it sent the ball skimming along the ground  the clear ring of the quoit  as it struck upon the iron peg  the noisy murmur of many voices  and the loud shout of mirth and delight  which would awaken the echoes far and wide  till the fields rung with it .  the day would pass away  in a series of enjoyments which would awaken no painful reflections when night arrived  for they would be calculated to bring with them  only health and contentment .  the young would lose that dread of religion  which the sour austerity of its professors too often inculcates in youthful bosoms  and the old would find less difficulty in persuading them to respect its observances .  the drunken and dissipated  deprived of any excuse for their misconduct  would no longer excite pity but disgust .  above all  the more ignorant and humble class of men  who now partake of many of the bitters of life  and taste but few of its sweets  would naturally feel attachment and respect for that code of morality  which  regarding the many hardships of their station  strove to alleviate its rigours  and endeavoured to soften its asperity .   this is what sunday might be made  and what it might be made without impiety or profanation .  the wise and beneficent creator who places men upon earth  requires that they shall perform the duties of that station of life to which they are called  and he can never intend that the more a man strives to discharge those duties  the more he shall be debarred from happiness and enjoyment .  let those who have six days in the week for all the world s pleasures  appropriate the seventh to fasting and gloom  either for their own sins or those of other people  if they like to bewail them  but let those who employ their six days in a worthier manner  devote their seventh to a different purpose .  let divines set the example of true morality  preach it to their flocks in the morning  and dismiss them to enjoy true rest in the afternoon  and let them select for their text  and let sunday legislators take for their motto  the words which fell from the lips of that master  whose precepts they misconstrue  and whose lessons they pervert   the sabbath was made for man  and not man to serve the sabbath .                   end of the project gutenberg ebook  sunday
