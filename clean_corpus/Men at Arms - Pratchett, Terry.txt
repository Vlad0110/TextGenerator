    begin reader   corporal carrot  ankh morpork city guard  night watch   sat down in his nightshirt  took up his pencil  sucked the end for a moment  and then wrote          dearest mume and dad   well here is another fine turnup for the books  for i have been made corporal .  .  it means another five dollars a month plus also i have a new jerkin with  two stripes upon it as well .  and a new copper badge .  it is a great responsibility .  .  this is all because we have got new recruits because the patrician who  as i have formerly vouchsafed is the ruler of the city  has agreed the watch must reflect the ethnic makeup of the city          carrot paused for a moment and stared out of the small dusty bedroom window at the early evening sunlight sidling across the river .  then he bent over the paper again .             which i do not fulley understand but must have something to do with the dwarf grabpot thundergust   s cosmetic factory .  also  captain vimes of who i have often written to you of is  leaving the watch to get married and become a fine gentleman and  i   m sure we wish him all the best  he taught me all i know apart  from the things i taught myself .  we are clubbing together to get him a surprise present  i thought one of those new watches that don   t need demons to make them go and we could inscribe on the back something like    a watch from  your old freinds in the watch     this is a pune or play on words .  we do not know who will be the new captain  sgt .  colon says he will resign if it   s him  cpl .  nobbs          carrot stared out of the window again .  his big honest forehead wrinkled with effort as he tried to think of something positive to say about corporal nobbs .             is more suited in his current roll  and i have not been in the watch long enough .  so we shall just have to wait and see          it began  as many things do  with a death .  and a burial  on a spring morning  with mist on the ground so thick that it poured into the grave and the coffin was lowered into cloud .   a small greyish mongrel  host to so many assorted doggy diseases that it was surrounded by a cloud of dust  watched impassively from the mound of earth .   various elderly female relatives cried .  but edward d   eath didn   t cry  for three reasons .  he was the eldest son  the thirty seventh lord d   eath  and it was not done for a d   eath to cry  he was   just  the diploma still had the crackle in it   an assassin  and assassins didn   t cry at a death  otherwise they   d never be stopping  and he was angry .  in fact  he was enraged .   enraged at having to borrow money for this poor funeral .  enraged at the weather  at this common cemetery  at the way the background noise of the city didn   t change in any way  even on such an occasion as this .  enraged at history .  it was never meant to be like this .   it shouldn   t have been like this .   he looked across the river to the brooding bulk of the palace  and his anger screwed itself up and became a lens .   edward had been sent to the assassins    guild because they had the best school for those whose social rank is rather higher than their intelligence .  if he   d been trained as a fool  he   d have invented satire and made dangerous jokes about the patrician .  if he   d been trained as a thief  he   d have broken into the palace and stolen something very valuable from the patrician .   however   he   d been sent to the assassins     that afternoon he sold what remained of the d   eath estates  and enrolled again at the guild school .   for the post graduate course .   he got full marks  the first person in the history of the guild ever to do so .  his seniors described him as a man to watch   and  because there was something about him that made even assassins uneasy  preferably from a long way away .      in the cemetery the solitary gravedigger filled in the hole that was the last resting place of d   eath senior .   he became aware of what seemed to be thoughts in his head .  they went something like this   any chance of a bone .  no  no  sorry  bad taste there  forget i mentioned it .  you   ve got beef sandwiches in your wossname  lunchbox thingy  though .  why not give one to the nice little doggy over there .   the man leaned on his shovel and looked around .   the grey mongrel was watching him intently .   it said     woof .         it took edward d   eath five months to find what he was looking for .  the search was hampered by the fact that he did not know what he was looking for  only that he   d know it when he found it .  edward was a great believer in destiny .  such people often are .   the guild library was one of the largest in the city .  in certain specialized areas it was the largest .  these areas mainly had to do with the regrettable brevity of human life and the means of bringing it about .   edward spent a lot of time there  often at the top of a ladder  often surrounded by dust .   he read every known work on armaments .  he didn   t know what he was looking for and he found it in a note in the margin of an otherwise very dull and inaccurate treatise on the ballistics of crossbows .  he copied it out  carefully .   edward spent a lot of time among history books as well .  the assassins    guild was an association of gentlemen of breeding  and people like that regard the whole of recorded history as a kind of stock book .  there were a great many books in the guild library  and a whole portrait gallery of kings and queens   and edward d   eath came to know their aristocratic faces better than he did his own .  he spent his lunch hours there .   it was said later that he came under bad influences at this stage .  but the secret of the history of edward d   eath was that he came under no outside influences at all  unless you count all those dead kings .  he just came under the influence of himself .   that   s where people get it wrong .  individuals aren   t naturally paid up members of the human race  except biologically .  they need to be bounced around by the brownian motion of society  which is a mechanism by which human beings constantly remind one another that they are   well   human beings .  he was also spiraling inward  as tends to happen in cases like this .   he   d had no plan .  he   d just retreated  as people do when they feel under attack  to a more defensible position  i . e .  the past  and then something happened which had the same effect on edward as finding a plesiosaur in his goldfish pond would on a student of ancient reptiles .   he   d stepped out blinking in the sunlight one hot afternoon  after a day spent in the company of departed glory  and had seen the face of the past strolling by  nodding amiably to people .   he hadn   t been able to control himself .  he   d said     hey  you .  who are y ou .      the past had said     corporal carrot  sir .  night watch .  mr .  d   eath  isn   t it .  can i help you .         what .  no .  no .  be about your b usiness .      the past nodded and smiled at him  and strolled on  into the future .      carrot stopped staring at the wall .          i have expended three dollars on an iconograph box which  is a thing with a brownei inside that paints pictures of thing   s  this is all the rage these days .  please find enclosed pictures of my room and my freinds in the watch  nobby is the one making the humerous gesture but he is a rough diamond and a good soul deep down .        he stopped again .  carrot wrote home at least once a week .  dwarfs generally did .  carrot was two meters tall but he   d been brought up as a dwarf  and then further up as a human .  literary endeavor did not come easily to him  but he persevered .      the weather     he wrote  very slowly and carefully     continues very hot           edward could not believe it .  he checked the records .  he double checked .  he asked questions and  because they were innocent enough questions  people gave him answers .  and finally he took a holiday in the ramtops  where careful questioning led him to the dwarf mines around copperhead  and thence to an otherwise unremarkable glade in a beech wood where  sure enough  a few minutes of patient digging unearthed traces of charcoal .   he spent the whole day there .  when he   d finished  carefully replacing the leafmould as the sun went down  he was quite certain .   ankh morpork had a king again .   and this was right .  and it was fate that had let edward recognize this just when he   d got his plan .  and it was right that it was fate  and the city would be saved from its ignoble present by its glorious past .  he had the means  and he had the end .  and so on   edward   s thoughts often ran like this .   he could think in italics .  such people need watching .   preferably from a safe distance .          i was interested in your letter where you said people have been coming and asking about me  this is amazing  i have been here hardly five minutes and already i am famus .      i was very pleased to hear about the opening of    shaft .  i don   t mind telling you that although  i am very happy here i miss the good times back home .  sometimes on my day off i go and  sit in the cellar and hit my head with an axe handle but  it is not the same .      hoping this finds you in good health  yrs .  faithfully      your loving son  adopted   carrot .        he folded the letter up  inserted the iconographs  sealed it with a blob of candle wax pressed into place with his thumb  and put it in his pants pocket .  dwarf mail to the ramtops was quite reliable .  more and more dwarfs were coming to work in the city  and because dwarfs are very conscientious many of them sent money home .  this made dwarf mail just about as safe as anything  since their mail was closely guarded .  dwarfs are very attached to gold .  any highwayman demanding    your money or your life    had better bring a folding chair and packed lunch and a book to read while the debate goes on .   then carrot washed his face  donned his leather shirt and trousers and chainmail  buckled on his breastplate and  with his helmet under his arm  stepped out cheerfully  ready to face whatever the future would bring .      this was another room  somewhere else .   it was a poky room  the plaster walls crumbling  the ceilings sagging like the underside of a fat man   s bed .  and it was made even more crowded by the furniture .   it was old  good furniture  but this wasn   t the place for it .  it belonged in high echoing halls .  here  it was crammed .  there were dark oak chairs .  there were long sideboards .  there was even a suit of armor .  there was barely room for the half dozen or so people who sat at the huge table .  there was barely room for the table .   a clock ticked in the shadows .   the heavy velvet curtains were drawn  even though there was still plenty of daylight left in the sky .  the air was stifling  both from the heat of the day and the candles in the magic lantern .   the only illumination was from the screen which  at that moment  was portraying a very good profile of corporal carrot ironfoundersson .   the small but very select audience watched it with the carefully blank expressions of people who are half convinced that their host is several cards short of a full deck but are putting up with it because they   ve just eaten a meal and it would be rude to leave too soon .      well .     said one of them .     i think i   ve seen him walking around the city .  so .  he   s just a watchman  edward .         of course .  it is essential that he should be .  a humble station in life .  it all fits the classic p attern .     edward d   eath gave a signal .  there was a click as another glass slide was slotted in .     this one was not p ainted from life .  king p paragore .  taken from an old p ainting .  this one      click .       is king veltrick iii .  from another p portrait .  this one is queen alguinna iv   note the line of the chin .  this one      click .       is a sevenpenny p iece from the reign of webblethorpe the unconscious  note again the detail of the chin and general b bone structure  and this      click .       is   an upside d own picture of a vase of flowers .  d elphini ums  i believe .  why is this .         er  sorry  mr .  edward  i   ad a few glass plates left and the demons weren   t tired and           next slide  please .  and then you may leave us .         yes  mr .  edward .         report to the d uty torturer .         yes  mr .  edward .      click .      and this is a rather good   well done  bl enkin   image of the bust of queen coanna .         thank you  mr .  edward .         more of her face would have enabled us to be certain of the likeness  however .  there is sufficient  i believe .  you may go  bl enkin .         yes  mr .  edward .         a little something off the ears  i th ink .         yes  mr .  edward .      the servant respectfully shut the door behind him  and then went down to the kitchen shaking his head sadly .  the d   eaths hadn   t been able to afford a family torturer for years .  for the boy   s sake he   d just have to do the best he could with a kitchen knife .   the visitors waited for the host to speak  but he didn   t seem about to do so  although it was sometimes hard to tell with edward .  when he was excited  he suffered not so much from a speech impediment as from misplaced pauses  as if his brain were temporarily putting his mouth on hold .   eventually  one of the audience said     very well .  so what is your point .         you   ve seen the likeness .  isn   t if ob vious .         oh  come now        edward d   eath pulled a leather case toward him and began undoing the thongs .      but  but the boy was adopted by discworld dwarfs .  they found him as a baby in the forests of the ramtop mountains .  there were some b urning wagons  corpses  that sort of thing .  b andit attack  apparently .  the dwarfs found a sword in the wreckage .  he has it now .  a very old sword .  and it   s always sharp .         so .  the world is full of old swords .  and grindstones .         this one had been very well hidden in one of the carts  which had broken up .  strange .  one would expect it to be ready to hand  yes .  to be used .  in b andit country .  and then the boy grows up and  and   fate   conspires that he and his sword come to ankh morpork  where he is currently a watchman in the night watch .  i couldn   t believe it .         that   s still not        edward raised his hand a moment  and then pulled out a package from the case .      i made careful enq uiries  you know  and was able to find the place where the attack occurred .  a most careful search of the ground revealed old cart n ails  a few copper coins and  in some charcoal   this .      they craned to see .      looks like a ring .         yes .  it   s  it   s  it   s superficially d iscolored  of course  otherwise someone would have spot ted it .  probably secreted somewhere on a cart .  i   ve had it p artly cleaned .  you can just read the inscription .  now  here is an illustrated inventory of the royal jewelery of ankh done in am      in the reign of king tyrril .  may i  please  may i draw your a ttention to the small wedding ring in the bottom left hand corner of the page .  you will see that the artist has hel pfully drawn the inscription .      it took several minutes for everyone to examine it .  they were naturally suspicious people .  they were all descendants of people for whom suspicion and paranoia had been prime survival traits .   because they were all aristocrats .  not one among them did not know the name of his or her great great great grandfather and what embarrassing disease he   d died of .   they had just eaten a not very good meal which had  however  included some ancient and worthwhile wines .  they   d attended because they   d all known edward   s father  and the d   eaths were a fine old family  if now in very reduced circumstances .      so you see     said edward proudly     the evidence is overwhelming .  we have a king .      his audience tried to avoid looking at each other   s faces .      i thought you   d be pl eased     said edward .   finally  lord rust voiced the unspoken consensus .  there was no room in those true blue eyes for pity  which was not a survival trait  but sometimes it was possible to risk a little kindness .      edward     he said     the last king of ankh morpork died centuries ago .         executed by t raitors .         even if a descendant could still be found  the royal blood would be somewhat watered down by now  don   t you think .         the royal b lood cannot be wa tered down .      ah  thought lord rust .  so he   s that kind .  young edward thinks the touch of a king can cure scrofula  as if royalty was the equivalent of a sulphur ointment .  young edward thinks that there is no lake of blood too big to wade through to put a rightful king on a throne  no deed too base in defense of a crown .  a romantic  in fact .   lord rust was not a romantic .  the rusts had adapted well to ankh morpork   s post monarchy centuries by buying and selling and renting and making contacts and doing what aristocrats have always done  which is trim sails and survive .      well  maybe     he conceded  in the gentle tones of someone trying to talk someone else off a ledge     but we must ask ourselves  does ankh morpork  at this point in time  require a king .      edward looked at him as though he were mad .      need .  need .  while our fair city languishes under the heel of the ty rant .         oh .  you mean vetinari .         can   t you see what he   s done to this city .         he is a very unpleasant  jumped up little man     said lady selachii     but i would not say he actually terrorizes much .  not as such .         you have to hand it to him     said viscount skater     the city operates .  more or less .  fellas and whatnot do things .         the streets are safer than they used to be under mad lord snapcase     said lady selachii .      sa fer .  vetinari set up the thieves    guild .     shouted edward .      yes  yes  of course  very reprehensible  certainly .  on the other hand  a modest annual payment and one walks in safety           he always says     said lord rust     that if you   re going to have crime  it might as well be organized crime .         seems to me     said viscount skater     that all the guild chappies put up with him because anyone else would be worse  yes .  we   ve certainly had some   difficult ones .  anyone remember homicidal lord winder .         deranged lord harmoni     said lord monflathers .      laughing lord scapula     said lady selachii .     a man with a very pointed sense of humor .         mind you  vetinari   there   s something not entirely       lord rust began .      i know what you mean     said viscount skater .     i don   t like the way he always knows what you   re thinking before you think it .         everyone knows the assassins have set his fee at a million dollars     said lady selachii .     that   s how much it would cost to have him killed .         one can   t help feeling     said lord rust     that it would cost a lot more than that to make sure he stayed dead .         ye gods .  what happened to pride .  what happened to honor .      they perceptibly jumped as the last lord d   eath thrust himself out of his chair .      will you listen to yourselves .  please .  look at you .  what man among you has not seen his family name degraded since the days of the kings .  can   t you remember the men your forefathers were .     he strode rapidly around the table  so that they had to turn to watch him .  he pointed an angry finger .      you  lord rust .  your ancestor was cr eated a baron after single handedly killing thirty seven klatchians while armed with nothing more than a p in  isn   t that so .         yes  but           you  sir   lord monflathers .  the first duke led six hundred men to a glorious and epic de feat at the battle of quirm .  does that mean n othing .  and you  lord venturii  and you  sir george   sitting in ankh in your old houses with your old names and your old money  while guilds   guilds .  ragtags of tradesmen and merchants .    guilds  i say  have a voice in the running of the city .      he reached a bookshelf in two strides and threw a huge leather bound book on to the table  where it upset lord rust   s glass .      twurp   s p eerage     he shouted .     we all have pages in there .  we own it .  but this man has you mesmerized .  i assure you he is flesh and blood  a mere mortal .  no one dares remove him because they th ink it will make things a little worse for themselves .  ye g ods .      his audience looked glum .  it was all true  of course   if you put it that way .  and it didn   t sound any better coming from a wild eyed  pompous young man .      yes  yes  the good old days .  towerin    spires and pennants and chivalry and all that     said viscount skater .     ladies in pointy hats .  chappies in armor bashin    one another and whatnot .  but  y   know  we have to move with the times           it was a golden age     said edward .   my god  thought lord rust .  he actually does believe it .      you see  dear boy     said lady selachii     a few chance likenesses and a piece of jewelery   that doesn   t really add up to much  does it .         my nurse told me     said viscount skater     that a true king could pull a sword from a stone .         hah  yes  and cure dandruff     said lord rust .     that   s just a legend .  that   s not real .  anyway  i   ve always been a bit puzzled about that story .  what   s so hard about pulling a sword out of a stone .  the real work   s already been done .  you ought to make yourself useful and find the man who put the sword in the stone in the first place  eh .      there was a sort of relieved laughter .  that   s what edward remembered .  it all ended up in laughter .  not exactly at him  but he was the type of person who always takes laughter personally .   ten minutes later  edward d   eath was alone .   they   re being so nice about it .  moving with the times .  he   d expected more than that of them .  a lot more .  he   d dared to hope that they might be inspired by his lead .  he   d pictured himself at the head of an army     blenkin came in at a respectful shuffle .      i saw    em all off  mr .  edward     he said .      thank you  blenkin .  you may clear the table .         yes  mr .  edward .         whatever happened to honor  blenkin .         dunno  sir .  i never took it .         they didn   t want to listen .         no  sir .         they didn   t want to l isten .      edward sat by the dying fire  with a dog eared copy of thighbiter   s the ankh morpork succesfion open on his lap .  dead kings and queens looked at him reproachfully .   and there it might have ended .  in fact it did end there  in millions of universes .  edward d   eath grew older and obsession turned to a sort of bookish insanity of the gloves with the fingers cut out and carpet slippers variety  and became an expert on royalty although no one ever knew this because he seldom left his rooms .  corporal carrot became sergeant carrot and  in the fullness of time  died in uniform aged seventy in an unlikely accident involving an anteater .   in a million universes  lance constables cuddy and detritus didn   t fall through the hole .  in a million universes  vimes didn   t find the pipes .   in one strange but theoretically possible universe the watch house was redecorated in pastel colors by a freak whirlwind  which also repaired the door latch and did a few other odd jobs around the place .   in a million universes  the watch failed .   in a million universes  this was a very short book .   edward dozed off with the book on his knees and had a dream .  he dreamed of glorious struggle .  glorious was another important word in his personal vocabulary  like honor .   if traitors and dishonorable men would not see the truth then he  edward d   eath  was the finger of destiny .   the problem with destiny  of course  is that she is often not careful where she puts her finger .      captain sam vimes  ankh morpork city guard  night watch   sat in the draughty anteroom to the patrician   s audience chamber with his best cloak on and his breastplate polished and his helmet on his knees .   he stared woodenly at the wall .   he ought to be happy  he told himself .  and he was .  in a way .  definitely .  happy as anything .   he was going to get married in a few days .   he was going to stop being a guard .   he was going to be a gentleman of leisure .   he took off his copper badge and buffed it absent mindedly on the edge of his cloak .  then he held it up so that the light glinted off the patina   d surface .  amcw no .      .  he sometimes wondered how many other guards had had the badge before him .   well  now someone was going to have it after him .      this is ankh morpork  citie of one thousand surprises  according to the guild of merchants    guidebook  .  what more need be said .  a sprawling place  home to a million people  greatest of cities on the discworld  located on either side of the river ankh  a waterway so muddy that it looks as if it is flowing upside down .   and visitors say  how does such a big city exist .  what keeps it going .  since it   s got a river you can chew  where does the drinking water come from .  what is  in fact  the basis of its civic economy .  how come it  against all probability  works .   actually  visitors don   t often say this .  they usually say things like    which way to the  you know  the   er   you know  the young ladies  right .      but if they started thinking with their brains for a little while  that   s what they   d be thinking .      the patrician of ankh morpork sat back on his austere chair with the sudden bright smile of a very busy person at the end of a crowded day who   s suddenly found in his schedule a reminder saying             be cheerful and relaxed and a people person .      well  of course i was very saddened to receive your letter  captain           yes  sir     said vimes  still as wooden as a furniture warehouse .      please sit down  captain .         yes  sir .     vimes remained standing .  it was a matter of pride .      but of course i quite understand .  the ramkin country estates are very extensive  i believe .  i   m sure lady ramkin will appreciate your strong right hand .         sir .     captain vimes  while in the presence of the ruler of the city  always concentrated his gaze on a point one foot above and six inches to the left of the man   s head .      and of course you will be quite a rich man  captain .         yes  sir .         i hope you have thought about that .  you will have new responsibilities .         yes  sir .      it dawned on the patrician that he was working on both ends of this conversation .  he shuffled through the papers on his desk .      and of course i shall have to promote a new chief officer for the night watch     said the patrician .     have you any suggestions  captain .      vimes appeared to descend from whatever cloud his mind had been occupying .  this was guard work .      well  not fred colon   he   s one of nature   s sergeants           sergeant colon  ankh morpork city guard  night watch  surveyed the bright faces of the new recruits .   he sighed .  he remembered his first day .  old sergeant wimbler .  what a tartar .  tongue like a whiplash .  if the old boy had lived to see this     what was it called .  oh  yeah .  affirmative action hirin    procedure  or something .  silicon anti defamation league had been going on at the patrician  and now        try it one more time  lance constable detritus     he said .     the trick is  you stops your hand just above your ear .  now  just get up off the floor and try salutin    one more time .  now  then   lance constable cuddy .         here .         where .         in front of you  sergeant .      colon looked down and took a step back .  the swelling curve of his more than adequate stomach moved aside to reveal the upturned face of lance constable cuddy  with its helpful intelligent expression and one glass eye .      oh .  right .         i   m taller than i look .      oh  gods  thought sergeant colon wearily .  add    em up and divide by two and you   ve got two normal men  except normal men don   t join the guard .  a troll and a dwarf .  and that ain   t the worst of it        vimes drummed his fingers on the desk .      not colon  then     he said .     he   s not as young as he was .  time he stayed in the watch house  keeping up on the paperwork .  besides  he   s got a lot on his plate .         sergeant colon has always had a lot on his plate  i should say     said the patrician .      with the new recruits  i mean     said vimes  meaningfully .     you remember  sir .      the ones you told me i had to have .  he added in the privacy of his head .  they weren   t to go in the day watch  of course .  and those bastards in the palace guard wouldn   t take them  either .  oh  no .  put    em in the night watch  because it   s a joke anyway and no one   ll really see    em .  no one important  anyway .   vimes had only given in because he knew it wouldn   t be his problem for long .   it wasn   t as if he was speciesist  he told himself .  but the watch was a job for men .      how about corporal nobbs .     said the patrician .      nobby .      they shared a mental picture of corporal nobbs .      no .         no .         then of course there is     the patrician smiled     corporal carrot .  a fine young man .  already making a name for himself  i gather .         that   s   true     said vimes .      a further promotion opportunity  perhaps .  i would value your advice .      vimes formed a mental picture of corporal carrot           this     said corporal carrot     is the hubwards gate .  to the whole city .  which is what we guard .         what from .     said lance constable angua  the last of the new recruits .      oh  you know .  barbarian hordes  warring tribesmen  bandit armies   that sort of thing .         what .  just us .         us .  oh  no .     carrot laughed .     that   d be silly  wouldn   t it .  no  if you see anything like that  you just ring your bell as hard as you like .         what happens then .         sergeant colon and nobby and the rest of    em will come running along just as soon as they can .      lance constable angua scanned the hazy horizon .   she smiled .   carrot blushed .   constable angua had mastered saluting first go .  she wouldn   t have a full uniform yet  not until someone had taken a  well  let   s face it  a breastplate along to old remitt the armorer and told him to beat it out really well here and here  and no helmet in the world would cover all that mass of ash blond hair but  it occurred to carrot  constable angua wouldn   t need any of that stuff really .  people would be queuing up to get arrested .      so what do we do now .     she said .      proceed back to the watch house  i suppose     said carrot .     sergeant colon   ll be reading out the evening report  i expect .      she   d mastered    proceeding     too .  it   s a special walk devised by beat officers throughout the multiverse   a gentle lifting of the instep  a careful swing of the leg  a walking pace that can be kept up hour after hour  street after street .  lance constable detritus wasn   t going to be ready to learn    proceeding    for some time  or at least until he stopped knocking himself out every time he saluted .      sergeant colon     said angua .     he was the fat one  yes .         that   s right .         why has he got a pet monkey .         ah     said carrot .     i think it is corporal nobbs to whom you refer           it   s human .  he   s got a face like a join the dots puzzle .         he does have a very good collection of boils  poor man .  he does tricks with them .  just never get between him and a mirror .      not many people were on the streets .  it was too hot  even for an ankh morpork summer .  heat radiated from every surface .  the river slunk sullenly in the bottom of its bed  like a student around    a . m .  people with no pressing business out of doors lurked in cellars and only came out at night .   carrot moved through the baking streets with a proprietorial air and a slight patina of honest sweat  occasionally exchanging a greeting .  everyone knew carrot .  he was easily recognizable .  no one else was about two meters tall with flame red hair .  besides  he walked as if he owned the city .      who was that man with the granite face i saw in the watch house .     said angua  as they proceeded along broad way .      that was detritus the troll     said carrot .     he used to be a bit of a criminal  but now he   s courting ruby she says he   s got to           no  that man     said angua  learning as had so many others that carrot tended to have a bit of trouble with metaphors .     face like thu   face like someone very disgruntled .         oh  that was captain vimes .  but he   s never been gruntled  i think .  he   s retiring at the end of the week  and getting married .         doesn   t look very happy about it     said angua .      couldn   t say .         i don   t think he likes the new recruits .      the other thing about constable carrot was that he was incapable of lying .      well  he doesn   t like trolls much     he said .     we couldn   t get a word out of him all day when he heard we had to advertise for a troll recruit .  and then we had to have a dwarf  otherwise they   d be trouble .  i   m a dwarf  too  but the dwarfs here don   t believe it .         you don   t say .     said angua  looking up at him .      my mother had me by adoption .         oh .  yes  but i   m not a troll or a dwarf     said angua sweetly .      no  but you   re a w        angua stopped .     that   s it  is it .  good grief .  this is the century of the fruitbat  you know .  ye gods  does he really think like that .         he   s a bit set in his ways .         congealed  i should think .         the patrician said we had to have a bit of representation from the minority groups     said carrot .      minority groups .         sorry .  anyway  he   s only got a few more days        there was a splintering noise across the street .  they turned as a figure sprinted out of a tavern and hared away up the street  closely followed   at least for a few steps   by a fat man in an apron .      stop .  stop .  unlicensed thief .         ah     said carrot .  he crossed the road  with angua padding along behind him  as the fat man slowed to a waddle .      morning  mr .  flannel     he said .     bit of trouble .         he took seven dollars and i never saw no thief license .     said mr .  flannel .     what you going to do about it .  i pay my taxes .         we shall be hotly in pursuit any moment     said carrot calmly  taking out his notebook .     seven dollars  was it .         at least fourteen .      mr .  flannel looked angua up and down .  men seldom missed the opportunity .      why   s she got a helmet on .     he said .      she   s a new recruit  mr .  flannel .      angua gave mr .  flannel a smile .  he stepped back .      but she   s a           got to move with the times  mr .  flannel     said carrot  putting his notebook away .   mr .  flannel drew his mind back to business .      in the meantime  there   s eighteen dollars of mine that i won   t see again     he said sharply .      oh  nil desperandum  mr .  flannel  nil desperandum     said carrot cheerfully .     come  constable angua .  let us proceed upon our inquiries .      he proceeded off  with flannel staring at them with his mouth open .      don   t forget my twenty five dollars     he shouted .      aren   t you going to chase the man .     said angua  running to keep up .      no point     said carrot  stepping sideways into an alley that was so narrow as to be barely visible .  he strolled between the damp  moss grown walls  in deep shadow .      interesting thing     he said .     i bet there   s not many people know that you can get to zephire street from broad way .  you ask anyone .  they   ll say you can   t get out of the other end of shirt alley .  but you can because  all you do  you go up mormius street  and then you can squeeze between these bollards here into borborygmic lane   good  aren   t they  very good iron   and here we are in whilom alley        he wandered to the end of the alley and stood listening for a while .      what are we waiting for .     said angua .   there was the sound of running feet .  carrot leaned against the wall  and stuck out one arm into zephire street .  there was a thud .  carrot   s arm didn   t move an inch .  it must have been like running into a girder .   they looked down at the unconscious figure .  silver dollars rolled across the cobbles .      oh dear  oh dear  oh dear     said carrot .     poor old here   n   now .  he promised me he was going to give it up  too .  oh well        he picked up a leg .      how much money .     he said .      looks like three dollars     said angua .      well done .  the exact amount .         no  the shopkeeper said           come on .  back to the watch house .  come on  here   n   now .  it   s your lucky day .         why is it his lucky day .     said angua .     he was caught  wasn   t he .         yes .  by us .  thieves    guild didn   t get him first .  they aren   t so kind as us .      here   n   now   s head bounced from cobblestone to cobblestone .      pinching three dollars and then trotting straight home     sighed carrot .     that   s here   n   now .  worst thief in the world .         but you said thieves    guild           when you   ve been here a while  you   ll understand how it all works     said carrot .  here   n   now   s head banged on the curb .     eventually     carrot added .     but it all does work .  you   d be amazed .  it all works .  i wish it didn   t .  but it does .         while here   n   now was being mildly concussed on the way to the safety of the watch   s jail  a clown was being killed .   he was ambling along an alley with the assurance of one who is fully paid up this year with the thieves    guild when a hooded figure stepped out in front of him .      beano .         oh  hello   it   s edward  right .      the figure hesitated .      i was just going back to the guild     said beano .   the hooded figure nodded .      are you ok .     said beano .      i   m sorry about th is     it said .     but it is for the good of the city .  it is nothing p ersonal .      he stepped behind the clown .  beano felt a crunch  and then his own personal internal universe switched off .   then he sat up .      ow     he said     that hur        but it didn   t .   edward d   eath was looking down at him with a horrified expression .      oh   i didn   t mean to hit you that hard .  i only wanted you out of the way .         why   d you have to hit me at all .      and then the feeling stole over beano that edward wasn   t exactly looking at him  and certainly wasn   t talking to him .   he glanced at the ground  and experienced that peculiar sensation known only to the recently dead   horror at what you see lying in front of you  followed by the nagging question  so who   s doing the looking .   knock knock .   he looked up .      who   s there .      death .      death who .      there was a chill in the air .  beano waited .  edward was frantically patting his face   well  what until recently had been his face .   i wonder   can we start again .  i don   t seem to have the hang of this .      sorry .     said beano .      i   m s orry .     moaned edward     i meant it for the best .      beano watched his murderer drag his   the   body away .      nothing personal  he says     he said .     i   m glad it wasn   t anything personal .  i should hate to think i   ve just been killed because it was personal .      it   s just that it has been suggested that i should be more of a people person .      i mean  why .  i thought we were getting on really well .  it   s very hard to make friends in my job .  in your job too  i suppose .      break it to them gently  as it were .      one minute walking along  the next minute dead .  why .      think of it more as being   dimensionally disadvantaged .   the shade of beano the clown turned to death .      what are you talking about .      you   re dead .      yes .  i know .     beano relaxed  and stopped wondering too much about events in an increasingly irrelevant world .  death found that people often did  after the initial confusion .  after all  the worst had already happened .  at least   with any luck .   if you would care to follow me        will there be custard pies .  red noses .  juggling .  are there likely to be baggy trousers .      no .   beano had spent almost all his short life as a clown .  he smiled grimly  under his make up .      i like it .         vimes    meeting with the patrician ended as all such meetings did  with the guest going away in possession of an unfocused yet nagging suspicion that he   d only just escaped with his life .   vimes trudged on to see his bride to be .  he knew where she would be found .   the sign scrawled across the big double gates in morphic street said  here be dragns .   the brass plaque beside the gates said  the ankh morpork sunshine sanctuary for sick dragons .   there was a small and hollow and pathetic dragon made out of papier m  ch   and holding a collection box  chained very heavily to the wall  and bearing the sign  don   t let my flame go out .   this was where lady sybil ramkin spent most of her days .   she was  vimes had been told  the richest woman in ankh morpork .  in fact she was richer than all the other women in ankh morpork rolled  if that were possible  into one .   it was going to be a strange wedding  people said .  vimes treated his social superiors with barely concealed distaste  because the women made his head ache and the men made his fists itch .  and sybil ramkin was the last survivor of one of the oldest families in ankh .  but they   d been thrown together like twigs in a whirlpool  and had yielded to the inevitable     when he was a little boy  sam vimes had thought that the very rich ate off gold plates and lived in marble houses .   he   d learned something new  the very very rich could afford to be poor .  sybil ramkin lived in the kind of poverty that was only available to the very rich  a poverty approached from the other side .  women who were merely well off saved up and bought dresses made of silk edged with lace and pearls  but lady ramkin was so rich she could afford to stomp around the place in rubber boots and a tweed skirt that had belonged to her mother .  she was so rich she could afford to live on biscuits and cheese sandwiches .  she was so rich she lived in three rooms in a thirty four roomed mansion  the rest of them were full of very expensive and very old furniture  covered in dust sheets .   the reason that the rich were so rich  vimes reasoned  was because they managed to spend less money .   take boots  for example .  he earned thirty eight dollars a month plus allowances .  a really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars .  but an affordable pair of boots  which were sort of ok for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out  cost about ten dollars .  those were the kind of boots vimes always bought  and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in ankh morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles .   but the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years .  a man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that   d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years    time  while a poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet .   this was the captain samuel vimes    boots    theory of socioeconomic unfairness .   the point was that sybil ramkin hardly ever had to buy anything .  the mansion was full of this big  solid furniture  bought by her ancestors .  it never wore out .  she had whole boxes full of jewelery which just seemed to have accumulated over the centuries .  vimes had seen a wine cellar that a regiment of speleologists could get so happily drunk in that they wouldn   t mind that they   d got lost without trace .   lady sybil ramkin lived quite comfortably from day to day by spending  vimes estimated  about half as much as he did .  but she spent a lot more on dragons .   the sunshine sanctuary for sick dragons was built with very  very thick walls and a very  very lightweight roof  an idiosyncrasy of architecture normally only found elsewhere in firework factories .   and this is because the natural condition of the common swamp dragon is to be chronically ill  and the natural state of an unhealthy dragon is to be laminated across the walls  floor and ceiling of whatever room it is in .  a swamp dragon is a badly run  dangerously unstable chemical factory one step from disaster .  one quite small step .   it has been speculated that its habit of exploding violently when angry  excited  frightened or merely plain bored is a developed survival trait  to discourage predators .  eat dragons  it proclaims  and you   ll have a case of indigestion to which the term    blast radius    will be appropriate .   vimes therefore pushed the door open carefully .  the smell of dragons engulfed him .  it was an unusual smell  even by ankh morpork standards   it put vimes in mind of a pond that had been used to dump alchemical waste for several years and then drained .   small dragons whistled and yammered at him from pens on either side of the path .  several excited gusts of flame sizzled the hair on his bare shins .   he found sybil ramkin with a couple of the miscellaneous young women in breeches who helped run the sanctuary  they were generally called sara or emma  and all looked exactly the same to vimes .  they were struggling with what seemed to be an irate sack .  she looked up as he approached .      ah  here   s sam     she said .     hold this  there   s a lamb .      the sack was thrust into his arms .  at the same moment a talon ripped out of the bottom of the sack and scraped down his breastplate in a spirited attempt to disembowel him .  a spiky eared head thrust its way out of the other end  two glowing red eyes focused on him briefly  a tooth serrated mouth gaped open and a gush of evil smelling vapor washed over him .   lady ramkin grabbed the lower jaw triumphantly  and thrust the other arm up to the elbow down the little dragon   s throat .      got you .     she turned to vimes  who was still rigid with shock .     little devil wouldn   t take his limestone tablet .  swallow .  swallow .  there .  who   s a good boy then .  you can let him go now .      the sack slipped from vimes    arms .      bad case of flameless gripe     said lady ramkin .     hope we   ve got it in time        the dragon ripped its way out of the sack and looked around for something to incinerate .  everyone tried to get out of the way .   then its eyes crossed  and it hiccuped .   the limestone tablet pinged off the opposite wall .      everybody down .      they leapt for such cover as was provided by a water trough and a pile of clinkers .   the dragon hiccuped again  and looked puzzled .   then it exploded .   they stuck their heads up when the smoke had cleared and looked down at the sad little crater .   lady ramkin took a handkerchief out of a pocket of her leather overall and blew her nose .      silly little bugger     she said .     oh  well .  how are you  sam .  did you go to see havelock .      vimes nodded .  never in his life  he thought  would he get used to the idea of the patrician of ankh morpork having a first name  or that anyone could ever know him well enough to call him by it .      i   ve been thinking about this dinner tomorrow night     he said desperately .     you know  i really don   t think i can           don   t be silly     said lady ramkin .     you   ll enjoy it .  it   s time you met the right people .  you know that .      he nodded mournfully .      we shall expect you up at the house at eight o   clock  then     she said .     and don   t look like that .  it   ll help you tremendously .  you   re far too good a man to spend his nights traipsing around dark wet streets .  it   s time you got on in the world .      vimes wanted to say that he liked traipsing around dark wet streets  but it would be no use .  he didn   t like it much .  it was just what he   d always done .  he thought about his badge in the same way he thought about his nose .  he didn   t love it or hate it .  it was just his badge .      so just you run along .  it   ll be terrific fun .  have you got a handkerchief .      vimes panicked .      what .         give it to me .     she held it close to his mouth .     spit       she commanded .   she dabbed at a smudge on his cheek .  one of the interchangeable emmas gave a giggle that was just audible .  lady ramkin ignored it .      there     she said .     that   s better .  now off you go and keep the streets safe for all of us .  and if you want to do something really useful  you could find chubby .         chubby .         he got out of his pen last night .         a dragon .      vimes groaned  and pulled a cheap cigar out of his pocket .  swamp dragons were becoming a minor nuisance in the city .  lady ramkin got very angry about it .  people would buy them when they were six inches long as a cute way of lighting fires and then  when they were burning the furniture and leaving corrosive holes in the carpet  the floor and the cellar ceiling underneath it  they   d be shoved out to fend for themselves .      we rescued him from a blacksmith in easy street     said lady ramkin .     i said     my good man  you can use a forge like everyone else    .  poor little thing .         chubby     said vimes .     got a light .         he   s got a blue collar     said lady ramkin .      right  yes .         he   ll follow you like a lamb if he thinks you   ve got a charcoal biscuit .         right .     vimes patted his pockets .      they   re a little bit over excited in this heat .      vimes reached down into a pen of hatchlings and picked up a small one  which flapped its stubby wings excitedly .  it spurted a brief jet of blue flame .  vimes inhaled quickly .      sam  i really wish you wouldn   t do that .         sorry .         so if you could get young carrot and that nice corporal nobbs to keep an eye out for           no problem .      for some reason lady sybil  keen of eye in every other respect  persisted in thinking of corporal nobbs as a cheeky  lovable rascal .  it had always puzzled sam vimes .  it must be the attraction of opposites .  the ramkins were more highly bred than a hilltop bakery  whereas corporal nobbs had been disqualified from the human race for shoving .   as he walked down the street in his old leather and rusty mail  with his helmet screwed on his head  and the feel of the cobbles through the worn soles of his boots telling him he was in acre alley  no one would have believed that they were looking at a man who was very soon going to marry the richest woman in ankh morpork .      chubby was not a happy dragon .   he missed the forge .  he   d quite liked it in the forge .  he got all the coal he could eat and the blacksmith hadn   t been a particularly unkind man .  chubby had not demanded much out of life  and had got it .   then this large woman had taken him away and put him in a pen .  there had been other dragons around .  chubby didn   t particularly like other dragons .  and people   d given him unfamiliar coal .   he   d been quite pleased when someone had taken him out of the pen in the middle of the night .  he   d thought he was going back to the blacksmith .   now it was dawning on him that this was not happening .  he was in a box  he was being bumped around  and now he was getting angry        sergeant colon fanned himself with his clipboard  and then glared at the assembled guards .   he coughed .      right then  people     he said .     settle down .         we are settled down  fred     said corporal nobbs .      that   s sergeant to you  nobby     said sergeant colon .      what do we have to sit down for anyway .  we didn   t used to do all this .  i feel a right berk  sitting down listenin    to you goin    on about           we got to do it proper  now there   s more of us     said sergeant colon .     right .  ahem .  right .  ok .  we welcome to the guard today lance constable detritus   don   t salute .    and lance constable cuddy  also lance constable angua .  we hope you will have a long and   what   s that you   ve got there  cuddy .         what .     said cuddy  innocently .      i can   t help noticing that you still has got there what appears to be a double headed throwing axe  lance constable  despite what i vouchsafed to you earlier re guard rules .         cultural weapon  sergeant .     said cuddy hopefully .      you can leave it in your locker .  guards carry one sword  short  and one truncheon .      with the exception of detritus  he added mentally .  firstly  because even the longest sword nestled in the troll   s huge hand like a toothpick  and secondly  because until they   d got this saluting business sorted out he wasn   t about to see a member of the watch nail his own hand to his own ear .  he   d have a truncheon  and like it .  even then  he   d probably beat himself to death .   trolls and dwarfs .  dwarfs and trolls .  he didn   t deserve it  not at his time of life .  and that wasn   t the worst of it .   he coughed again .  when he read from his clipboard  it was in the sing song voice of someone who learned his public speaking at school .      right     he said again  a little uncertainly .     so .  says here           sergeant .         now wh   oh  it   s you  corporal carrot .  yes .         aren   t you forgetting something  sergeant .     said carrot .      i dunno     said colon cautiously .     am i .         about the recruits  sarge .  something they   ve got to take .     carrot prompted .   sergeant colon rubbed his nose .  let   s see   they had  as per standing orders  taken and signed for one shirt  mail

got to take the oath  sarge .         oh .  er .  have they .         yes  sarge .  it   s the law .      sergeant colon looked embarrassed .  it probably was the law  at that .  carrot was much better at this sort of thing .  he knew the laws of ankh morpork by heart .  he was the only person who did .  all colon knew was that he   d never taken an oath when he joined  and as for nobby  the best he   d ever get to an oath was something like    bugger this for a game of soldiers .         all right  then     he said .     you   ve all  er  got to take the oath   eh   and corporal carrot will show you how .  did you take the  er  oath when you joined us  carrot .         oh  yes  sarge .  only no one asked me  so i gave it to myself  quiet like .         oh .  right .  carry on  then .      carrot stood up and removed his helmet .  he smoothed down his hair .  then he raised his right hand .      raise your right hands  too     he said .     er   that   s the one nearest lance constable angua  lance constable detritus .  and repeat after me       he closed his eyes and his lips moved for a moment  as though he was reading something off the inside of his skull .         i

trickling down his cheek .      er   right    that   s it  then  thank you     said sergeant colon  after a while .         pro tect the in no cent com ma           in your own time  lance constable detritus .      the sergeant cleared his throat and consulted the clipboard again .      now  grabber hoskins has been let out of jail again  so be on the look out  you know what he   s like when he   s had his celebratory drink  and bloody coalface the troll beat up four men last night              in the cause of said du ty com ma           where   s captain vimes .     demanded nobby .     he should be doing this .         captain vimes is   sorting things out     said sergeant colon .        s   not easy  learning civilianing .  right .     he glanced at his clipboard again  and back to the guardsmen .  men   hah .   his lips moved as he counted .  there  sitting between nobby and constable cuddy  was a very small  raggedy man  whose beard and hair were so overgrown and matted together that he looked like a ferret peering out of a bush .         me brack et af ore said de it y brack et full stop .         oh  no     he said .     what   re you doing here  here   n   now .  thank you  detritus   don   t salute   you can sit down now .         mr .  carrot brings me in     said here   n   now .      protective custody  sarge     said carrot .      again .     colon unhooked the cell keys from their nail over the desk and tossed them to the thief .     all right .  cell three .  take the keys in with you  we   ll holler if we need    em back .         you   re a toff  mr .  colon     said here   n   now  wandering down the steps to the cells .   colon shook his head .      worst thief in the world     he said .      he doesn   t look that good     said angua .      no  i mean the worst     said colon .     as in    not good at it .            remember when he was going to go all the way up to dunmanifestin to steal the secret of fire from the gods .     said nobby .      and i said    but we   ve got it  here   n   now  we   ve had it for thousands of years        said carrot .     and he said     that   s right  so it has antique value .             poor old chap     said sergeant colon .     ok .  what else have we got   yes  carrot .         now  they   ve got to take the king   s shilling     said carrot .      right .  yes .  ok .     colon fished in his pocket  and took out three sequin sized ankh morpork dollars  which had about the gold content of seawater .  he tossed them one at a time to the recruits .      this is called the king   s shilling     he said  glancing at carrot .     dunno why .  you gotta get give it when you join .  regulations  see .  shows you   ve joined .     he looked embarrassed for a moment  and then coughed .     right .  oh  yeah .  loada roc   some trolls     he corrected himself     got some kind of march down short street .  lance constable detritus   don   t let him salute .  right .  what   s this about  then .         it troll new year     said detritus .      is it .  s   pose we got to learn about this sort of thing now .  and says here there   s this gritsuc   this dwarf rally or something           battle of koom valley day     said constable cuddy .     famous victory over the trolls .     he looked smug  insofar as anything could be seen behind the beard .      yeah .  from ambush     grunted detritus  glowering at the dwarf .      what .  it was the trolls       cuddy began .      shut up     said colon .     look  it says here   says here they   re marching   says here they   re marching up short street .     he turned the paper over .     is this right .         trolls going one way  dwarfs going the other .     said carrot .      now there   s a parade you don   t want to miss     said nobby .      what   s wrong .     said angua .   carrot waved his hands vaguely in the air .     oh  dear .  it   s going to be dreadful .  we must do something .         dwarfs and trolls get along like a house on fire     said nobby .     ever been in a burning house  miss .      sergeant colon   s normally red face had gone pale pink .  he buckled on his sword belt and picked up his truncheon .      remember     he said     let   s be careful out there .         yeah     said nobby     let   s be careful to stay in here .         to understand why dwarfs and trolls don   t like each other you have to go back a long way .   they get along like chalk and cheese .  very like chalk and cheese  really .  one is organic  the other isn   t  and also smells a bit cheesy .  dwarfs make a living by smashing up rocks with valuable minerals in them and the silicon based lifeform known as trolls are  basically  rocks with valuable minerals in them .  in the wild they also spend most of the daylight hours dormant  and that   s not a situation a rock containing valuable minerals needs to be in when there are dwarfs around .  and dwarfs hate trolls because  after you   ve just found an interesting seam of valuable minerals  you don   t like rocks that suddenly stand up and tear your arm off because you   ve just stuck a pick axe in their ear .   it was a state of permanent inter species vendetta and  like all good vendettas  didn   t really need a reason any more .  it was enough that it had always existed .   dwarfs hated trolls because trolls hated dwarfs  and vice versa .   the watch lurked in three lamps alley  which was about halfway down short street .  there was a distant crackle of fireworks .  dwarfs let them off to drive away evil mine spirits .  trolls let them off because they tasted nice .      don   t see why we can   t let    em fight it out amongst themselves and then arrest the losers     said corporal nobbs .     that   s what we always used to do .         the patrician gets really shirty about ethnic trouble     said sergeant colon moodily .     he gets really sarcastic about it .      a thought struck him .  he brightened up a little bit .      got any ideas  carrot .     he said .   a second thought struck him .  carrot was a simple lad .      corporal carrot .         sarge .         sort this lot out  will you .      carrot peered around the corner at the advancing walls of trolls and dwarfs .  they   d already seen each other .      right you are  sergeant     he said .     lance constables cuddy and detritus   don   t salute .    you come with me .         you can   t let him go out there .     said angua .     it   s certain death .         got a real sense o   duty  that boy     said corporal nobbs .  he took a minute length of dog end from behind his ear and struck a match on the sole of his boot .      don   t worry  miss     said colon .     he           lance constable     said angua .      what .         lance constable     she repeated .     not miss .  carrot says i don   t have any sex while i   m on duty .      to the background of nobby   s frantic coughing  colon said  very quickly     what i mean is  lance constable  young carrot   s got krisma .  bags of krisma .         krisma .         bags of it .         the jolting had stopped .  chubby was really annoyed now .  really  really annoyed .   there was a rustling noise .  a piece of sacking moved aside and there  staring at chubby  was another male dragon .   it looked annoyed .   chubby reacted in the only way he knew how .      carrot stood in the middle of the street  arms folded  while the two new recruits stood just behind him  trying to keep an eye on both approaching marches at the same time .   colon thought carrot was simple .  carrot often struck people as simple .  and he was .   where people went wrong was thinking that simple meant the same thing as stupid .   carrot was not stupid .  he was direct  and honest  and good natured and honorable in all his dealings .  in ankh morpork this would normally have added up to    stupid    in any case and would have given him the survival quotient of a jellyfish in a blast furnace  but there were a couple of other factors .  one was a punch that even trolls had learned to respect .  the other was that carrot was genuinely  almost supernaturally  likeable .  he got on well with people  even while arresting them .  he had an exceptional memory for names .   for most of his young life he   d lived in a small dwarf colony where there were hardly any other people to know .  then  suddenly  he was in a huge city  and it was as if a talent had been waiting to unfold .  and was still unfolding .   he waved cheerfully at the approaching dwarfs .         morning mr .  cumblethigh .     morning  mr .  stronginthearm .      then he turned and waved at the leading troll .  there was a muffled    pop    as a firework went off .         morning  mr .  bauxite .      he cupped his hands .      if you could all just stop and listen to me       he bellowed .   the two marches did stop  with some hesitation and a general piling up of the people in the back .  it was that or walk over carrot .   if carrot did have a minor fault  it lay in not paying attention to small details around him when his mind was on other things .  so the whispered conversation behind his back was currently escaping him .         hah .  it was too an ambush .  and your mother was an ore           now then  gentlemen     said carrot  in a reasoned and amiable voice     i   m sure there   s no need for this belligerent manner              you ambush us too .  my great great grandfather he at koom valley  he tell me .            in our fair city on such a lovely day .  i must ask you as good citizens of ankh morpork              yeah .  you even know who your father is  do you .            that  while you must certainly celebrate your proud ethnic folkways  to profit by the example of my fellow officers here  who have sunk their ancient differences              i smash your head  you roguesome dwarfs .            for the greater benefit of              i could take you with one hand tied behind my back .            the city  whose badge they are              you get opportunity .  i tie both hands behind you back .            proud and privileged to wear .         aargh .         ooow .      it dawned on carrot that hardly anyone was paying any attention to him .  he turned .   lance constable cuddy was upside down  because lance constable detritus was trying to bounce him on the cobbles by his helmet  although lance constable cuddy was putting the position to good effect by gripping lance constable detritus around the knee and trying to sink his teeth into lance constable detritus    ankle .   the opposing marchers watched in fascination .      we should do something .     said angua  from the guards    hiding place in the alley .      weeell     said sergeant colon  slowly     it   s always very tricky  ethnic .         can put a foot wrong very easily     said nobby .     very thin skinned  your basic ethnic .         thin skinned .  they   re trying to kill one another .         it   s cultural     said sergeant colon  miserably .     no sense us tryin    to force our culture on    em  is there .  that   s speciesist .      out in the street  corporal carrot had gone very red in the face .      if he lays a finger on either of    em  with all their friends watching     said nobby     the plan is  we run away like hell        veins stood out on carrot   s mighty neck .  he stuck his hands on his waist and bellowed      lance constable detritus .  salute .      they   d spent hours trying to teach him .  detritus    brain took some time to latch on to an idea  but once it was there  it didn   t fade away fast .   he saluted .   his hand was full of dwarf .   so he saluted while holding lance constable cuddy  swinging him up and over like a small angry club .   the sound of their helmets meeting echoed off the buildings  and it was followed a moment later by the crash of them both hitting the ground .   carrot prodded them with the toe of his sandal .   then he turned and strode toward the dwarf marchers  shaking in anger .   in the alleyway  sergeant colon started to suck the rim of his helmet out of terror .      you   ve got weapons  haven   t you .     snarled carrot at a hundred dwarfs .     own up .  if the dwarfs who   ve got weapons don   t drop them right this minute the entire parade  and i mean the entire parade  will be put in the cells .  i   m serious about this .      the dwarfs in the front row took a step backward .  there was a desultory tinkle of metallic objects hitting the ground .      all of them     said carrot menacingly .     that includes you with the black beard trying to hide behind mr .  hamslinger .  i can see you  mr .  stronginthearm .  put it down .  no one   s amused .         he   s going to die  isn   t he     said angua  quietly .      funny  that     said nobby .     if we was to try it  we   d be little bits of mince .  but it seems to work for him .         krisma     said sergeant colon  who was having to lean on the wall .      do you mean charisma .     said angua .      yeah .  one of them things .  yeah .         how does he manage it .         dunno     said nobby .     s   pose he   s an easy lad to like .      carrot had turned on the trolls  who were smirking at the dwarfs    discomfiture .      and as for you     he said     i shall definitely be patrolling around quarry lane tonight  and i won   t be seeing any trouble .  will i .      there was a shuffling of huge oversized feet  and a general muttering .   carrot cupped his hand to his ear .      i couldn   t quite hear     he said .   there was a louder mutter  a sort of toccata scored for one hundred reluctant voices on the theme of    yes  corporal carrot .         right .  now off you go .  and let   s have no more of this nonsense  there   s good chaps .      carrot brushed the dust off his hands and smiled at everyone .  the trolls looked puzzled .  in theory  carrot was a thin film of grease on the street .  but somehow it just didn   t seem to be happening     angua said     he just called a hundred trolls    good chaps    .  some of them are just down off the mountains .  some of them have got lichen on them .         smartest thing on a troll     said sergeant colon .   and then the world exploded .      the watch had left before captain vimes got back to pseudopolis yard .  he plodded up the stairs to his office  and sat down in the sticky leather chair .  he gazed blankly at the wall .   he wanted to leave the guard .  of course he did .   it wasn   t what you could call a way of life .  not life .   unsocial hours .  never being certain from one day to the next what the law actually was  in this pragmatic city .  no home life  to speak of .  bad food  eaten when you could  he   d even eaten some of cut me own throat dibbler   s sausages in a bun before now .  it always seemed to be raining or baking hot .  no friends  except for the rest of the squad  because they were the only people who lived in your world .   whereas in a few days he would  as sergeant colon had said  be on the gravy boat .  nothing to do all day but eat his meals and ride around on a big horse shouting orders at people .   at times like this the image of old sergeant kepple floated across his memory .  he   d been head of the watch when vimes was a recruit .  and  soon afterwards  he retired .  they   d all clubbed together and bought him a cheap watch  one of those that   d keep going for a few years until the demon inside it evaporated .   bloody stupid idea  vimes thought moodily  staring at the wall .  bloke leaves work  hands in his badge and hourglass and bell  and what   d we get him .  a watch .   but he   d still come in to work the next day  with his new watch .  to show everyone the ropes  he said  to tidy up a few loose ends  haha .  see you youngsters don   t get into trouble  haha .  a month later he was bringing the coal in and sweeping the floor and running errands and helping people write reports .  he was still there five years later .  he was still there six years later  when one of the watch got in early and found him lying on the floor     and it emerged that no one  no one  knew where he lived  or even if there was a mrs .  kepple .  they had a whip round to bury him  vimes remembered .  there were just guards at the funeral     come to think of it  there were always just guards at a guard   s funeral .   of course it wasn   t like that now .  sergeant colon had been happily married for years  perhaps because he and his wife arranged their working lives so that they only met occasionally  normally on the doorstep .  but she left him decent meals in the oven  and there was clearly something there  they   d got grandchildren  even  so obviously there had been times when they   d been unable to avoid each other .  young carrot had to fight young women off with a stick .  and corporal nobbs   well  he probably made his own arrangements .  he was said to have the body of a twenty five year old  although no one knew where he kept it .   the point was that everyone else had someone  even if in nobby   s case it was probably against their will .   so  captain vimes  what is it really .  do you care for her .  don   t worry too much about love  that   s a dicey word for the over forties .  or are you just afraid of becoming some old man dying in the groove of his life and buried out of pity by a bunch of youngsters who never knew you as anything other than some old fart who always seemed to be around the place and got sent out to bring back the coffee and hot figgins and was laughed at behind his back .   he   d wanted to avoid that .  and now fate was handing him a fairy tale .   of course he   d known she was rich .  but he hadn   t expected the summons to mr .  morecombe   s office .   mr .  morecombe had been the ramkins    family solicitor for a long time .  centuries  in fact .  he was a vampire .   vimes disliked vampires .  dwarfs were law abiding little buggers when they were sober  and even trolls were all right if you kept them where you could see them .  but all the undead made his neck itch .  live and let live was all very well  but there was a problem right there  when you thought about it logically     mr .  morecombe was scrawny  like a tortoise  and very pale .  it had taken him ages to come to the point  and when it came the point nailed vimes to his chair .      how much .         er .  i believe i am right in saying the estate  including the farms  the areas of urban development  and the small area of unreal estate near the university  are together worth approximately   seven million dollars a year .  yes .  seven million at current valuation  i would say .         it   s all mine .         from the hour of your wedding to lady sybil .  although she instructs me in this letter that you are to have access to all her accounts as of the present moment .      the pearly dead eyes had watched vimes carefully .      lady sybil     he said     owns approximately one tenth of ankh  and extensive properties in morpork  plus of course considerable farm lands in           but   but   we   ll own them together           lady sybil is very specific .  she is deeding all the property to you as her husband .  she has a somewhat   old fashioned approach .     he pushed a folded paper across the table .  vimes took it  unfolded it  and stared .      should you predecease her  of course     mr .  morecombe droned on     it will revert to her by common right of marriage .  or to any fruit of the union  of course .      vimes hadn   t even said anything at that point .  he   d just felt his mouth drop open and small areas of his brain fuse together .      lady sybil     said the lawyer  the words coming from far away     while not as young as she was  is a fine healthy woman and there is no reason why        vimes had got through the rest of the interview on automatic .   he could hardly think about it now .  when he tried  his thoughts kept skidding away .  and  just as always happened when the world got too much for him  they skidded somewhere else .   he pulled open the bottom drawer of his desk and stared at the shiny bottle of bearhugger   s very fine whiskey .  he wasn   t sure how it had got there .  somehow he   d never got around to throwing it out .   start that again and you won   t even see retirement .  stick to cigars .   he shut the drawer and leaned back  taking a half smoked cigar from his pocket .   maybe the guards weren   t so good now anyway .  politics .  hah .  watchmen like old kepple would turn in their graves if they knew that the watch had taken on a w     and the world exploded .   the window blew in  peppering the wall behind vimes    desk with fragments and cutting one of his ears .   he threw himself to the floor and rolled under the desk .   right  that did it .  the alchemists had blown up their guild house for the last time  if vimes had anything to do with it     but when he peered over the window sill he saw  across the river  the column of dust rising over the assassins    guild        the rest of the watch came trotting along filigree street as vimes reached the guild entrance .  a couple of black clad assassins barred his way  in a polite manner which nevertheless indicated that impoliteness was a future option .  there were sounds of hurrying feet behind the gates .      you see this badge .  you see it .     vimes demanded .      nevertheless  this is guild property     said an assassin .      let us in  in the name of the law .     bellowed vimes .   the assassin smiled nervously at him .     the law is that guild law prevails inside guild walls     he said .   vimes glared at him .  but it was true .  the laws of the city  such as they were  stopped outside the guild houses .  the guilds had their own laws .  the guild owned the     he stopped .   behind him  lance constable angua reached down and picked up a fragment of glass .   then she stirred the debris with her foot .   and then her gaze met that of a small  non descript mongrel dog watching her very intently from under a cart .  in fact non descript was not what it was .  it was very easy to descript .  it looked like halitosis with a wet nose .      woof  woof     said the dog  in a bored way .     woof  woof  woof  and growl  growl .      the dog trotted into the mouth of an alleyway .  angua glanced around  and followed it .  the rest of the squad were gathered around vimes  who   d gone very quiet .      fetch me the master of assassins     he said .     now .      the young assassin tried to sneer .      hah .  your uniform doesn   t scare me     he said .   vimes looked down at his battered breastplate and worn mail .      you   re right     he said .     this is not a scary uniform .  i   m sorry .  forward  corporal carrot and lance constable detritus .      the assassin was suddenly aware of the sunlight being blocked out .      now these  i think you   ll agree     said vimes  from somewhere behind the eclipse     are scary uniforms .      the assassin nodded slowly .  he hadn   t asked for this .  usually there were never any guards outside the guild .  what would be the point .  he had  tucked away in his exquisitely tailored black clothes  at least eighteen devices for killing people  but he was becoming aware that lance constable detritus had one on the end of each of his arms .  closer  as it were  to hand .      i   ll  er  i   ll go and get the master  then  shall i .     he said .   carrot leaned down .      thank you for your co operation     he said gravely .      angua watched the dog .  the dog watched her .   she squatted on her haunches as it sat down and scratched an ear furiously .   looking around carefully to make sure that no one could see them  she barked an inquiry .      don   t bovver     said the dog .      you can talk .         huh .  that don   t take much intelligence     said the dog .     and it don   t take much intelligence to spot what you are  neither .      angua looked panicky .      where does it show .         it   s the smell  girl .  din   t you learn nuffin .  smelled you a mile orf .  i thought  oh ho  what   s one of them doing in the watch  eh .      angua waved a finger wildly .      if you tell anyone    .      the dog looked more pained than normal .      no one   d listen     it said .      why not .            cos everyone knows dogs can   t talk .  they hear me  see  but unless things are really tough they just think they   re thinking to    emselves .     the little dog sighed .     trust me .  i know what i   m talking about .  i   ve read books .  well   chewed books .      it scratched an ear again .     seems to me     it said     we could help each other           in what way .         well  you could put me in the way of a pound of steak .  that does wonders for my memory  steak .  makes it go clean away .      angua frowned .      people don   t like the word    blackmail        she said .      it ain   t the only word they don   t like     said the dog .     take my case  now .  i   ve got chronic intelligence .  is that any use to a dog .  did i ask for it .  not me .  i just finds a cushy spot to spend my nights along at the high energy magic building at the university  no one told me about all this bloody magic leaking out the whole time  next thing i know i open me eyes  head starts fizzing like a dose of salts  oh oh  thinks i  here we go again  hello abstract conceptualizing  intellectual development here we come   what bloody use is that to me .  larst time it happened  i ended up savin    the world from horrible wossnames from the dungeon dimensions  and did anyone say fanks .  wot a good dog  give him a bone .  har har .     it held up a threadbare paw .     my name   s gaspode .  something like this happens to me just about every week .  apart from that  i   m just a dog .      angua gave up .  she grasped the moth eaten limb and shook it .      my name   s angua .  you know what i am .         forgotten it already     said gaspode .      captain vimes looked at the debris scattered across the courtyard from a hole in one of the ground floor rooms .  all the surrounding windows had broken  and there was a lot of glass underfoot .  mirror glass .  of course  assassins were notoriously vain  but mirrors would be in rooms  wouldn   t they .  you wouldn   t expect a lot of glass outside .  glass got blown in  not out .   he saw lance constable cuddy bend down and pick up a couple of pulleys attached to a piece of rope  which was burned at one end .   there was a rectangle of card in the debris .   the hairs on the back of vimes    hand prickled .   he sniffed rankness in the air .   vimes would be the first to admit that he wasn   t a good copper  but he   d probably be spared the chore because lots of other people would happily admit it for him .  there was a certain core of stubborn bloody mindedness there which upset important people  and anyone who upsets important people is automatically not a good copper .  but he   d developed instincts .  you couldn   t live on the streets of a city all your life without them .  in the same way that the whole jungle subtly changes at the distant approach of the hunter  there was an alteration in the feel of the city .   there was something happening here  something wrong  and he couldn   t quite see what it was .  he started to reach down        what is the meaning of this .      vimes straightened up .  he did not turn around .      sergeant colon  i want you to go back to the watch house with nobby and detritus     he said .     corporal carrot and lance constable cuddy  you stay with me .         yes  sah .     said sergeant colon  stamping heavily and ripping off a smart salute to annoy the assassins .  vimes acknowledged it .   then he turned around .      ah  dr .  cruces     he said .   the master of assassins was white with rage  contrasting nicely with the extreme black of his clothing .      no one sent for you .     he said .     what gives you the right to be here  mister policeman .  walking around as if you own the place .      vimes paused  his heart singing .  he savored the moment .  he   d like to take this moment and press it carefully in a big book  so that when he was old he could take it out occasionally and remember it .   he reached into his breastplate and pulled out the lawyer   s letter .      well  if you would like the most fundamental reason     he said     it is because i rather think i do .      a man can be defined by the    things he hates .  there were quite a lot of things that captain vimes hated .  assassins were near the top of the list  just after kings and the undead .   he had to allow  though  that dr .  cruces recovered very quickly .  he didn   t explode when he read the letter  or argue  or claim it was a forgery .  he simply folded it up  handed it back  and said  coldly     i see .  the freehold  at least .         quite so .  could you tell me what has been happening  please .      he was aware of other senior assassins entering the courtyard through the hole in the wall .  they were very carefully looking at the debris .   dr .  cruces hesitated for a moment .      fireworks     he said .         what happened     said gaspode     was that someone put a dragon in a box right up against the wall inside the courtyard  right  and then they went and hid behind one of the statues and pulled a string and next minute   bang .         bang .            s   right .  then our friend nips into the hole for a few seconds  right  comes out again  trots around the courtyard and next minute there   s assassins everywhere and he   s among    em .  what the hell .  another man in black .  no one notices  see .         you mean he   s still in there .         how do i know .  hoods and cloaks  everyone in black           how come you were able to see this .         oh  i always nip into the assassins    guild on a wednesday night .  mixed grill night  see .     gaspode sighed at angua   s blank expression .     the cook always does a mixed grill of a wednesday night .  no one ever eats the black pudding .  so it   s round the kitchens  see  woof woof  beg beg  who   s a good boy then  look at the little bugger  he looks as though he understands every word i   m sayin     let   s see what we   ve got here for a good doggy        he looked embarrassed for a moment .      pride is all very well  but a sausage is a sausage     he said .         fireworks .     said vimes .   dr .  cruces looked like a man grasping a floating log in a choppy sea .      yes .  fireworks .  yes .  for founder   s day .  unfortunately someone threw away a lighted match which ignited the box .     dr .  cruces suddenly smiled .     my dear captain vimes     he said  clapping his hands     much as i appreciate your concern  i really           they were stored in that room over there .     said vimes .      yes  but that   s of no account        vimes crossed to the hole in the wall and peered inside .  a couple of assassins glanced at dr .  cruces and reached nonchalantly toward various areas of their clothing .  he shook his head .  his caution might have had something to do with the way carrot put his hand on the hilt of his sword  but it could also have been because assassins did have a certain code  after all .  it was dishonorable to kill someone if you weren   t being paid .      it seems to be some kind of   museum     said vimes .     guild memorabilia  that sort of thing .         yes  exactly .  odd and ends .  you know how they mount up over the years .         oh .  well  that all seems in order     said vimes .     sorry to have troubled you  doctor .  i will be going .  i hope i have not inconvenienced you in any way .         of course not .  glad to have been able to put your mind at rest .      they were ushered gently yet firmly toward the gateway .      i should clean up this glass     said captain vimes  glancing at the debris again .     someone could hurt themselves  all this glass lying around .  wouldn   t like to see one of your people get hurt .         we shall be doing it right this minute  captain     said dr .  cruces .      good .  good .  thank you very much .     captain vimes paused at the doorway  and then thumped the palm of his hand on his forehead .     sorry  excuse me   mind like a sieve these days   what was it you said was stolen .      not a muscle  not a sinew moved on dr .  cruces    face .      i didn   t say anything was stolen  captain vimes .      vimes gaped at him for a moment .      right .  sorry .  of course  you didn   t   apologies   work getting on top of me  i expect .  i   ll be going  then .      the door slammed in his face .      right     said vimes .      captain  why    .     carrot began .  vimes held up a hand .      that wraps it up  then     he said  slightly louder than necessary .     nothing to worry about .  let   s get back to the yard .  where   s lance constable whatshername .         here  captain     said angua  stepping out of the alley .      hiding  eh .  and what   s that .         woof woof whine whine .         it   s a little dog  captain .         good grief .         the clang of the big corroded inhumation bell echoed through the assassins    guild .  black clad figures came running from all directions  pushing and shoving in their haste to get to the courtyard .   the guild council assembled hurriedly outside dr .  cruces    office .  his deputy  mr .  downey  knocked tentatively at the door .      come .      the council filed in .   cruces    office was the biggest room in the building .  it always seemed wrong to visitors that the assassins    guild had such light  airy  well designed premises  more like the premises of a gentlemen   s club than a building where death was plotted on a daily basis .   cheery sporting prints lined the walls  although the quarry was not  when you looked closely  stags or foxes .  there were also group etchings   and  more recently  new fangled iconographs   of the guild  rows of smiling faces on black clad bodies and the youngest members sitting cross legged in front  one of them making a face .    down one side of the room was the big mahogany table where the elders of the guild sat in weekly session .  the other side of the room held cruces    private library  and a small workbench .  above the bench was an apothecary cabinet  made up of hundreds of little drawers .  the names on the drawer labels were in assassins    code  but visitors from outside the guild were generally sufficiently unnerved not to accept a drink .   four pillars of black granite held up the ceiling .  they had been carved with the names of noted assassins from history .  cruces had his desk foursquare between them .  he was standing behind it  his expression almost as wooden as the desk .      i want a roll call     he snapped .     has anyone left the guild .         no  sir .         how can you be so sure .         the guards on the roofs in filigree street say no one came in or went out  sir .         and who   s watching them .         they   re watching one another  sir .         very well .  listen carefully .  i want the mess cleaned up .  if anyone needs to go outside the building  i want everyone watched .  and then the guild is going to be searched from top to bottom  do you understand .         what for  doctor .     said a junior lecturer in poisons .      for   anything that is hidden .  if you find anything and you don   t know what it is  send for a council member immediately .  and don   t touch it .         but doctor  all sorts of things are hidden           this will be different  do you understand .         no  sir .         good .  and no one is to speak to the wretched watch about this .  you  boy   bring me my hat .     dr .  cruces sighed .     i suppose i shall have to go and tell the patrician .         hard luck  sir .         the captain didn   t say anything until they were crossing the brass bridge .      now then  corporal carrot     he said     you know how i   ve always told you how observation is important .         yes  captain .  i have always paid careful attention to your remarks on the subject .         so what did you observe .         someone   d smashed a mirror .  everyone knows assassins like mirrors .  but if it was a museum  why was there a mirror there .         please  sir .         who said that .         down here  sir .  lance constable cuddy .         oh  yes .  yes .         i know a bit about fireworks  sir .  there   s a smell you get after fireworks .  didn   t smell it  sir .  smelled something else .         well   smelled  cuddy .         and there were bits of burned rope and pulleys .         i smelled dragon     said vimes .      sure  captain .         trust me .     vimes grimaced .  if you spent any time in lady ramkin   s company  you soon found out what dragons smelled like .  if something put its head in your lap while you were dining  you said nothing  you just kept passing it tidbits and hoped like hell it didn   t hiccup .      there was a glass case in that room     he said .     it was smashed open .  hah .  something was stolen .  there was a bit of card in the dust  but someone must have pinched it while old cruces was talking to me .  i   d give a hundred dollars to know what it said .         why  captain .     said corporal carrot .      because that bastard cruces doesn   t want me to know .         i know what could have blown the hole open     said angua .      what .         an exploding dragon .      they walked in stunned silence .      that could do it  sir     said carrot loyally .     the little devils go bang at the drop of a helmet .         dragon     muttered vimes .     what makes you think it was a dragon  lance constable angua .      angua hesitated .     because a dog told me    was not  she judged  a career advancing thing to say at this point .      woman   s intuition .     she suggested .      i suppose     said vimes     you wouldn   t hazard an intuitive guess as to what was stolen .      angua shrugged .  carrot noticed how interestingly her chest moved .      something the assassins wanted to keep where they could look at it .     she said .      oh  yes     said vimes .     i suppose next you   ll tell me this dog saw it all .         woof .         edward d   eath drew the curtains  bolted the door and leaned on it .  it had been so easy .   he   d put the bundle on the table .  it was thin  and about four feet long .   he unwrapped it carefully  and there   it   was .   it looked pretty much like the drawing .  typical of the man   a whole page full of meticulous drawings of crossbows  and this in the margin  as though it hardly mattered .   it was so simple .  why hide it away .  probably because people were afraid .  people were always afraid of power .  it made them nervous .   edward picked it up  cradled it for a while  and found that it seemed to fit his arm and shoulder very snugly .   you   re mine .   and that  more or less  was the end of edward d   eath .  something continued for a while  but what it was  and how it thought  wasn   t entirely human .      it was nearly noon .  sergeant colon had taken the new recruits down to the archery butts in butts treat .   vimes went on patrol with carrot .   he felt something inside him bubbling over .  something was brushing the tips of his corroded but nevertheless still active instincts  trying to draw attention to itself .  he had to be on the move .  it was all that carrot could do to keep up .   there were trainee assassins in the streets around the guild  still sweeping up debris .      assassins in daylight     snarled vimes .     i   m amazed they don   t turn to dust .         that   s vampires  sir     said carrot .      hah .  you   re right .  assassins and licensed thieves and bloody vampires .  you know  this was a great old city once  lad .      unconsciously  they fell into step   proceeding .      when we had kings  sir .         kings .  kings .  hell  no .      a couple of assassins looked around in surprise .      i   ll tell you     said vimes .     a monarch   s an absolute ruler  right .  the head honcho           unless he   s a queen     said carrot .   vimes glared at him  and then nodded .      ok  or the head honchette           no  that   d only apply if she was a young woman .  queens tend to be older .  she   d have to be a   a honcharina .  no  that   s for very young princesses .  no .  um .  a honchesa  i think .      vimes paused .  there   s something in the air in this city  he thought .  if the creator had said     let there be light    in ankh morpork  he   d have got no further because of all the people saying    what color .         the supreme ruler  ok     he said  starting to stroll forward again .      ok .         but that   s not right  see .  one man with the power of life and death .         but if he   s a good man       carrot began .      what .  what .  ok .  ok .  let   s believe he   s a good man .  but his second in command   is he a good man too .  you   d better hope so .  because he   s the supreme ruler  too  in the name of the king .  and the rest of the court   they   ve got to be good men .  because if just one of them   s a bad man the result is bribery and patronage .         the patrician   s a supreme ruler     carrot pointed out .  he nodded at a passing troll .     g   day  mr .  carbuncle .         but he doesn   t wear a crown or sit on a throne and he doesn   t tell you it   s right that he should rule     said vimes .     i hate the bastard .  but he   s honest .  honest like a corkscrew .         even so  a good man as king           yes .  and then what .  royalty pollutes people   s minds  boy .  honest men start bowing and bobbing just because someone   s granddad was a bigger murdering bastard than theirs was .  listen .  we probably had good kings  once .  but kings breed other kings .  and blood tells  and you end up with a bunch of arrogant  murdering bastards .  chopping off queens    heads and fighting their cousins every five minutes .  and we had centuries of that .  and then one day a man said    no more kings .     and we rose up and we fought the bloody nobles and we dragged the king off his throne and we dragged him into sator square and we chopped his bloody head off .  job well done .         wow     said carrot .     who was he .         who .         the man who said    no more kings    .      people were staring .  vimes    face went from the red of anger to the red of embarrassment .  there was little difference in the shading  however .      oh   he was commander of the city guard in those days     he mumbled .     they called him old stoneface .         never heard of him     said carrot .      he  er  doesn   t appear much in the history books     said vimes .     sometimes there has to be a civil war  and sometimes  afterwards  it   s best to pretend something didn   t happen .  sometimes people have to do a job  and then they have to be forgotten .  he wielded the axe  you know .  no one else   d do it .  it was a king   s neck  after all .  kings are     he spat the word     special .  even after they   d seen the   private rooms  and cleaned up the   bits .  even then .  no one   d clean up the world .  but he took the axe and cursed them all and did it .         what king was it .     said carrot .      lorenzo the kind     said vimes  distantly .      i   ve seen his picture in the palace museum     said carrot .     a fat old man .  surrounded by lots of children .         oh yes     said vimes  carefully .     he was very fond of children .      carrot waved at a couple of dwarfs .      i didn   t know this     he said .     i thought there was just some wicked rebellion or something .      vimes shrugged .     it   s in the history books  if you know where to look .         and that was the end of the kings of ankh morpork .         oh  there was a surviving son  i think .  and a few mad relatives .  they were banished .  that   s supposed to be a terrible fate  for royalty .  i can   t see it myself .         i think i can .  and you like the city  sir .         well  yes .  but if it was a choice between banishment and having my head chopped off  just help me down with this suitcase .  no  we   re well rid of kings .  but  i mean   the city used to work .         still does     said carrot .   they passed the assassins    guild and drew level with the high  forbidding walls of the fools    guild  which occupied the other corner of the block .      no  it just keeps going .  i mean  look up there .      carrot obediently raised his gaze .   there was a familiar building on the junction of broad way and alchemists .  the facade was ornate  but covered in grime .  gargoyles had colonized it .   the corroded motto over the portico said    neither rain nor snow nor glom of nit can stay these messengers about their duty    and in more spacious days that may have been the case  but recently someone had found it necessary to nail up an addendum which read       dont ask us about   rocks  troll   s with sticks  all sorts of dragons  mrs .  cake  huje green things with teeth  any kinds of black dogs with orange eyebrows  rains of spaniel   s .   fog .   mrs .  cake       oh     he said .     the royal mail .         the post office     corrected vimes .     my granddad said that once you could post a letter there and it   d be delivered within a month  without fail .  you didn   t have to give it to a passing dwarf and hope the little bugger wouldn   t eat it before        his voice trailed off .      uh .  sorry .  no offense meant .         none taken     said carrot cheerfully .      it   s not that i   ve got anything against dwarfs .  i   ve always said you   d have to look very hard before you   d find a  a better bunch of highly skilled  law abiding  hard working              little buggers .         yes .  no .      they proceeded .      that mrs .  cake     said carrot     definitely a strong minded woman  eh .         too true     said vimes .   something crunched under carrot   s enormous sandal .      more glass     he said .     it went a long way  didn   t it .         exploding dragons .  what an imagination the girl has .         woof woof     said a voice behind them .      that damn dog   s been following us     said vimes .      it   s barking at something on the wall     said carrot .   gaspode eyed them coldly .      woof woof  bloody whine whine     he said .     are you bloody blind or what .      it was true that normal people couldn   t hear gaspode speak  because dogs don   t speak .  it   s a well known fact .  it   s well known at the organic level  like a lot of other well known facts which overrule the observations of the senses .  this is because if people went around noticing everything that was going on all the time  no one would ever get anything done .   besides  almost all dogs don   t talk .  ones that do are merely a statistical error  and can therefore be ignored .   however  gaspode had found he did tend to get heard on a subconscious level .  only the previous day someone had absent mindedly kicked him into the gutter and had gone a few steps before they suddenly thought  i   m a bastard  what am i .      there is something up there     said carrot .     look   something blue  hanging off that gargoyle .         woof woof  woof .  would you credit it .      vimes stood on carrot   s shoulders and walked his hand up the wall  but the little blue strip was still out of reach .   the gargoyle rolled a stony eye toward him .      do you mind .     said vimes .     it   s hanging on your ear        with a grinding of stone on stone  the gargoyle reached up a hand and unhooked the intrusive material .      thank you .            on   t ent on it .      vimes climbed down again .      you like gargoyles  don   t you  captain     said carrot  as they strolled away .      yep .  they may only be a kind of troll but they keep themselves to themselves and seldom go below the first floor and don   t commit crimes anyone ever finds out about .  my type of people .      he unfolded the strip .   it was a collar or  at least  what remained of a collar   it was burnt at both ends .  the word    chubby    was just readable through the soot .      the devils .     said vimes .     they did blow up a dragon .         the most dangerous man in the world should be introduced .   he has never  in his entire life  harmed a living creature .  he has dissected a few  but only after they were dead   and had marvelled at how well they   d been put together considering it had been done by unskilled labor .  for several years he hadn   t moved outside a large  airy room  but this was ok  because he spent most of his time inside his own head in any case .  there   s a certain type of person it   s very hard to imprison .   he had  however  surmised that an hour   s exercise every day was essential for a healthy appetite and proper bowel movements  and was currently sitting on a machine of his own invention .   it consisted of a saddle above a pair of treadles which turned  by means of a chain  a large wooden wheel currently held off the ground on a metal stand .  another  freewheeling  wooden wheel was positioned in front of the saddle and could be turned by means of a tiller arrangement .  he   d fitted the extra wheel and tiller so that he could wheel the entire thing over to the wall when he   d finished taking his exercise and  besides  it gave the whole thing a pleasing symmetry .   he called it    the turning the wheel with pedals and another wheel machine .         lord vetinari was also at work .   normally  he was in the oblong office or seated in his plain wooden chair at the foot of the steps in the palace of ankh morpork  there was an ornate throne at the top of the steps  covered with dust .  it was the throne of ankh morpork and was  indeed  made of gold .  he   d never dreamed of sitting on it .   but it was a nice day  so he was working in the garden .   visitors to ankh morpork were often surprised to find that there were some interesting gardens attached to the patrician   s palace .   the patrician was not a gardens kind of person .  but some of his predecessors had been  and lord vetinari never changed or destroyed anything if there was no logical reason to do so .  he maintained the little zoo  and the racehorse stable  and even recognized that the gardens themselves were of extreme historic interest because this was so obviously the case .   they had been laid out by bloody stupid johnson .   many great landscape gardeners have gone down in history and been remembered in a very solid way by the magnificent parks and gardens that they designed with almost god like power and foresight  thinking nothing of making lakes and shifting hills and planting woodlands to enable future generations to appreciate the sublime beauty of wild nature transformed by man .  there have been capability brown  sagacity smith  intuition de vere slade gore     in ankh morpork  there was bloody stupid johnson .   bloody stupid    it might look a bit messy now but just you come back in five hundred years    time    johnson .  bloody stupid    look  the plans were the right way round when i drew them    johnson .  bloody stupid johnson  who had       tons of earth built into an artificial hillock in front of quirm manor because    it   d drive me mad to have to look at a bunch of trees and mountains all day long  how about you .      the ankh morpork palace grounds were considered the high spot  if such it could be called  of his career .  for example  they contained the ornamental trout lake  one hundred and fifty yards long and  because of one of those trifling errors of notation that were such a distinctive feature of bloody stupid   s designs  one inch wide .  it was the home of one trout  which was quite comfortable provided it didn   t try to turn around  and had once featured an ornate fountain which  when first switched on  did nothing but groan ominously for five minutes and then fire a small stone cherub a thousand feet into the air .   it contained the hoho  which was like a haha only deeper .  a haha is a concealed ditch and wall designed to allow landowners to look out across rolling vistas without getting cattle and inconvenient poor people wandering across the lawns .  under bloody stupid   s errant pencil it was dug fifty feet deep and had claimed three gardeners already .   the maze was so small that people got lost looking for it .   but the patrician rather liked the gardens  in a quiet kind of way .  he had certain views about the mentality of most of mankind  and the gardens made him feel fully justified .   piles of paper were stacked on the lawn around the chair .  clerks renewed them or took them away periodically .  they were different clerks .  all sorts and types of information flowed into the palace  but there was only one place where it all came together  very much like strands of gossamer coming together in the center of a web .   a great many rulers  good and bad and quite often dead  know what happened  a rare few actually manage  by dint of much effort  to know what   s happening .  lord vetinari considered both types to lack ambition .      yes  dr .  cruces     he said  without looking up .   how the hell does he do it .  cruces wondered .  i know i didn   t make any noise        ah  havelock       he began .      you have something to tell me  doctor .         it   s been   mislaid .         yes .  and no doubt you are anxiously seeking it .  very well .  good day .      the patrician hadn   t moved his head the whole time .  he hadn   t even bothered to ask what it was .  he bloody well knows  thought cruces .  how is it you can never tell him anything he doesn   t know .   lord vetinari put down a piece of paper on one of the piles  and picked up another .      you are still here  dr .  cruces .         i can assure you  m   lord  that           i   m sure you can .  i   m sure you can .  there is one question that intrigues me  however .         m   lord .         why was it in your guild house to be stolen .  i had been given to understand it had been destroyed .  i   m quite sure i gave orders .      this was the question the assassin had been hoping would not be asked .  but the patrician was good at that game .      er .  we   that is  my predecessor   thought it should serve as a warning and an example .      the patrician looked up and smiled brightly .      capital .     he said .     i have always had a great belief in the effectiveness of examples .  so i am sure you   ll be able to sort this out with minimum inconvenience all round .         certainly  m   lord     said the assassin  glumly .     but        noon began .   noon in ankh morpork took some time  since twelve o   clock was established by consensus .  generally  the first bell to start was that one in the teachers    guild  in response to the universal prayers of its members .  then the water clock on the temple of small gods would trigger the big bronze gong .  the black bell in the temple of fate struck once  unexpectedly  but by then the silver pedal driven carillon in the fools    guild would be tinkling  the gongs  bells and chimes of all the guilds and temples would be in full swing  and it was impossible to tell them apart  except for the tongueless and magical octiron bell of old tom in the unseen university clock tower  whose twelve measured silences temporarily overruled the din .   and finally  several strokes behind all the others  was the bell of the assassin   s guild  which was always last .   beside the patrician  the ornamental sundial chimed twice and fell over .      you were saying .     said the patrician mildly .      captain vimes     said dr .  cruces .     he   s taking an interest .         dear me .  but it is his job .         really .  i must demand that you call him off .      the words echoed around the  garden .  several pigeons flew away .      demand .     said the patrician  sweetly .   dr .  cruces backed and filled desperately .     he is a servant after all     he said .     i see no reason why he should be allowed to involve himself in affairs that don   t concern him .         i rather believe he thinks he   s a servant of the law     said the patrician .      he   s a jack in office and an insolent upstart .         dear me .  i did not appreciate your strength of feeling .  but since you demand it  i will bring him to heel without delay .         thank you .         don   t mention it .  do not let me keep you .      dr .  cruces wandered off in the direction of the patrician   s idle gesture .   lord vetinari bent over his paperwork again  and did not even look up when there was a distant  muffled cry .  instead  he reached down and rang a small silver bell .   a clerk hurried up .      go and fetch the ladder  will you  drumknott .     he said .     dr .  cruces seems to have fallen in the hoho .         the back door to the dwarf bjorn hammerhock   s workshop lifted off the latch and creaked open .  he went to see if there was anyone there  and shivered .   he shut the door .      bit of a chilly breeze     he said  to the room   s other occupant .     still  we could do with it .      the ceiling of the workshop was only about five feet above the floor .  that was more than tall enough for a dwarf .   ow  said a voice that no one heard .   hammerhock looked at the thing clamped in the vice  and picked up a screwdriver .   ow .      amazing     he said .     i think that moving this tube down the barrel forces the  er  six chambers to slide along  presenting a new one to the  er  firing hole .  that seems clear enough .  the triggering mechanism is really just a tinderbox device .  the spring   here   has rusted through .  i can easily replace that .  you know     he said  looking up     this is a very interesting device .  with the chemicals in the tubes and all .  such a simple idea .  is it a clown thing .  some kind of automatic slap stick .      he sorted through a bin of metal offcuts to find a piece of steel  and then selected a file .      i   d like to make a few sketches afterwards     he said .   about thirty seconds later there was a pop and a cloud of smoke .   bjorn hammerhock picked himself up  shaking his head .      that was lucky .     he said .     could have been a nasty accident there .      he tried to fan some of the smoke away  and then reached for the file again .   his hand went through it .   ahem .   bjorn tried again .   the file was as insubstantial as the smoke .      what .      ahem .   the owner of the strange device was staring in horror at something on the floor .  bjorn followed his gaze .      oh     he said .  realization  which had been hovering on the edge of bjorn   s consciousness  finally dawned .  that was the thing about death .  when it happened to you  you were among the first to know .   his visitor grabbed the device from the bench and rammed it into a cloth bag .  then he looked around wildly  picked up the corpse of mr .  hammerhock  and dragged it through the door toward the river .   there was a distant splash  or as close to a splash as you could get from the ankh .      oh dear     said bjorn .     and i can   t swim  either .      that will not  of course  be a problem  said death .   bjorn looked at him .      you   re a lot shorter than i thought you   d be     he said .   this is because i   m kneeling down  mr .  hammerhock .      that damn thing killed me .      yes .      that   s the first time anything like that has ever happened to me .      to anyone .  but not  i suspect  the last time .   death stood up .  there was a clicking of knee joints .  he no longer cracked his skull on the ceiling .  there wasn   t a ceiling any more .  the room had gently faded away .   there were such things as dwarf gods .  dwarfs were not a naturally religious species  but in a world where pit props could crack without warning and pockets of fire damp could suddenly explode they   d seen the need for gods as the sort of supernatural equivalent of a hard hat .  besides  when you hit your thumb with an eight pound hammer it   s nice to be able to blaspheme .  it takes a very special and strong minded kind of atheist to jump up and down with their hand clasped under their other armpit and shout     oh  random fluctuations in the space time contiuum .     or    aaargh  primitive and outmoded concept on a crutch .      bjorn didn   t waste time asking questions .  a lot of things become a shade urgent when you   re dead .      i believe in reincarnation     he said .   i know .      i tried to live a good life .  does that help .      that is not up to me .  death coughed .  of course    since you believe in reincarnation   you   ll be bjorn again .   he waited .      yes .  that   s right     said bjorn .  dwarfs are known for their sense of humor  in a way .  people point them out and say     those little devils haven   t got a sense of humor .      um .  was there anything amusing in the statement i just made .      uh .  no .  no   i don   t think so .      it was a pun  or play on words .  bjorn again .      yes .      did you notice it .      i can   t say i did .      oh .      sorry .      i   ve been told i should try to make the occasion a little more enjoyable .      bjorn again .      yes .      i   ll think about it .      thank you .         hright     said sergeant colon     this  men  is your truncheon  also nomenclatured your night stick or baton of office .     he paused while he tried to remember his army days  and brightened up .      hand you will look after hit     he shouted .     you will eat with hit  you will sleep with hit  you              scuse me .         who said that .         down here .  it   s me  lance constable cuddy .         yes  pilgrim .         how do we eat with it  sergeant .      sergeant colon   s wound up machismo wound down .  he was suspicious of lance constable cuddy .  he strongly suspected lance constable cuddy was a trouble maker .      what .         well  do we use it as a knife or a fork or cut in half for chopsticks or what .         what are you talking about .         excuse me  sergeant .         what is it  lance constable angua .         how exactly do we sleep with it  sir .         well  i   i meant   corporal nobbs  stop that sniggering right now .     colon adjusted his breastplate and decided to strike out in a new direction .      now  hwat we have    ere is a puppet  mommet or heffigy      indicating a vaguely humanoid shape made of leather and stuffed with straw  mounted on a stake      called by the hnickname of harthur  weapons training  for the use hof .  forward  lance constable angua .  tell me  lance constable  do you think you could kill a man .         how long will i have .      there was a pause while they picked up corporal nobbs and patted him on the back until he settled down .      very well     said sergeant colon     what you must do now is take your truncheon like so  and on the command one  proceed smartly to harthur and on the command two  tap him smartly upon the bonce .  hwun   two        the truncheon bounced off arthur   s helmet .      very good  only one thing wrong .  anyone tell me what it was .      they shook their heads .      from behind     said sergeant colon .     you hit    em from behind .  no sense in risking trouble  is there .  now you have a go  lance constable cuddy .         but sarge           do it .      they watched .      perhaps we could fetch him a chair .     said angua  after an embarrassing fifteen seconds .   detritus sniggered .      him too little to be a guard     he said .   lance constable cuddy stopped jumping up and down .      sorry  sergeant     he said     this isn   t how dwarfs do it  see .         it   s how guards do it     said sergeant colon .     all right  lance constable detritus   don   t salute   you give it a try .      detritus held the truncheon between what must technically be called thumb and forefinger  and smashed it over arthur   s helmet .  he stared reflectively at the truncheon   s stump .  then he bunched up his  for want of a better word  fist  and hammered arthur over what was briefly its head until the stake was driven three feet into the ground .      now the dwarf  he can have a go     he said .   there was another embarrassed five seconds .  sergeant colon cleared his throat .      well  yes  i think we can consider him thoroughly apprehended     he said .     make a note  corporal nobbs .  lance constable detritus   don   t salute .    deducted one dollar for loss of truncheon .  and you   re supposed to be able to ask    em questions afterwards .      he looked at the remains of arthur .      i think around about now is a good time to demonstrate the fine points of harchery     he said .      lady sybil ramkin looked at the sad strip of leather that was all that remained of the late chubby .      who   d do something like this to a poor little dragon .     she said .      we   re trying to find out     said vimes .     we   we think maybe he was tied up next to a wall and exploded .      carrot leaned over the wall of a pen .      coochee coochee coo .     he said .  a friendly flame took his eyebrows off .      i mean  he was as tame as anything     said lady ramkin .     wouldn   t hurt a fly  poor little thing .         how could someone make a dragon blow up .     said vimes .     could you do it by giving it a kick .             oh  yes     said sybil .     you   d lose your leg  mind you .         then it wasn   t that .  any other way .  so you wouldn   t get hurt .           not really .  it   d be easier to make it blow itself up .  really  sam  i don   t like talking about           i have to know .         well   at this time of year the males fight .  make themselves look big  you know .  that   s why i always keep them apart .      vimes shook his head .     there was only one dragon     he said .   behind them  carrot leaned over the next pen  where a pear shaped male dragon opened one eye and glared at him .      whosagoodboyden .     murmured carrot .     i   m sure i   ve got a bit of coal somewhere        the dragon opened the other eye  blinked  and then was fully awake and rearing up .  its ears flattened .  its nostrils flared .  its wings unfurled .  it breathed in .  from its stomach came the gurgle of rushing acids as sluices and valves were opened .  its feet left the floor .  its chest expanded     vimes hit carrot at waist height  bearing him to the ground .   in its pen the dragon blinked .  the enemy had mysteriously gone .  scared off .   it subsided  blowing off a huge flame .   vimes unclasped his hands from his head and rolled over .      what   d do you do that for  captain .     said carrot .     i wasn   t           it was attacking a dragon .     shouted vimes .     one that wouldn   t back down .      he pulled himself to his knees and tapped carrot   s breastplate .      you polish that up real bright .     he said .     you can see yourself in it .  so can anything else .         oh  yes  of course there   s that     said lady sybil .     everyone knows you should keep dragons away from mirrors           mirrors     said carrot .     hey  there were bits of           yes .  he showed chubby a mirror     said vimes .      the poor little thing must have been trying to make himself bigger than himself     said carrot .      we   re dealing here     said vimes     with a twisted mind .         oh  no .  you think so .         yes .         but   no   you can   t be right .  because nobby was with us all the time .         not nobby     said vimes testily .     whatever he might do to a dragon  i doubt if he   d make it explode .  there   s stranger people in this world than corporal nobbs  my lad .      carrot   s expression slid into a rictus of intrigued horror .      gosh     he said .      sergeant colon surveyed the butts .  then he removed his helmet and wiped his forehead .      i think perhaps lance constable angua shouldn   t have another go with the longbow until we   ve worked out how to stop her   her getting in the way .         sorry  sergeant .      they turned to detritus  who was standing sheepishly behind a heap of broken longbows .  crossbows were out of the question .  they sat in his massive hands like a hairpin .  in theory the longbow would be a deadly weapon in his hands  just as soon as he mastered the art of when to let go .   detritus shrugged .      sorry  mister     he said .     bows aren   t troll weapon .           ha .     said colon .     as for you  lance constable cuddy           just can   t get the hang of aiming  sergeant .         i thought dwarfs were famous for their skills in battle .         yeah  but   not these skills     said cuddy .      ambush     murmured detritus .   since he was a troll  the murmur bounced off distant buildings .  cuddy   s beard bristled .      you devious troll  i get my           well now     said sergeant colon quickly     i think we   ll stop training .  you   ll have to   sort of pick it up as you go along  all right .      he sighed .  he was not a cruel man  but he   d been either a soldier or a guard all his life  and he was feeling put upon .  otherwise he wouldn   t have said what he said next .      i don   t know  i really don   t .  fighting among yourselves  smashing your own weapons   i mean  who do we think we   re fooling .  now  it   s nearly noon  you take a few hours off  we   ll see you again tonight .  if you think it   s worth turning up .      there was a spang .  noise .  cuddy   s crossbow had gone off in his hand .  the bolt whiffled past corporal nobbs    ear and landed in the river  where it stuck .      sorry     said cuddy .      tsk  tsk     said sergeant colon .   that was the worst part .  it would have been better all round if he   d called the dwarf some names .  it would have been better if he   d made it seem that cuddy was worth an insult .   he turned around and walked off towards pseudopolis yard .   they heard his muttered comment .      what him say .     said detritus .           a fine body of men        said angua  going red .   cuddy spat on the ground  which didn   t take long on account of its closeness .  then he reached under his cloak and produced  like a conjuror extracting a size    rabbit from a size   hat  his double headed battle axe .  and started to run .   by the time he reached the virginal target he was a blur .  there was a rip and the dummy exploded like a nuclear haystack .   the other two wandered up and inspected the result  as pieces of chaff gently drifted to the ground .      yes  all right     said angua .     but he did say you   re supposed to be able to ask them questions afterwards .         he didn   t say they   ve got to be able to answer them     said cuddy grimly .      lance constable cuddy  deduct one dollar for target     said detritus  who already owed eleven dollars for bows .         if it   s worth turning up    .     said cuddy  losing the axe somewhere about his person again .     speciesist .         i don   t think he meant it that way     said angua .      ho  it   s all right for you     said cuddy .      why .            cos you a man     said detritus .   angua was bright enough to pause for a moment to think this over .      a woman     she said .      same thing .         only in broad terms .  come on  let   s go and have a drink        the transient moment of camaraderie in adversity completely evaporated .      drink with a troll .         drink with a dwarf .           all right     said angua .     how about you and you coming and having a drink with me .      angua removed her helmet and shook out her hair .  female trolls don   t have hair  although the more fortunate ones are able to cultivate a fine growth of lichen  and a female dwarf is more likely to be complimented on the silkiness of her beard than on her scalp .  but it was just possible the sight of angua scraped little sparks off some shared  ancient  cosmic maleness .      i haven   t really had a chance to look around     she said .     but i saw a place in gleam street .      which meant that they had to cross the river  at least two of them trying to indicate to passers by that they weren   t with at least one of the other two .  which meant that  with desperate nonchalance  they were looking around .   which meant that cuddy saw the dwarf in the water .   if you could call it water .   if you could still call it a dwarf .   they looked down .      you know     said detritus  after a while     that look like that dwarf who make weapons in rime street .         bjorn hammerhock .     said cuddy .      that the one  yeah .         it looks a bit like him     cuddy conceded  still talking in a cold flat voice     but not exactly like him .         what d   you mean .     said angua .      because mr .  hammerhock     said cuddy     didn   t have such a great big hole where his chest should be .         doesn   t he ever sleep .  thought vimes .  doesn   t the bloody man ever get his head down .  isn   t there a room somewhere with a black dressing gown hanging on the door .   he knocked on the door of the oblong office .      ah  captain     said the patrician  looking up from his paperwork .     you were commendably quick .         was i .         you got my message .     said lord vetinari .      no  sir .  i   ve been   occupied .         indeed .  and what could occupy you .         someone has killed mr .  hammerhock  sir .  a big man in the dwarf community .  he   s been   shot with something  some kind of siege weapon or something  and dumped in the river .  we   ve just fished him out .  i was on the way to tell his wife .  i think he lives in treacle street .  and then i thought  since i was passing           this is very unfortunate .         certainly it was for mr .  hammerhock     said vimes .   the patrician leaned back and stared at vimes .      tell me     he said     how was he killed .         i don   t know .  i   ve never seen anything like it   there was just a great big hole .  but i   m going to find out what it was .         hmm .  did i mention that dr .  cruces came to see me this morning .         no  sir .         he was very   concerned .         yes  sir .         i think you upset him .         sir .      the patrician seemed to be reaching a decision .  his chair thumped forward .      captain vimes           sir .         i know that you are retiring the day after tomorrow and feel  therefore  a little   restless .  but while you are captain of the night watch i am asking you to follow two very specific instructions           sir .         you will cease any investigations connected with this theft from the assassins    guild .  do you understand .  it is entirely guild business .         sir     vimes kept his face carefully immobile .      i   m choosing to believe that the unspoken word in that sentence was a yes  captain .         sir .         and that one  too .  as for the matter of the unfortunate mr .  hammerhock   the body was discovered just a short while ago .         yes  sir .         then it   s out of your jurisdiction  captain .         what .  sir .         the day watch can deal with it .         but we   ve never bothered with that hours of day light jurisdiction stuff .         nevertheless  in the current circumstances i shall instruct captain quirke to take over the investigation  if it turns out that one is necessary .      if one is necessary .  if people don   t end up with half their chest gone by accident .  meteorite strike  perhaps  thought vimes .   he took a deep breath and leaned on the patrician   s desk .      mayonnaise quirke couldn   t find his arse with an atlas .  and he   s got no idea about how to talk to dwarfs .  he calls them gritsuckers .  my men found the body .  it   s my jurisdiction .      the patrician glanced at vimes    hands .  vimes removed them from the desk as if it had suddenly grown red hot .        night watch .  that   s what you are  captain .  your writ runs in the hours of darkness .         it   s dwarfs we   re talking about .  if we don   t get it right  they   ll take the law into their own hands .  that usually means chopping the head off the nearest troll .  and you   ll put quirke on this .         i   ve given you an order  captain .         but           you may go .         you can   t           i said you may go  captain vimes .         sir .      vimes saluted .  then he turned about  and marched out of the room .  he closed the door carefully  so that there was barely a click .   the patrician heard him thump the wall outside .  vimes wasn   t aware  but there were a number of barely perceptible dents in the wall outside the oblong office  their depths corresponding to his emotional state at the time .   by the sound of it  this one would need the services of a plasterer .   lord vetinari permitted himself a smile  although there was no humor in it .   the city operated .  it was a self regulating college of guilds linked by the inexorable laws of mutual self interest  and it worked .  on average .  by and large .  overall .  normally .   the last thing you needed was some watchman blundering around upsetting things  like a loose   a loose   a loose siege catapult .   normally .   vimes seemed in a suitable emotional state .  with any luck  the orders would have the desired effect         there   s a bar like it in every big city .  it   s where the coppers drink .   the guard seldom drank in ankh morpork   s more cheerful taverns when they were off duty .  it was too easy to see something that would put them back on duty again .   so they generally went to the bucket  in gleam street .  it was small and low ceilinged  and the presence of city guards tended to discourage other drinkers .  but mr .  cheese  the owner  wasn   t too worried about this .  no one drinks like a copper who has seen too much to stay sober .   carrot counted out his change on the counter .      that   s three beers  one milk  one molten sulphur on coke with phosphoric acid           with umbrella in it     said detritus .         and a slow comfortable double entendre with lemonade .         with a fruit salad in it     said nobby .      woof .         and some beer in a bowl     said angua .      that little dog seems to have taken quite a shine to you     said carrot .      yes     said angua .     i can   t think why .      the drinks were put in front of them .  they stared at the drinks .  they drank the drinks .   mr .  cheese  who knew coppers  wordlessly refilled the glasses and detritus    insulated mug .   they stared at the drinks .  they drank the drinks .        you know     said colon  after a while     what gets me  what really gets me  is they just dumped him in the water .  i mean  not even weights .  just dumped him .  like it didn   t matter if he was found .  you know what i mean .         what gets me     said cuddy     is that he was a dwarf .         what gets me is that he was murdered     said carrot .   mr .  cheese passed along the line again .  they stared at the drinks .  they drank the drinks .   because the fact was that  despite all evidence to the contrary  murder was not a commonplace occurrence in ankh morpork .  there were  it was true  assassinations .  and as aforesaid there were many ways one could inadvertently commit suicide .  and there were occasional domestic fracas on a saturday night as people sought a cheaper alternative to divorce .  there were all these things  but at least they had a reason  however unreasonable .      big man in the dwarfs  was mr .  hammerhock     said carrot .     a good citizen  too .  wasn   t always stirring up old trouble like mr .  stronginthearm .         he   s got a workshop in rime street     said nobby .      had     said sergeant colon .   they stared at the drinks .  they drank the drinks .      what i want to know is     said angua     what put that hole in him .         never see anything like that     said colon .      hadn   t someone better go and tell mrs .  hammerhock .     said angua .      captain vimes is doing it     said carrot .     he said he wouldn   t ask anyone else to do it .         rather him than me     said colon fervently .     i wouldn   t do that for a big clock .  they can be fearsome when they   re angry  those little buggers .        everyone nodded gloomily  including the little bugger and the bigger little bugger by adoption .   they stared at the drinks .  they drank the drinks .      shouldn   t we be finding out who did it .     said angua .      why .     said nobby .   she opened and shut her mouth once or twice  and finally came out with     in case they do it again .         it wasn   t an assassination  was it .     said cuddy .      no     said carrot .     they always leave a note .  by law .      they looked at the drinks .  they drank the drinks .      what a city     said angua .      it all works  that   s the funny thing     said carrot .     d   you know  when i first joined the watch i was so simple i arrested the head of the thieves    guild for thieving .         sounds good to me     said angua .      got into a bit of trouble for that     said carrot .      you see     said colon     thieves are organized here .  i mean  it   s official .  they   re allowed a certain amount of thieving .  not that they do much these days  mind you .  if you pay them a little premium every year they give you a card and leave you alone .  saves time and effort all around .         and all thieves are members .     said angua .      oh  yes     said carrot .     can   t go thieving in ankh morpork without a guild permit .  not unless you   ve got a special talent .         why .  what happens .  what talent .     she said .      well  like being able to survive being hung upside down from one of the gates with your ears nailed to your knees     said carrot .   then angua said     that   s terrible .         yes  i know .  but the thing is     said carrot     the thing is  it works .  the whole thing .  guilds and organized crimes and everything .  it all seems to work .         didn   t work for mr .  hammerhock     said sergeant colon .   they looked at their drinks .  very slowly  like a mighty sequoia beginning the first step towards resurrection as a million save the trees leaflets  detritus toppled backward with his mug still in his hand .  apart from the      change in position  he didn   t move a muscle .      it   s the sulphur     said cuddy  without looking around .     it goes right to their heads .      carrot thumped his fist on the bar .      we ought to do something .         we could nick his boots     said nobby .      i mean about mr .  hammerhock .         oh  yeah  yeah     said nobby .     you sound like old vimesy .  if we was to worry about every dead body in this town           but not like this .     snapped carrot .     normally it   s just   well   suicide  or guild fighting  stuff like that .  but he was just a dwarf .  pillar of the community .  spent all day making swords and axes and burial weapons and crossbows and torture implements .  and then he   s in the river with a great big hole in his chest .  who   s going to do anything about it  if not us .         you been putting anything in your milk .     said colon .     look  the dwarfs can sort it out .  it   s like quarry lane .  don   t stick your nose where someone can pull it off and eat it .         we   re the city watch     said carrot .     that doesn   t mean just that part of the city who happens to be over four feet tall and made of flesh .         no dwarf did it     said cuddy  who was swaying gently .     no troll  neither .     he tried to tap the side of his nose  and missed .     the reason being  he still had all his arms and legs on .         captain vimes   ll want it investigated     said carrot .      captain vimes is trying to learn to be a civilian     said nobby .      well  i   m not going to       colon began  and got off his stool .   he hopped .  he jumped up and down a bit  his mouth opening and shutting .  then the words managed to come out .      my foot .         what about your foot .         something stuck in it .      he hopped backward  clutching at one sandal  and fell over detritus .      you   d be amazed what can get stuck to your boots in this town     said carrot .      there   s something on the bottom of your sandal     said angua .     stop waving it about  you silly man .      she drew her dagger .      bit of card or something .  with a drawing pin in it .  you picked it up somewhere .  probably took a while for you to tread it through   there .         bit of card .     said carrot .      there   s something written on it       angua scraped away the mud .          gonne          what does that mean .     she said .      i don   t know .  something   s gone  i suppose .  perhaps it   s mr .  gonne   s visiting card  whoever he is     said nobby .     who cares .  let   s have ano        carrot took the card and turned it over and over in his hands .        save the pin     said cuddy .     you only get five of them for a penny .  my cousin gimick makes them .         this is important     said carrot  slowly .     the captain ought to know about this .  i think he was looking for it .         what   s important about it .     said sergeant colon .     apart from my foot hurting like blazes .         i don   t know .  the captain   ll know     said carrot stubbornly .      you tell him  then     said colon .     he   s staying up at her ladyship   s now .         learning to be a gentleman     said nobby .      i   m going to tell him     said carrot .   angua glanced through the grubby window .  the moon would be up soon .  that was one trouble with cities .  the damn thing could be lurking behind a tower if you weren   t careful .      and i   d better be getting back to my lodgings     she said .      i   ll accompany you     said carrot  quickly .     i ought to go and find captain vimes in any case .         it   ll be out of your way           honestly  i   d like to .      she looked at his earnest expression .      i couldn   t put you to the trouble     she said .      that   s all right .  i like walking .  it helps me think .      angua smiled  despite her desperation .   they stepped out into the softer heat of the evening .  instinctively  carrot settled into the policeman   s pace .      very old street  this     he said .     they say there   s an underground stream under it .  i read that .  what do you think .         do you really like walking .     said angua  falling into step .        oh  yes .  there are many interesting byways and historical buildings to be seen .  i often go for walks on my day off .      she looked at his face .  ye gods  she thought .      why did you join the watch .     she said .      my father said it   d make a man of me .         it seems to have worked .         yes .  it   s the best job there is .         really .         oh  yes .  do you know what    policeman    means .      angua shrugged .     no .         it means    man of the polis    .  that   s an old word for city .         yes .         i read it in a book .  man of the city .      she glanced sideways at him again .  his face glowed in the light of a torch on the street corner  but it had some inner glow of its own .   he   s proud .  she remembered the oath .   proud of being in the damn watch  for gods    sake        why did you join .     he said .      me .  oh  i   i like to eat meals and sleep indoors .  anyway  there isn   t that much choice  is there .  it was that or become   hah   a seamstress .          and you   re not very good at sewing .      angua   s sharp glance saw nothing but honest innocence in his face .      yes     she said  giving up     that   s right .  and then i saw this poster .     the city watche needs men .  be a man in the city watch .     so i thought i   d give it a go .  after all  i   d only have something to gain .        she waited to see if he   d fail to pick this one up  too .  he did .      sergeant colon wrote the notice     said carrot .     he   s a fairly direct thinker .      he sniffed .      can you smell something .     he said .     smells like   a bit like someone   s thrown away an old privy carpet .         oh  thank you very much     said a voice very low down  somewhere in the darkness .     oh  yes .  thank you very much .  that   s very wossname of you .  old privy carpet .  oh  yes .         can   t smell anything     angua lied .      liar     said the voice .      or hear anything .         captain vimes    boots told him he was in scoone avenue .  his feet were doing the walking of their own volition  his mind was somewhere else .  in fact  some of it was dissolving gently in jimkin bearhugger   s finest nectar .   if only they hadn   t been so damn polite .  there were a number of things he   d seen in his life which he   d always try  without success  to forget .  up until now he would have put  at the top of the list  looking at the tonsils of a giant dragon as it drew the breath intended to turn him into a small pile of impure charcoal .  he still woke up sweating at the memory of the little pilot light .  but he dreaded now that it was going to be replaced by the recollection of all those impassive dwarf faces  watching him politely  and the feeling that his words were dropping into a deep pit .   after all  what could he say .     sorry he   s dead   and that   s official .  we   re putting our worst men on the case    .     the late bjorn hammerhock   s house had been full of dwarfs   silent  owlish  polite dwarfs .  the news had got around .  he wasn   t telling anyone anything they didn   t know .  many of them were holding weapons .  mr .  stronginthearm was there .  captain vimes had talked to him before about his speeches on the subject of the need for grinding all trolls in little bits and using them to make roads .  but the dwarf wasn   t saying anything now .  he was just looking smug .  there was an air of quiet  polite menace  that said  we   ll listen to you .  then we   ll do what we decide to do .   he hadn   t even been sure which one was mrs .  hammerhock .  they all looked alike to him .  when she was introduced   helmeted  bearded   he   d got polite  non committal answers .  no  she   d locked his workshop and seemed to have mislaid the key .  thank you .   he   d tried to indicate as subtly as possible that a wholesale march on quarry lane would be frowned upon by the guard  probably from a vantage point at a safe distance  but hadn   t the face to spell it out .  he couldn   t say  don   t take matters into your own hands for the guard are mightily in pursuit of the wrongdoer  because he didn   t have a clue where to start .  had your husband any enemies .  yes  someone put a huge great hole in him  but apart from that  did he have any enemies .   so he   d extracted himself with as much dignity as possible  which wasn   t very much  and after a battle with himself which he   d lost  he   d picked up half a bottle of bearhugger   s old persnickety and wandered into the night .      carrot and angua reached the end of gleam street .      where are you staying .     said carrot .        just down there .     she pointed .      elm street .  not mrs .  cake   s .         yes .  why not .  i just wanted a clean place  reasonably priced .  what   s wrong with that .         well   i mean  i   ve nothing against mrs .  cake  a lovely woman  one of the best   but   well   you must have noticed           noticed what .         well   she   s not very   you know   choosy .         sorry .  i   m still not with you .         you must have seen some of the other guests .  i mean  doesn   t reg shoe still have lodgings there .         oh     said angua     you mean the zombie .         and there   s a banshee in the attic .         mr .  ixolite .  yes .         and there   s old mrs .  drull .         the ghoul .  but she   s retired .  she does children   s party catering now .         i mean  doesn   t it strike you the place is a bit odd .         but the rates are reasonable and the beds are clean .         i shouldn   t think anyone ever sleeps in them .         all right .  i had to take what i could get .         sorry .  i know how it is .  i was like that myself when i first arrived here .  but my advice is to move out as soon as it   s polite and find somewhere   well   more suitable for a young lady  if you know what i mean .         not really .  mr .  shoe even tried to help me upstairs with my stuff .  mind you  i had to help him upstairs with his arms afterwards .  bits fall off him all the time  poor soul .         but they   re not really   our kind of people     said carrot wretchedly .     don   t get me wrong .  i mean   dwarfs .  some of my best friends are dwarfs .  my parents are dwarfs .  trolls .  no problem at all with trolls .  salt of the earth .  literally .  wonderful chaps under all that crust .  but   undead   i just wish they   d go back to where they came from  that   s all .         most of them came from round here .         i just don   t like    em .  sorry .         i   ve got to go     said angua  coldly .  she paused at the dark entrance of an alley .      right .  right     said carrot .     um .  when shall i see you again .         tomorrow .  we   re in the same job  yes .         but maybe when we   re off duty we could take a           got to go .      angua turned and ran .  the moon   s halo was already visible over the rooftops of unseen university .      ok .  well .  right .  tomorrow  then     carrot called after her .      angua could feel the world spinning as she stumbled through the shadows .  she shouldn   t have left it so long .   she stumbled out into a cross street with a few people in it and managed to make it to an alley mouth  pawing at her clothes     she was seen by bundo prung  recently expelled from the thieves    guild for unnecessary enthusiasm and conduct unbecoming in a mugger  and a desperate man .  an isolated woman in a dark alley was just about what he felt he could manage .   he glanced around  and followed her in .   silence followed  for about five seconds .  then bundo emerged  very fast  and didn   t stop running until he reached the docks  where a boat was leaving on the tide .  he ran up the gangplank just before it was pulled up  and became a seaman  and died three years later when an armadillo fell on his head in a far off country  and in all that time never said what he   d seen .  but he did scream a bit whenever he saw a dog .   angua emerged a few seconds later  and trotted away .      lady sybil ramkin opened the door and sniffed the night air .      samuel vimes .  you   re drunk .         not yet .  but i hope to be .     said vimes  in cheerful tones .      and you haven   t changed out of your uniform .      vimes looked down  and then up again .      that   s right .     he said brightly .      the guests will be here any minute .  go on up to your room .  there   s a tub drawn and willikins has laid out a suit for you .  get along with you           jolly good .      vimes bathed in lukewarm water and a rosy alcoholic glow .  then he dried himself off as best he could and looked at the suit on the bed .   it had been made for him by the finest tailor in the city .  sybil ramkin had a generous heart .  she was a woman out for all she could give .   the suit was blue and deep purple  with lace on the wrists and at the throat .  it was the height of fashion  he had been told .  sybil ramkin wanted him to go up in the world .  she   d never actually said it  but he knew she felt he was far too good to be a copper .   he stared at it in muzzy incomprehension .  he   d never really worn a suit before .  when he was a kid there   d been whatever rags could be tied on  and later on there   d been the leather knee britches and chainmail of the watch   comfortable  practical clothes .   there was a hat with the suit .  it had pearls on it .   vimes had never worn any headgear before that hadn   t been hammered out of one piece of metal .   the shoes were long and pointy .   he   d always worn sandals in the summer  and the traditional cheap boots in the winter .   captain vimes could just about manage to be an officer .  he wasn   t at all sure how to become a gentleman .  putting on the suit would seem to be part of it     guests were arriving .  he could hear the crunch of carriage wheels on the driveway  and the flip flop of the sedan chair carriers .   he glanced out of the window .  scoone avenue was higher than most of morpork and offered unrivalled views of the city  if that was your idea of a good time .  the patrician   s palace was a darker shape in the dusk  with one lighted window high up .  it was the center of a well lit area  which got darker and darker as the view widened and began to take in those parts of the city where you didn   t light a candle because that was wasting good food .  there was red torchlight around quarry lane   well  trolls    new year  understandable .  and a faint glow over the high energy magic building at unseen university  vimes would arrest all wizards on suspicion of being too bloody clever by half .  but more lights than you   d expect to see around cable and sheer  the part of the city that people like captain quirke referred to as    tinytown           samuel .      vimes adjusted his cravat as best he could .   he   d faced trolls and dwarfs and dragons  but now he was having to meet an entirely new species .  the rich .      it was always hard to remember  afterwards  how the world looked when she was dans une certaine condition  as her mother had delicately called it .   for example  she remembered seeing smells .  the actual streets and buildings   they were there  of course  but only as a drab monochrome background against which the sounds and  yes  the smells seared like brilliant lines of   colored fire and clouds of   well  of colored smoke .   that was the point .  that was where it all broke down .  there were no proper words afterwards for what she heard and smelled .  if you could see an eighth distinct color just for a while  and then describe it back in the seven colored world  it   d have to be      something like a sort of greenish purple    .  experience did not cross over well between species .   sometimes  although not very often  angua thought she was very lucky to get to see both worlds .  and there was always twenty minutes after a change when all the senses were heightened  so that the world glowed in every sensory spectrum like a rainbow .  it was nearly worth it just for that .   there were varieties of werewolf .  some people merely had to shave every hour and wear a hat to cover the ears .  they could pass for nearly normal .   but she could recognize them  nevertheless .  werewolves could spot another werewolf across a crowded street .  there was something about the eyes .  and  of course  if you had time  there were all sorts of other clues .  werewolves tended to live alone and take jobs that didn   t bring them into contact with animals .  they wore scent or aftershave a lot and tended to be very fastidious about their food .  and kept diaries with the phases of the moon carefully marked in red ink .   it was no life  being a werewolf in the country .  a stupid chicken went missing and you were a number one suspect .  everyone said it was better in the city .   it was certainly overpowering .   angua could see several hours of elm street all in one go .  the mugger   s fear was a fading orange line .  carrot   s trail was an expanding pale green cloud  with an edge that suggested he was slightly worried  there were additional tones of old leather and armor polish .  other trails  faint or powerful  criss crossed the street .   there was one that smelled like an old privy carpet .      yo  bitch     said a voice behind her .   she turned her head .  gaspode looked no better through canine vision  except that he was at the center of a cloud of mixed odors .      oh .  it   s you .            s   right     said gaspode  feverishly scratching himself .  he gave her a hopeful look .     just askin     you understand  just gettin    it over with right now  for the look of the thing  for wossname   s sake as it might be  but i s   pose there   s no chance of me sniffing           none .         just askin    .  no offense meant .      angua wrinkled her muzzle .      how come you smell so bad .  i mean  you smelled bad enough when i was human  but now        gaspode looked proud .      good  innit     he said .     it didn   t just happen .  i had to work at it .  if you was a true dog  this   d be like really great aftershave .  by the way  you want to get a collar  miss .  no one bothers you if you   ve got a collar .           thanks .      gaspode seemed to have something on his mind .      er   you don   t rip hearts out  do you .         not unless i want to     said angua .      right  right  right     said gaspode hurriedly .     where   re you going .      he broke into a waddling  bow legged trot to keep up with her .      to have a sniff around hammerhock   s place .  i didn   t ask you to come .         got nothing else to do     said gaspode .     the house of ribs don   t put its rubbish out till midnight .         haven   t you got a home to go to .     said angua  as they trotted under a fish and chip stall .      home .  me .  home .  yeah .  of course .  no problemo .  laughing kids  big kitchen  three meals a day  humorous cat next door to chase  own blanket and spot by the fire  he   s an old softy but we love him  ekcetra .  no problem there .  i just like to get out a bit     said gaspode .      only  i see you haven   t got a collar .         it fell off .         right .         it was the weight of all them rhinestones .         i expect it was .         they let me do pretty much as i like     said gaspode .      i can see that .         sometimes i don   t go home for  oh  days at a time .         right .         weeks  sometimes .         sure .         but they   re always so glad to see me when i do     said gaspode .        i thought you said you slept up at the university     said angua  as they dodged a cart in rime street .   for a moment gaspode smelled uncertain  but he recovered magnificently .      yeah  right     he said .     we ell  you know how it is  families   all them kids picking you up  giving you biscuits and similar  people pattin    you the whole time .  gets on yer nerves .  so i sleeps up there quite often .         right .         more often than not  point of fact .         really .      gaspode whimpered a little .      you want to be careful  you know .  a young bitch like you can meet real trouble in this dog   s city .      they had reached the wooden jetty behind hammerhock   s workshop .      how d   you       angua paused .   there was a mixture of smells here  but the overpowering one was as sharp as a saw .      fireworks .         and fear     said gaspode .     lots of fear .      he sniffed the planks .     human fear  not dwarf .  you can tell if it   s dwarfs .  it   s the rat diet  see .  phew .  must have been real bad to stay this strong .         i smell one male human  one dwarf     said angua .      yeah .  one dead dwarf .      gaspode stuck his battered nose along the line of the door  and snuffled noisily .      there   s other stuff     he said     but it   s a bugger what with the river so close and everything .  there   s oil and   grease   and all sorts   hey  where   re you going .      gaspode trotted after her as angua headed back to rime street  nose close to the ground .      following the trail .           what for .  he won   t thank you  you know .         who won   t .         your young man .      angua stopped so suddenly that gaspode ran into her .      you mean corporal carrot .  he   s not my young man .         yeah .  i   m a dog  right .  it   s all in the nose  right .  smell can   t lie .  pheremonies .  it   s the ole sexual alchemy stuff .         i   ve only known him a couple of nights .         aha .         what do you mean  aha .         nothing  nothing .  nothing wrong with it  anyway           there isn   t any it to be wrong .         right  right .  not that it would be     said gaspode  adding hurriedly     even if there was .  everyone likes corporal carrot .         they do  don   t they     said angua  her hackles settling down .     he   s very   likeable .         even big fido only bit his hand when carrot tried to pat him .         who   s big fido .         chief barker of the dog guild .         dogs have got a guild .  dogs .  pull one of the other ones  it   s got bells on           no  straight up .  scavenging rights  sunbathing spots  night time barking duty  breeding rights  howling rotas   the whole bone of rubber .         dog guild     snarled angua sarcastically .     oh  yeah .         chase a rat up a pipe in the wrong street and call me a liar .     s   good job for you i   m around  else you could get into big trouble .  there   s big trouble for a dog in this town who ain   t a guild member .  it   s lucky for you     said gaspode     that you met me .         i suppose you   re a big ma   dog in the guild  yes .         ain   t a member     said gaspode smugly .      how come you survive  then .         i can think on my paws  me .  anyway  big fido leaves me alone .  i got the power .         what power .         never you mind .  big fido   he   s a friend o    mine .         biting a man   s arm for patting you doesn   t sound very friendly .         yeah .  last man who tried to pat big fido  they only ever found his belt buckle .         yes .         and that was in a tree .         where are we .         not even a tree near here .  what .      gaspode sniffed the air .  his nose could read the city in a way reminiscent of captain vimes    educated soles .      junction of scoone avenue and prouts     he said .      trail   s dying out .  it   s mixed up with too much other stuff .      angua sniffed around for a while .  someone had come up here  but too many people had crossed the trail .  the sharp smell was still there  but only as suggestion in the welter of conflicting scents .   she was aware of an overwhelming smell of approaching soap .  she   d noticed it before  but only as a woman and only as a faint whiff .  as a quadruped  it seemed to fill the world .   corporal carrot was walking up the road  looking thoughtful .  he wasn   t looking where he was going  however  but he didn   t need to .  people stood aside for corporal carrot .     it was the first time she   d seen him through these eyes .  good grief .  how did people not notice it .  he walked through the city like a tiger through tall grass  or a hubland bear across the snow  wearing the landscape like a skin     gaspode glanced sideways .  angua was sitting on her haunches  staring .      yer tongue   s hanging out     he said .      what .    so .  so what .  that   s natural .  i   m panting .         har  har .      carrot noticed them  and stopped .      why  it   s the little mongrel dog     he said .      woof  woof     said gaspode  his traitor tail wagging .      i see you   ve got a lady friend  anyway     said carrot  patting him on the head and then absent mindedly wiping his hand on his tunic .      and  my word  what a splendid bitch     he said .     a ramtop wolfhound  if i   m any judge .     he stroked angua in a vague friendly way .     oh  well     he said .     this isn   t getting any work done  is it .         woof  whine  give the doggy a biscuit     said gaspode .   carrot stood up and patted his pockets .     i think i   ve got a piece of biscuit here   well  i could believe you understand every word i say        gaspode begged  and caught the biscuit easily .      woof  woof  fawn  fawn     he said .   carrot gave gaspode the slightly puzzled look that people always gave him when he said    woof    instead of barking  nodded at angua  and carried on toward scoone avenue and lady ramkin   s house .      there     said gaspode  crunching the stale biscuit noisily     goes a very nice boy .  simple  but nice .         yes  he is simple  isn   t he .     said angua .     that   s what i first noticed about him .  he   s simple .  and everything else here is complicated .         he was making sheep   s eyes at you earlier     said gaspode .     not that i   ve got anything against sheep   s eyes  mind you .  if they   re fresh .         you   re disgusting .         yeah  but at least i stay the same shape all month  no offense meant .         you   re asking for a bite .         oh  yeah     moaned gaspode .     yeah  you   ll bite me .  aaargh .  oh  yes  that   ll really worry me  that will .  i mean  think about it .  i   ve got so many dog diseases i   m only alive    cos the little buggers are too busy fighting among    emselves .  i mean  i   ve even got licky end  and you only get that if you   re a pregnant sheep .  go on .  bite me .  change my life .  every time there   s a full moon  suddenly i grow hair and yellow teeth and have to go around on all fours .  yes  i can see that making a big difference to my ongoing situation .  actually     he said     i   m definitely on a losing streak in the hair department  so maybe a  you know  not the whole bite  maybe just a nibble           shut up .     at least you   ve got a lady friend  carrot had said .  as if there was something on his mind        a quick lick  even           shut up .            this unrest is all vetinari   s fault     said the duke of eorle .     the man has no style .  so now  of course  we have a city where grocers have as much influence as barons .  he even let the plumbers form a guild .  that   s against nature  in my humble opinion .         it wouldn   t be so bad if he set some kind of social example     said lady omnius .        or even governed     said lady selachii .     people seem to be able to get away with anything .         i admit that the old kings were not necessarily our kind of people  toward the end     said the duke of eorle     but at least they stood for something  in my humble opinion .  we had a decent city in those days .  people were more respectful and knew their place .  people put in a decent day   s work  they didn   t laze around all the time .  and we certainly didn   t open the gates to whatever riff raff was capable of walking through .  and of course we also had law .  isn   t that so  captain .      captain samuel vimes stared glassily at a point somewhere to the left and just above the speaker   s left ear .   cigar smoke hung almost motionless in the air .  vimes was dimly aware that he   d spent several hours eating too much food in the company of people he didn   t like .   he longed for the smell of damp streets and the feel of the cobbles under his cardboard soles .  a tray of post prandial drinks was orbiting the table  but vimes hadn   t touched it  because it upset sybil .  and she tried not to show it  and that upset him even more .   the bearhugger   s had worn off .  he hated being sober .  it meant he started to think .  one of the thoughts jostling for space was that there was no such thing as a humble opinion .   he hadn   t had much experience with the rich and powerful .  coppers didn   t  as a rule .  it wasn   t that they were less prone to commit crimes  it was just that the crimes they committed tended to be so far above the normal level of criminality that they were beyond the reach of men with bad boots and rusting mail .  owning a hundred slum properties wasn   t a crime  although living in one was  almost .  being an assassin   the guild never actually said so  but an important qualification was being the son or daughter of a gentleman   wasn   t a crime .  if you had enough money  you could hardly commit crimes at all .  you just perpetrated amusing little peccadilloes .      and now everywhere you look it   s uppity dwarfs and trolls and rude people     said lady selachii .     there   s more dwarfs in ankh morpork now than there are in any of their own cities  or whatever they call their holes .         what do you think  captain .     said the duke of eorle .      hmm .     captain vimes picked up a grape and started turning it over and over in his fingers .      the current ethnic problem .         are we having one .         well  yes   look at quarry lane .  there   s fighting there every night .         and they have absolutely no concept of religion .      vimes examined the grape minutely .  what he wanted to say was  of course they fight .  they   re trolls .  of course they bash one another with clubs   trollish is basically body language and  well  they like to shout .  in fact  the only one who ever gives anyone any real trouble is that bastard chrysoprase  and that   s only because he apes humans and is a quick learner .  as for religion  troll gods were hitting one another with clubs ten thousand years before we   d even stopped trying to eat rocks .   but the memory of the dead dwarf stirred something perverse in his soul .   he put the grape back on his plate .      definitely     he said .     in my view  the godless bastards should be rounded up and marched out of the city at spearpoint .      there was a moment   s silence .      it   s no more than they deserve     vimes added .      exactly .  they   re barely more than animals     said lady omnius .  vimes suspected her first name was sara .      have you noticed how massive their heads are .     said vimes .     that   s really just rock .  very small brains .         and morally  of course       said lord eorle .   there was a murmur of vague agreement .  vimes reached for his glass .      willikins  i don   t think captain vimes wants any wine     said lady ramkin .      wrong .     said vimes cheerfully .     and while we   re on the subject  how about the dwarfs .         i don   t know if anyone   s noticed     said lord eorle     but you certainly don   t see as many dogs about as you used to .      vimes stared .  it was true about the dogs .  there didn   t seem to be quite so many mooching around these days  that was a fact .  but he   d visited a few dwarf bars with carrot  and knew that dwarfs would indeed eat dog  but only if they couldn   t get rat .  and ten thousand dwarfs eating continuously with knife  fork and shovel wouldn   t make a dent in ankh morpork   s rat population .  it was a major feature in dwarfish letters back home  come on  everyone  and bring the ketchup .      notice how small their heads are .     he managed .     very limited cranial capacity  surely .  fact of measurement .         and you never see their women     said lady sara omnius .     i find that very   suspicious .  you know what they say about dwarfs     she added darkly .     vimes sighed .  he was just about aware that you saw their women all the time  although they looked just like the male dwarfs .  surely everyone knew that  who knew anything about dwarfs .      cunning little devils too     said lady selachii .     sharp as needles .         you know     vimes shook his head     you know  that   s what   s so damn annoying  isn   t it .  the way they can be so incapable of any rational thought and so bloody shrewd at the same time .      only vimes saw the look lady ramkin flashed him .  lord eorle stubbed out his cigar .      they just move in and take over .  and work away like ants all the time real people should be getting some sleep .  it   s not natural .      vimes    mind circled the comment and compared it to the earlier one about a decent day   s work .      well  one of them won   t be working so hard     said lady omnius .     my maid said one of them was found in the river this morning .  probably some tribal war or something .         hah   it   s a start  anyway     said lord eorle  laughing .     not that anyone will notice one more or less .      vimes smiled brightly .   there was a wine bottle near his hand  despite willikins    tactful best efforts to remove it .  the neck looked invitingly grippable     he was aware of eyes on him .  he looked across the table into the face of a man who was watching him intently and whose last contribution to the conversation had been    could you be so kind as to pass me the seasonings  captain .     there was nothing remarkable about the face  except for the gaze   which was absolutely calm and mildly amused .  it was dr .  cruces .  vimes had the strong impression that his thoughts were being read .      samuel .      vimes    hand stopped halfway to the bottle .  willikins was standing next to her ladyship .      apparently there   s a young man at the door asking for you     said lady ramkin .     corporal carrot .         gosh  this is exciting .     said lord eorle .     has he come to arrest us  do you think .  hahaha .         ha     said vimes .   lord eorle nudged his partner .      i expect that somewhere a crime is being committed     he said .      yes     said vimes .     quite close  i think .      carrot was shown in  with his helmet under his arm at a respectful angle .   he gazed at the select company  licked his lips nervously  and saluted .  everyone was looking at him .  it was hard not to notice carrot in a room .  there were bigger people than him in the city .  he didn   t loom .  he just seemed  without trying  to distort things around him .  everything became background to corporal carrot .      at ease  corporal     said vimes .     what   s up .  i mean     he added quickly  knowing carrot   s erratic approach to colorful language     what is the reason for you being here at this time .         got something to show you  sir .  uh .  sir  i think it   s from the assass           we   ll just go and talk about it outside  shall we .     said vimes .  dr .  cruces hadn   t twitched a muscle .   lord eorle sat back .     well  i must say i   m impressed     he said .     i   d always thought you watchmen were a pretty ineffective lot  but i see you   re pursuing your duty at all times .  always on the alert for the criminal mind  eh .           oh  yes     said vimes .     the criminal mind .  yes .      the cooler air of the ancestral hallway came as a blessing .  he leaned against the wall and squinted at the card .         gonne    .         you know you said you saw something in the courtyard       carrot began .      what   s a gonne .         maybe something wasn   t in the assassins    museum  and they put this sign on it .     said carrot .     you know  like    removed for cleaning    .  they do that in museums .         no  i shouldn   t think th   what do you know about museums  anyway .         oh  well  sir     said carrot .     i sometimes visit them on my day off .  the one in the university  of course  and lord vetinari lets me look around the old palace one  and then there   s the guild ones  they generally let me in if i ask nicely  and there   s the dwarf museum off rime street           is there .     said vimes  interested despite himself .  he   d walked along rime street a thousand times .      yes  sir  just up whirligig alley .         fancy that .  what   s in it .         many interesting examples of dwarf bread  sir .      vimes thought about this for a moment .     that   s not important right now     he said .     this isn   t how you spell gone  anyway .         yes it is  sir     said carrot .      i meant  it   s not how gone is normally spelled .      he flicked the card back and forth in his fingers .      a man   d have to be a fool to break into the assassins    guild     he said .      yes  sir .      the anger had burned away the fumes .  once again he felt   not  not the thrill  that wasn   t the right word   the sense of something .  he still wasn   t sure what it was .  but it was there  waiting for him        samuel vimes  what   s going on .      lady ramkin shut the dining room door behind her .      i was watching you     she said .     you were being very rude  sam .         i was trying not to be .         lord eorle is a very old friend .         is he .         well  i   ve known him a long time .  i can   t stand the man  actually .  but you were making him look foolish .         he was making himself look foolish .  i was merely helping .         but i   ve often heard you being   rude about dwarfs and trolls .         that   s different .  i   ve got a right .  that idiot wouldn   t know a troll if it walked over him .         oh  he would know if a troll walked over him     said carrot  helpfully .     some of them weigh as much as        what   s so important  anyway .     said lady ramkin .      we   re   looking for whoever killed chubby     said vimes .   lady ramkin   s expression changed instantly .      that   s different  of course     she said .     people like that should be publicly flogged .      why did i say that .  thought vimes .  maybe because it   s true .  the   gonne   goes missing  next minute there   s a little dwarf artificer thrown in the river with a nasty draught where his chest should be .  they   re linked .  now all i have to do is find the links          carrot  can you come back with me to hammerhock   s .         yes  captain .  why .         i want to see inside that workshop .  and this time i   ve got a dwarf with me .      more than that  he added  i   ve got corporal carrot .  everyone likes corporal carrot .      vimes listened while the conversation droned on in dwarfish .  carrot seemed to be winning  but it was a near thing .  the clan was giving in not because of reason  or in obedience to the law  but because   well   because it was carrot who was asking .   finally  the corporal looked up .  he was sitting on a dwarf stool  so his knees practically framed his head .      you have to understand  you see  that a dwarf   s workshop is very important .         right     said vimes .     i understand .         and  er   you   re a bigger .         sorry .         a bigger .  bigger than a dwarf .         ah .         er .  the inside of a dwarf   s workshop is like   well  it   s like the inside of his clothes  if you know what i mean .  they say you can look  if i   m with you .  but you mustn   t touch anything .  er .  they   re not very happy about this  captain .      a dwarf who was possibly mrs .  hammerhock produced a bunch of keys .      i   ve always got on well with dwarfs     said vimes .      they   re not happy  sir .  um .  they don   t think we   ll do any good .         we   ll do our best .         um .  i didn   t translate that properly .  um .  they don   t think we   re any good .  they don   t mean to be offensive  sir .  they just don   t think we   ll be allowed to get anywhere  sir .            ow .         sorry about that  captain     said carrot  who was walking like an inverted l .     after you .  mind your head on the           ow .         perhaps it   d be best if you sat down and i   ll look around .      the workshop was long and  of course  low  with another small door at the far end .  there was a big workbench under a skylight .  on the opposite wall was a forge and a tool rack .  and a hole .   a chunk of plaster had fallen away a few feet above the ground  and cracks radiated away from the shattered brickwork underneath .   vimes pinched the bridge of his nose .  he hadn   t found time to sleep today .  that was another thing .  he   d have to get used to sleeping when it was dark .  he couldn   t remember when he   d last slept at night .   he sniffed .      i can smell fireworks     he said .      could be from the forge     said carrot .     anyway  trolls and dwarfs have been letting fireworks off all over the city .      vimes nodded .      all right     he said     so what can we see .         someone thumped the wall pretty hard just here     said carrot .      could have happened at any time     said vimes .      no  sir  because there   s the plaster dust underneath and a dwarf always keeps his workshop clean .           really .      there were various weapons  some of them half finished  on racks by the bench .  vimes picked up most of a crossbow .      he did good work     he said .     very good at mechanisms .         well known for it     said carrot  poking around aimlessly on the bench .     a very delicate hand .  he made musical boxes for a hobby .  could never resist a mechanical challenge .  er .  what are we looking for actually  sir .         not sure .  now this is good        it was a war axe  and so heavy that vimes    arm sagged .  intricate etched lines covered the blade .  it must have represented weeks of work .      not your actual saturday night special  eh .         oh no     said carrot     that   s a burial weapon .         i should think it is .         i mean  it   s made to be buried with a dwarf .  every dwarf is buried with a weapon .  you know .  to take with him to   wherever he   s going .         but it   s fine workmanship .  and it   s got an edge like   aargh     vimes sucked his finger     like a razor .      carrot looked shocked .     of course .  it   d be no good him facing them with an inferior weapon .         what them are you talking about .         anything bad he encounters on his journey after death     said carrot  a shade awkwardly .      ah .     vimes hesitated .  this was an area in which he did not feel comfortable .      it   s an ancient tradition     said carrot .      i thought dwarfs didn   t believe in devils and demons and stuff like that .         that   s true  but   we   re not sure if they know .         oh .        vimes laid down the axe and picked up something else from the work rack .  it was a knight in armor  about nine inches high .  there was a key in its back .  he turned it  and then nearly dropped the thing when the figure   s legs started to move .  he put it down  and it began to march stiffly across the floor  waving its sword .      moves a bit like colon  don   t it     said vimes .     clockwork .         it   s the coming thing     said carrot .     mr .  hammerhock was good at that .      vimes nodded .     we   re looking for anything that shouldn   t be here     he said .     or something that should be and isn   t .  is there anything missing .         hard to say  sir .  it isn   t here .         what .         anything that   s missing  sir     said carrot conscientiously .      i mean     said vimes  patiently     anything not here which you   d expect to find .         well  he   s got   he had   all the usual tools  sir .  nice ones  too .  shame  really .         what is .         they   ll be melted down  of course .      vimes stared at the neat racks of hammers and files .      why .  can   t some other dwarf use them .         what  use another dwarf   s actual tools .     carrot   s mouth twisted in distaste  as though someone had suggested he wear corporal nobbs    old shorts .     oh  no  that   s not   right .  i mean  they   re   part of him .  i mean   someone else using them  after he   s used them all these years  i mean   urrgh .         really .      the clockwork soldier marched under the bench .        it   d feel   wrong     said carrot .     er .  yukky .         oh .     vimes stood up .      capt           ow .            mind your head .  sorry .      rubbing his head with one hand  vimes used the other to examine the hole in the plaster .      there   s   something in here     he said .     pass me one of those chisels .      there was silence .      a chisel  please .  if it makes you feel any better  we are trying to find out who killed mr .  hammerhock .  all right .      carrot picked one up  but with considerable reluctance .      this is mr .  hammerhock   s chisel  this is     he said reproachfully .      corporal carrot  will you stop being a dwarf for two seconds .  you   re a guard .  and give me the damn chisel .  it   s been a long day .  thank you .      vimes prised at the brickwork  and a rough disc of lead dropped into his hand .      slingshot .     said carrot .      no room in here     said vimes .     anyway  how the hell could it get this far into the wall .      he slipped the disc into his pocket .      that seems about it  then     he said  straightening up .     we   d better   ow .    oh  fish out that clockwork soldier  will you .  better leave the place tidy .      carrot scrabbled in the darkness under the bench .  there was a rustling noise .      there   s a piece of paper under here  sir .      carrot emerged  waving a small yellowing sheet .  vimes squinted at it .      looks like nonsense to me     he said  eventually .     it   s not dwarfish  i know that .  but these symbols   these things i   ve seen before .  or something like them .     he passed the paper back to carrot .     what can you make of it .      carrot frowned .     i could make a hat     he said     or a boat .  or a sort of chrysanthemum           i mean the symbols .  these symbols  just here .         dunno  captain .  they do look familiar  though .  sort of   like alchemists    writing .         oh  no .     vimes put his hands over his eyes .     not the bloody alchemists .  oh  no .  not that bloody gang of mad firework merchants .  i can take the assassins  but not those idiots .  no .  please .  what time is it .      carrot glanced at the hourglass on his belt .     about half past eleven  captain .         then i   m off to bed .  those clowns can wait until tomorrow .  you could make me a happy man by telling me that this paper belonged to hammerhock .         doubt it  sir .         me too .  come on .  let   s go out through the back door .      carrot squeezed through .      mind your head  sir .      vimes  almost on his knees  stopped and stared at the doorframe .      well  corporal     he said eventually     we know it wasn   t a troll that did it  don   t we .  two reasons .  one  a troll couldn   t get through this door  it   s dwarf sized .         what   s the other reason  sir .      vimes carefully pulled something off a splinter on the low door lintel .      the other reason  carrot  is that trolls don   t have hair .      the couple of strands that had been caught in the grain of the beam were red and long .  someone had left them there inadvertently .  someone tall .  taller than a dwarf  anyway .   vimes peered at them .  they looked more like threads than hair .  fine red threads .  oh  well .  a clue was a clue .   he carefully folded them up in a scrap of paper borrowed from carrot   s notebook  and handed them to the corporal .      here .  keep this safe .      they crawled out into the night .  there was a narrow  plank walkway attached to the walls  and beyond that was the river .   vimes straightened up carefully .      i don   t like this  carrot     he said .     there   s something bad underneath all this .      carrot looked down .      i mean  there are hidden things happening     said vimes  patiently .      yes  sir .         let   s get back to the yard .      they proceeded to the brass bridge  quite slowly  because carrot cheerfully acknowledged everyone they met .  hard edged ruffians  whose normal response to a remark from a watchman would be genteelly paraphrased by a string of symbols generally found on the top row of a typewriter   s keyboard  would actually smile awkwardly and mumble something harmless in response to his hearty     good evening  masher .  mind how you go .      vimes stopped halfway across the bridge to light his cigar  striking a match on one of the ornamental hippos .  then he looked down into the turbid waters .      carrot .         yes  captain .         do you think there   s such a thing as a criminal mind .        carrot almost audibly tried to work this out .      what   you mean like   mr .  cut me own throat dibbler  sir .         he   s not a criminal .         you have eaten one of his pies  sir .         i mean   yes   but   he   s just geographically divergent in the financial hemisphere .         sir .         i mean he just disagrees with other people about the position of things .  like money .  he thinks it should all be in his pocket .  no  i meant       vimes closed his eyes  and thought about cigar smoke and flowing drink and laconic voices .  there were people who   d steal money from people .  fair enough .  that was just theft .  but there were people who  with one easy word  would steal the humanity from people .  that was something else .   the point was   well  he didn   t like dwarfs and trolls .  but he didn   t like anyone very much .  the point was that he moved in their company every day  and he had a right to dislike them .  the point was that no fat idiot had the right to say things like that .   he stared at the water .  one of the piles of the bridge was right below him  the ankh sucked and gurgled around it .  debris   baulks of timber  branches  rubbish   had piled up in a sort of sordid floating island .  there was even fungus growing on it .   what he could do with right now was a bottle of bearhugger   s .  the world swam into focus when you looked at it through the bottom of a bottle .   something else swam into focus .   doctrine of signatures  thought vimes .  that   s what the herbalists call it .  it   s like the gods put a    use me    label on plants .  if a plant looks like a part of the body  it   s good for ailments peculiar to that part .  there   s teethwort for teeth  spleenwort for   spleens  eyebright for eyes   there   s even a toadstool called phallus impudicus  and i don   t know what that   s for but nobby is a big man for mushroom omelettes .  now   either that fungus down there is exactly the medicine for hands  or     vimes sighed .      carrot  can you go and get a boathook  please .      carrot followed his gaze .      just to the left of that log  carrot .         oh  no .         i   m afraid so .  haul it out  find out who he was  make out a report for sergeant colon .      the corpse was a clown .  once carrot had climbed down the pile and moved the debris aside  he floated face up  a big sad grin painted on his face .      he   s dead .         catching  isn   t it .      vimes looked at the grinning corpse .  don   t investigate .  keep out of it .  leave it to the assassins and bloody quirke .  these are your orders .      corporal carrot .         sir .      these are your orders     well  damn that .  what did vetinari think he was .  some kind of clockwork soldier .      we   re going to find out what   s been going on here .         yes  sir .         whatever else happens .  we   re going to find out .         the river ankh is probably the only river in the universe on which the investigators can chalk the outline of the corpse .          dear sgt colon      i hope you are well .  the weather is fine .  this is a corpse who  we fished out of the river last night but  we don   t know who he is except he is a member of the fools    guild called beano .  he has been seriously hit on the back of the head and has been stuck under the bridge for some time  he is not a pretty sight .  captain vimes says to find out things .  he says he thinks it is mixed up with the murder of mr .  hammerhock .  he says talk to the fools .  he says do it .  also please find attached piece of paper .  captain vimes says  try it out on the alchemists          sergeant colon stopped reading for a while to curse all alchemists .             because it is puzzling evidence .  hoping this finds you in good health  yours faithfully  carrot ironfoundersson   cpl  .        the sergeant scratched his head .  what the hell did that all mean .   just after breakfast a couple of senior jesters from the fools    guild had come to pick up the corpse .  corpses in the river   well  there was nothing very unusual about that .  but it wasn   t the way clowns died  usually .  after all  what did a clown have that was worth stealing .  what sort of danger was a clown .   as for the alchemists  he was blowed if he was     of course  he didn   t have to .  he looked up at the recruits .  they had to be good for something .      cuddy and detritus   don   t salute .    i   ve got a little job for you .  just take this piece of paper to the alchemists    guild  all right .  and ask one of the loonies to tell you what he makes of it .         where   s the alchemists    guild  sergeant .     said cuddy .      in the street of alchemists  of course     said colon     at the moment .  but i should run  if i was you .         the alchemists    guild is opposite the gamblers    guild .  usually .  sometimes it   s above it  or below it  or falling in bits around it .   the gamblers are occasionally asked why they continue to maintain an establishment opposite a guild which accidentally blows up its guild hall every few months  and they say     did you read the sign on the door when you came in .      the troll and the dwarf walked toward it  occasionally barging into each other by deliberate accident .      anyway  you so clever  he gave paper to me .         hah .  can you read it  then .  can you .         no  i tell you to read it .  that called del eg ay shun .         hah .  can   t read .  can   t count .  stupid troll .         not stupid .         hah .  yes .  everyone knows trolls can   t even count up to four .          eater of rats .         how many fingers am i holding up .  you tell me  mr .  clever rocks in the head .           many     detritus hazarded .      har har  no  five .  you   ll be in big trouble on payday .  sergeant colon   ll say  stupid troll  he won   t know how many dollars i give him .  hah .  how come you read the notice about joining the watch  anyway .  got someone to read it to you .         how come you read notice .  get someone to hold you up .      they walked into the door of the alchemists    guild .      i knock .  my job .         i   ll knock .      when mr .  sendivoge  the guild secretary  opened the door it was to find a dwarf hanging on the knocker and being swung up and down by a troll .  he adjusted his crash helmet .      yes .     he said .   cuddy let go .   detritus    massive brows knitted .      er .  you loony bastard  what you make of this .     he said .   sendivoge stared from detritus to the paper .  cuddy was struggling to get around the troll  who was almost completely blocking the doorway .      what   d you go and call him that for .         sergeant colon  he said           i could make a hat out of it     said sendivoge     or a string of dollies  if i could get some scissors           what my   colleague means  sir  is can you help us in our inquiries in re the writing on this alleged piece of paper here .     said cuddy .     that bloody hurt .      sendivoge peered at him .      are you watchmen .     he said .      i   m lance constable cuddy and this     said cuddy  gesturing upward     is lance trying to be constable detritus   don   t salu  oh          there was a thump  and detritus slumped sideways .      suicide squad  is he .     said the alchemist .      he   ll come round in a minute     said cuddy .     it   s the saluting .  it   s too much for him .  you know trolls .      sendivoge shrugged and stared at the writing .      looks   familiar     he said .     seen it somewhere before .  here   you   re a dwarf  aren   t you .         it   s the nose  isn   t it .     said cuddy .     it always gives me away .         well  i   m sure we always try to be of help to the community     said sendivoge .     do come in .      cuddy   s steel tipped boots kicked detritus back into semisensibility  and he lumbered after them .      why the  er  why the crash helmet  mister .     said cuddy  as they walked along the corridor .  all around them was the sound of hammering .  the guild was usually being rebuilt .   sendivoge rolled his eyes .      balls     he said     billiard balls  in fact .         i knew a man who played like that     said cuddy .      oh  no .  mr .  silverfish is a good shot .  that tends rather to be the problem  in fact .      cuddy looked at the crash helmet again .      it   s the ivory  you see .         ah     said cuddy  not seeing     elephants .         ivory without elephants .  transmuted ivory .  sound commercial venture .         i thought you were working on gold .         ah  yes .  of course  you people know all about gold     said sendivoge .      oh  yes     said cuddy  reflecting on the phrase    you people .         the gold     said sendivoge  thoughtfully     is turning out to be a bit tricky             how long have you been trying .         three hundred years .         that   s a long time .         but we   ve been working on the ivory for only a week and it   s going very well .     said the alchemist quickly .     except for some side effects which we   ll doubtless soon be able to sort out .      he pushed open a door .   it was a large room  heavily outfitted with the usual badly ventilated furnaces  rows of bubbling crucibles  and one stuffed alligator .  things floated in jars .  the air smelled of a limited life expectancy .   a lot of equipment had been moved away  however  to make room for a billiard table .  half a dozen alchemists were standing around it in the manner of men poised to run .      it   s the third this week     said sendivoge  gloomily .  he nodded to a figure bent over a cue .      er  mr .  silverfish       he began .      quiet .  game on .     said the head alchemist  squinting at the white ball .   sendivoge glanced at the score rail .      twenty one points     he said .     my word .  perhaps we   re adding just the right amount of camphor to the nitro cellulose after all        there was a click .  the cue ball rolled away  bounced off the cushion        and then accelerated .  white smoke poured off it as it bore down on an innocent cluster of red balls .   silverfish shook his head .      unstable     he said .     everybody down .      everyone in the room ducked  except for the two watchmen  one of whom was in a sense pre ducked and the other of whom was several minutes behind events .     the black ball took off on a column of flame  whiffled past detritus    face trailing black smoke and then shattered a window .  the green ball was staying in one spot but spinning furiously .  the other balls cannoned back and forth  occasionally bursting into flame or caroming off the walls .   a red one hit detritus between the eyes  curved back on to the table  holed itself in the middle pocket and then blew up .   there was silence  except for the occasional bout of coughing .  silverfish appeared through the oily smoke and  with a shaking hand  moved the score point one notch with the burning end of his cue .      one .     he said .     oh well .  back to the crucible .  someone order another billiard table              scuse me     said cuddy  prodding him in the knee .      who   s there .         down here .      silverfish looked down .      oh .  are you a dwarf .      cuddy gave him a blank stare .      are you a giant .     he said .      me .  of course not .         ah .  then i must be a dwarf  yes .  and that   s a troll behind me     said cuddy .  detritus pulled himself into something resembling attention .      we   ve come to see if you can tell us what   s on this paper     said cuddy .      yur     said detritus .   silverfish looked at it .      oh  yes     he said     some of old leonard   s stuff .  well .         leonard .     said cuddy .  he glared at detritus .     write this down     he snapped .        leonard of quirm     said the alchemist .   cuddy still looked lost .      never heard of him .     said silverfish .      can   t say i have  sir .         i thought everyone knew about leonard da quirm .  quite barmy .  but a genius  too .         was he an alchemist .      write this down  write this down   detritus looked around blearily for a burnt bit of wood and a handy wall .      leonard .  no .  he didn   t belong to a guild .  or he belonged to all the guilds  i suppose .  he got around quite a bit .  he tinkered  if you know what i mean .         no  sir .         he painted a bit  and messed about with mechanisms .  any old thing .      or a hammer and chisel even  thought detritus .      this     said silverfish     is a formula for   oh  well  i might as well tell you  it   s hardly a big secret   it   s a formula for what we called no . l powder .  sulphur  saltpeter and charcoal .  you use it in fireworks .  any fool could make it up .  but it looks odd because it   s written back to front .         this sounds important     hissed cuddy to the troll .      oh  no .  he always used to write back to front     said silverfish .     he was odd like that .  but very clever all the same .  haven   t you seen his portrait of the mona ogg .         i don   t think so .      silverfish handed the parchment to detritus  who squinted at it as if he knew what it meant .  maybe he could write on this  he thought .      the teeth followed you around the room .  amazing .  in fact some people said they followed them out of the room and all the way down the street .           i think we should talk to mr .  da quirm     said cuddy .      oh  you could do that  you could do that  certainly     said silverfish .     but he might not be in a position to listen .  he disappeared a couple of years ago .         then when i find something to write with  thought detritus  i have to find someone teach me how write        disappeared .  how .     said cuddy .      we think     said silverfish  leaning closer     that he found a way of making himself invisible .         really .         because     said silverfish  nodding conspiratorially     no one   s seen him .         ah     said cuddy .     er .  this is just off of the top of my head  you understand  but i suppose he couldn   t   just have gone somewhere where you couldn   t see him .         nah  that wouldn   t be like old leonard .  he wouldn   t disappear .  but he might vanish .         oh .         he was a bit   unhinged  if you know what i mean .  head too full of brains .  ha  i remember he had this idea once of getting lightning out of lemons .  hey  sendivoge  you remember leonard and his lightning lemons .      sendivoge made little circular motions alongside his head with one finger .     oh  yes .     if you stick copper and zinc rods in the lemon  hey presto  you get tame lightning .     man was an idiot .         oh  not an idiot     said silverfish  picking up a billiard ball that had miraculously escaped the detonations .     just so sharp he kept cutting himself  as my granny used to say .  lightning lemons .  where   s the sense in that .  it was as bad as his    voices in the sky    machine .  i told him  leonard  i said  what are wizards for  eh .  there   s perfectly normal magic available for that kind of thing .  lightning lemons .  it   ll be men with wings next .  and you know what he said .  you know what he said .  he said  funny you should say that   poor old chap .      even cuddy joined in the laughter .      and did you try it .     he said  afterwards .      try what .     said silverfish .      har .  har .  har     said detritus  toiling behind the others .      putting the metal rods in the lemons .         don   t be a damn fool .         what dis letter mean .     said detritus  pointing at the paper .   they looked .      oh  that   s not a symbol     said silverfish .     that   s just old leonard   s way .  he was always doodling in margins .  doodle  doodle  doodle .  i told him  you should call yourself mr .  doodle .         i thought it was some alchemy thing     said cuddy .     it looks a bit like a crossbow without the bow .  and this word ennogeht .  what does that mean .         search me .  sounds barbarian to me .  anyway   if that   s all  officer   we   ve got some serious research to do     said silverfish  tossing the fake ivory ball up in the air and catching it again .     we   re not all daydreamers like poor old leonard .         ennogeht     said cuddy  turning the paper round and round .     t h e g o n n e        silverfish missed the ball .  cuddy got behind detritus just in time .         i   ve done this before     said sergeant colon  as he and nobby approached the fools    guild .     keep up against the wall when i bangs the knocker  all right .        it was shaped like a pair of artificial breasts  the sort that are highly amusing to rugby players and anyone whose sense of humor has been surgically removed .  colon gave it a quick rap and then flung himself to safety .   there was a whoop  a few honks on a horn  a little tune that someone somewhere must have thought was very jolly  a small hatch slid aside above the knocker and a custard pie emerged slowly  on the end of a wooden arm .  then the arm snapped and the pie collapsed in a little heap by colon   s foot .      it   s sad  isn   t it .     said nobby .   the door opened awkwardly  but only by a few inches  and a small clown stared up at him .      i say  i say  i say     it said     why did the fat man knock at the door .         i don   t know     said colon automatically .     why did the fat man knock at the door .      they stared at each other  tangled in the punch line .      that   s what i asked you     said the clown reproachfully .  he had a depressed  hopeless voice .   sergeant colon struck out toward sanity .      sergeant colon  night watch     he said     and this here is corporal nobbs .  we   ve come to talk to someone about the man who   was found in the river  ok .         oh .  yes .  poor brother beano .  i suppose you   d better come in  then     said the clown .   nobby was about to push at the door when colon stopped him  and pointed wordlessly upwards .      there seems to be a bucket of whitewash over the door     he said .      is there .     said the clown .  he was very small  with huge boots that made him look like a capital l .  his face was plastered with flesh colored make up on which a big frown had been painted .  his hair had been made from a couple of old mops  painted red .  he wasn   t fat  but a sort of hoop in his trousers was supposed to make him look amusingly overweight .  a pair of rubber braces  so that his trousers bounced up and down when he walked  were a further component in the overall picture of a complete and utter twerp .      yes     said colon .     there is .         sure .         positive .         sorry about that     said the clown .     it   s stupid  i know  but kind of traditional .  wait a moment .      there were sounds of a stepladder being lugged into position  and various clankings and swearwords .      all right  come on in .      the clown led the way through the gatehouse .  there was no sound but the flop flop of his boots on the cobbles .  then an idea seemed to occur to him .      it   s a long shot  i know  but i suppose neither of you gentlemen   d like a sniff of my buttonhole .         no .         no .         no  i suppose not .     the clown sighed .     it   s not easy  you know .  clowning  i mean .  i   m on gate duty    cos i   m on probation .         you are .         i keep on forgetting  is it crying on the outside and laughing on the inside .  i always get it mixed up .         about this beano       colon began .      we   re just holding his funeral     said the little clown .     that   s why my trousers are at half mast .      they stepped out into the sunlight again .   the inner courtyard was lined with clowns and fools .  bells tinkled in the breeze .  sunlight glinted off red noses and the occasional nervous jet of water from a fake buttonhole .   the clown ushered the guards into a line of fools .      i   m sure dr .  whiteface will talk to you as soon as we   ve finished     he said .     my name   s boffo  by the way .     he held out his hand hopefully .      don   t shake it     colon warned .   boffo looked crestfallen .   a band struck up  and a procession of guild members emerged from the chapel .  a clown walked a little way ahead  carrying a small urn .      this is very moving     said boffo .   on a dais on the opposite side of the quadrangle was a fat clown in baggy trousers  huge braces  a bow tie that was spinning gently in the breeze  and a top hat .  his face had been painted into a picture of misery .  he held a bladder on a stick .   the clown with the urn reached the dais  climbed the steps  and waited .   the band fell silent .   the clown in the top hat hit the urn carrier about the head with the bladder   once  twice  three times     the urn bearer stepped forward  waggled his wig  took the urn in one hand and the clown   s belt in the other and  with great solemnity  poured the ashes of the late brother beano into the other clown   s trousers .   a sigh went up from the audience .  the band struck up the clown anthem    the march of the idiots     and the end of the trombone flew off and hit a clown on the back of the head .  he turned and swung a punch at the clown behind him  who ducked  causing a third clown to be knocked through the bass drum .   colon and nobby looked at one another and shook their heads .     boffo produced a large red and white handkerchief and blew his nose with a humorous honking sound .      classic     he said .     it   s what he would have wanted .         have you any idea what happened .     said colon .      oh  yes .  brother grineldi did the old heel and toe trick and tipped the urn down           i mean  why did beano die .         um .  we think it was an accident     said boffo .      an accident     said colon flatly .      yes .  that   s what dr .  whiteface thinks .     boffo glanced upward  briefly .  they followed his gaze .  the rooftops of the assassins    guild adjoined the fools    guild .  it didn   t do to upset neighbors like that  especially when the only weapon you had was a custard pie edged with short crust pastry .      that   s what dr .  whiteface thinks     said boffo again  looking at his enormous shoes .   sergeant colon liked a quiet life .  and the city could spare a clown or two .  in his opinion  the loss of the whole boiling could only make the world a slightly happier place .  and yet   and yet   honestly  he didn   t know what had got into the watch lately .  it was carrot  that was what it was .  even old vimes had picked it up .  we don   t let things lie any more        maybe he was cleaning a club  sort of thing  and it accidentally went off     said nobby .  he   d caught it  too .      no one   d want to kill young beano     said the clown  in a quiet voice .     he was a friendly soul .  friends everywhere .         almost everywhere     said colon .   the funeral was over .  the jesters  jokers and clowns were going about their business  getting stuck in doorways on the way .  there was much pushing and shoving and honking of noses and falling of prats .  it was a scene to make a happy man slit his wrists on a fine spring morning .      all i know is     said boffo  in a low voice     that when i saw him yesterday he was looking very   odd .  i called out to him when he was going through the gates and           how do you mean  odd .     said colon .  i am detectoring  he thought  with a faint touch of pride .  people are helping me with my inquiries .      dunno .  odd .  not quite himself           this was yesterday .         oh  yes .  in the morning .  i know because the gate rota           yesterday morning .         that   s what i said  mister .  mind you  we were all a bit nervous after the bang           brother boffo .         oh  no       mumbled the clown .   a figure was striding toward them .  a terrible figure .   no clowns were funny .  that was the whole purpose of a clown .  people laughed at clowns  but only out of nervousness .  the point of clowns was that  after watching them  anything else that happened seemed enjoyable .  it was nice to know there was someone worse off than you .  someone had to be the butt of the world .   but even clowns are frightened of something  and that is the white faced clown .  the one who never gets in the way of the custard .  the one in the shiny white clothes  and the deadpan white make up .  the one with the little pointy hat and the thin mouth and the delicate black eyebrows .   dr .  whiteface .      who are these gentlemen .     he demanded .      er       boffo began .        night watch  sir     said colon  saluting .      and why are you here .         investigating our inquiries as to the fatal demise of the clown beano  sir     said colon .      i rather think that is guild business  sergeant .  don   t you .         well  sir  he was found in the           i am sure it is something we don   t need to bother the watch with     said dr .  whiteface .   colon hesitated .  he   d prefer to face dr .  cruces than this apparition .  at least the assassins were supposed to be unpleasant .  clowns were only one step away from mime artists  too .      no  sir     he said .     it was obviously an accident  right .         quite so .  brother boffo will show you to the door     said the head clown .     and then     he added     he will report to my office .  does he understand .         yes  dr .  whiteface     mumbled boffo .      what   ll he do to you .     said nobby  as they headed for the gate .      hat full of whitewash  probably     said boffo .     pie inna face if i   m lucky .      he opened the wicket gate .      a lot of us ain   t happy about this     he whispered .     i don   t see why those buggers should get away with it .  we ought to go round to the assassins and have it out with them .         why the assassins .     said colon .     why would they kill a clown .      boffo looked guilty .     i never said a thing .      colon glared at him .     there   s definitely something odd happening  mr .  boffo .      boffo looked around  as if expecting a vengeful custard pie at any moment .        you find his nose     he hissed .     you just find his nose .  his poor nose .      the gate slammed shut .   sergeant colon turned to nobby .      did exhibit a have a nose  nobby .         yes  fred .         then what was that about .         search me .     nobby scratched a promising boil .     p   raps he meant a false nose .  you know .  those red ones on elastic .  the ones     said nobby  grimacing     they think are funny .  he didn   t have one .      colon rapped on the door  taking care to stand out of the way of any jolly amusing booby traps .   the hatch slid aside .      yes .     hissed boffo .      did you mean his false nose .     said colon .      his real one .  now bugger off .      the hatch snapped back .      mental     said nobby  firmly .      beano had a real nose .  did it look wrong to you .     said colon .      no .  it had a couple of holes in it .         well  i don   t know about noses     said colon     but either brother boffo is dead wrong or there   s something fishy going on .         like what .         well  nobby  you   re what i might call a career soldier  right .            s   right  fred .         how many dishonorable discharges have you had .         lots     said nobby  proudly .     but i always puts a poultice on    em .         you   ve been on a lot of battlefields  ain   t you .         dozens .        sergeant colon nodded .      so you   ve seen a lot of corpses  right  when you   ve been ministering to the fallen        corporal nobbs nodded .  they both knew that    ministering    meant harvesting any personal jewelery and stealing their boots .  in many a faraway battlefield the last thing many a mortally wounded foeman ever saw was corporal nobbs heading toward him with a sack  a knife and a calculating expression .      shame to let good stuff go to waste     said nobby .      so you   ve noticed how dead bodies get   deader     said sergeant colon .      deader than dead .         you know .  more corpsey     said sergeant colon  forensic expert .      goin    stiff and purple and suchlike .         right .         and then sort of manky and runny           yes  all right           makes it easier to get the rings off  mind you           the point is  nobby  that you can tell how old a corpse is .  that clown  for e . g .  you saw him  same as me .  how long  would you say .         about            i   d say .  his boots didn   t fit  i know that .  too floppy .         i meant how long he   d been dead .         couple of days .  you can tell because there   s this           so how come boffo saw him yesterday morning .      they strolled onward .      bit of a poser  that is     said nobby .      you   re right .  i expect the captain   ll be very interested .         maybe he was a zombie .         shouldn   t think so .         never could stand zombies     nobby mused .        really .         it was always so hard to nick their boots .      sergeant colon nodded at a passing beggar .      you still doing the folk dancing on your nights off  nobby .         yes  fred .  we   re practicing    gathering sweet lilacs    this week .  there is a very complicated double crossover step .         you   re definitely a man of many parts  nobby .         only if i couldn   t cut the rings off  fred .         what i mean is  you presents an intriguing dichotomy .      nobby took a kick at a small scruffy dog .      you been reading books again  fred .         got to improve my mind  nobby .  it   s these new recruits .  carrot   s got his nose in a book half the time  angua knows words i has to look up  even the short arse is brighter   n me .  they keep on extracting the urine .  i   m definitely a bit under endowed in the head department .         you   re brighter than detritus     said nobby .      that   s what i tell myself .  i say     fred  whatever happens  you   re brighter than detritus .     but then i say     fred   so   s yeast .            he turned away from the window .   so .  the damn watch .   that damn vimes .  exactly the wrong man in the wrong place .  why didn   t people learn from history .  treachery was in his very genes .  how could a city run properly with someone like that  poking around .  that wasn   t what a watch was for .  watchmen were supposed to do what they were told  and see to it that other people did too .     someone like vimes could upset things .  not because he was clever .  a clever watchman was a contradiction in terms .  but sheer randomness might cause trouble .   the gonne lay on the table .      what shall i do about vimes .      kill him .      angua woke up .  it was almost noon  she was in her own bed at mrs .  cake   s  and someone was knocking at the door .      mmm .     she said .      oi don   t know .  shall i ask him to go away .     said a voice from around keyhole level .   angua thought quickly .  the other residents had warned her about this .  she waited for her cue .      oh  thanks  love .  oi was forgetting     said the voice .   you had to pick your time  with mrs .  cake .  it was difficult  living in a house run by someone whose mind was only nominally attached to the present .  mrs .  cake was a psychic .      you   ve got your precognition switched on again  mrs .  cake     said angua  swinging her legs out of bed and rummaging quickly through the pile of clothes on the chair .      where   d we got to .     said mrs .  cake  still on the other side of the door .      you just said     i don   t know  shall i ask him to go away .     mrs .  cake     said angua .  clothes .  that was always the trouble .  at least a male werewolf only had to worry about a pair of shorts and pretend he   d been on a brisk run .      right .     mrs .  cake coughed .     there   s a young man downstairs asking for you     she said .      who is it .     said angua .     there was a moment   s silence .      yes  oi think that   s all sorted out     said mrs .  cake .     sorry  dear .  oi get terrible headaches if   n people don   t fill in the right bits .  are you human  dear .          you can come in  mrs .  cake .      it wasn   t much of a room .  it was mainly brown .  brown oilcloth flooring  brown walls  a picture over the brown bed of a brown stag being attacked by brown dogs on a brown moorland against a sky which  contrary to established meteorological knowledge  was brown .  there was a brown wardrobe .  possibly  if you fought your way through the mysterious old coats  hanging in it  you   d break through into a magical fairyland full of talking animals and goblins  but it   d probably not be worth it .   mrs .  cake entered .  she was a small fat woman  but made up for her lack of height by wearing a huge black hat  not the pointy witch variety  but one covered with stuffed birds  wax fruit and other assorted decorative items  all painted black .  angua quite liked her .  the rooms were clean   the rates were cheap  and mrs .  cake had a very understanding approach to people who lived slightly unusual lives and had  for example  an aversion to garlic .  her daughter was a werewolf and she knew all about the need for ground floor windows and doors with long handles that a paw could operate .      he   s got chainmail on     said mrs .  cake .  she was holding a bucket of gravel in either hand .     he   s got soap in his ears  too .         oh .  er .  right .           oi can tell    im to bugger off if you like     said mrs .  cake .     that   s what i allus does if the wrong sort comes round .  especially if they   ve got a stake .  i can   t be having with that sort of thing  people messing up the hallways  waving torches and stuff .         i think i know who it is     said angua .     i   ll see to it .      she tucked in her shirt .      pull the door to if you go out     mrs .  cake called after her as she went out into the hall .     oi   m just off to change the dirt in mr .  winkins    coffin  on account of his back giving him trouble .         it looks like gravel to me  mrs .  cake .         orthopaedic  see .      carrot was standing respectfully on the doorstep with his helmet under his arm and a very embarrassed expression on his face .      well .     said angua  not unkindly .      er .  good morning .  i thought  you know  perhaps  you not knowing very much about the city  really .  i could  if you like  if you don   t mind  not having to go on duty for a while   show you some of it    .      for a moment angua thought she   d contracted prescience from mrs .  cake .  various futures flitted across her imagination .      i haven   t had breakfast     she said .      they make a very good breakfast in gimlet   s dwarf delicatessen in cable street .         it   s lunchtime .         it   s breakfast time for the night watch .         i   m practically vegetarian .         he does a soya rat .      she gave in .     i   ll fetch my coat .         har  har     said a voice  full of withering cynicism .   she looked down .  gaspode was sitting behind carrot  trying to glare while scratching himself furiously .        last night we chased a cat up a tree     said gaspode .     you and me  eh .  we could make it .  fate has thrown us together  style of fing .         go away .         sorry .     said carrot .      not you .  that dog .      carrot turned .      him .  is he bothering you now .  he   s a nice little chap .         woof  woof  biscuit .      carrot automatically patted his pocket .      see .     said gaspode .     this boy is mister simple  am i right .         do they let dogs in dwarf shops .     said angua .      no     said carrot .      on a hook     said gaspode .      really .  sounds good to me     said angua .     let   s go .         vegetarian .     mumbled gaspode  limping after them .     oh  my .         shut up .         sorry .     said carrot .      i was just thinking aloud .         vimes    pillow was cold and hard .  he felt it gingerly .  it was cold and hard because it was not a pillow but a table .  his cheek appeared to be stuck to it  and he was not interested in speculating what with .   he hadn   t even managed to take his armor off .   but he did manage to unstick one eye .   he   d been writing in his notebook .  trying to make sense of it all .  and then he   d gone to sleep .   what time was it .  no time to look back .   he traced out       stolen from assassins    guild  gonne  hammerhock killed .  smell of fireworks .  lump of lead .  alchymical symbols .   nd body in river .  a clown .  where was his red nose .  gonne .     he stared at the scrawled notes .   i   m on the path  he thought  i don   t have to know where it leads .  i just have to follow .  there   s always a crime  if you look hard enough .  and the assassins are in this somewhere .   follow every lead .  check every detail .  chip  chip away .   i   m hungry .   he staggered to his feet and looked at his face in the cracked mirror over the basin .   events of the previous day filtered through the clogged gauze of memory .  central to all of them was the face of lord vetinari .  vimes grew angry just thinking about that .  the cool way he   d told vimes that he mustn   t take an interest in the theft from     vimes stared at his reflection        something stung his ear and smashed the glass .   vimes stared at the hole in the plaster  surrounded by the remains of a mirror frame .  around him  the mirror glass tinkled on to the floor .   vimes stood stock still for a long moment .   then his legs  reaching the conclusion that his brain was somewhere else  threw the rest of him on to the floor .   there was another tinkle and a half bottle of bearhugger   s exploded on the desk .  vines couldn   t even remember buying it .   he scrambled forward on hands and knees and pulled himself upright alongside the window .   images flashed through his mind .  the dead dwarf .  the hole in the wall     a thought seemed to start in the small of his back and spread upward to his brain .  these were lath and plaster walls  and old ones at that  you could push a finger through them with a bit of effort .  as for a lump f metal     he hit the floor at the same time as a pock coincided with a hole punched through the wall on one side of the window .  plaster dust puffed into the air .   his crossbow was leaning against the wall .  he wasn   t an expert but  hells  who was .  you pointed it and you fired it .  he pulled it toward him  rolled on his back  stuck his foot in the stirrup and hauled on the string until it clicked into place .   then he rolled back on to one knee and slotted a quarrel into the groove .   a catapult  that   s what it was .  it had to be .  troll sized  perhaps .  someone up on the roof of the opera house or somewhere high     draw their fire  draw their fire   he picked up his helmet and balanced it on the end of another quarrel .  the thing to do was crouch below the window and     he thought for a moment .  then he shuffled across the floor to the corner  where there was a pole with a hook on the end .  once upon a time it had been used to open the upper windows  now long rusted shut .   he balanced his helmet on the end  wedged himself into the corner  and with a certain amount of effort moved the pole so that the helmet just showed over the windowsi     pock .   splinters flew up from a point on the floor where it would undoubtedly have severely inconvenienced anyone lying on the boards cautiously raising a decoy helmet on a stick .   vimes smiled .  someone was trying to kill him  and that made him feel more alive than he had done for days .   and they were also slightly less intelligent than he was .  this is a quality you should always pray for in your would be murderer .   he dropped the pole  picked up the crossbow  spun past the window  fired at an indistinct shape on the opera house roof opposite as if the bow could possibly carry across that range  leapt across the room and wrenched at the door .  something smashed into the doorframe as the door swung to behind him .   then it was down the back stairs  out of the door  over the privy roof  into knuckle passage  up the back steps of zorgo the retrophrenologist   into zorgo   s operating room and over to the window .   zorgo and his current patient looked at him curiously .   pugnant   s roof was empty .  vimes turned back and met a pair of puzzled gazes .         morning  captain vimes     said the retrophrenologist  a hammer still upraised in one massive hand .   vimes smiled manically .      just thought       he began  and then went on        i saw an interesting rare butterfly on the roof over there .      troll and patient stared politely past him .      but there wasn   t     said vimes .   he walked back to the door .      sorry to have bothered you     he said  and left .   zorgo   s patient watched him go with interest .      didn   t he have a crossbow .     he said .     bit odd  going after interesting rare butterflies with a crossbow .      zorgo readjusted the fit of the grid on his patient   s bald head .      dunno     he said     i suppose it stops them creating all these damn thunderstorms .     he picked up the mallet again .     now  what were we going for today .  decisiveness  yes .         yes .  well  no .  maybe .         right .     zorgo took aim .     this     he said with absolute truth     won   t hurt a bit .         it was more than just a delicatessen .  it was a sort of dwarf community center and meeting place .  the babble of voices stopped when angua entered  bending almost double  but started up again with slightly more volume and a few laughs when carrot followed .  he waved cheerfully at the other customers .   then he carefully removed two chairs .  it was just possible to sit upright if you sat on the floor .      very   nice     said angua .     ethnic .         i come in here quite a lot     said carrot .     the food   s good and  of course  it pays to keep your ear to the ground .         that   d certainly be easy here     said angua  and laughed .      pardon .         well  i mean  the ground is   so much   closer        she felt a pit opening wider with every word .  the noise level had suddenly dropped again .      er     said carrot  staring fixedly at her .     how can i put this .  people are talking in dwarfish   but they   re listening in human .         sorry .      carrot smiled  and then nodded at the cook behind the counter and cleared his throat noisily .      i think i might have a throat sweet somewhere       angua began .      i was ordering breakfast     said carrot .      you know the menu off by heart .         oh  yes .  but it   s written on the wall as well .      angua turned and looked again at what she   d thought were merely random scratches .      it   s oggham     said carrot .     an ancient and poetic runic script whose origins are lost in the mists of time but it   s thought to have been invented even before the gods .         gosh .  what does it say .      carrot really cleared his throat this time .         soss  egg  beans and rat   p  soss  rat and fried slice   p  cream cheese rat  p  rat and beans  p  rat and ketchup  p  rat  p           why does ketchup cost almost as much as the rat .     said angua .      have you tried rat without ketchup .     said carrot .     anyway  i ordered you dwarf bread .  have you ever eaten dwarf bread .         no .         everyone should try it once     said carrot .  he appeared to consider this .     most people do     he added .       three and a half minutes after waking up  captain samuel vimes  night watch  staggered up the last few steps on to the roof of the city   s opera house  gasped for breath and threw up allegro ma non troppo .   then he leaned against the wall  waving his crossbow vaguely in front of him .   there wasn   t anyone else on the roof .  there were just the leads  stretching away  drinking up the morning sunlight .  it was already almost too hot to move .   when he felt a bit better he poked around among the chimneys and skylight .  but there were a dozen ways down  and a thousand places to hide .   he could see right into his room from here .  come to that  he could see into the rooms of most of the city .   catapult   no     oh  well .  at least there   d been witnesses .   he walked to the edge of the roof  and peered over .      hello  there     he said .  he blinked .  it was six stories down  and not a sight to look at on a recently emptied stomach .      er   could you come up here  please .     he said .         ight oo are .      vimes stood back .  there was a scrape of stone and a gargoyle pulled itself laboriously over the parapet  moving like a cheap stop motion animation .   he didn   t know much about gargoyles .  carrot had said something once about how marvelous it was  an urban troll species that had evolved a symbiotic relationship with gutters  and he had admired the way they funnelled run off water into their ears and out through fine sieves in their mouths .  they were probably the strangest species on the disc .   you didn   t get many birds nesting on buildings colonized by gargoyles  and bats tended to fly around them .      what   s your name  friend .            ornice oggerooking oardway .      vimes    lips moved as he mentally inserted all those sounds unobtainable to a creature whose mouth was stuck permanently open .  cornice overlooking broadway .  a gargoyle   s personal identity was intimately bound up with its normal location  like a limpet .      well now  cornice     he said     do you know who i am .         oh     said the gargoyle sullenly .   vimes nodded .  it sits up here in all weather straining gnats through its ears  he thought .  people like that don   t have a crowded address book .  even whelks get out more .      i   m captain vimes of the watch .      the gargoyle pricked up its huge ears .      ar .  oo erk or ister arrot .      vimes worked this one out  too  and blinked .      you know corporal carrot .         oh  ess .  air ee un owes arrot .      vimes snorted .  i grew up here  he thought  and when i walk down the street everyone says     who   s that glum bugger .     carrot   s been here a few months and everyone knows him .  and he knows everyone .  everyone likes him .  i   d be annoyed about that  if only he wasn   t so likeable .      you live right up here     said vimes  interested despite the more pressing problem on his mind     how come you know arrot   carrot .         ee cuns uk ere um imes an awks oo ugg .         uz ee .         egg .         did someone else come up here .  just now .         egg .         did you see who it was .         oh .  ee oot izh oot on i ed .  ang et ogg a ire erk .  i or ing un ah ay

 oo oint  ik koes ang .         you point it and it goes bang .         egg .      vimes scratched his head .  sounded like a wizard   s staff .  but they didn   t go bang .      well   thanks     he said .     you   ve been   eh ee elkfhull .      he turned back toward the stairs .   someone had tried to kill him .   and the patrician had warned him against investigating the theft from the assassins    guild .  theft  he said .   up until then  vimes hadn   t even been certain there had been a theft .   and then  of course  there are the laws of chance .  they play a far greater role in police procedure than narrative causality would like to admit .  for every murder solved by the careful discovery of a vital footprint or a cigarette end  a hundred failed to be resolved because the wind blew some leaves the wrong way or it didn   t rain the night before .  so many crimes are solved by a happy accident   by the random stopping of a car  by an overhead remark  by someone of the right nationality happening to be within five miles of the scene of the crime without an alibi     even vimes knew about the power of chance .   his sandal clinked against something metallic .         and this     said corporal carrot     is the famous commemorative arch celebrating the battle of crumhorn .  we won it  i think .  it   s got over ninety statues of famous soldiers .  it   s something of a landmark .         should have put up a stachoo to the accounttants     said a doggy voice behind angua .     first battle in the universe where the enemy were persuaded to sell their weapons .         where is it  then .     said angua  still ignoring gaspode .      ah .  yes .  that   s the problem     said carrot .     excuse me  mr .  scant .  this is mr .  scant .  official keeper of the monuments .  according to ancient tradition  his pay is one dollar a year and a new vest every hogswatchday .      there was an old man sitting on a stool at the road junction  with his hat over his eyes .  he pushed it up .      afternoon  mr .  carrot .  you   ll be wanting to see the triumphal arch  will you .         yes  please .     carrot turned back to angua .     unfortunately  the actual practical design was turned over to bloody stupid johnson .      the old man eventually produced a small cardboard box from a pocket  and reverentially took off the lid .      where is it .         just there     said carrot .     behind that little bit of cotton wool .         oh .         i   m afraid that for mr .  johnson accurate measurements were something that happened to other people .      mr .  scant closed the lid .      he also did the quirm memorial  the hanging gardens of ankh  and the colossus of morpork     said carrot .      the colossus of morpork .     said angua .   mr .  scant held up a skinny finger .     ah     he said .     don   t go away .     he started to pat his pockets .     got    im    ere somewhere .         didn   t the man ever design anything useful .         well  he did design an ornamental cruet set for mad lord snapcase     said carrot  as they strolled away .      he got that right .         not exactly .  but here   s an interesting fact  four families live in a salt shaker and we use the pepper pot for storing grain .      angua smiled .  interesting facts .  carrot was full of interesting facts about ankh morpork .  angua felt she was floating uneasily on a sea of them .  walking along a street with carrot was like having three guided tours rolled into one .      now here     said carrot     is the beggars    guild .  they   re the oldest of the guilds .  not many people know that .         is that so .         people think it   d be the fools or the assassins .  ask anyone .  they   ll say    the oldest guild in ankh morpork is certainly the fools    guild or the assassins    guild .     but they aren   t .  they   re quite recent .  but there   s been a beggars    guild for centuries .         really .     said angua  weakly .  in the last hour she   d learned more about ankh morpork than any reasonable person wanted to know .  she vaguely suspected that carrot was trying to court her .  but  instead of the usual flowers or chocolate  he seemed to be trying to gift wrap a city .   and  despite all her better instincts  she was feeling jealous .  of a city .  ye gods  i   ve known him a couple of days .   it was the way he wore the place .  you expected him any moment to break into the kind of song that has suspicious rhymes and phrases like    my kind of town    and    i wanna be a part of it    in it  the kind of song where people dance in the street and give the singer apples and join in and a dozen lowly matchgirls suddenly show amazing choreographical ability and everyone acts like cheery lovable citizens instead of the murderous  evil minded  self centered individuals they suspect themselves to be .  but the point was that if carrot had erupted into a song and dance  people would have joined in .  carrot could have jollied a circle of standing stones to form up behind him and do a rumba .      there   s some very interesting old statuary in the main courtyard     he said .     including a very good one of jimi  the god of beggars .  i   ll show you .  they won   t mind .      he rapped on the door .      you don   t have to     said angua .      it   s no trouble        the door opened .   angua   s nostrils flared .  there was a smell     a beggar looked carrot up and down .  his mouth dropped open .      it   s cumbling michael  isn   t it .     said carrot  in his cheery way .   the door slammed .      well  that wasn   t very friendly     said carrot .      stinks  don   t it .     said a nasty little voice from somewhere behind angua .  while she was in no mood to acknowledge gaspode  she found herself nodding .  although the beggars were an entire cocktail of odors the second biggest one was fear  and the biggest of all was blood .  the scent of it made her want to scream .   there was a babble of voices behind the door  and it swung open again .   this time there was a whole crowd of beggars there .  they were all staring at carrot .      all right  yer honor     said the one hailed as cumbling michael     we give in .  how did you know .         how did we know wh       carrot began  but angua nudged him .      someone   s been killed here     she said .      who   s she .     said cumbling michael .      lance constable angua is a man of the watch     said carrot .      har  har     said gaspode .      i must say you people are getting better     said cumbling michael .     we only found the poor thing a few minutes ago .      angua could feel carrot opening his mouth to say    who .     she nudged him again .      you   d better take us to him     she said .   he turned out to be        for one thing  he turned out to be a she .  in a rag strewn room on the top floor .   angua knelt beside the body .  it was very clearly a body now .  it certainly wasn   t a person .  a person normally had more head on their shoulders .      why .     she said .     who   d do such a thing .      carrot turned to the beggars clustered around the doorway .      who was she .         lettice knibbs     said cumbling michael .     she was just the lady   s maid to queen molly .      angua glanced up at carrot .      queen .         they sometimes call the head beggar king or queen     said carrot .  he was breathing heavily .   angua pulled the maid   s velvet cloak over the corpse .      just the maid     she muttered .   there was a full length mirror in the middle of the floor  or at least the frame of one .  the glass was scattered like sequins around it .   so was the glass from a window pane .   carrot kicked aside some shards .  there was a groove in the floor  and something metallic embedded in it .      cumbling michael  i need a nail and a length of string     said carrot  very slowly and carefully .  his eyes never left the speck of metal .  it was almost as if he expected it to do something .      i don   t think       the beggar began .   carrot reached out without turning his head and picked him up by his grubby collar without apparent effort .      a length of string     he repeated     and a nail .         yes  corporal carrot .         and the rest of you  go away     said angua .   they goggled at her .      do it .     she shouted  clenching her fists .     and stop staring at her .      the beggars vanished .      it   ll take a while to get the string     said carrot  brushing aside some glass .     they   ll have to beg it off someone  you see .      he drew his knife and started digging at the floorboards  with care .  eventually he excavated a metal slug  flattened slightly by its passage through the window  the mirror  the floorboards and certain parts of the late lettice knibbs that had never been designed to see daylight .   he turned it over and over in his hand .      angua .         yes .         how did you know there was someone dead in here .         i   just had a feeling .      the beggars returned  so unnerved that half a dozen of them were trying to carry one piece of string .   carrot hammered the nail into the frame under the smashed pane to hold one end of the string .  he stuck his knife in the groove and affixed the other end of the string to it .  then he lay down and sighted up the string .      good grief .         what is it .         it must have come from the roof of the operahouse .         yes .  so .         that   s more than two hundred yards away .         yes .         the   thing went an inch into an oak floor .         did you know the girl   at all .     said angua  and felt embarrassed at asking .      not really .         i thought you knew everyone .         she was just someone i   d see around .  the city   s full of people who you just see around .         why do beggars need servants .         you don   t think my hair gets like this by itself  dear  do you .      there was an apparition in the doorway .  its face was a mass of sores .  there were warts  and they had warts  and they had hair on .  it was possibly female  but it was hard to tell under the layers and layers of rags .  the aforementioned hair looked as though it had been permed by a hurricane .  with treacle on its fingers .   then it straightened up .      oh .  corporal carrot .  didn   t know it was you .      the voice was normal now  no trace of whine or wheedle .  the figure turned and brought her stick down hard on something in the corridor .      naughty boy  dribbling sidney .  you could have told i it were corporal carrot .         arrgh .      the figure strode into the room .      and who   s your ladyfriend  mr .  carrot .         this is lance constable angua .  angua  this is queen molly of the beggars .      for once  angua noted  someone wasn   t surprised to find a female in the watch .  queen molly nodded at her as one working woman to another .  the beggars    guild was an equal opportunity non employer .      good day to you .  you couldn   t spare i ten thousand dollars for a small mansion  could you .         no .         just asking .      queen molly prodded at the gown .      what was it  corporal .         i think it   s a new kind of weapon .         we heard the glass smash and there she was     said molly .     why would anyone want to kill her .      carrot looked at the velvet cloak .      whose room is this .     he said .      mine .  it   s my dressing room .         then whoever did it wasn   t after her .  he was after you  molly .     some in rags  and some in tags  and one in a velvet gown      it   s in your charter  isn   t it .  official dress of the chief beggar .  she probably couldn   t resist seeing what it looked like on her .  right gown  right room .  wrong person .      molly put her hand to her mouth  risking instant poisoning .      assassination .      carrot shook his head .     that doesn   t sound right .  they like to do it up close .  it   s a caring profession     he added  bitterly .      what should i do .         burying the poor thing would be a good start .     carrot turned the metal slug over in his fingers .  then he sniffed it .      fireworks     he said .      yes     said angua .      and what are you going to do .     said queen molly .     you   re watchmen  aren   t you .  what   s happening .  what are you going to do about it .         cuddy and detritus were proceeding along phedre road .  it was lined with tanneries and brick kilns and timber yards and was not generally considered a beauty spot which was why  cuddy suspected  they   d been given it to patrol    to get to know the city    .  it got them out of the way .  sergeant colon thought they made the place look untidy .   there was no sound but the clink of his boots and the thump of detritus    knuckles on the ground .   finally  cuddy said     i just want you to know that i don   t like being teamed up with you any more than you like being teamed up with me .         right .         but if we   re going to have to make the best of it  there   d better be some changes  ok .         like what .         like it   s ridiculous you not even being able to count .  i know trolls can count .  why can   t you .         can count .         how many fingers am i holding up  then .      detritus squinted .      two .         ok .  now how many fingers am i holding up .         two   and one more           so two and one more is    .      detritus looked panicky .  this was calculus territory .      two and one more is three .         two and one more is three .         now how many .         two and two .         that   s four .         four er .         now how many .      cuddy tried eight fingers .      a twofour .      cuddy looked surprised .  he   d expected    many     or possibly    lots    .      what   s a twofour .         a two and a two and a two and a two .      cuddy put his head on one side .      hmm     he said .     ok .  a twofour is what we call an eight .         ate .         you know     said cuddy  subjecting the troll to a long critical stare     you might not be as stupid as you look .  this is not hard .  let   s think about this .  i mean   i   ll think about this  and you can join in when you know the words .         vimes slammed the watch house door behind him .  sergeant colon looked up from his desk .  he had a pleased expression .      what   s been happening  fred .      colon took a deep breath .      interesting stuff  captain .  me and nobby did some detectoring up at the fools    guild .  i   ve writ it all down what we found out .  it   s all here .  a proper report .         fine .         all written down  look .  properly .  punctuation and everything .         well done .         it   s got commas and everything  look .         i   m sure i shall enjoy it  fred .         and the   and cuddy and detritus have found out stuff  too .  cuddy   s done a report  too .  but it   s not got so much punctuation as mine .         how long have i been asleep .         six hours .      vimes tried to make mental space for all of this  and failed .      i   ve got to get something inside me     he said .     some coffee or something .  and then the world will somehow be better .         anyone strolling along phedre road might have seen a troll and a dwarf apparently shouting at one another in excitement .      a two thirtytwo  and eight  and a one .         see .  how many bricks in that pile .      pause .      a sixteen  an eight  a four  a one .         remember what i said about dividing by eight and two .      longer pause .      two enty nine    .         right .         right .         you can get there .         i can get there .         you   re a natural at counting to two .         i   m a nat   ral at counting to two .         if you can count to two  you can count to anything .         if i can count to two  i can count to anything .         and then the world is your mollusc .         my mollusc .  what   s a mollusc .         angua had to scurry to keep up with carrot .      aren   t we going to look at the opera house .     she said .      later .  anyone up there   ll be long gone by the time we get there .  we must tell the captain .         you think she was killed by the same thing as hammerhock .         yes .            there are   niner birds .         that   s right .         there are   one bridge .         right .         there are   four ten boats .         all right .         there are   one tousand .  three hundret .  six ty .  four bricks .         ok .         there are           i should give it a rest now .  you don   t want to wear everything out by counting           there are   one running man           what .  where .         sham harga   s coffee was like molten lead  but it had this in its favor  when you   d drunk it  there was this overwhelming feeling of relief that you   d got to the bottom of the cup .      that     said vimes     was a bloody awful cup of coffee  sham .         right     said harga .      i mean i   ve drunk a lot of bad coffee in my time but that  that was like having a saw dragged across my tongue .  how long   d it been boiling .         what   s today   s date .     said harga  cleaning a glass .  he was generally cleaning glasses .  no one ever found out what happened to the clean ones .      august the fifteenth .         what year .      sham harga smiled  or at least moved various muscles around his mouth .  sham harga had run a successful eatery for many years by always smiling  never extending credit  and realizing that most of his customers wanted meals properly balanced between the four food groups  sugar  starch  grease and burnt crunchy bits .      i   d like a couple of eggs     said vimes     with the yolks real hard but the whites so runny that they drip like treacle .  and i want bacon  that special bacon all covered with bony nodules and dangling bits of fat .  and a slice of fried bread .  the kind that makes your arteries go clang just by looking at it .         tough order     said harga .      you managed it yesterday .  and give me some more coffee .  black as midnight on a moonless night .      harga looked surprised .  that wasn   t like vimes .      how black   s that  then .     he said .      oh  pretty damn black  i should think .         not necessarily .         what .         you get more stars on a moonless night .  stands to reason .  they show up more .  it can be quite bright on a moonless night .      vimes sighed .      an overcast moonless night .     he said .   harga looked carefully at his coffee pot .      cumulus or cirro nimbus .         i   m sorry .  what did you say .         you gets city lights reflected off cumulus  because it   s low lying  see .  mind you  you can get high altitude scatter off the ice crystals in           a moonless night     said vimes  in a hollow voice     that is as black as that coffee .         right .         and a doughnut .     vimes grabbed harga   s stained vest and pulled him until they were nose to nose .     a doughnut as doughnutty as a doughnut made of flour  water  one large egg  sugar  a pinch of yeast  cinnamon to taste and a jam  jelly or rat filling depending on national or species preference  ok .  not as doughnutty as something in any way metaphorical .  just a doughnut .  one doughnut .         a doughnut .         yes .         you only had to say .      harga brushed off his vest  gave vimes a hurt look  and went back into the kitchen .         stop .  in the name of the law .         what the law   s name  then .         how should i know .         why we chasing him .         because he   s running away .      cuddy had only been a guard for a few days  but already he had absorbed one important and basic fact  it is almost impossible for anyone to be in a street without breaking the law .  there are a whole quiverful of offenses available to a policeman who wishes to pass the time of day with a citizen  ranging from loitering with intent through obstruction to lingering while being the wrong color shape species sex .  it occurred briefly to him that anyone not making a dash for it when they saw detritus knuckling along at high speed behind them was probably guilty of contravening the being bloody stupid act of      .  but it was too late to take that into account .  someone was running  and they were chasing .  they were chasing because he was running  and he was running because they were chasing .      vimes sat down with his coffee and looked at the thing he   d picked up from the rooftop .   it looked like a short set of pan pipes  provided pan was restricted to six notes  all of them the same .  they were made of steel  welded together .  there was a strip of serrated metal along one side  like a flattened out cogwheel  and the whole thing reeked of fireworks .   he laid it carefully beside his plate .   he read sergeant colon   s report .  fred colon had spent some time on it  probably with a dictionary .  it went as follows          report of sgt .  f .  colon .  approx .    am today  auguste     i proseeded in the company of corporal  c .  w .  st .  j .  nobbs  to the guild of fools and joculators in god street  whereupon we conversed with clown boffo who said  clown beano  the corpus derelicti  was definitely seen by him  clown boffo  leaving the guild the previous morning just after the explosion .   this is dead bent in my opinion  the reason being  the stiff was dead at least two days  cpl .  c .  w .  st .  j .  nobbs agrees  so someone is telling meat pies  never trust anyone who falls on his arse for a living .   whereupon dr .  whiteface met us  and  damn near gave us the derriere velocite out of the place .  it seemed to us  viz  me and cpl .  c .  w .  st .  j .  nobbs  that the fools are worried that it might have been the assassins  but we don   t know why .  also  clown boffo went on about us looking for beano   s nose  but he had a nose on when we saw him here  so we said to clown boffo  did he mean a false nose  he said  no  a real one  bugger off .  whereupon we come back here .        vimes worked out what derriere velocite meant .  the whole nose business looked like a conundrum wrapped up in an enigma  or at least in sergeant colon   s handwriting  which was pretty much the same thing .  why be asked to look for a nose that wasn   t lost .   he looked at cuddy   s report  written in the careful angular handwriting of someone more used to runes .  and sagas .          captain vimes  this herewith is the chronicle of me  lance constable cvddy .  bright was the morning and high ovr hearts when we proceeded to the alchemists gvild  where events eventvated as i shall now sing .  these inclvded exploding balls .  as to the qvest vpon which we were sent  we were informed that the attached piece of paper  attached  is in the handwriting of leonard of qvirm  who vanished in mysteriovs circvmstances .  it is how to make a powder called no .    powder  which is vsed in fireworks .  mr .  silverfish the alchemist says any alchemists knows it .  also  in the margin of the paper  is a drawing of the gonne  becavse i asked my covsin grabpot abovt leonard and he vsed to sell paints to leonard and he recognized the writing and said leonard always wrote backwards becavse he was a genivs .  i have copied same herewith .        vimes laid the papers down and put the piece of metal on top of them .   then he reached in his pocket and produced a couple of metal pellets .   a stick  the gargoyle had said .   vimes looked at the sketch .  it looked  as cuddy had noted  like the stock of a crossbow with a pipe on the top of it .  there were a few sketches of strange mechanical devices alongside it  and a couple of the little six pipe things .  the whole drawing looked like a doodle .  someone  possibly this leonard  had been reading a book about fireworks and had scribbled in the margins .   fireworks .   well   fireworks .  but fireworks weren   t a weapon .  crackers went bang .  rockets went up  more or less  but all you could be sure of them hitting was the sky .   hammerhock was noted for his skill with mechanisms .  that wasn   t a major dwarfish attribute .  people thought it was  but it wasn   t .  they were skilled with metal all right  and they made good swords and jewelery  but they weren   t too technical when it came to things like cogwheels and springs .  hammerhock was unusual .   so     supposing there was a weapon .  supposing there was something about it that was different  strange  terrifying .   no  that couldn   t be it .  it   d either end up all over the place  or it   d be destroyed .  it wouldn   t end up in the assassins    museum .  what got put in museums .  things that hadn   t worked  or had got lost  or ought to be remembered   so where   s the sense in putting our firework on show .   there had been a lot of locks on the door .  so   not a museum you just wandered into  then .  maybe you had to be a high up assassin  and one day one of the guild leaders   d take you down there at dead  hah  of night  and say   and say     for some reason the face of the patrician loomed up at this point .   once again vimes felt the edge of something  some fundamental central thing           where   d he go .  where   d he go .      there was a maze of alleys around the doors .  cuddy leaned against a wall and fought for breath .      there he go .     shouted detritus .     along whalebone lane .      he lumbered off in pursuit .      vimes put down his coffee cup .   whoever had shot those lead balls at him had been very accurate across several hundred yards  and had got off six shots faster than anyone could fire an arrow     vimes picked up the pipes .  six little pipes  six shots .  and you could carry a pocketful of these things .  you could shoot further  faster  more accurately than anyone else with any other kind of weapon     so .  a new type of weapon .  much  much faster than a bow .  the assassins wouldn   t like that .  they wouldn   t like that at all .  they weren   t even keen on bows .  the assassins preferred to kill up close .   so they   d put the   the gonne safely under lock and key .  the gods alone knew how they   d come by it in the first place .  and a few senior assassins would know about it .  they   d pass on the secret  beware of things like this           down there .  he went into grope alley .         slow down .  slow down .         why .     said detritus .      it   s a dead end .      the two watchmen lumbered to a halt .   cuddy knew that he was currently the brains of the partnership  even though detritus was presently counting  his face beaming with pride  the stones in the wall beside him .   why had they chased someone halfway across the city .  because they   d run away .  no one ran away from the watch .  thieves just flashed their licenses .  unlicensed thieves had nothing to fear from the watch  since they   d saved up all their fear for the thieves    guild .  assassins always obeyed the letter of the law .  and honest men didn   t run away from the watch .   running away from the watch was downright suspicious .   the origin of grope alley   s name was fortunately lost in the celebrated mists of time  but it had come to be deserved .  it had turned into a kind of tunnel as upper stories were built out and over it  leaving a few inches of sky .   cuddy peered around the corner  into the gloom .   click .  click .   it came from deep in the darkness .      detritus .         yeah .         did he have any weapons .         just a stick .  one stick .         only   i smell fireworks .      cuddy pulled his head back  very carefully .   there had been the smell of fireworks in hammerhock   s workshop .  and mr .  hammerhock ended up with a big hole in his chest .  and a sense of named dread  which is much more specific and terrifying than nameless dread  was stealing over cuddy .  it was similar to the feeling you get when you   re playing a high stakes game and your opponent suddenly grins and you realize that you don   t know all the rules but you do know you   ll be lucky to get out of this with  if you are very fortunate  your shirt .   on the other hand   he could picture sergeant colon   s face .  we chased this man into an alley  sarge  and then we came away     he drew his sword .      lance constable detritus .         yes  lance constable cuddy .         follow me .         why .  the damn thing was made of metal  wasn   t it .  ten minutes in a hot crucible and that   d be the end of the problem .  something like that  something dangerous  why not just get rid of it .  why keep it .   but that wasn   t human nature  was it .  sometimes things were too fascinating to destroy .   he looked at the strange metal tubes .  six short pipes  welded together  sealed firmly at one end .  there was a small hole in the top side of each of the pipes     vimes slowly picked up one of the lumps of lead        the alley twisted once or twice  but there were no other alleys or doors off it .  there was one at the far end .  it was larger than a normal door  and heavily constructed .      where are we .     whispered cuddy .      don   t know     said detritus .     back of the docks somewhere .      cuddy pushed open the door with his sword .      cuddy .         yeah .         we walked seven ty nine steps .         that   s nice .      cold air rushed past them .      meat store     whispered cuddy .     someone picked the lock .      he slipped through and into a high  gloomy room  as large as a temple  which in some ways it resembled .  faint light crept through the high  ice covered windows .  from rack upon rack  all the way to the ceiling  hung meat carcasses .   they were semi transparent and so very cold cuddy   s breath turned to crystals in the air .      oh  my     said detritus .     i think this the pork futures warehouse in morpork road .         what .         used to work here     said the troll .     used to work everywhere .  go away  you stupid troll  you too thick     he added  gloomily .      is there any way out .         the main door is in morpork street .  but no one comes in here for months .  till pork exists .       cuddy shivered .      you in here .     he shouted .     it   s the watch .  step out now .      a dark figure appeared from between a couple of pre pigs .      now what we do .     said detritus .   the distant figure raised what looked like a stick  holding it like a crossbow .   and fired .  the first shot zinged off cuddy   s helmet .   a stony hand clamped on to the dwarf   s head and detritus pushed cuddy behind him  but then the figure was running  running toward them  still firing .   detritus blinked .   five more shots  one after another  punctured his breastplate .   and then the running man was through the open door  slamming it behind him .         captain vimes .      he looked up .  it was captain quirke of the day watch  with a couple of his men behind him .      yes .         you come with us .  and give me your sword .         what .         i think you heard me  captain .         look  it   s me  quirke .  sam vimes .  don   t be a fool .         i ain   t a fool .  i   ve got men with crossbows .  men .  it   s you that   d be the fool if you resist arrest .         oh .  i   m under arrest .         only if you don   t come with us           the patrician was in the oblong office  staring out of the window .  the multi belled cacophony of five o   clock was just dying away .   vimes saluted .  from the back  vetinari looked like a carnivorous flamingo .      ah  vimes     he said  without looking around     come here  will you .  and tell me what you see .      vimes hated guessing games  but he joined the patrician anyway .   the oblong office had a view over half the city  although most of it was rooftops and towers .  vimes    imagination peopled the towers with men holding gonnes .  the patrician would be an easy target .      what do you see out there  captain .         city of ankh morpork  sir     said vimes  keeping his expression carefully blank .      and does it put you in mind of anything  captain .      vimes scratched his head .  if he was going to play games  he was going to play games        well  sir  when i was a kid we owned a cow once  and one day it got sick  and it was always my job to clean out the cowshed  and           it reminds me of a clock     said the patrician .     big wheels  little wheels .  all clicking away .  the little wheels spin and the big wheels turn  all at different speeds  you see  but the machine works .  and that is the most important thing .  the machine keeps going .  because when the machine breaks down        he turned suddenly  strode to his desk with his usual predatory stalk  and sat down .      or  again  sometimes a piece of grit might get into the wheels  throwing them off balance .  one speck of grit .      vetinari looked up and flashed vimes a mirthless smile .      i won   t have that .      vimes stared at the wall .      i believe i told you to forget about certain recent events  captain .         sir .         yet it appears that the watch have been getting in the wheels .         sir .         what am i to do with you .         couldn   t say  sir .      vimes minutely examined the wall .  he wished carrot was here .  the lad might be simple  but he was so simple that sometimes he saw things that the subtle missed .  and he kept coming up with simple ideas that stuck in your mind .  policeman  for example .  he   d said to vimes one day  while they were proceeding along the street of small gods  do you know where    policeman    comes from  sir .  vimes hadn   t .     polis    used to mean    city     said carrot .  that   s what policeman means     a man for the city    .  not many people know that .  the word    polite    comes from    polis     too .  it used to mean the proper behavior from someone living in a city .   man of the city   carrot was always throwing out stuff like that .  like    copper    .  vimes had believed all his life that the watch were called coppers because they carried copper badges  but no  said carrot  it comes from the old word cappere  to capture .   carrot read books in his spare time .  not well .  he   d have real difficulty if you cut his index finger off .  but continuously .  and he wandered around ankh morpork on his day off .      captain vimes .      vimes blinked .      sir .         you have no concept of the delicate balance of the city .  i   ll tell you one more time .  this business with the assassins and the dwarf and this clown   you are to cease involving yourself .         no  sir .  i can   t .         give me your badge .      vimes looked down at his badge .   he never really thought about it .  it was just something he   d always had .  it didn   t mean anything very much   really   one way or the other .  it was just something he   d always had .      my badge .         and your sword .      slowly  with fingers that suddenly felt like bananas  and bananas that didn   t belong to him at that  vimes undid his sword belt .      and your badge .         um .  not my badge .         why not .         um .  because it   s my badge .         but you   re resigning anyway when you get married .         right .      their eyes met .      how much does it mean to you .      vimes stared .  he couldn   t find the right words .  it was just that he   d always been a man with a badge .  he wasn   t sure he could be one without the other .   finally lord vetinari said     very well .  i believe you   re getting married at noon tomorrow .     his long fingers picked up the gilt embossed invitation from the desk .     yes .  you can keep your badge  then .  and have an honorable retirement .  but i   m keeping the sword .  and the day watch will be sent down to the yard shortly to disarm your men .  i   m standing the night watch down  captain vimes .  in due course i might appoint another man in charge   at my leisure .  until then  you and your men can consider yourselves on leave .         the day watch .  a bunch of           i   m sorry .         yes  sir .         one infraction  however  and the badge is mine .  remember .         cuddy opened his eyes .      you   re alive .     said detritus .   the dwarf gingerly removed his helmet .  there was a gouge in the rim  and his head ached .      it looks like a mild skin abrasion     said detritus .      a what .  ooooh .     cuddy grimaced .     what about you  anyway .     he said .  there was something odd about the troll .  it hadn   t quite dawned on him what it was  but there was definitely something unfamiliar  quite apart from all the holes .      i suppose the armor was some help     said detritus .  he pulled at the straps of his breastplate .  five discs of metal slid out at around belt level .     if it hadn   t slowed them down i   d be seriously abraded .         what   s up with you .  why are you talking like that .         like what  pray .         what happened to the    me big troll    talk .  no offense meant .         i   m not sure i understand .      cuddy shivered  and stamped his feet to keep warm .      let   s get out of here .      they trotted to the door .  it was shut fast .      can you knock it down .         no .  if this place wasn   t troll proof  it   d be empty .  sorry .         detritus .         yes .         are you all right .  only there   s steam coming off your head .         i do feel   er        detritus blinked .  there was a tinkle of falling ice .  odd things were happening in his skull .   thoughts that normally ambulated sluggishly around his brain were suddenly springing into vibrant  coruscating life .  and there seemed to be more and more of them .      my goodness     he said  to no one in particular .   this was a sufficiently un troll like comment that even cuddy  whose extremities were already going numb  stared at him .      i do believe     said detritus     that i am genuinely cogitating .  how very interesting .         what do you mean .      more ice cascaded off detritus as he rubbed his head .      of course .     he said  holding up a giant finger .     superconductivity .         wha    .         you see .  brain of impure silicon .  problem of heat dissipation .  daytime temperature too hot  processing speed slows down  weather gets hotter  brain stops completely  trolls turn to stone until nightfall  ie  coldertemperature  however  lowertemperature enough  brainoperates fasterand           i think i   m going to freeze to death soon     said cuddy .   detritus looked around .      there are small glazed apertures up there     he said .      too hi    to rea     e   en if i st    on y   shoulders     mumbled cuddy  slumping down further .      ah  but my plan involves throwing something through them to attract help     said detritus .      wha    pla    .         i have in fact eventuated twenty three but this one has a ninety seven percent chance of success     said detritus  beaming .      ha   nt got an   ting t   throw     said cuddy .      i have     said detritus  scooping him up .     do not worry .  i can compute your trajectory with astonishing precision .  and then all you will need to do is fetch captain vimes or carrot or someone .      cuddy   s feeble protests described an arc through the freezing air and vanished along with the window glass .   detritus sat down again .  life was so simple  when you really thought about it .  and he was really thinking .   he was seventy six percent sure he was going to get at least seven degrees colder .      mr .  cut me own throat dibbler  purveyor  merchant venturer and all round salesman  had thought long and hard about going into ethnic foodstuffs .  but it was a natural career procession .  the old sausage in a bun trade had been falling off lately  while there were all these trolls and dwarfs around with money in their pockets or wherever it was trolls kept their money  and money in the possession of other people had always seemed to throat to be against the proper natural order of things .   dwarfs were easy enough to cater for .  rat on a stick was simple enough  although it meant a general improvement in dibbler   s normal catering standards .   on the other hand  trolls were basically  when you got right down to it  no offense meant  speak as you find   basically  they were walking rocks .   he   d sought advice about troll food from chrysoprase  who was also a troll  although you   d hardly know it any more  he   d been around humans so long he wore a suit now and  as he said  had learned all kindsa civilized things  like extortion  money lending at     percent interest per munf  and stuff like that .  chrysoprase might have been born in a cave above the snowline on some mountain somewhere  but five minutes in ankh morpork and he   d fitted right in .  dibbler liked to think of chrysoprase as a friend  you   d hate to think of him as an enemy .   throat had chosen today to give his new approach a try .  he pushed his hot food barrow through streets broad and narrow  crying      sausages .  hot sausages .  inna bun .  meat pies .  get them while they   re hot .      this was by way of a warm up .  the chances of a human eating anything off dibbler   s barrow unless it was stamped flat and pushed under the door after two weeks on a starvation diet was  by now  remote .  he looked around conspiratorially   there were always trolls working in the docks   and took the cover off a fresh tray .   now then  what was it .  oh  yes        dolomitic conglomerates .  get chore dolomitic conglomerates heeyar .  manganese nodules .  manganese nodules .  get them while they   re   uh   nodule shaped .     he hesitated a bit  and then rallied .     pumice .  pumice .  tufa a dollar .  roast limestones        a few trolls wandered up to stare at him .      you  sir  you look   hungry     said dibbler  grinning widely at the smallest troll .     why not try our shale on a bun .  mmm mmm .  taste that alluvial deposit  know what i mean .      c .  m .  o .  t .  dibbler had a number of bad points  but species prejudice was not one of them .  he liked anyone who had money  regardless of the color and shape of the hand that was proffering it .  for dibbler believed in a world where a sapient creature could walk tall  breathe free  pursue life  liberty and happiness  and step out toward the bright new dawn .  if they could be persuaded to gobble something off dibbler   s hot food tray at the same time  this was all to the good .   the troll inspected the tray suspiciously  and lifted up a bun .      urrh  yuk     he said     it   s got all ammonites in it .  yuk .         pardon .     said dibbler .      dis shale     said the troll     is stale .         lovely and fresh .  just like mother used to hew .         yeah  and there   s bloody quartz all through dis granite     said another troll  towering over dibbler .     clogs the arteries  quartz .      he slammed the rock back on the tray .  the trolls ambled off  occasionally turning around to give dibbler a suspicious look .      stale .  stale .  how can it be stale .  it   s rock .     shouted dibbler after them .   he shrugged .  oh  well .  the hallmark of a good businessman was knowing when to cut your losses .   he closed the lid of the tray  and opened another one .      hole food .  hole food .  rat .  rat .  rat onna stick .  rat in a bun .  get them while they   re dead .  get chore        there was a crash of glass above him  and lance constable cuddy landed head first in the tray .      there   s no need to rush  plenty for everyone     said dibbler .      pull me out     said cuddy  in a muffled voice .     or pass me the ketchup .      dibbler hauled on the dwarf   s boots .  there was ice on them .      just come down the mountain  have you .         where   s the man with the key to this warehouse .         if you liked our rat  then why not try our fine selection of        cuddy   s axe appeared almost magically in his hand .      i   ll cut your knees off     he said .      gerhardtsockofthebutchers   guildiswhoyouwant .         right .         nowpleasetaketheaxeaway .      cuddy   s boots skidded on the cobbles as he hurried off .   dibbler peered at the broken remains of the cart .  his lips moved as he calculated .      here .     he shouted .     you owe   hey  you owe me for three rats .         lord vetinari had felt slightly ashamed when he watched the door close behind captain vimes .  he couldn   t work out why .  of course  it was hard on the man  but it was the only way     he took a key from a cabinet by his desk and walked over to the wall .  his hands touched a mark on the plaster that was apparently no different from a dozen other marks  but this one caused a section of wall to swing aside on well oiled hinges .   no one knew all the passages and tunnels hidden in the walls of the palace  it was said that some of them went a lot further than that .  and there were any amount of old cellars under the city .  a man with a pick axe and a sense of direction could go where he liked just by knocking down forgotten walls .   he walked down several narrow flights of steps and along a passage to a door  which he unlocked .  it swung back on well oiled hinges .   it was not  exactly  a dungeon  the room on the other side was quite airy and well lit by several large but high windows .  it had a smell of wood shavings and glue .      look out .      the patrician ducked .   something batlike clicked and whirred over his head  circled erratically in the middle of the room  and then flew apart into a dozen jerking pieces .      oh dear     said a mild voice .     back to the drawing tablet .  good afternoon  your lordship .         good afternoon  leonard     said the patrician .     what was that .         i call it a flapping wing flying device     said leonard da quirm  getting down off his launching stepladder .     it works by gutta percha strips twisted tightly together .  but not very well  i   m afraid .      leonard of quirm was not  in fact  all that old .  he was one of those people who started looking venerable around the age of thirty  and would probably still look about the same at the age of ninety .  he wasn   t exactly bald  either .  his head had just grown up through his hair  rising like a mighty rock dome through heavy forest .   inspirations sleet through the universe continuously .  their destination  as if they cared  is the right mind in the right place at the right time .  they hit the right neuron  there   s a chain reaction  and a little while later someone is blinking foolishly in the tv lights and wondering how the hell he came up with the idea of pre sliced bread in the first place .   leonard of quirm knew about inspirations .  one of his earliest inventions was an earthed metal nightcap  worn in the hope that the damn things would stop leaving their white hot trails across his tortured imagination .  it seldom worked .  he knew the shame of waking up to find the sheets covered with nocturnal sketches of unfamiliar siege engines and novel designs for apple peeling machines .   the da quirms had been quite rich and young leonard had been to a great many schools  where he had absorbed a ragbag of information despite his habit of staring out of the window and sketching the flight of birds .  leonard was one of those unfortunate individuals whose fate it was to be fascinated by the world  the taste  shape and movement of it     he fascinated lord vetinari as well  which is why he was still alive .  some things are so perfect of their type that they are hard to destroy .  one of a kind is always special .   he was a model prisoner .  give him enough wood  wire  paint and above all give him paper and pencils  and he stayed put .   the patrician moved a stack of drawings and sat down .      these are good     he said .     what are they .         my cartoons     said leonard .      this is a good one of the little boy with his kite stuck in a tree     said lord vetinari .      thank you .  may i make you some tea .  i   m afraid i don   t see many people these days  apart from the man who oils the hinges .         i   ve come to        the patrician stopped and prodded at one of the drawings .      there   s a piece of yellow paper stuck to this one     he said  suspiciously .  he pulled at it .  it came away from the drawing with a faint sucking noise  and then stuck to his fingers .  on the note  in leonard   s crabby backward script  were the words     krow ot smees siht  omem    .      oh  i   m rather pleased with that     said leonard .     i call it my    handy note scribbling piece of paper with glue that comes unstuck when you want    .      the patrician played with it for a while .      what   s the glue made of .         boiled slugs .      the patrician pulled the paper off one hand .  it stuck to the other hand .      is that what you came to see me about .     said leonard .      no .  i came to talk to you     said lord vetinari     about the gonne .         oh  dear .  i   m very sorry .         i am afraid it has   escaped .         my goodness .  i thought you said you   d done away with it .         i gave it to the assassins to destroy .  after all  they pride themselves on the artistic quality of their work .  they should be horrified at the idea of anyone having that sort of power .  but the damn fools did not destroy it .  they thought they could lock it away .  and now they   ve lost it .         they didn   t destroy it .         apparently not  the fools .         and nor did you .  i wonder why .         i .   .   .  do you know  i don   t know .         i should never have made it .  it was merely an application of principles .  ballistics  you know .  simple aerodynamics .  chemical power .  some rather good alloying  although i say it myself .  and i   m rather proud of the rifling idea .  i had to make a quite complicated tool for that  you know .  milk .  sugar .         no  thank you .         people are searching for it  i trust .         the assassins are .  but they won   t find it .  they don   t think the right way .     the patrician picked up a pile of sketches of the human skeleton .  they were extremely good .      oh  dear .         so i am relying on the watch .         this would be the captain vimes you have spoken of .      lord vetinari always enjoyed his occasional conversations with leonard .  the man always referred to the city as if it was another world .      yes .         i hope you have impressed upon him the importance of the task .         in a way .  i   ve absolutely forbidden him to undertake it .  twice .      leonard nodded .     ah .  i   think i understand .  i hope it works .      he sighed .      i suppose i should have dismantled it  but   it was so clearly a made thing .  i had this strange fancy i was merely assembling something that already existed .  sometimes i wonder where i got the whole idea .  it seemed   i don   t know   sacrilege  i suppose  to dismantle it .  it   d be like dismantling a person .  biscuit .         dismantling a person is sometimes necessary     said lord vetinari .      this  of course  is a point of view     said leonard da quirm politely .      you mentioned sacrilege     said lord vetinari .     normally that involves gods of some sort  does it not .         did i use the word .  i can   t imagine there is a god of gonnes .         it is quite hard  yes .      the patrician shifted uneasily  reached down behind him  and pulled out an object .      what     he said     is this .         oh  i wondered where that had gone     said leonard .     it   s a model of my spinning up into the air machine .       lord vetinari prodded the little rotor .      would it work .         oh  yes     said leonard .  he sighed .     if you can find one man with the strength of ten men who can turn the handle at about one thousand revolutions a minute .      the patrician relaxed  in a way which only then drew gentle attention to the foregoing moment of tension .      now there is in this city     he said     a man with a gonne .  he has used it successfully once  and almost succeeded a second time .  could anyone have invented the gonne .         no     said leonard .     i am a genius .     he said it quite simply .  it was a statement of fact .      understood .  but once a gonne has been invented  leonard  how much of a genius need someone be to make the second one .         the rifling technique requires considerable finesse  and the cocking mechanism that slides the bullette assembly is finely balanced  and of course the end of the barrel must be very       leonard saw the patrician   s expression  and shrugged .     he must be a clever man     he said .      this city is full of clever men     said the patrician .     and dwarfs .  clever men and dwarfs who tinker with things .         i am so very sorry .         they never think .         indeed .      lord vetinari leaned back and stared at the skylight .      they do things like open the three jolly luck take away fish bar on the site of the old temple in dagon street on the night of the winter solstice when it also happens to be a full moon .         that   s people for you  i   m afraid .         i never did find out what happened to mr .  hong .         poor fellow .         and then there   s the wizards .  tinker  tinker  tinker .  never think twice before grabbing a thread of the fabric of reality and giving it a pull .         shocking .         the alchemists .  their idea of civic duty is mixing up things to see what happens .         i hear the bangs  even here .         and then  of course  along comes someone like you           i really am terribly sorry .      lord vetinari turned the model flying machine over and over in his fingers .      you dream of flying     he said .      oh  yes .  then men would be truly free .  from the air  there are no boundaries .  there could be no more war  because the sky is endless .  how happy we would be  if we could but fly .      vetinari turned the machine over and over in his hands .      yes     he said     i daresay we would .         i had tried clockwork  you know .         i   m sorry .  i was thinking about something else .         i meant clockwork to power my flying machine .  but it won   t work .         oh .         there   s a limit to the power of a spring  no matter how tightly one winds it .         oh  yes .  yes .  and you hope that if you wind a spring one way  all its energies will unwind the other way .  and sometimes you have to wind the spring as tight as it will go     said vetinari     and pray it doesn   t break .      his expression changed .      oh dear     he said .      pardon .     said leonard .      he didn   t thump the wall .  i may have gone too far .         detritus sat and steamed .  now he felt hungry   not for food  but for things to think about .  as the temperature sank  the efficiency of his brain increased even more .  it needed something to do .   he calculated the number of bricks in the wall  first in twos and then in tens and finally in sixteens .  the numbers formed up and marched past his brain in terrified obedience .  division and multiplication were discovered .  algebra was invented and provided an interesting diversion for a minute or two .  and then he felt the fog of numbers drift away  and looked up and saw the sparkling  distant mountains of calculus .   trolls evolved in high  rocky and above all in cold places .  their silicon brains were used to operating at low temperatures .  but down on the muggy plains the heat build up slowed them down and made them dull .  it wasn   t that only stupid trolls came down to the city .  trolls who decided to come down to the city were often quite smart   but they became stupid .   detritus was considered moronic even by city troll standards .  but that was simply because his brain was naturally optimized for a temperature seldom reached in ankh morpork even during the coldest winter     now his brain was nearing its ideal temperature of operation .  unfortunately  this was pretty close to a troll   s optimum point of death .   part of his brain gave some thought to this .  there was a high probability of rescue .  that meant he   d have to leave .  that meant he   d become stupid again  as sure as  better make the most of it  then .   he went back to the world of numbers so complex that they had no meaning  only a transitional point of view .  and got on with freezing to death  as well .      dibbler reached the butchers    guild very shortly after cuddy .  the big red doors had been kicked open and a small butcher was sitting just inside them rubbing his nose .      which way did he go .         dat way .      and in the guild   s main hall the master butcher gerhardt sock was staggering around in circles .  this was because cuddy   s boots were planted on his chest .  the dwarf was hanging on to the man   s vest like a yachtsman tacking into a gale  and whirling his axe round and round in front of sock   s face .      you give it to me right now or i   ll make you eat your own nose .      a crowd of apprentice butchers was trying to keep out of the way .      but           don   t you argue with me .  i   m an officer of the watch  i am .         but you           you   ve got one last chance  mister .  give it to me right now .      sock shut his eyes .      what is it you want .      the crowd waited .      ah     said cuddy .     ahaha .  didn   t i say .         no .         i   m pretty sure i did  you know .         you didn   t .         oh .  well .  it   s the key to the pork futures warehouse  if you must know .     cuddy jumped down .      why .      the axe hovered in front of his nose again .      i was just asking     said sock  in a desperate and distant voice .      there   s a man of the watch in there freezing to death     said cuddy .      there was quite a crowd around them when they finally got the main door open .  lumps of ice clinked on the stones  and there was a rush of supercold air .   frost covered the floor and the rows of hanging carcasses on their backward journey through time .  it also covered a detritus shaped lump squatting in the middle of the floor .   they carried it out into the sunlight .      should his eyes be flashing on and off like that .     said dibbler .      can you hear me .     shouted cuddy .     detritus .      detritus blinked .  ice slid off him in the day   s heat .   he could feel the cracking up of the marvelous universe of numbers .  the rising temperature hit his thoughts like a flame thrower caressing a snowflake .      say something .     said cuddy .   towers of intellect collapsed as the fire roared through detritus    brain .      hey  look at this     said one of the apprentices .   the inner walls of the warehouse were covered with numbers .  equations as complex as a neural network had been scraped in the frost .  at some point in the calculation the mathematician had changed from using numbers to using letters  and then letters themselves hadn   t been sufficient  brackets like cages enclosed expressions which were to normal mathematics what a city is to a map .   they got simpler as the goal neared   simpler  yet containing in the flowing lines of their simplicity a spartan and wonderful complexity .   cuddy stared at them .  he knew he   d never be able to understand them in a hundred years .   the frost crumbled in the warmer air .   the equations narrowed as they were carried on down the wall and across the floor to where the troll had been sitting  until they became just a few expressions that appeared to move and sparkle with a life of their own .  this was maths without numbers  pure as lightning .   they narrowed to a point  and at the point was just the very simple symbol          .      equals what .     said cuddy .     equals what .      the frost collapsed .   cuddy went outside .  detritus was now sitting in a puddle of water  surrounded by a crowd of human onlookers .      can   t one of you get him a blanket or something .     he said .   a very fat man said     huh .  who   d use a blanket after it had been on a troll .         hah  yes  good point     said cuddy .  he glanced at the five holes in detritus    breastplate .  they were at about head height  for a dwarf .     could you come over here for moment  please .      the man grinned at his friends  and sauntered over .      i expect you can see the holes in his armor  right .     said cuddy .   c .  m .  o .  t .  dibbler was a survivor .  in the same way that rodents and insects can sense an earthquake ahead of the first tremors  so he could tell if something big was about to go down on the street .  cuddy was being too nice .  when a dwarf was nice like that  it meant he was saving up to be nasty later on .      i   ll just  er  go about my business  then     he said  and backed away .      i   ve got nothing against dwarfs  mind you     said the fat man .     i mean  dwarfs is practically people  in my book .  just shorter humans  almost .  but trolls   weeeelll   they   re not the same as us  right .            scuse me     scuse me  gangway  gangway     said dibbler  achieving with his cart the kind of getaway customarily associated with vehicles that have fluffy dice on the windscreen .      that   s a nice coat you   ve got there     said cuddy .   dibbler   s cart went around the corner on one wheel .      it   s a nice coat     said cuddy .     you know what you should do with a coat like that .      the man   s forehead wrinkled .      take it off right now     said cuddy     and give it to the troll .         why  you little        the man grabbed cuddy by his shirt and wrenched him upward .   the dwarf   s hand moved very quickly .  there was a scrape of metal .   man and dwarf made an interesting and absolute stationary tableau for a few seconds .   cuddy had been brought up almost level with the man   s face  and watched with interest as the eyes began to water .      let me down     said cuddy .     gently .  i make involuntary muscle movements if i   m startled .      the man did so .      now take off your coat   good   just pass it over   thank you           your axe       the man murmured .      axe .  axe .  my axe .     cuddy looked down .     well  well  well .  hardly knew i was holding it there .  my axe .  well  there   s a thing .      the man was trying to stand on tiptoe .  his eyes were watering .      the thing about this axe     said cuddy     the interesting thing  is that it   s a throwing axe .  i was champion three years running up at copperhead .  i could draw it and split a twig thirty yards away in one second .  behind me .  and i was ill that day .  a bilious attack .      he backed away .  the man sank gratefully on to his heels .   cuddy draped the coat over the troll   s shoulders .      come on  on your feet     he said .     let   s get you home .      the troll lumbered upright .      how many fingers am i holding up .     said cuddy .   detritus peered .      two and one .     he suggested .      it   ll do     said cuddy .     for a start .         mr .  cheese looked over the bar at captain vimes  who hadn   t moved for an hour .  the bucket was used to serious drinkers  who drank without pleasure but with a sort of determination never to see sobriety again .  but this was something new .  this was worrying .  he didn   t want a death on his hands .   there was no one else in the bar .  he hung his apron on a nail and hurried out toward the watch house  almost colliding with carrot and angua in the doorway .      oh  i   m glad that   s you  corporal carrot     he said .     you   d better come .  it   s captain vimes .         what   s happened to him .         i don   t know .  he   s drunk an awful lot .         i thought he was off the stuff .         i think     said mr .  cheese cautiously     that this is not the case any more .         a scene  somewhere near quarry lane      where we going .         i   m going to get someone to have a look at you .         not dwarf doctor .         there must be someone up here who knows how to slap some quick drying cement on you  or whatever you do .  should you be oozing like that .         dunno .  never oozed before .  where we .         dunno .  never been down here before .      the area was on the windward side of the cattle yards and the slaughterhouse district .  that meant it was shunned as living space by everyone except trolls  to whom the organic odors were about as relevant and noticeable as the smell of granite would be to humans .  the old joke went  the trolls live next to the cattle yard .  what about the stench .  oh  the cattle don   t mind     which was daft .  trolls didn   t smell  except to other trolls .   there was a slabby look about the buildings here .  they had been built for humans but adapted by trolls  which broadly had meant kicking the doorways wider and blocking up the windows .  it was still daylight .  there weren   t any trolls visible .      ugh     said detritus .      come on  big man     said cuddy  pushing detritus along like a tug pushes a tanker .      lance constable cuddy .         yes .         you a dwarf .  this is quarry lane .  you found here  you in deep trouble .         we   re city guards .         chrysoprase  he not give a coprolith about that stuff .      cuddy looked around .      what do you people use for doctors  anyway .      a troll face appeared in a doorway .  and another .  and another .   what cuddy had thought was a pile of rubble turned out to be a troll .   there were  suddenly  trolls everywhere .   i   m a guard  thought cuddy .  that   s what sergeant colon said .  stop being a dwarf and start being a watchman .  that   s what i am .  not a dwarf .  a watchman .  they gave me a badge  shaped like a shield .  city watch  that   s me .  i carry a badge .   i wish it was a lot bigger .      vimes was sitting quietly at a table in the corner of the bucket .  there were some pieces of paper and a handful of metal objects in front of him  but he was staring at his fist .  it was lying on the table  clenched so tight the knuckles were white .      captain vimes .     said carrot  waving a hand in front of his eyes .  there was no response .      how much has he had .         two nips of whiskey  that   s all .         that shouldn   t do this to him  even on an empty stomach     said carrot .   angua pointed at the neck of a bottle protruding from vimes    pocket .      i don   t think he   s been drinking on an empty stomach     she said .     i think he put some alcohol in it first .         captain vimes .     said carrot again .      what   s he holding in his hand .     said angua .      i don   t know .  this is bad  i   ve never seen him like this before .  come on .  you take the stuff .  i   ll take the captain .         he hasn   t paid for his drink     said mr .  cheese .   angua and carrot looked at him .      on the house .     said mr .  cheese .      there was a wall of trolls around cuddy .  it was as good a choice of word as any .  right now their attitude was more of surprise than menace  such as dogs might show if a cat had just sauntered into the kennels .  but when they   d finally got used to the idea that he really existed  it was probably only a matter of time before this state of affairs no longer obtained .   finally  one of them said     what dis  then .         he a man of the watch  same as me     said detritus .      him a dwarf .         he a watchman .         him got bloody cheek  i know that .     a stubby troll finger prodded cuddy in the back .  the trolls crowded in .      i count to ten     said detritus .     then any troll not going about that troll   s business  he a sorry troll .         you detritus     said a particularly wide troll .     everyone know you stupid troll  you join watch because stupid troll  you can   t count to        wham .      one     said detritus .     two   tree .  four er   five .  six        the recumbent troll looked up in amazement .      that detritus  him counting .      there was a whirring noise and an axe bounced off the wall near detritus    head .   there were dwarfs coming up the street  with a purposeful and deadly air .  the trolls scattered .   cuddy ran forward .      what are you lot doing .     he said .     are you mad  or something .      a dwarf pointed a trembling finger at detritus .      what   s that .         he   s a watchman .         looks like a troll to me .  get it .      cuddy took a step backward and produced his axe .      i know you  stronginthearm     he said .     what   s this all about .         you know  watchman     said stronginthearm .     the watch say a troll killed bjorn hammerhock .  they   ve found the troll .         no  that   s not        there was a sound behind cuddy .  the trolls were back  armed for dwarf .  detritus turned around and waved a finger at them .      any troll move     he said     and i start counting .         hammerhock was killed by a man     said cuddy .     captain vimes thinks           the watch have got the troll     said a dwarf .     damn rocks .         gritsuckers .         monoliths .         eaters of rats .         hah  i been a man only hardly any time     said detritus     and already i fed up with you stupid trolls .  what you think humans say  eh .  oh  them ethnic  them don   t know how to behave in big city  go around waving clubs at the drop of a thing you wear on head .         we   re watchmen     said cuddy .     our job is to keep the peace .         good     said stronginthearm .     go and keep it safe somewhere until we need it .         this not koom valley     said detritus .      that   s right .     shouted a dwarf at the back of the crowd .     this time we can see you .      trolls and dwarfs were pouring in at either end of the street .      what would corporal carrot do at a time like this .     whispered cuddy .      he say  you bad people  make me angry  you stop toot sweet         and then they   d go away  right .         yeah .         what would happen if we tried that .         we look in gutter for our heads .         i think you   re right .         you see that alley .  it a nice alley .  it say  hello .  you out numbered                        to   .  drop in and see me .      a club bounced off detritus    helmet .      run .      the two watchmen sprinted for the alley .  the impromptu armies watched them and then  differences momentarily forgotten  gave chase .      where this go .         it goes away from the people chasing us .         i like this alley .      behind them the pursuers  suddenly trying to make progress in a gap barely wide enough to accommodate a troll  realized that they were pushing and shoving with their mortal enemies and started to fight one another in the quickest  nastiest and above all narrowest battle ever held in the city .   cuddy waved detritus to a halt and peered around a corner .      i think we   re safe     he said .     all we have to do is get out of the other end of this and get back to the watch house .  ok .      he turned around  failed to see the troll  took a step forward  and vanished temporarily from the world of men .         oh  no     said sergeant colon .     he promised he wasn   t going to touch it any more .  look  he   s had a whole bottle .         what is it .  bearhugger   s .     said nobby .      shouldn   t think so  he   s still breathing .  come on  help me up with him .      the night watch clustered around .  carrot had deposited captain vimes on a chair in the middle of the watch house floor .   angua picked out the bottle and looked at the label .      c .  m .  o .  t .  dibbler   s genuine authentic soggy mountain dew     she read .     he   s going to die .  it says     one hundred and fifty percent proof    .         nah  that   s just old dibbler   s advertising     said nobby .     it ain   t got no proof .  just circumstantial evidence .         why hasn   t he got his sword .     said angua .   vimes opened his eyes .  the first thing he saw was the concerned face of nobby .      aargh .     he said .     swor    .  gi    it    way .  hooray .         what .     said colon .      no mo    watsh .  all go              i think he   s a bit drunk     said carrot .      drun    .     m not drun    .  you wouldn    dare call m    drun    if i was sober .         get him some coffee     said angua .      i reckon he   s beyond our coffee     said colon .     nobby  nip along to fat sally   s in squeezebelly alley and get a jug of their special klatchian stuff .  not a metal jug  mind .      vimes blinked as they manhandled him into a chair .      all go    way     he said .     bang .  bang .         lady sybil   s going to be really mad     said nobby .     you know he promised to leave it alone .         captain vimes .     said carrot .      mm .         how many fingers am i holding up .         mm .         how many hands  then .         fo    .         blimey  i haven   t seen him like this for years     said colon .     here  let me try something .  want another drink  captain .         he certainly doesn   t need a           shut up  i know what i   m doing .  another drink  captain vimes .         mm .         i   ve never known him not be able to give a loud clear    yes .         said colon  standing back .     i think we   d better get him up to his room .         i   ll take him  poor chap .     said carrot .  he lifted vimes easily  and slung him over his shoulder .      i hate to see him like this     said angua  following him into the hallway and up the stairs .      he only drinks when he gets depressed     said carrot .      why does he get depressed .         sometimes it   s because he hasn   t had a drink .      the house in pseudopolis yard had originally been a ramkin family residence .  now the first floor was occupied by the guards on an ad hoc basis .  carrot had a room .  nobby had rooms consecutively  four so far  moving out when the floor became hard to find .  and vimes had a room .   more or less .  it was hard to tell .  even a prisoner in a cell manages to stamp his personality on it somewhere  but angua had never seen such an unlived in room .      this is where he lives .     said angua .     good grief .         what did you expect .         i don   t know .  anything .  something .  not nothing .      there was a joyless iron bedstead .  the springs and mattress had sagged so that they formed a sort of mould  forcing anyone who got into it to instantly fold into a sleeping position .  there was a washstand  under a broken mirror .  on the stand was a razor  carefully aligned toward the hub because vimes shared the folk belief that this kept it sharp .  there was a brown wooden chair with the cane seat broken .  and a small chest at the foot of the bed .   and that was all .      i mean  at least a rug     said angua .     a picture on the wall .  something .      carrot deposited vimes on the bed  where he flowed unconsciously into the shape .      haven   t you got something in your room .     angua asked .      yes .  i   ve got a cutaway diagram of no .   shaft at home .  it   s very interesting strata .  i helped cut it .  and some books and things .  captain vimes isn   t really an indoors kind of person .         but there   s not even a candle .         he finds his way to bed by memory  he says .         or an ornament or anything .         there   s a sheet of cardboard under the bed     carrot volunteered .     i remember i was with him in filigree street when he found it .  he said    there   s a month   s soles in this  if i   m any judge .     he was very pleased about that .         he can   t even afford boots .         i don   t think so .  i know lady sybil offered to buy him all the new boots he wanted  and he got a bit offended about that .  he seems to try to make them last .         but you can buy boots  and you get less than him .  and you send money home .  he must drink it all  the idiot .         don   t think so .  i didn   t think he   d touched the stuff for months .  lady sybil got him on to cigars .      vimes snored loudly .      how can you admire a man like this .     said angua .      he   s a very fine man .      angua raised the lid of the wooden chest with her foot .      hey  i don   t think you should do that       said carrot wretchedly .      i   m just looking     said angua .     no law against that .         in fact  under the privacy act of       it is an           there   s only old boots and stuff .  and some paper .     she reached down and picked up a crudely made book .  it was merely a wad of irregular shaped bits of paper sandwiched together between card covers .      that belongs to captain        she opened the book and read a few lines .  her mouth dropped open .      will you look at this .  no wonder he never has any money .         what d   you mean .         he spends it on women .  you wouldn   t think it  would you .  look at this entry .  four in one week .      carrot looked over her shoulder .  on the bed  vimes snorted .   there  on the page  in vimes    curly handwriting  were the words   mrs .  gaskin  mincing st      mrs .  scurrick  treacle st      mrs .  maroon  wixon   s alley      annabel curry  lobsneaks           annabel curry couldn   t have been much good  for only two dollars     said angua .   she was aware of a sudden drop in temperature .      i shouldn   t think so     said carrot  slowly .     she   s only nine years old .      one of his hands gripped her wrist tightly and the other prised the book out of her fingers .      hey  let go .         sergeant .     shouted carrot  over his shoulder     can you come up here a moment .      angua tried to pull away .  carrot   s arm was as immovable as an iron bar .   there was the creak of colon   s foot on the stair  and the door swung open .   he was holding a very small cup in a pair of tongs .      nobby got the coff       he began  and stopped .      sergeant     said carrot  staring into angua   s face     lance constable angua wants to know about mrs .  gaskin .         old leggy gaskin   s widow .  she lives in mincing street .         and mrs .  scurrick .         in treacle street .  takes in laundry now .     sergeant colon looked from one to the other  trying to get a handle on the situation .      mrs .  maroon .         that   s sergeant maroon   s widow  she sells coal in           how about annabel curry .         she still goes to the spiteful sisters of seven handed sek charity school  doesn   t she .     colon smiled nervously at angua  still not sure of what was happening .     she   s the daughter of corporal curry  but of course he was before your time        angua looked up at carrot   s face .  his expression was unreadable .      they   re the widows of coppers .     she said .   he nodded .     and one orphan .         it   s a tough old life     said colon .     no pensions for widows  see .      he looked from one to the other .      is there something wrong .     he said .   carrot relaxed his grip  turned  slipped the book into the box  and shut the lid .      no     he said .      look  i   m sorr       angua began .  carrot ignored her and nodded at the sergeant .      give him the coffee .         but   fourteen dollars   that   s nearly half his pay .      carrot picked up vimes    limp arm and tried to prise his fist open  but even though vimes was out cold the fingers were locked .      i mean  half his pay .         i don   t know what he   s holding in here     said carrot  ignoring her .     maybe it   s a clue .      he took the coffee and hauled up vimes by his collar .      you just drink this  captain     he said     and everything will look a lot   clearer        klatchian coffee has an even bigger sobering effect than an unexpected brown envelope from the tax man .  in fact  coffee enthusiasts take the precaution of getting thoroughly drunk before touching the stuff  because klatchian coffee takes you back through sobriety and  if you   re not careful  out the other side  where the mind of man should not go .  the watch was generally of the opinion that samuel vimes was at least two drinks under par  and needed a stiff double even to be sober .      careful   careful       carrot let a few drops dribble between vimes    lips .      look  when i said       angua began .      forget it .     carrot didn   t even look round .      i was only           i said forget it .      vimes opened his eyes  took a look at the world  and screamed .      nobby .         yes  sarge .         did you buy the red desert special or the curly mountain straight .         red desert  sarge  because           you could have said .  better get me       he glanced at vimes    grimace of horror       half a glass of bearhugger   s .  we   ve sent him too far the other way .      the glass was fetched and administered .  vimes unstiffened as it took effect .   his palm uncurled .      oh  my gods     said angua .     have we got any bandages .         the sky was a little white circle  high above .      where the hell are we  partner .     said cuddy .      cave .         no caves under ankh morpork .  it   s on loam .      cuddy had fallen about thirty feet but had cushioned the fall because he landed on detritus    head .  the troll had been sitting  surrounded by rotting woodwork  in   well   a cave .  or  cuddy thought  as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom  a stone lined tunnel .      i didn   t do nothing     said detritus     i just stood there  next minute  everything going past upward .      cuddy reached down into the mud underfoot and brought up a piece of wood .  it was very thick .  it was also very rotten .      we fell through something into something     he said .  he ran his hand over the curved tunnel wall .     and this is good masonry .  very good .         how we get out .      there was no way to climb back .  the tunnel roof was much higher than detritus .      we walk out  i think     said cuddy .   he sniffed the air  which was dank .  dwarfs have a very good sense of direction underground .      this way     he added  setting off .      cuddy .         yes .         no one ever say there tunnels under the city .  no one know about them .         so    .         so there no way out .  because way out is way in  too  and if no one know about tunnels  then it    cos no way in .         but they   ve got to lead somewhere .         ok .      black mud  more or less dry  made a path at the bottom of the tunnel .  there was slime on the walls  too  indicating that at some point in the recent past the tunnel had been full of water .  here and there huge patches of fungi  luminous with decay  cast a faint glow over the ancient stonework .    cuddy felt his spirits lift as he plodded through the darkness .  dwarfs always felt happier underground .      bound to find a way out     he said .      right .         so   how come you joined the watch  then .         hah .  my girl ruby she say  you want get married  you get proper job  i not marry a troll what people say  him no good troll  him thick as a short plank of wood .     detritus    voice echoed in the darkness .     how about you .         i got bored .  i worked for my brother in law  durance .  he   s got a good business making fortune rats for dwarf restaurants .  but i thought  this isn   t a proper job for a dwarf .         sound like easy job to me .         i had the devil of a time getting them to swallow the fortunes .      cuddy stopped .  a change in the air suggested a vaster tunnel up ahead .   and  indeed  the tunnel opened into the side of a much larger one .  there was deep mud on the floor  in the middle of which ran a trickle of water .  cuddy fancied he heard rats  or what he hoped were rats  scuttle away into the dark emptiness .  he even thought he could hear the sounds of the city   indistinct  intermingled   filtering through the earth .      it   s like a temple     he said  and his voice boomed away into the distance .      writing here on wall     said detritus .   cuddy peered at the letters hacked deeply into the stone .         via cloaca        he said .     hmm .  well  now   via is an old word for street or way .  cloaca means        he peered into the gloom .      this is a sewer     he said .      what that .         it   s like   well  where do trolls dump their   rubbish .     said cuddy .      in street     said detritus .     hygienic .         this is   an underground street just for   well  for crap     said cuddy .     i never knew ankh morpork had them .         maybe ankh morpork didn   t know ankh morpork had them     said detritus .      right .  you   re right .  this place is old .  we   re in the bowels of the earth .         in ankh morpork even the shit have a street to itself     said detritus  awe and wonder in his voice .     truly  this a land of opportunity .         here   s some more writing     said cuddy .  he scraped away some slime .         cirone iv me fabricat        he read aloud .     he was one of the early kings  wasn   t he .  hey   do you know what that means .         no one   s been down here since yesterday     said detritus .      no .  this place   this place is more than two thousand years old .  we   re quite probably the first people to come down here since           yesterday     said the troll .      yesterday .  yesterday .  what   s yesterday got to do with it .         footprints still fresh     said detritus .   he pointed .   there were footprints in the mud .      how long have you lived here .     said cuddy  suddenly feeling very conspicuous in the middle of the tunnel .      nine er years .  that is the number of years i have lived here .  nine er     said detritus  proudly .     it only one of a large   number of numbers i can count to .         have you ever heard of tunnels under the city .         no .         someone knows about them  though .         yes .         what shall we do .      the answer was inevitable .  they   d chased a man into the pork futures warehouse  and nearly died .  then they   d ended up in the middle of a small war  and nearly died .  now they were in a mysterious tunnel where there were fresh footprints .  if corporal carrot or sergeant colon said     and what did you do then .      neither of them could face up to the thought of saying    we came back .         the footprints go this way     said cuddy     and then they return .  but the ones coming back aren   t so deep as the ones going .  you can see they   re later ones because they   re over the top of the other ones .  so he was heavier going than he was coming back  yes .         right     said detritus .      so that means    .         he lose weight .         he was carrying something  and he left it   up ahead somewhere .      they stared at the darkness .      so we go and find what it was .     said detritus .      i think so .  how do you feel .         feel ok .      different species though they were  their minds had focused on a single image  involving a muzzle flash and a lead slug singing through the subterranean night .      he came back     said cuddy .      yes     said detritus .   they looked at the darkness again .      it has not been a nice day     said cuddy .      that the truth .         i   d just like to know something  in case   i mean   look  what happened in the pork store .  you did all that maths .  all that counting .         i   dunno .  i saw it all .         all what .         just all of it .  everything .  all the numbers in the world .  i could count them all .         what did they equal .         dunno .  what does equal mean .      they trudged on  to see what the future held .   the trail led eventually into a narrower tunnel  barely wide enough for the troll to stand upright .  finally they could go no further .  a stone had dropped out of the roof and rubble and mud had percolated through  blocking the tunnel .  but that didn   t matter because they   d found what they were looking for  even though they hadn   t been looking for it .      oh dear     said detritus .      very definitely     said cuddy .  he looked around vaguely .      you know     he said     i reckon these tunnels are usually full of water .  they   re well below the normal river level .      he looked back to the pathetic discovery .      there   s going to be a lot of trouble about this     he said .         it   s his badge     said carrot .     good grief .  he   s holding it so tight it   s cut right into his hand .         technically ankh morpork is built on loam  but what it is mainly built on is ankh morpork  it has been constructed  burned down  silted up  and rebuilt so many times that its foundations are old cellars  buried roads and the fossil bones and middens of earlier cities .   below these  in the darkness  sat the troll and the dwarf .      what we doing now .         we ought to leave it here and fetch corporal carrot .  he   ll know what to do .      detritus looked over his shoulder at the thing behind them .      i don   t like that     he said .     it not right to leave it here .         right .  yes  you   re right .  but you   re a troll and i   m a dwarf .  what do you think would happen if people saw us carrying that along the streets .         big trouble .         correct .  come on .  let   s follow the footprints back out .         supposing it gone when we come back .     said detritus  lumbering to his feet .      how .  and we   re following the tracks out  so if whoever it was who put it there comes back  we   ll run straight into them .         oh  good .  i glad you said that .         vimes sat on the edge of his bed while angua bandaged his hand .      captain quirke .     said carrot .     but he   s   not a good choice .         mayonnaise quirke  we used to call him     said colon .     he   s a pillock .         don   t tell me     said angua .     he   s rich  thick and oily  yes .         and smells faintly of eggs     said carrot .      plumes in his helmet     said colon     and a breastplate you can see your face in .         well  carrot   s got one of those too     said nobby .      yes  but the difference is  carrot keeps his armor polished because he   likes nice clean armor     said colon loyally .     while quirke keeps his shiny because he   s a pillock .         but he   s wrapped up the case     said nobby .     i heard about it when i went out for the coffee .  he   s arrested coalface the troll .  you know  captain .  the privy cleaner .  someone saw him near rime street just before the dwarf got killed .         but he   s massive     said carrot .     he couldn   t have got through the door .         he   s got a motive     said nobby .      yes .         yes .  hammerhock was a dwarf .         that   s not a motive .         it is for a troll .  anyway  if he didn   t do that  he probably did something .  there   s plenty of evidence against him .         like what .     said angua .      he   s a troll .         that   s not evidence .         it is to captain quirke     said the sergeant .      he   s bound to have done something     nobby repeated .   in this he was echoing the patrician   s view of crime and punishment .  if there was crime  there should be punishment .  if the specific criminal should be involved in the punishment process then this was a happy accident  but if not then any criminal would do  and since everyone was undoubtedly guilty of something  the net result was that  in general terms  justice was done .      he   s a nasty piece of work  that coalface     said colon .     a righthand troll for chrysoprase .         yes  but he couldn   t have killed bjorn     said carrot .     and what about the beggar girl .      vimes sat looking at the floor .      what do you think  captain .     said carrot .   vimes shrugged .      who cares .     he said .      well  you care     said carrot .     you always care .  we can   t let even someone like           listen to me     said vimes  in a small voice .     supposing we   d found who killed the dwarf and the clown .  or the girl .  it wouldn   t make any difference .  it   s all rotten anyway .         what is  captain .     said colon .      all of it .  you might try and empty a well with a sieve .  let the assassins try to sort it out .  or the thieves .  he can try the rats next .  why not .  we   re not the people for this .  we ought to have just stayed with ringing our bells and shouting    all   s well .            but all isn   t well  captain     said carrot .      so what .  when has that ever mattered .         oh  dear     said angua  under her breath .     i think perhaps you gave him too much of that coffee        vimes said     i   m retiring from the watch tomorrow .  twenty five years on the streets        nobby started to grin nervously and stopped as the sergeant  without apparently shifting position  grabbed one of his arms and twisted it gently but meaningfully up his back .         and what good   s it all been .  what good have i done .  i   ve just worn out a lot of boots .  there   s no place in ankh morpork for policemen .  who cares what   s right or wrong .  assassins and thieves and trolls and dwarfs .  might as well have a bloody king and have done with it .      the rest of the night watch stood looking at their feet in mute embarrassment .  then carrot said     it   s better to light a candle than curse the darkness  captain .  that   s what they say .         what .     vimes    sudden rage was like a thunderclap .     who says that .  when has that ever been true .  it   s never been true .  it   s the kind of thing people without power say to make it all seem less bloody awful  but it   s just words  it never makes any difference        someone hammered at the door .      that   ll be quirke     said vimes .     you   re to hand over your weapons .  the night watch is being stood down for a day .  can   t have coppers running around upsetting things  can we .  open the door  carrot .         but       carrot began .      that was an order .  i might not be any good for anything else  but i can bloody well order you to open the door  so open the door .      quirke was accompanied by half a dozen members of the day watch .  they had crossbows .  in deference to the fact that they were doing a mildly unpleasant job involving fellow officers  they had them pointing slightly downward .  in deference to the fact that they weren   t damn fools  they had the safety catches off .   quirke wasn   t actually a bad man .  he didn   t have the imagination .  he dealt more in that sort of generalized low grade unpleasantness which slightly tarnishes the soul of all who come into contact with it .   many people are in jobs that are a little beyond them  but there are ways of reacting to the situation .  sometimes they   re flustered and nice  sometimes they   re quirke .  quirke handled them with the maxim  it doesn   t matter if you   re right or wrong  so long as you   re definite .  there was  on the whole  no real racial prejudice in ankh morpork  when you   ve got dwarfs and trolls  the mere color of other humans is not a major item .  but quirke was the kind of man to whom it comes naturally to pronounce the word negro with two gs .   he had a hat with plumes in it .      come in  come in     said vimes .     it wasn   t as if we were doing anything .         captain vimes           it   s all right .  we know .  give him your weapons  people .  that   s an order  carrot .  one official issue sword  one pike or halberd  one night stick or truncheon  one crossbow .  that   s right  isn   t it  sergeant colon .         yessir .      carrot hesitated only a moment .      oh  well     he said .     my official sword is in the rack .         what   s that one in your belt .      carrot said nothing .  however  he shifted position slightly .  his biceps strained against the leather of his jerkin .      official sword .  right     said quirke .  he turned .  he was one of those people who would recoil from an assault on strength  but attack weakness without mercy .     where   s the gritsucker .     he said .     and the rock .         ah     said vimes     you are referring to those representative members of our fellow sapient races who have chosen to throw in their lots with the people of this city .         i mean the dwarf and the troll     said quirke .      haven   t the faintest idea     said vimes cheerfully .  it seemed to angua that he was drunk again  if people could get drunk on despair .      we dunno  sir     said colon .     haven   t seen    em all day .         probably fighting up in quarry lane with the rest of them     said quirke .     you can   t trust people of their type .  you ought to know that .      and it also seemed to angua that although words like halfpint and gritsucker were offensive  they were as terms of universal brotherhood compared to words like    people of their type    in the mouth of men like quirke .  much to her shock  she found her gaze concentrating on the man   s jugular vein .      fighting .     said carrot .     why .      quirke shrugged .      who knows .         let me think now     said vimes .     it could be something to do with a wrongful arrest .  it could be something to do with some of the more restless dwarfs just needing any excuse to have a go at the trolls .  what do you think  quirke .         i don   t think  vimes .         good man .  you   re just the type the city needs .      vimes stood up .      i   ll be going  then     he said .     i   ll see you all tomorrow .  if there is one .      the door slammed behind him .      this hall was huge .  it was the size of a city square  with pillars every few yards to support the roof .  tunnels radiated off it in every direction  and at various heights in the walls .  water trickled out of many of them  from small springs and underground streams .   that was the problem .  the film of running water over the stone floor of the hall had wiped away traces of the footprints .   a very large tunnel  almost blocked with debris and silt  led off in what cuddy was pretty sure was the direction of the estuary .   it was almost pleasant .  there was no smell  other than a damp  under a stone mustiness .  and it was cool .      i   ve seen big dwarf halls in the mountains     said cuddy     but i   ve got to admit this is something else .     his voice echoed back and forth in the chamber .      oh  yes     said detritus     it   s got to be something else  because it   s not a dwarf hall in the mountains .         can you see any way up .         no .         we could have passed a dozen ways to the surface and not known it .         yes     said the troll .     it   s a knotty problem .         detritus .         yes .         did you know you   re getting smarter again  down here in the cool .         really .         can you use it to think of a way out .         digging .     the troll suggested .   there were fallen blocks here and there in the tunnels .  not many  the place had been well built        nah .  haven   t got a shovel     said cuddy .   detritus nodded .      give me your breastplate     he said .   he leaned it up against the wall .  his fist pounded into it a few times .  he handed it back .  it was  more or less  shovel shaped .      it   s a long way up     cuddy said doubtfully .      but we know the way     said detritus .     it   s either that  or stay down here eating rat for rest of your life .      cuddy hesitated .  the idea had a certain appeal        without ketchup     detritus added .      i think i saw a fallen stone just a way back there     said the dwarf .      captain quirke looked around the watch room with the air of one who was doing the scenery a favor by glancing at it .      nice place  this     he said .     i think we   ll move in here .  better than the quarters near the palace .         but we   re here     said sergeant colon .      you   ll just have to squash up     said captain quirke .   he glanced at angua .  her stare was getting on his nerves .      there   ll be a few changes  too     he said .  behind him  the door creaked open .  a small  smelly dog limped in .      but lord vetinari hasn   t said who   s commanding night watch     said carrot .      ho  yes .  seems to me  seems to me     said quirke     that it   s not likely to be one of you lot  eh .  seems to me it   s likely the watches   ll be combined .  seems to me there   s too much sloppiness around the place .  seems to me there   s a bit too much of a ragtag .      he glanced at angua again .  the way she was looking at him was putting him off .      seems to me       quirke began again  and then noticed the dog .     look at this .     he said .     dogs in the watch house .     he kicked gaspode hard  and grinned as the dog ran yelping under the table .      what about lettice knibbs  the beggar girl .     said angua .     no troll killed her .  or the clown .         you got to see the big picture     said quirke .      mister captain     said a low voice from under the table  audible at a conscious level only to angua     you got an itchy bottom .         what big picture   s this  then .     said sergeant colon .      got to think in terms of the whole city     said quirke .  he shifted uneasily .      really itchy     said the sub table voice .      you feeling all right  captain quirke .     said angua .   the captain squirmed .      prickle  prickle  prickle     said the voice .      i mean  some things are important  some ain   t     said quirke .     aargh .         sorry .         prickle .         can   t hang around here talking to you all day     said quirke .     you .  report to .  me .  tomorrow afternoon           prickle  prickle  prickle           abouuut face .      the day watch scurried out  with quirke hopping and squirming in  as it were  the rear .      my word  he seemed anxious to get away     said carrot .      yes     said angua .     can   t think why .      they looked at one another .      is that it .     said carrot .     no more night watch .         it   s generally very quiet in the unseen university library .  there   s perhaps the shuffling of feet as wizards wander between the shelves  the occasional hacking cough to disturb the academic silence  and every once in a while a dying scream as an unwary student fails to treat an old magical book with the caution it deserves .   consider orangutans .   in all the worlds graced by their presence  it is suspected that they can talk but choose not to do so in case humans put them to work  possibly in the television industry .  in fact they can talk .  it   s just that they talk in orangutan .  humans are only capable of listening in bewilderment .   the librarian of unseen university had unilaterally decided to aid comprehension by producing an orangutan human dictionary .  he   d been working on it for three months .   it wasn   t easy .  he   d got as far as    oook .       he was down in the stacks  where it was cool .   and suddenly someone was singing .   he took the pen out of his foot and listened .   a human would have decided they couldn   t believe their ears .  orangs are more sensible .  if you won   t believe your own ears  whose ears will you believe .   someone was singing  underground .  or trying to sing .   the chthonic voices went something like this      dlog  glod  dlog  glod           listen  you   troll .  it   s the simplest song there is .  look  like this    gold  gold  gold  gold    .         gold  gold  gold  gold           no .  that   s the second verse .      there was also the rhythmical sound of dirt being shovelled and rubble being moved .   the librarian considered matters for a while .  so   a dwarf and a troll .  he preferred both species to humans .  for one thing  neither of them were great readers .  the librarian was  of course  very much in favor of reading in general  but readers in particular got on his nerves .  there was something  well  sacrilegious about the way they kept taking books off the shelves and wearing out the words by reading them .  he liked people who loved and respected books  and the best way to do that  in the librarian   s opinion  was to leave them on the shelves where nature intended them to be .   the muffled voices seemed to be getting closer .      gold  gold  gold           now you   re singing the chorus .      on the other hand  there were proper ways of entering a library .   he waddled over to the shelves and selected humptulip   s seminal work how to kille insects .  all       pages of it .      vimes felt quite light hearted as he walked up scoone avenue .  he was aware that there was an inner vimes screaming his head off .  he ignored him .   you couldn   t be a real copper in ankh morpork and stay sane .  you had to care .  and caring in ankh morpork was like opening a tin of meat in the middle of a piranha school .   everyone dealt with it in their own way .  colon never thought about it  and nobby didn   t worry about it  and the new ones hadn   t been in long enough to be worn down by it  and carrot   was just himself .   hundreds of people died in the city every day  often of suicide .  so what did a few more matter .   the vimes inside hammered on the walls .   there were quite a few coaches outside the ramkin mansion  and the place seemed to be infested with assorted female relatives and interchangeable emmas .  they were baking things and polishing things .  vimes strolled through  more or less unregarded .   he found sybil out in the dragon house  in her rubber boots and protective dragon armor .  she was mucking out  apparently blissfully unaware of the controlled uproar in the mansion .   she looked up as the door shut behind vimes .      oh  there you are .  you   re home early     she said .     i couldn   t stand the fuss  so i came out here .  but i   ll have to go and change soon        she stopped when she saw his expression .     there   s something wrong  isn   t there .         i   m not going back     said vimes .      really .  last week you said you   d do a full watch .  you said you were looking forward to it .      not much gets past old sybil  vimes thought .   she patted his hand .      i   m glad you   re out of it     she said .      corporal nobbs darted into the watch house and slammed the door behind him .      well .     said carrot .      it   s not good     said nobby .     they say the trolls are planning to march to the palace to get coalface out .  there   s gangs of dwarfs and trolls wandering around looking for trouble .  and beggars .  lettice was very popular .  and there   s a lot of guild people out there  too .  the city     he said  importantly     is def   nitely a keg of no .  i powder .         how do you like the idea of camping out on the open plain .     said colon .      what   s that got to do with it .         if anyone puts a match to anything tonight  it   s goodbye ankh     said the sergeant morosely .     usually we can shut the city gates  right .  but there   s hardly more   n a few feet of water in the river .         you flood the city just to put out fires .     said angua .      yep .         another thing     said nobby .     people threw stuff at me .      carrot had been staring at the wall .  now he produced a small  battered black book from his pocket  and started to thumb through the pages .      tell me     he said  in a slightly distant voice     has there been an irretrievable breakdown of law and order .         yeah .  for about five hundred years     said colon .     irretrievable breakdown of law   n   order is what ankh morpork is all about .         no  i mean more than usual .  it   s important .     carrot turned a page .  his lips moved silently as he read .      throwing stuff at me sounds like a breakdown in law and order     said nobby .   he was aware of their expressions .      i don   t think we could make that stick     said colon .      it stuck all right     said nobby     and some of it went down my shirt .         why throw things at you .     said angua .      it   s    cos i was a watchman     said nobby .     the dwarfs don   t like the watch    cos of mr .  hammerhock  and the trolls don   t like the watch    cos of coalface being arrested  and people don   t like the watch    cos of all these angry dwarfs and trolls around .      someone thumped at the door .      that   s probably an angry mob right now     said nobby .   carrot opened the door .      it   s not an angry mob     he announced .      ook .         it   s an orangutan carrying a stunned dwarf followed by a troll .  but he is quite angry  if that   s any help .         lady ramkin   s butler  willikins  had filled him a big bath .  hah .  tomorrow it   d be his butler  and his bath .   and this wasn   t one of the old hip baths  drag it in front of the fire jobs  no .  the ramkin mansion collected water off the roof into a big cistern  after straining out the pigeons  and then it was heated by an ancient geyser  and flowed along drumming  groaning lead pipes to a pair of mighty brass taps and then into an enamelled tub .  there were things laid out on a fluffy towel beside it   huge scrubbing brushes  three kinds of soap  a loofah .   willikins was standing patiently beside the bath  like a barely heated towel rail .      yes .     said vimes .      his lordship   that is  her ladyship   s father   he required to have his back scrubbed     said willikins .      you go and help the old geyser stoke the furnace     said vimes firmly .   left alone  he struggled out of his breastplate and threw it in the corner .  the chainmail shirt followed it  and the helmet  and the money pouch  and various leather and cotton oddments that came between a watchman and the world .   and then he sank  gingerly at first  into the suds .         try soap .  soap   ll work     said detritus .      hold still  will you .     said carrot .      you   re twisting my head off .         go on  soap him head .         soap your own head .      there was a thung noise and cuddy   s helmet came free .   cuddy emerged  blinking  into the light .  he focused on the librarian  and growled .      he hit me on the head .         oook .         he says you came up through the floor     said carrot .      that   s no reason to hit me on the head .         some of the things that come up through the floor at unseen university don   t even have a head     said carrot .      oook .         or they have hundreds .  why were you digging down there .         we weren   t digging down .  we were digging up        carrot sat and listened .  he interrupted only twice .      shot at you .         five time     said detritus  happily .     have to report damage to breastplate but not to backplate on account of fortunately my body got in way  saving valuable city property worth three dollars .      carrot listened some more .      sewers .     he said  eventually .      it   s like the whole city  underground .  we saw crowns and stuff carved on the walls .      carrot   s eyes sparkled .     that means they must date right back to the days when we had kings .  and then when we kept on rebuilding the city we forgot they were down there           um .  that   s not all that   s down there     said cuddy .     we   found something .         oh .         something bad .         you won   t like it at all     said detritus .     bad  bad  bad .  even worse .         we thought it would be best to leave it there     said cuddy     on account of it being evidence .  but you ought to see it .         it   s going to upset everything     said the troll  warming to the part .      what was it .         if we tell you  you say  stupid ethnic people  you pulling my leg off     said detritus .      so you   d better come and see     said cuddy .   sergeant colon looked at the rest of the watch .      all of us .     he said  nervously .     er .  shouldn   t a couple of senior officers stay up here .  in case anything happens .         do you mean in case anything happens up here .     said angua  tartly .     or in case anything happens down there .         i   ll go with lance constable cuddy and lance constable detritus     said carrot .     i don   t think anyone else ought to come .         but it could be dangerous .     said angua .      if i find who   s been shooting at watchmen     said carrot     it will be .         samuel vimes reached up with a big toe and turned on the hot tap .   there was a respectful knock at the door  and willikins old retainer   d in .      would sir be wanting anything .      vimes thought about it .      lady ramkin said you wouldn   t be wanting any alcohol     said willikins  as if reading his thoughts .      did she .         emphatically  sir .  but i have here a very fine cigar .      he winced as vimes bit the end off and spat it over the side of the bath  but produced some matches and lit it for him .      thank you  willikins .  what   s your first name .         first name  sir .         i mean  what do people call you when they   ve got to know you better .         willikins  sir .         oh  right  then .  well .  you may go  willikins .         yes  sir .      vimes lay back in the warm water .  the inner voice was still in there somewhere  but he tried not to pay any attention .  about now  it was saying  you   d be proceeding along the street of small gods  just by the bit of old city wall where you could stop and smoke a rollup out of the wind     to drown it out  he started to sing at the top of his voice .      the cavernous sewers under the city echoed with human and near human voices for the first time in millennia .      hi ho              hi ho           oook oook oook oook ook           you all stupid .         i can   t help it .  it   s my nearly dwarfish blood .  we just like singing underground .  it comes naturally to us .         all right  but why him singing .  him ape .         he   s a people person .      they   d brought torches .  shadows jumped among the pillars in the big cavern  and fled along the tunnels .  whatever the possible lurking dangers  carrot was beside himself with the joy of discovery .      it   s amazing .  the via cloaca is mentioned in some old book i read  but everyone thought it was a lost street .  superb workmanship .  lucky for you the river was so low .  it looks as though these are normally full of water .         that   s what i said     said cuddy .     full of water  i said .      he glanced cautiously at the dancing shadows  which made weird and worrying shapes on the far wall   strange biped animals  eldritch underground things     carrot sighed .      stop making shadow pictures  detritus .         oook .         what him say .         he said    do deformed rabbit  it   s my favorite        carrot translated .   rats rustled in the darkness .  cuddy peered around .  he kept imagining figures  back there  sighting along some kind of pipe     there were a disturbing few moments when he lost sight of the tracks on the wet stone  but he picked them up again near a mold hung wall .  and then  there was the particular pipe .  he   d made a scratch on the stones .      it   s not far along     he said  handing carrot the torch .   carrot disappeared .   they heard his footsteps in the mud  and then a whistle of surprise  and then silence for a while .   carrot reappeared .      my word     he said .     you two know who this is .         it looks like       cuddy began .      it looks like trouble     said carrot .      you see why we didn   t bring it back up .     said cuddy .     carrying a human   s corpse through the streets right now would not be a good idea  i thought .  especially this one .         i thought some of that  too     detritus volunteered .      right enough     said carrot .     well done  men .  i think we   d better   leave it for now  and come back with a sack later on .  and   don   t tell anyone else .         except the sergeant and everyone     said cuddy .      no   not even them .  it   d make everyone very   jumpy .         just as you say  corporal carrot .         we   re dealing with a sick mind here  men .      underground light dawned on cuddy .      ah     he said .     you suspect corporal nobbs  sir .         this is worse .  come on  let   s get back up .     he looked back toward the big pillar barred cavern .     any idea where we are  cuddy .         could be under the palace  sir .         that   s what i reckoned .  of course  the tunnels go everywhere        carrot   s worried train of thought faltered away on some distant track .   there was water in the sewers  even in this drought .  springs flowed into them  or water filtered down from far above .  everywhere was the drip and splash of water .  and cool  cool air .   it would almost be pleasant were it not for the sad  hunched corpse of someone that looked for all the world like beano the clown .      vimes dried himself off .  willikins had also laid out a dressing gown with brocade on the sleeves .  he put it on  and wandered into his dressing room .   that was another new thing .  the rich even had rooms for dressing in  and clothes to wear while you went into the dressing rooms to get dressed .   fresh clothes had been laid out for him .  tonight there was something dashing in red and yellow        about now he   d be patrolling treacle mine road        and a hat .  it had a feather in it .   vimes dressed himself  and even wore the hat .  and he seemed quite normal and composed  until you realized that he avoided meeting his own gaze in the mirror .      the watch sat around the big table in the guardroom and in deep gloom .  they were off duty .  they   d never really been off duty before .      what say we have a game of cards .     said nobby  brightly .  he produced a greasy pack from somewhere in the noisome recesses of his uniform .      you won everyone   s wages off them yesterday     said sergeant colon .      now   s the chance to win    em back  then .         yeah  but there were five kings in your hand  nobby .      nobby shuffled the cards .         s   funny  that     he said     there   s kings everywhere  when you look .         there certainly is if you look up your sleeve .         no  i mean  there   s kings way in ankh  and kings in cards  and we get the king   s shilling when we join up     said nobby .     we got kings all over the place except on that gold throne in the palace .  i   ll tell you   there wouldn   t be all this trouble around the place if we had a king .      carrot was staring at the ceiling  his eyebrows locked in concentration .  detritus was counting on his fingers .      oh  yes     said sergeant colon .     beer   d be a penny a pint  the trees   d bloom again .  oh  yeah .  every time someone stubs a toe in this town  turns out it wouldn   t have happened if there   d been a king .  vimes   d go spare to hear you talk like that .         people   d listen to a king  though     said nobby .      vimes   d say that   s the trouble     said colon .     it   s like that thing of his about using magic .  that stuff makes him angry .         how you get king inna first place .     said detritus .      someone sawed up a stone     said colon .      hah .  anti siliconism .         nah  someone pulled a sword out of a stone     said nobby .      how   d he know it was in there  then .     colon demanded .      it   it was sticking out  wasn   t it .         where anyone could   ve grabbed it .  in this town .         only the rightful king could do it  see     said nobby .      oh  right     said colon .     i understand .  oh  yes .  so what you   re saying is  someone   d decided who the rightful king was before he pulled it out .  sounds like a fix to me .  prob   ly someone had a fake hollow stone and some dwarf inside hanging on the other end with a pair of pliers until the right guy came along        a fly bounced on the window pane for a while  then zigzagged across the room and settled on a beam  where cuddy   s idly thrown axe cut it in half .      you got no soul  fred     said nobby .     i wouldn   t   ve minded being a knight in shining armor .  that   s what a king does if you   re useful .  he makes you a knight .         a night watchman in crappy armor is about your m  tier     said colon  who looked around proudly to see if anyone had noticed the slanty thing over the e .     nah  catch me being respectful to some bloke because he just pulled a sword out of a stone .  that don   t make you a king .  mind you     he said     someone who could shove a sword into a stone   a man like that  now  he   s a king .         a man like that   d be an ace     said nobby .   angua yawned .   ding ding a ding ding        what the hell   s that .     said colon .   carrot   s chair thumped forward .  he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a velvet bag  which he upended on to the table .  out slid a golden disc about three inches across .  when he pressed a catch on one side it opened like a clamshell .   the stopped watch peered at it .      it   s a clock .     said angua .      a watch     said carrot .      it   s very big .         that   s because of the clockwork .  there has to be room for all the little wheels .  the small watches just have those little time demons in and they don   t last and anyway they keep rotten time        ding ding a ding ding  ding dingle ding ding        and it plays a tune .     said angua .      every hour     said carrot .     it   s part of the clockwork .      ding .  ding .  ding .      and it chimes the hours afterwards     said carrot .      it   s slow  then     said sergeant colon .     all the others just struck  you couldn   t miss    em .         my cousin jorgen makes ones like these     said cuddy .     they keep better time than demons or water clocks or candles .  or those big pendulum things .         there   s a spring and wheels     said carrot .      the important bit     said cuddy  taking an eyeglass from somewhere in his beard and examining the watch carefully     is a little rocking thingummy that stops the wheels from going too fast .         how does it know if they   re going too fast .     said angua .      it   s kind of built in     said cuddy .     don   t understand it much myself .  what   s this inscription here        he read it aloud .         a watch from  your old freinds in the watch    .         it   s a play on words     said carrot .   there was a long  embarrassed silence .      um .  i chipped in a few dollars each from you new recruits     he added  blushing .     i mean   you can pay me back when you like .  if you want to .  i mean   you   d be bound to be friends .  once you got to know him .      the rest of the watch exchanged glances .   he could lead armies  angua thought .  he really could .  some people have inspired whole countries to great deeds because of the power of their vision .  and so could he .  not because he dreams about marching hordes  or world domination  or an empire of a thousand years .  just because he thinks that everyone   s really decent underneath and would get along just fine if only they made the effort  and he believes that so strongly it burns like a flame which is bigger than he is .  he   s got a dream and we   re all part of it  so that it shapes the world around him .  and the weird thing is that no one wants to disappoint him .  it   d be like kicking the biggest puppy in the universe .  it   s a kind of magic .      the gold   s rubbing off     said cuddy .     but it   s a good watch     he added quickly .      i was hoping we could give it to him tonight     said carrot .     and all go out for a   drink           not a good idea     said angua .      leave it until tomorrow     said colon .     we   ll form a guard of honor at the wedding .  that   s traditional .  everyone holds their swords up in a kind of arch .         we   ve only got one sword between us     said carrot glumly .   they all stared at the floor .      it   s not fair     said angua .     i don   t care who stole whatever they stole from the assassins  but he was right to try to find out who killed mr .  hammerhock .  and no one cares about lettice knibbs .         i like to find out who shoot me     said detritus .      beats me why anyone   d be daft enough to steal from the assassins     said carrot .     that   s what captain vimes said .  he said you   d have to be a fool to think of breaking into that place .      they stared at the floor again .      like a clown or a jester .     said detritus .      detritus  he didn   t mean a cap and bells fool     said carrot  in a kindly voice .     he just meant you   d have to be some sort of idi        he stopped .  he stared at the ceiling .      oh  my     he said .     it   s as simple as that .         simple as what .     said angua .   someone hammered at the door .  it wasn   t a polite knock .  it was the thumping of someone who was either going to have the door opened for them or break it down .   a guard stumbled into the room .  half his armor was off and he had a black eye  but he was just recognizable as skully muldoon of the day watch .   colon helped him up .      been in a fight  skully .      skully looked up at detritus  and whimpered .      the buggers attacked the watch house .         who .         them .      carrot patted him on the shoulder .      this isn   t a troll     he said .     this is lance constable detritus   don   t salute .  trolls attacked the day watch .         they   re chucking cobbles .         you can   t trust    em     said detritus .      who .     said skully .      trolls .  nasty pieces of work in my opinion     said detritus  with all the conviction of a troll with a badge .     they need keeping a eye on .         what   s happened to quirke .     said carrot .      i don   t know .  you lot have got to do something .         we   re stood down     said colon .     official .         don   t give me that .         ah     said carrot  brightly .  he pulled a stub of pencil out of his pocket and made a little tick in his black book .     you still got that little house in easy street  sergeant muldoon .         what .  what .  yes .  what about it .         is the rent worth more than a farthing a month .      muldoon stared at him with his one operating eye .      are you simple or what .      carrot gave him a big smile .     that   s right  sergeant muldoon .  is it  though .  worth a farthing  would you say .         there   s dwarfs running around the streets looking for a fight and you want to know about property prices .         a farthing .         don   t be daft .  it   s worth at least five dollars a month .         ah     said carrot  ticking the book again .     that   d be inflation  of course .  and i expect you   ve got a cooking pot   do you own at least two and one third acres and more than half a cow .         all right  all right     said muldoon .     it   s some kind of joke  right .         i think probably the property qualification can be waived     said carrot .     it says here that it can be waived for a citizen in good standing .  finally  has there been  in your opinion  an irreparable breakdown of law and order in the city .         they turned over throat dibbler   s barrow and made him eat two of his sausages inna bun .         oh  i say .     said colon .      without mustard .         i think we can call that a yes     said carrot .  he ticked the page again  and closed the book with a definite snap .      we   d better be going     he said .      we were told       colon began .      according to the laws and ordinances of ankh morpork     said carrot     any residents of the city  in times of the irreparable breakdown of law and order  shall  at the request of an officer of the city who is a citizen in good standing   there   s a lot of stuff here about property and stuff  and then it goes on   form themselves into a militia for city defense .         what does that mean .     said angua .      militia       mused sergeant colon .      hang on  you can   t do that .     said muldoon .     that   s nonsense .         it   s the law .  never been repealed     said carrot .      we   ve never had a militia .  never needed one .         until now  i think .         now look here     said muldoon     you come back with me to the palace .  you   re men of the watch           and we   re going to defend the city     said carrot .      people were streaming past the watch house .  carrot stopped a couple by the simple expedient of sticking out his hand .      mr .  poppley  isn   t it .     he said .     how   s the grocery business .  hello  mrs .  poppley .         ain   t you heard .     said the flustered man .     the trolls have set fire to the palace .      he followed carrot   s gaze up broad way  to where the palace stood squat and dark in the early evening light .  ungovernable flames failed to billow from every window .      my word     said carrot .      and there   s dwarfs breaking windows and everything .     said the grocer .     a dog   s not safe .         you can   t trust    em     said cuddy .   the grocer stared at him .     are you a dwarf .     he said .      amazing .  how do people do it     said cuddy .      well  i   m off .  i   m not stopping to see mrs .  poppley ravished by the little devils .  you know what they say about dwarfs .      the watch watched the couple head off into the crowd again .      well  i don   t     said cuddy  to no one in particular .     what is it they say about dwarfs .      carrot fielded a man pushing a barrow .      would you mind telling me what   s going on  sir .     he said .      and do you know what it is they say about dwarfs .     said a voice behind him .      that   s not a sir  that   s throat     said colon .     and will you look at the color of him .         should he be all shiny like that .     said detritus .      feeling fine .  feeling fine .     said dibbler .     hah .  so much for people importuning the standard of my merchandise .         what   s happening  throat .     said colon .      they say       dibbler began  green in the face .      who says .     said carrot .      they say     said dibbler .     you know .  they .  everyone .  they say the trolls have killed someone up at dolly sisters and the dwarfs have smashed up chalky the troll   s all night pottery and they   ve broken down the brass bridge and        carrot looked up the road .      you just came over the brass bridge     he said .      yeah  well   that   s what they say     said dibbler .      oh  i see .     carrot straightened up .      did they happen to say   sort of  in passing   anything else about dwarfs .     said cuddy .      i think we   re going to have to go and have a word with the day watch about the arrest of coalface     carrot said .      we ain   t got no weapons     said colon .      i   m certain coalface has nothing to do with the murder of hammerhock     said carrot .     we are armed with the truth .  what can harm us if we are armed with the truth .         well  a crossbow bolt can  e . g .   go right through your eye and out the back of your head     said sergeant colon .      all right  sergeant     said carrot     so where do we get some more weapons .         the bulk of the armory loomed against the sunset .   it was strange to find an armory in a city which relied on deceit  bribery and assimilation to defeat its enemies but  as sergeant colon said  once you   d won their weapons off    em you needed somewhere to store the things .   carrot rapped on the door .  after a while there were footsteps  and a small window slid back .  a suspicious voice said     yes .         corporal carrot  city militia .         never heard of it .  bugger off .      the hatch snapped back .  carrot heard nobby snigger .   he thumped on the door again .      yes .         i   m corporal carrot       the hatch moved  but hit carrot   s truncheon as he rammed it in the hole .        and i   m here to collect some arms for my men .         yeah .  where   s your authority .         what .  but i   m        the truncheon was knocked away and the hatch thudded into place .         scuse me     said corporal nobbs  pushing past .     let me have a go .  i   ve been here before  sort of thing .      he kicked the door with his steel capped boots  known and feared wherever men were on the floor and in no position to fight back .   snap .     i told you to bug           auditors     said nobby .   there was a moment   s silence .      what .         here to take inventory .         where   s your auth           oh .  oh .  he says where   s my authority .     nobby leered at the guards .     oh .  keeps me hanging around here while his cronies can nip out the back to bring the stuff back out of hock  eh .         i nev           and  and then  yeah  we   ll get the old thousand swords trick  yeah .  fifty crates stacked up  turns out the bottom forty are full of rocks .         i           what   s your name  mister .         i           you open this door right now .      the hatch shut .  there was a sound of bolts being pulled back by someone who was not at all convinced it was a good idea and would be asking searching questions in a minute .      got a piece of paper on you  fred .  quick .         yes  but       said sergeant colon .      any paper .  now .      colon fumbled in his pocket and handed nobby his grocery bill just as the door opened .  nobby swaggered in at high speed  forcing the man inside to walk backward .      don   t run off .     he shouted     i haven   t found anything wrong           i wasn   t r              yet .      carrot had time to get an impression of a cavernous place full of complicated shadows .  apart from the man  who was fatter than colon  there were a couple of trolls who appeared to be operating a grindstone .  current events did not seem to have penetrated the thick walls .      all right  no one panic  just stop what you   re doing  stop what you   re doing  please .  i   m corporal nobbs  ankh morpork city ordnance inspection city audit       the piece of paper was waved in front of the man   s eyes at vision blurring speed  and nobby   s voice faltered a bit as he contemplated the end of the sentence        bureau   special   audit   inspection .  how many people work here .         just me        nobby pointed at the trolls .      what about them .      the man spat on the floor .      oh  i thought you said people .      carrot stuck out his hand automatically and it slammed against detritus    breastplate .      ok     said nobby     let   s see what we   ve got here       he walked fast along the racks  so that everyone else had to run to keep up .     what   s this .         er           don   t know  eh .         sure   it   s   it   s           a triple stringed       lb .  carriage mounted siege crossbow with the double action windlass .         right .         isn   t this a klatchian reinforced crossbow with the goat leg cocking mechanism and the underhaft bayonet .         er   yeah .      nobby gave it a cursory examination  and then tossed it aside .   the rest of the night watch looked on in astonishment .  nobby had never been known to wield any weapon beyond a knife .      have you got one of those hershebian twelve shot bows with the gravity feed .     he snapped .      eh .  what you see is what we got  mister .      nobby pulled a hunting crossbow from its rack .  his skinny arms twanged as he hauled on the cocking lever .      sold the bolts for this thing .         they   re right there .      nobby selected one from the shelf and dropped it into its slot .  then he sighted along the shaft .  he turned .      i like this inventory     said nobby .     we   ll take it all .      the man looked down the sights at nobby   s eye and  to angua   s horrified admiration  didn   t faint .      that little bow don   t scare me     he said .      this little bow scare you .     said nobby .     no .  right .  this is a little bow .  a little bow like this wouldn   t scare a man like you  because it   s such a little bow .  it   d need a bigger bow than this to scare a man like you .      angua would have given a month   s pay to see the quartermaster   s face from the front .  she   d watched as detritus had lifted down the siege bow  cocked it with one hand and a barely audible grunt  and stepped forward .  now she could imagine the eyeballs swivelling as the coldness of the metal penetrated the back of the armorer   s fleshy red neck .      now  the one behind you  that   s a big bow     said nobby .   it wasn   t as if the six foot iron arrow was sharp .  it was supposed to smash through doorways  not do surgery .      can i pull the trigger yet .     detritus rumbled  into the man   s ear .      you wouldn   t dare fire that thing in here .  that   s a siege weapon .  it   d go right through the wall .         eventually     said nobby .      what this bit for .     said detritus .      now  look           i hope you keep that thing maintained     said nobby .     them things were a bugger for metal fatigue .  especially on the safety catch .         what are a safety catch .     said detritus .   everything went quiet .   carrot found his voice  a long way off .      corporal nobbs .         yessir .         i   ll take over from this point  if you don   t mind .      he gently pushed the siege bow away  but detritus hadn   t liked the crack about people and it kept swinging back again .      now     said carrot     i don   t like this element of coercion .  we   re not here to bully this poor man .  he   s a city employee  just like us .  it   s very wrong of you to put him in fear .  why not just ask .         sorry  sir     said nobby .   carrot patted the armorer on the shoulder .      may we take some weapons .     he said .      what .         some weapons .  for official purposes .      the armorer looked unable to cope with this .      you mean i got a choice .     he said .      why  certainly .  we practice policing by consent in ankh morpork .  if you feel unable to agree to our request  you only have to say the word .      there was a faint bong as the tip of the iron arrow once again bounced on the back of the armorer   s skull .  he sought in vain for something to say  because the only word he could think of right now was    fire .         uh     he said .     uh .  yeah .  right .  sure .  take what you want .         fine  fine .  and sergeant colon will give you a receipt  adding of course that you release the weapons of your own free will .         my own free will .         you have absolute choice in the matter  of course .      the man   s face screwed up in the effort of desperate cogitation .      i reckon           yes .         i reckon it   s ok for you to take    em .  take    em right away .         good man .  do you have a trolley .         and do you happen to know what it is they say about dwarfs .     said cuddy .   it crept over angua once again that carrot had no irony in his soul .  he meant every word .  if the man had really held out  carrot would probably have given in .  of course  there was a bit of a gap between probably and certainly .   nobby was down the end of the row  occasionally squeaking with delight as he found an interesting war hammer or an especially evil looking glaive .  he was trying to hold everything  all at once .   then he dropped the lot and ran forward .      oh  wow .  a klatchian fire engine .  this is more my meteor .      they heard him rummaging around in the gloom .  he emerged pushing a sort of bin on small squeaky wheels .  it had various handles and fat leathery bags  and a nozzle at the front .  it looked like a very large kettle .      the leather   s been kept greased  too .         what is it .     said carrot .      and there   s oil in the reservoir .     nobby pumped a handle energetically .     last i heard  this thing had been banned in eight countries and three religions said they   d excommunicate any soldiers found using it .   anyone got a light .         here     said carrot     but what   s           watch .      nobby lit a match  applied it to the tube at the front of the device  and pulled a lever .   they put out the flames eventually .      needs a bit of adjustment     said nobby  through his mask of soot .      no     said carrot .  for the rest of his life he   d remember the jet of fire scorching his face en route to the opposite wall .      but it   s           no .  it   s too dangerous .         it   s meant to be           i mean it could hurt people .         ah     said nobby     right .  you should have said .  we   re after weapons that don   t hurt people  right .         corporal nobbs .     said sergeant colon  who   d been even closer to the flame than carrot .      yes  sarge .         you heard corporal carrot .  no heathen weapons .  anyway  how come you know so much about all this stuff .         milit   ry service .         really  nobby .     said carrot .      had a special job  sir .  very responsible .         and what was that .         quartermaster  sir     said nobby  saluting smartly .      you were a quartermaster .     said carrot .     in whose army .         duke of pseudopolis  sir .         but pseudopolis always lost its wars .         ah   well           who did you sell the weapons to .         that   s a slander  that is .  they just used to spend a lot of time away for polishing and sharpening .         nobby  this is carrot talking to you .  how much time  approximately .         approximately .  oh .  about a hundred percent  if we   re talking approximately  sir .         nobby .         sir .         you don   t have to call me sir .         yessir .      in the end  cuddy remained faithful to his axe  but added a couple more as an afterthought  sergeant colon chose a pike because the thing about a pike  the important thing  was that everything happened at the other end of it  i . e .   a long way off  lance constable angua selected  without much enthusiasm  a short sword  and corporal nobbs        corporal nobbs was a kind of mechanical porcupine of blades  bows  points and knobbly things on the end of chains .      you sure  nobby .     said carrot .     there   s nothing you want to leave .         it   s so hard to choose  sir .      detritus was hanging on to his huge bow .      that all you   re taking  detritus .         no sir .  taking flint and morraine  sir .      the two trolls who had been working in the armory had formed up behind detritus .      swore    em in  sir     said detritus .     used troll oath .      flint saluted amateurishly .      he said he   d kick our goohuloog heads in if we didn   t join up and do what we   re told  sir     he said .      very old troll oath     said detritus .     very famous  very traditional .         one of    em could carry the klatchian fire engine       nobby began hopefully .      no  nobby .  well   welcome to the watch  men .         corporal carrot .         yes  cuddy .         it   s not fair .  they   re trolls .         we need every man we can get  cuddy .      carrot stood back .     now  we don   t want people to think we   re looking for trouble     he said .      oh  dressed like this  sir  we won   t have to look for trouble     said sergeant colon despondently .      question  sir .     said angua .      yes  lance constable angua .         who   s the enemy .         looking like this  we won   t have any problem finding enemies     said sergeant colon .      we   re not looking for enemies  we   re looking for information     said carrot .     the best weapon we can use right now is the truth  and to start with  we   re going to the fools    guild to find out why brother beano stole the gonne .         did he steal the gonne .         i think he may have  yes .         but he died before the gonne was stolen .     said colon .      yes     said carrot .     i know that .         now that     said colon     is what i calls an alibi .      the squad formed up and  after a brief discussion among the trolls as to which was their left foot and which was their right  marched away .  nobby kept looking back longingly to the fire machine .   sometimes it   s better to light a flamethrower than curse the darkness .      ten minutes later they   d pushed through the crowds and were outside the guilds .      see .     carrot said .      they back on to each other     said nobby .     so what .  there   s still a wall between them .         i   m not so sure     said carrot .     we   ll jolly well find out .         have we got time .     said angua .     i thought we were going to see the day watch .         there   s something i must find out first     said carrot .     the fools haven   t told me the truth .         hang on a minute  hang on a minute     said sergeant colon .     this is going altogether just a bit too far by half .  look  i don   t want us to kill anyone  right .  i happen to be sergeant around here  if anyone   s interested .  understand  carrot .  nobby .  no shooting or swordplay .  it   s bad enough barging into guild property  but we   ll get into really serious trouble if we shoot anyone .  lord vetinari won   t stop at sarcasm .  he might use      colon swallowed      irony .  so that   s an order .  what do you want to do  anyway .         i just want people to tell me things     said carrot .      well  if they don   t  you   re not to hurt them     said colon .     look  you can ask questions  fair enough .  but if dr .  whiteface starts getting difficult  we   re to come away  right .  clowns give me the creeps .  and he   s worst of all .  if he won   t answer  we   re to leave peacefully and  oh  i don   t know  think of something else .  that   s an order  like i said .  are you clear about this .  it   s an order .         if he won   t answer my questions     said carrot     i   m to leave peacefully .  right .         so long as that   s understood .      carrot knocked on the fools    door  reached up  caught the custard pie as it emerged from the slot and rammed it back hard .  then he kicked the door so that it swung inward a few inches .   someone behind it said    ow .      the door opened a bit further to reveal a small clown covered in whitewash and custard .      you didn   t have to do that     he said .      i just wanted to get into the spirit of the thing     said carrot .     i   m corporal carrot and this is the citizens    militia  and we all enjoy a good laugh .            scuse me           except for lance constable cuddy .  and lance constable detritus enjoys a good laugh too  although some minutes after everyone else .  and we   re here to see dr .  whiteface .      the clown   s hair rose .  water squirted from his buttonhole .      have   have you got an appointment .     he said .      i don   t know     said carrot .     have we got an appointment .         i   ve got an iron ball with spikes on     nobby volunteered .      that   s a morningstar  nobby .         is it .         yes     said carrot .     an appointment is an engagement to see someone  while a morningstar is a large lump of metal used for viciously crushing skulls .  it is important not to confuse the two  isn   t it  mr .     .     he raised his eyebrows .      boffo  sir .  but           so if you could perhaps run along and tell dr .  whiteface we   re here with an iron ball with spi   what am i saying .  i mean  without an appointment to see him .  please .  thank you .      the clown scuttled off .      there     said carrot .     was that all right  sergeant .         he   s probably going to be satirical  even     said colon  morosely .   they waited .  after a while lance constable cuddy took a screwdriver from his pocket and inspected the custard pie throwing machine bolted to the door .  the rest of them shuffled their feet  except for nobby  who kept dropping things on his .   boffo reappeared  flanked by two muscular jesters who didn   t look as though they had a sense of humor at all .      dr .  whiteface says there   s no such thing as a city militia     he ventured .     but .  um .  dr .  whiteface says  if it   s really important he   ll see some of you .  but not the trolls or the dwarf .  we heard there   s gangs of trolls and dwarfs terrorizing the city .         dat   s what they say     said detritus  nodding .      incidentally  do you know what it is they       cuddy began  but nobby nudged him into silence .      you and me  sergeant .     said carrot .     and you  lance constable angua .         oh dear     said sergeant colon .   but they followed carrot into the somber buildings and along the gloomy corridors to dr .  whiteface   s office .  the chief of all the clowns  fools and jesters was standing in the middle of the floor  while a jester tried to sew extra sequins on his coat .      well .            evening  doctor     said carrot .      i should like to make it clear that lord vetinari will be hearing about this directly     said dr .  whiteface .      oh  yes .  i shall tell him     said carrot .      i can   t imagine why you   re bothering me when there   s rioting in the streets .         ah  well   we shall deal with that later .  but captain vimes always told me  sir  that there   s big crimes and little crimes .  sometimes the little crimes look big and the big crimes you can hardly see  but the crucial thing is to decide which is which .      they stared at one another .      well .     the clown demanded .      i should like you to tell me     said carrot     about events in this guild house the night before last .      dr .  whiteface stared at him in silence .   then he said     if i don   t .         then     said carrot     i am afraid i shall  with extreme reluctance  be forced to carry out the order i was given just before entering .      he glanced at colon .     that   s right  isn   t it  sergeant .         what .  eh .  well  yes           i would much prefer not to do so  but i have no choice     said carrot .   dr .  whiteface glared at the two of them .      but this is guild property .  you have no right to   to           i don   t know about that  i   m only a corporal     said carrot .     but i   ve never disobeyed a direct order yet  and i am sorry to have to tell you that i will carry out this one fully and to the letter .         now  see here        carrot moved a little closer .      if it   s any comfort  i   ll probably be ashamed about it     he said .   the clown stared into his honest eyes and saw  as did everyone  only simple truth .      listen .  if i shout     said dr .  whiteface  going red under his makeup     i can have a dozen men in here .         believe me     said carrot     that will only make it easier for me to obey .      dr .  whiteface prided himself on his ability to judge character .  in carrot   s resolute expression there was nothing but absolute  meticulous honesty .  he fiddled with a quill pen and then threw it down in a sudden movement .      confound it .     he shouted .     how did you find out  eh .  who told you .         i really couldn   t say     said carrot .     but it makes sense anyway .  there   s only one entrance to each guild  but the guild houses are back to back .  someone just had to cut through the wall .         i assure you we didn   t know about it     said the clown .   sergeant colon was lost in admiration .  he   d seen people bluff on a bad hand  but he   d never seen anyone bluff with no cards .      we thought it was just a prank     said the clown .     we thought young beano had just done it with humorous intent  and then he turned up dead and we didn   t           you   d better show me the hole     said carrot .      the rest of the watch stood to variations on the theme of at ease in the courtyard .      corporal nobbs .         yes  lance constable cuddy .         what is it everyone says about dwarfs .         oh  come on  you   re pulling my leg  right .  everyone knows that who knows anything about dwarfs     said nobby .   cuddy coughed .      dwarfs don   t     he said .      what do you mean  dwarfs don   t .         no one   s told us what everyone knows about dwarfs     said cuddy .      well   i expect they thought you knew     said nobby  weakly .      not me .         oh  all right     said nobby .  he glanced at the trolls  then leaned across to cuddy and whispered in the approximate region of his ear .   cuddy nodded .      oh  is that all .         yes .  er   is it true .         what .  oh  yes .  of course .  it   s nat   ral for a dwarf .  some have got more than others  of course .         that   s the case all round     said nobby .      i myself  for example  have saved more than seventy eight dollars .         no .  i mean  no .  i mean  i don   t mean well endowed with money .  i mean       nobby whispered again .  cuddy   s expression didn   t change .   nobby waggled his eyebrows .     true  is it .         how should i know .  i don   t know how much money humans generally have .      nobby subsided .      there   s one thing that   s true at least     he said .     you dwarfs really love gold  don   t you .         of course we don   t .  don   t be silly .         well           we just say that to get it into bed .         it was in a clown   s bedroom .  colon had occasionally wondered what clowns did in private  and it was all here   the overlarge shoe tree  the very wide trouser press  the mirror with all the candles round it  some industrial sized sticks of make up   and a bed which looked like nothing more complicated than a blanket on the floor  because that   s what it was .  clowns and fools weren   t encouraged to live the soft life .  humor was a serious business .   there was also a hole in the wall  just big enough to admit a man .  a little pile of crumbling bricks was heaped next to it .   there was darkness on the other side .   on the other side  people killed other people for money .   carrot stuck his head and shoulders through the hole  but colon tried to pull him back .      hang on  lad  you don   t know what horrors lie beyond these walls           i   m just having a look to find out .         it could be a torture chamber or a dungeon or a hideous pit or anything .         it   s just a student   s bedroom  sergeant .         you see .      carrot stepped through .  they could hear him moving around in the gloom .  it was assassin   s gloom  somehow richer and less gloomy than clown   s gloom .   he poked his head through again .      no one   s been in here for a while  though     he said .     there   s dust all over the floor but there   s footprints in it .  and the door   s locked and bolted .  on this side .      the rest of his body followed carrot .      i just want to make sure i fully understand this     he said to dr .  whiteface .     beano made a hole into the assassins    guild  yes .  and then he went and exploded that dragon .  and then he came back through this hole .  so how did he get killed .         by the assassins  surely     said dr .  whiteface .     they   d be within their rights .  trespass on guild property is a very serious offense  after all .         did anyone see beano after the explosion .     said carrot .      oh yes .  boffo was on gate duty and he distinctly remembers him going out .         he knows it was him .      dr .  whiteface looked blank .      of course .         how .         how .  he recognized him  of course .  that   s how you know who people are .  you look at them and you say   that   s him .  that   s called re cog nit ion     said the clown  with pointed deliberation .     it was beano .  boffo said he looked very worried .         ah .  fine .  no more questions  doctor .  did beano have any friends among the assassins .         well   possibly  possibly .  we don   t discourage visitors .      carrot stared at the clown   s face .  then he smiled .      of course .  well  that about wraps it all up  i think .         if only he   d stuck to something  you know  original     said dr .  whiteface .      like a bucket of whitewash over the door  or a custard pie .     said sergeant colon .      that   s right .         well  we might as well be going     said carrot .     i imagine you don   t want to lay a complaint about the assassins .      dr .  whiteface tried to look panicky  but this did not work very well under a mouth painted into a wide grin .      what .  no .  i mean   if an assassin broke into our guild  i mean  not on proper business  and stole something  well  we   d definitely consider we were within our rights to  well           pour jelly into his shirt .     said angua .      hit him around the head with a bladder on a stick .     said colon .      possibly .         each guild to their own  of course     said carrot .     i suggest we might as well be going  sergeant .  nothing more for us to do here .  sorry to have troubled you  dr .  whiteface .  i can see this must have been a great strain on you .      the clown was limp with relief .      don   t mention it .  don   t mention it .  happy to help .  i know you have your job to do .      he ushered them down the stairs and into the courtyard  bubbling with small talk now .  the rest of the watch clanked to attention .      actually       said carrot  just as he was being ushered out of the gate     there is one thing you could do .         of course  of course .         um  i know it   s a bit cheeky     said carrot     but i   ve always been very interested in guild customs   so   do you think someone could show me your museum .         sorry .  what museum .         the clown museum .         oh  you mean the hall of faces .  that   s not a museum .  of course .  nothing secret about it .  boffo  make a note .  we   d be happy to show you around any time  corporal .         thank you very much  dr .  whiteface .         any time .         i   m just going off duty     said carrot .     right now would be nice .  since i happen to be here .         you can   t go off duty when   ow .     said colon .      sorry  sergeant .         you kicked me .         i accidentally trod on your sandal  sergeant .  i   m sorry .      colon tried to see a message in carrot   s face .  he   d got used to simple carrot .  complicated carrot was as unnerving as being savaged by a duck .      we   ll  er  we   ll just be going  then  shall we .     he said .      no point in staying here now it   s all settled     said carrot  mugging furiously .     may as well take the night off  really .      he glanced at the rooftops .      oh  well  now it   s all settled we   ll be off  right     said colon .     right  nobby .         oh  yeah  we   ll be off all right  because it   s all settled     said nobby .     you hear that  cuddy .         what  that it   s all settled .     said cuddy .     oh  yeah .  we might as well be off .  ok  detritus .      detritus was staring moodily at nothing with his knuckles resting on the ground .  this was a normal stance for a troll while waiting for the next thought to arrive .   the syllables of his name kicked a neuron into fitful activity .      what .     he said .      it   s all settled .         what is .         you know   mr .  hammerhock   s death and everything .         is it .         yes .         oh .      detritus considered this for a while  nodded  and settled back into whatever state of mind he normally occupied .   another neuron gave a fizzle .      right     he said .   cuddy watched him for a moment .      that   s about it     he said  sadly .     that   s all we   re getting .         i   ll be back shortly     said carrot .     shall we be off   joey  wasn   t it .  dr .  whiteface .         i suppose there   s no harm     said dr .  whiteface .     very well .  show corporal carrot anything he likes  boffo .         right  sir     said the little clown .      it must be a jolly job  being a clown     said carrot .      must it .         lots of japes and jokes  i mean .      boffo gave carrot a lopsided look .      well       he said .     it has its moments           i bet it does .  i bet it does .            are you often on gate duty  boffo .     said carrot pleasantly  as they strolled through the fools    guild .      huh .  just about all the time     said boffo .      so when did that friend of his  you know  the assassin   visit him .         oh  you know about him  then     said boffo .      oh  yes     said carrot .      about ten days ago     said boffo .     it   s through here  past the pie range .         he   d forgotten beano   s name  but he did know the room .  he didn   t know the number but he went straight to it     carrot went on .      that   s right .  i expect dr .  whiteface told you     said boffo .      i   ve spoken to dr .  whiteface     said carrot .   angua felt she was beginning to understand the way carrot asked questions .  he asked them by not asking them .  he simply told people what he thought or suspected  and they found themselves filling in the details in an attempt to keep up .  and he never  actually  told lies .   boffo pushed open a door and fussed around lighting a candle .      here we are then     he said .     i   m in charge of this  when i   m not on the bloody gate .         ye gods     said angua  under her breath .     it   s horrible .         it   s very interesting     said carrot .      it   s historical     said boffo the clown .      all those little heads        they stretched away in the candlelight  shelf on shelf of them  tiny little clown faces   as if a tribe of headhunters had suddenly developed a sophisticated sense of humor and a desire to make the world a better place .      eggs     said carrot .     ordinary hens    eggs .  what you do is  you get a hen   s egg  and you make a hole in either end and you blow the egg stuff out  and then a clown paints his make up on the egg and that   s his official make up and no other clown can use it .  that   s very important .  some faces have been in the same family for generations  you know .  very valuable thing  a clown   s face .  isn   t that so  boffo .      the clown was staring at him .      how do you know all that .         i read it in a book .      angua picked up an ancient egg .  there was a label attached to it  and on the label were a dozen names  all crossed out except the last one .  the ink on the earlier ones had faded almost to nothing .  she put it down and unconsciously wiped her hand on her tunic .      what happens if a clown wants to use another clown   s face .     she said .      oh  we compare all the new eggs with the ones on the shelves     said boffo .     it   s not allowed .      they walked between aisles of faces .  angua fancied she could hear the squelch of a million custard filled trousers and the echoes of a thousand honking noses and a million grins of faces that weren   t smiling .  about halfway along was a sort of alcove containing a desk and chair  a shelf piled with old ledgers  and a workbench covered with crusted pots of paint  scraps of colored horsehair  sequins and other odds and ends of the egg painter   s specialized art .  carrot picked up a wisp of colored horsehair and twiddled it thoughtfully .      but supposing     he said     that a clown  i mean a clown with his own face   supposing he used another clown   s face .         pardon .     said boffo .      supposing you used another clown   s make up .     said angua .      oh  that happens all the time     said boffo .     people   re always borrowing slap off each other           slap .     said angua .      make up     carrot translated .     no  i think what the lance constable is asking  boffo  is  could a clown make himself up to look like another clown .      boffo   s brow wrinkled  like someone trying hard to understand an impossible question .      pardon .         where   s beano   s egg  boffo .         that   s here on the desk     said boffo .     you can have a look if you like .      an egg was handed up .  it had a blobby red nose and a red wig .  angua saw carrot hold it up to the light and produce a couple of red strands from his pocket .      but     she said  trying one more time to get boffo to understand     couldn   t you wake up one morning and put on make up so that you looked like a different clown .      he looked at her .  it was hard to tell his expression under the permanently downcast mouth  but as far as she could tell she might as well have suggested that he performed a specific sex act with a small chicken .      how could i do that .     he said .     then i wouldn   t be me .         someone else might do it  though .      boffo   s buttonhole squirted .      i don   t have to listen to this sort of dirty talk  miss .         what you   re saying  then     said carrot     is that no clown would ever make up his face in another clown   s  urn  design .         you   re doing it again .         yes  but perhaps sometimes by accident a young clown might perhaps           look  we   re decent people  all right .         sorry     said carrot .     i think i understand .  now   when we found poor mr .  beano  he didn   t have his clown wig on  but something like that could easily have got knocked off in the river .  but his nose  now   you told sergeant colon that someone had taken his nose .  his real nose .  could you     said carrot  in the pleasant tones of someone talking to a simpleton     point to your real nose  boffo .      boffo tapped the big red nose on his face .      but that   s       angua began .         your real nose     said carrot .     thank you .      the clown wound down a little .      i think you   d better go     he said .     i don   t like this sort of thing .  it upsets me .         sorry     said carrot again .     it   s just that   i think i   m having an idea .  i wondered about it before   and i   m pretty certain now .  i think i know about the person who did it .  but i had to see the eggs to be sure .         you saying another clown killed him .     said boffo belligerently .        cos if you are  i   m going straight to           not exactly     said carrot .     but i can show you the killer   s face .      he reached down and took something from the debris on the table .  then he turned to boffo and opened his hand .  he had his back to angua  and she could not quite see what he was holding .  but boffo gave a strangled cry and ran away down the avenue of faces  his big shoes flip flopping hugely on the stone flags .      thank you     said carrot  at his retreating back .     you   ve been very helpful .      he folded his hand again .      come on     he said .     we   d better be going .  i don   t think we   re going to be popular here in a minute or two .         what was that you showed him .     angua asked  as they proceeded with dignity yet speed toward the gate .     it was something you came here to find  wasn   t it .  all that stuff about wanting to see the museum           i did want to see it .  a good copper should always be open to new experiences     said carrot .   they made it to the gate .  no vengeful pies floated out of the darkness .   angua leaned against the wall outside .  the air smelled sweeter here  which was an unusual thing to say about ankh morpork air .  but at least out here people could laugh without getting paid for it .      you didn   t show me what frightened him     she said .      i showed him a murderer     said carrot .     i   m sorry .  i didn   t think he   d take it like that .  i suppose they   re all a bit wound up right now .  and it   s like dwarfs and tools .  everyone thinks in their own ways .         you found the murderer   s face in there .         yes .      carrot opened his hand .   it contained a bare egg .      he looks like this     he said .      he didn   t have a face .         no  you   re thinking like a clown .  i am very simple     said carrot     but i think what happened was this .  someone in the assassins wanted a way of getting in and out without being seen .  he realized there   s only a thin wall between the two guilds .  he had a room .  all he had to do was find out who lived on the other side .  later he killed beano  and he took his wig and his nose .  his real nose .  that   s how clowns think .  make up wouldn   t have been hard .  you can get that anywhere .  he walked into the guild made up to look like beano .  he cut through the wall .  then he strolled down to the quad outside the museum  only this time he was dressed as an assassin .  he got the   the gonne and came back here .  he went through the wall again  dressed up as beano  and strolled away .  and then someone killed him .         boffo said beano looked worried     said angua .      and i thought  that   s odd  because you   d have to see a clown right up close to know what his real expression was .  but you might notice if the make up wasn   t on quite right .  like  maybe  if it was put on by someone who wasn   t too used to it .  but the important thing is that if another clown sees beano   s face go out of the door  he   s seen the person leave .  they can   t think about someone else wearing that face .  it   s not how they think .  a clown and his make up are the same thing .  without his make up a clown doesn   t exist .  a clown wouldn   t wear another clown   s face in the same way a dwarf wouldn   t use another dwarf   s tools .         sounds risky  though     said angua .      it was .  it was very risky .         carrot .  what are you going to do now .         i think it might be a good idea to find out whose room was on the other side of the hole  don   t you .  i think it might belong to beano   s little friend .         in the assassins    guild .  just us .         um .  you   ve got a point .      carrot looked so crestfallen that angua gave in .      what time is it .     she said .   carrot very carefully took captain vimes    presentation watch out of its cloth case .      it   s           abing  abing  abong  bong   bing   bing     they waited patiently until it had finished .      a quarter to seven     said carrot .     absolutely accurate  too .  i put it right by the big sundial in the university .      angua glanced at the sky .      ok     she said .     i can find out  i think .  leave it to me .         how .         er   i   well  i could get out of uniform  couldn   t i  and  oh  talk my way in as a kitchen maid   s sister or something        carrot looked doubtful .      you think that   ll work .         can you think of anything better .         not right now .         well  then .  i   ll   er   look   you go back to the rest of the men and   i   ll find somewhere to change into something more suitable .      she didn   t have to look around to recognize where the snigger came from .  gaspode had a way of turning up silently like a small puff of methane in a crowded room  and with the latter   s distressing ability to fill up all available space .      where can you get a change of clothes around here .     said carrot .      a good watchman is always ready to improvise     said angua .      that little dog is awfully wheezy     said carrot .     why does he always follow us around .         i really couldn   t say .         he   s got a present for you .      angua risked a glance .  gaspode was holding  but only just  a very large bone in his mouth .  it was wider than he was long  and might have belonged to something that died in a tar pit .  it was green and furry in places .      how nice     she said  coldly .     look  you go on .  let me see what i can do           if you   re sure       carrot began  in a reluctant tone of voice .      yes .      when he   d gone angua headed for the nearest alley .  there were only a few minutes to moonrise .      sergeant colon saluted when carrot came back  frowning in thought .      we can go home now  sir .     he suggested .      what .  why .         now it   s all sorted out .         i just said that to waylay suspicion     said carrot .      ah .  very clever     said the sergeant quickly .     that   s what i thought .  he   s saying that to waylay suspicion  i thought .         there   s still a murderer out there somewhere .  or something worse .      carrot ran his gaze over the ill assorted soldiery .      but right now i think we   re going to have to sort out this business with the day watch     he said .      er .  people say it   s practically a riot up there     said colon .      that   s why we   ve got to sort it out .      colon bit his lip .  he was not  as such  a coward .  last year the city had been invaded by a dragon and he   d actually stood on a rooftop and fired arrows at it while it was bearing down on him with its mouth open  although admittedly he   d had to change his underwear afterwards .  but that had been simple .  a great big fire breathing dragon was straightforward .  there it was  right in front of you  about to broil you alive .  that was all you had to worry about .  admittedly  it was a lot to worry about  but it was   simple .  it wasn   t any kind of mystery .      we   re going to have to sort it out .     he said .      yes .         oh .  good .  i like sorting things out .         foul ole ron was a beggars    guild member in good standing .  he was a mutterer  and a good one .  he would walk behind people muttering in his own private language until they gave him money not to .  people thought he was mad  but this was not  technically  the case .  it was just that he was in touch with reality on the cosmic level  and had a bit of trouble focusing on things smaller  like other people  walls and soap  although on very small things  such as coins  his eyesight was grade a  .   therefore he was not surprised when a handsome young woman streaked past him and removed all her clothes .  this sort of thing happened all the time  although up until now only on the inner side of his head .   then he saw what happened next .   he watched as the sleek golden shape streaked away .      i told    em .  i told    em .  i told    em .     he said .     i   ll give    em the wrong end of a ragman   s trumpet  so i shall .  bug   r   em .  millennium hand and shrimp .  i told    em .         gaspode wagged what was technically a tail when angua reemerged .         change into fomefing more fuitable        he said  his voice slightly muffled by the bone .     good one .  i brung you thif little token        he dropped it on the cobbles .  it didn   t look any better to angua   s lupine eyes .      what for .     she said .      stuffed with nourishin    marrowbone jelly  that bone     he said accusingly .      forget it     said angua .     now  how do you normally get into the assassins    guild .         and maybe afterwards we could kind of hang out in the middens along phedre road .     said gaspode  his stump of a tail still thumping the ground .     there   s rats along there that   ll make your hair stand on   no  all right  forget i mentioned it     he finished quickly  when fire flashed for a moment in angua   s eyes .   he sighed .      there   s a drain by the kitchens     he said .      big enough for a human .         not even for a dwarf .  but it won   t be worth it .  it   s spaghetti tonight .  you don   t get many bones in spaghetti           come on .      he limped along .      that was a good bone     he said .     hardly even started going green .  hah .  i bet you wouldn   t say no to a box of chocolates from mr .  hunk  though .      he cringed as she rounded on him .      what are you talking about .         nothing .  nothing .      he trailed after her  whining .   angua wasn   t happy  either .  it was always a problem  growing hair and fangs every full moon .  just when she thought she   d been lucky before  she   d found that few men are happy in a relationship where their partner grows hair and howls .  she   d sworn  no more entanglements like that .   as for gaspode  he was resigning himself to a life without love  or at least any more than the practical affection experienced so far  which had consisted of an unsuspecting chihuahua and a brief liaison with a postman   s leg .      the no .    powder slid down the folded paper into the metal tube .  blast vimes .  who   d have thought he   d actually head for the opera house .  he   d lost a set of tubes up there .  but there were still three left  packed neatly in the hollow stock .  a bag of no .    powder and a rudimentary knowledge of lead casting was all a man needed to rule the city     the gonne lay on the table .  there was a bluish sheen to the metal .  or  perhaps  not so much a sheen as a glisten .  and  of course  that was only the oil .  you had to believe it was only the oil .  it was clearly a thing of metal .  it couldn   t possibly be alive .   and yet     and yet        they say it was only a beggar girl in the guild .      well .  what of it .  she was a target of opportunity .  that was not my fault .  that was your fault .  i am merely the gonne .  gonnes don   t kill people .  people kill people .      you killed hammerhock .  the boy said you fired yourself .  and he   d repaired you .      you expect gratitude .  he would have made another gonne .      was that a reason to kill him .      certainly .  you have no understanding .   was the voice in his head or in the gonne .  he couldn   t be certain .  edward had said there was a voice   it said that everything you wanted  it could give you        getting into the guild was easy for angua  even through the angry crowds .  some of the assassins  the ones from noble homes that had big floppy dogs around the place in the same way that lesser folk have rugs  had brought a few with them .  besides  angua was pure pedigree .  she drew admiring glances as she trotted through the buildings .   finding the right corridor was easy  too .  she   d remembered the view from the guild next door  and counted the number of floors .  in any case  she didn   t have to look hard .  the reek of fireworks hung in the air all along the corridor .   there was a crowd of assassins in the corridor  too .  the door of the room had been forced open .  as angua peered around the corner she saw dr .  cruces emerge  his face suffused with rage .      mr .  downey .      a white haired assassin drew himself to attention .      sir .         i want him found .         yes  doctor           in fact i want him inhumed .  with extreme impoliteness .  and i   m setting the fee at ten thousand dollars   i shall pay it personally  you understand .  without guild tax  either .      several assassins nonchalantly strolled away from the crowd .  ten thousand untaxed dollars was good money .   downey looked uncomfortable .     doctor  i think           think .  you   re not paid to think .  heaven knows where the idiot has got to .  i ordered the guild searched .  why didn   t anyone force the door .         sorry  doctor  edward left us weeks ago and i didn   t think           you didn   t think .  what are you paid for .         never seen him in such a temper     said gaspode .   there was a cough behind the chief assassin .  dr .  whiteface had emerged from the room .      ah  doctor     said dr .  cruces .     i think perhaps we   d better go and discuss this further in my study  yes .         i really am most terribly sorry  my lord           don   t mention it .  the little   devil has made us both look like fools .  oh   nothing personal  of course .  mr .  downey  the fools and the assassins will be guarding this hole until we can get some masons in tomorrow .  no one is to go through  you understand .         yes  doctor .         very well .         that   s mr .  downey     said gaspode  as dr .  cruces and the chief clown disappeared down the corridor .     number two in the assassins .     he scratched his ear .     he   d knock off old cruces for tuppence if it wasn   t against the rules .      angua trotted forward .  downey  who was wiping his forehead with a black handkerchief  looked down .      hello  you   re new     he said .  he glanced at gaspode .     and the mutt   s back  i see .         woof  woof     said gaspode  his stump of a tail thumping the floor .     incident   ly     he added for angua   s benefit     he   s often good for a peppermint if you catch him in the right mood .  he   s poisoned fifteen people this year .  he   s almost as good with poisons as old cruces .         do i need to know that .     said angua .  downey patted her on the head .      oh  assassins shouldn   t kill unless they   re being paid .  it   s these little tips that make all the difference .      now angua was in a position to see the door .  there was a name written on a piece of card stuck in a metal bracket .   edward d   eath .      edward d   eath     she said .      there   s a name that tolls a bell     said gaspode .     family used to live up kingsway .  used to be as rich as creosote .         who was creosote .         some foreign bugger who was rich .         oh .         but great granddad had a terrible thirst  and granddad chased anything in a dress  his dress  you understand  and old d   eath  well  he was sober and clean but lost the rest of the family money on account of having a blind spot when it came to telling the difference between a one and an eleven .         i can   t see how that loses you money .         it does if you think you can play cripple mr .  onion with the big boys .      the werewolf and the dog padded back down the corridor .      do you know anything about master edward .     said angua .      nope .  the house was flogged off recently .  family debts .  haven   t seen him around .         you   re certainly a mine of information     she said .      i gets around .  no one notices dogs .     gaspode wrinkled his nose .  it looked like a withered truffle .     blimey .  stinks of gonne  doesn   t it .         yes .  something odd about that     said angua .      what .         something not right .      there were other smells .  unwashed socks  other dogs  dr .  whiteface   s greasepaint  yesterday   s dinner   the scents filled the air .  but the firework smell of what angua was now automatically thinking of as the gonne wound around everything else  acrid as acid .      what   s not right .         don   t know   maybe it   s the gonne smell           nah .  that started off here .  the gonne was kept here for years .         right .  ok .  well  we   ve got a name .  it might mean something to carrot        angua trotted down the stairs .         scuse me       said gaspode .      yes .         how can you turn back into a woman again .         i just get out of the moonlight and   concentrate .  that   s how it works .         cor .  that   s all .         if it   s technically full moon i can change even during the day if i want to .  i only have to change when i   m in the moonlight .         get away .  what about wolfbane .         wolfbane .  it   s a plant .  a type of aconite  i think .  what about it .         don   t it kill you .         look  you don   t have to believe everything you hear about werewolves .  we   re human  just like everyone else .  most of the time     she added .   by now they were outside the guild and heading for the alley  which indeed they reached  but it lacked certain important features that it had included when they were last there .  most notable of these was angua   s uniform  but there was also a world shortage of foul ole ron .      damn .      they looked at the empty patch of mud .      got any other clothes .     said gaspode .      yes  but only back in elm street .  this is my only uniform .         you have to put some clothes on when you   re human .         yes .         why .  i would have thought a nude woman would be at home in any company  no offense meant .         i prefer clothes .      gaspode sniffed at the dirt .      come on  then     he sighed .     we   d better catch up foul ole ron before your chainmail becomes a bottle of bearhugger   s  yes .      angua looked around .  the scent of foul ole ron was practically tangible .      all right .  but let   s be quick about it .      wolfbane .  you didn   t need daft old herbs to make your life a problem  if you spent one week every month with two extra legs and four extra nipples .      there were crowds around the patrician   s palace  and outside the assassins    guild .  a lot of beggars were in evidence .  they looked ugly .  looking ugly is a beggar   s stock in trade in any case .  these looked uglier than necessary .   the militia peered around a corner .      there   s hundreds of people     said colon .     and loads of trolls outside the day watch .         where   s the crowd thickest .     said carrot .      anywhere the trolls are     said colon .  he remembered himself .     only joking     he added .      very well     said carrot .     everyone follow me .      the babble stopped as the militia marched  lumbered  trotted and knuckled toward the day watch house .   a couple of very large trolls blocked the way .  the crowd watched in expectant silence .   any minute now  colon thought  someone   s going to throw something .  and then we   re all going to die .   he glanced up .  slowly and jerkily  gargoyle heads were appearing along the gutters .  no one wanted to miss a good fight .   carrot nodded at the two trolls .   they   d got lichen all over them  colon noticed .      it   s bluejohn and bauxite  isn   t it .     said carrot .   bluejohn  despite himself  nodded .  bauxite was tougher  and merely glared .      you   re just the sort i was looking for     carrot went on .   colon gripped his helmet like a size     limpet trying to crawl up into a size    shell .  bauxite was an avalanche with feet .      you   re conscripted     said carrot .   colon peeked out from under the brim .      report to corporal nobbs for your weapons .  lance constable detritus will administer the oath .     he stood back .     welcome to the citizens    watch .  remember  every lance constable has a field marshal   s baton in his knapsack .      the trolls hadn   t moved .      ain   t gonna be inna watch     said bauxite .      officer material if ever i saw it     said carrot .      hey  you can   t put them in the watch .     shouted a dwarf from the crowd .      why  hello  mr .  stronginthearm     said carrot .     good to see community leaders here .  why can   t they be in the militia .      all the trolls listened intently .  stronginthearm realized that he was suddenly the center of attention  and hesitated .      well   you   ve only got the one dwarf  for one thing       he began .      i   m a dwarf     said carrot     technically .      stronginthearm looked a little nervous .  the whole issue of carrot   s keenly embraced dwarfishness was a difficult one for the more politically minded dwarfs .      you   re a bit big     he said lamely .      big .  what   s size got to do with being a dwarf .     carrot demanded .      um   a lot .     whispered cuddy .      good point     said carrot .     that   s a good point .     he scanned the faces .     right .  we need some honest  law abiding dwarfs   you there           me .     said an unwary dwarf .      have you got any previous convictions .         well  i dunno   i suppose i used to believe very firmly that a penny saved is a penny earned           good .  and i   ll take   you two   and you .  four more dwarfs  yes .  can   t complain about that  eh .         ain   t gonna be inna watch     said bauxite again  but uncertainty modulated his tone .      you trolls can   t leave now     said detritus .     otherwise  too many dwarfs .  that   s numbers  that is .         i   m not joining any watch .     said a dwarf .      not man enough  eh .     said cuddy .          what .  i   m as good as any bloody troll any day .         right  that   s sorted out then     said carrot  rubbing his hands together .     acting constable cuddy .         sir .         hey     said detritus     how come he suddenly full constable .         since he was in charge of the dwarf recruits     said carrot .     and you   re in charge of the troll recruits  acting constable detritus .         i full acting constable in charge of the troll recruits .         of course .  now  if you would step out of the way  lance constable bauxite        behind carrot  detritus drew a big proud breath .      ain   t gonna           lance constable bauxite .  you horrible big troll .  you standing up straight .  you saluting right now .  you stepping out of the way of corporal carrot .  you two troll  you come here .  wurn   two er   tree   four er .  you in the watch now .  aaargh  i cannot believe it what my eye it seeing .  where you from  bauxite .         slice mountain  but           slice mountain .  slice mountain .  only       detritus looked at his fingers for a moment  and rammed them behind his back .     only two er things come from slice mountain .  rocks   an      an          he struck out wildly     other sortsa rocks .  what kind you  bauxite .         what the hell   s going on here .      the watch house door had opened .  captain quirke emerged  sword in hand .      you two horrible troll .  you raise your hand right now  you repeat troll oath           ah  captain     said carrot .     can we have a word .         you   re in real trouble  corporal carrot     snarled quirke .     who do you think you are .         i will do what i told           don   t wanna be inna        wham .      i will do what i told           just the man on the spot  captain     said carrot cheerfully .      well  man on the spot  i   m the senior officer here  and you can damn well           interesting point     said carrot .  he produced his black book .     i   m relieving you of your command .            otherwise i get my goohuloog head kicked in .            otherwise i get my goohuloog head kicked in .         wha    .  are you mad .         no  sir  but i   m choosing to believe that you are .  there are regulations laid down for this eventuality .         where is your authority .     quirke stared at the crowd .     hah .  i suppose you   ll say this armed mob is your authority  eh .      carrot looked shocked .      no .  the laws and ordinances of ankh morpork  sir .  it   s all down here .  can you tell me what evidence you have against the prisoner coalface .         that damn troll .  it   s a troll .         yes .      quirke looked around .      look  i don   t have to tell you with everyone here           as a matter of fact  according to the rules  you do .  that   s why it   s called evidence .  it means    that which is seen    .         listen .     hissed quirke  leaning toward carrot .     he   s a troll .  he   s as guilty as hell of something .  they all are .      carrot smiled brightly .   colon had come to know that smile .  carrot   s face seemed to go waxy and glisten when he smiled like that .      and so you locked him up .         right .         oh .  i see .  i understand now .      carrot turned away .      i don   t know what you think you   re       quirke began .   people hardly saw carrot move .  there was just a blur  a sound like a steak being thumped on a slab  and the captain was flat on the cobbles .   a couple of members of the day watch appeared cautiously in the doorway .   everyone became aware of a rattling noise .  nobby was spinning the morningstar round and round on the end of its chain  except that because the spiky ball was a very heavy spiky ball  and because the difference between nobby and a dwarf was species rather than height  it was more a case of both of them orbiting around each other .  if he let go  it was an even chance that the target would be hit by a spiky ball or an unexploded corporal nobbs .  neither prospect pleased .      put it down  nobby     hissed colon     i don   t think they   re going to make trouble           i can   t let go  fred .      carrot sucked his knuckles .      do you think that comes under the heading of    minimum necessary force     sergeant .     he asked .  he appeared to be genuinely worried .      fred .  fred .  what   ll i do .      nobby was a terrified blur .  when you are swinging a spiky ball on a chain  the only realistic option is to keep moving .  standing still is an interesting but brief demonstration of a spiral in action .      is he still breathing .     said colon .      oh  yes .  i pulled the punch .         sounds minimum enough to me  sir     said colon loyally .      fredddd .      carrot reached out absent mindedly as the morningstar rocketed past and caught it by the chain .  then he threw it against the wall  where it stuck .      you men in there in the watch house     he said     come out now .      five men emerged  edging cautiously around the prone captain .      good .  now go and get coalface .         er   he   s in a bit of a bad temper  corporal carrot .         on account of being chained to the floor     volunteered another guard .      well  now     said carrot .     the thing is  he   s going to be unchained right now .     the men shuffled their feet nervously  possibly remembering an old proverb that fitted the occasion very well .    carrot nodded .     i won   t ask you to do it  but i might suggest you take some time off     he said .      quirm is very nice at this time of year     said sergeant colon helpfully .     they   ve got a floral clock .         er   since you mention it   i   ve got some sick leave coming up     one of them said .      i should think that   s very probable  if you hang around     said carrot .   they sidled off as fast as decency allowed .  the crowd hardly paid them any attention .  there was still a lot more mileage in watching carrot .      right     said carrot .     detritus  you take some men and go and bring out the prisoner .         i don   t see why       a dwarf began .      you shut up  you horrible man     said detritus  drunk with power .   you could have heard a guillotine drop .   in the crowd  a number of different sized knobbly hands gripped a variety of concealed weapons .   everyone looked at carrot .   that was the strange thing  colon remembered later .  everyone looked at carrot .      gaspode sniffed a lamppost .      i see three legged shep has been ill again     he said .     and old willy the pup is back in town .      to a dog  a well placed hitching post or lamp is a social calendar .      where are we .     said angua .  foul ole ron   s trail was hard to follow .  there were so many other smells .      somewhere in the shades     said gaspode .     sweetheart lane  smells like .     he snuffled across the ground .     ah  here he is again  the little              ullo  gaspode        it was a deep  hoarse voice  a kind of whisper with sand in it .  it came from somewhere in an alley .         o   s yer fwiend  gaspode .      there was a snigger .      ah     said gaspode .     uh .  hi  guys .      two dogs emerged from the alley .  they were huge .  their species was indeterminate .  one of them was jet black and looked like a pit bull terrier crossed with a mincing machine .  the other   the other looked like a dog whose name was almost certainly    butch    .  both top and bottom set of fangs had grown so large that he appeared to be looking at the world through bars .  he was also bow legged  although it would probably be a bad if not terminal move for anyone to comment on this .   gaspode   s tail vibrated nervously .      these are my friends black roger and           butch .     suggested angua .      how did you know that .         a lucky guess     said angua .   the two big dogs had moved around so that they were on either side of them .      well  well  well     said black roger .     who   s this  then .         angua     said gaspode .     she   s a              wolfhound     said angua .   the two dogs paced around them hungrily .      big fido know about her .     said black roger .      i was just       gaspode began .      well  now     said black roger     i reckon you   d be wanting to come with us .  guild night tonight .         sure  sure     said gaspode .     no problem there .      i could certainly manage either of them  angua thought .  but not both at once .   being a werewolf meant having the dexterity and jaw power to instantly rip out a man   s jugular .  it was a trick of her father   s that had always annoyed her mother  especially when he did it just before meals .  but angua had never been able to bring herself to do it .  she   d preferred the vegetarian option .         ullo     said butch  in her ear .      don   t you worry about anything     moaned gaspode .     me an    big fido   we   re like that .         what   re you trying to do .  cross your claws .  i didn   t know dogs could do that .         we can   t     said gaspode miserably .   other dogs slunk out of the shadows as the two of them were half led  half driven along byways that weren   t even alleys any more  just gaps between walls .  they opened out eventually into a bare area  nothing more than a large light well for the buildings around it .  there was a very large barrel on its side in one corner  with a ragged bit of blanket in it .  a variety of dogs were waiting around in front of it  looking expectant  some of them had only one eye  some of them had only one ear  all of them had scars  and all of them had teeth .      you     said black roger     wait here .         do not twy to wun away     said butch        cos having your intestines chewed often offends .      angua lowered her head to gaspode level .  the little dog was shaking .      what have you got me into .     she growled .     this is the dog guild  right .  a pack of strays .         shsssh .  don   t say that .  these aren   t strays .  oh  blimey .     gaspode glanced around .     you don   t just get any hound in the guild .  oh  dear me  no .  these are dogs that have been       he lowered his voice        er   bad dogs .         bad dogs .         bad dogs .  you naughty boy .  give him a smack .  you bad dog     muttered gaspode  like some horrible litany .     every dog you see here  right  every dog   run away .  run away from his or her actual owner .         is that all .         all .  all .  well .  of course .  you ain   t exactly a dog .  you wouldn   t understand .  you wouldn   t know what it was like .  but big fido   he told    em .  throw off your choke chains  he said .  bite the hand that feeds you .  rise up and howl .  he gave    em pride     said gaspode  his voice a mixture of fear and fascination .     he told    em .  any dog he finds not bein    a free spirit   that dog is a dead dog .  he killed a dobermann last week  just for wagging his tail when a human went past .      angua looked at some of the other dogs .  they were all unkempt .  they were also  in a strange way  un doglike .  there was a small and rather dainty white poodle that still just about had the overgrown remains of its poodle cut  and a lapdog with the tattered remains of a tartan jacket still hanging from its shoulder .  but they weren   t milling around  or squabbling .  they had a uniform intent look that she   d seen before  although never on dogs .   gaspode was clearly trembling now .  angua slunk over to the poodle .  it still had a diamante collar visible under the crusty fur .      this big fido     she said     is he some kind of wolf  or what .         spiritually  all dogs are wolves     said the poodle     but cynically and cruelly severed from their true destiny by the manipulations of so called humanity .      it sounded like a quote .     big fido said that .     angua hazarded .   the poodle turned its head .  for the first time she saw its eyes .  they were red  and as mad as hell .  anything with eyes like that could kill anything it wanted because madness  true madness  can drive a fist through a plank .      yes     said big fido .      he had been a normal dog .  he   d begged  and rolled over  and heeled  and fetched .  every night he   d been taken for a walk .   there was no flash of light when it happened .  he   d just been lying in his basket one night and he   d thought about his name  which was fido  and the name on the basket  which was fido .  and he thought about his blanket with fido on it  and his bowl with fido on it  and above all he brooded on the collar with fido on it  and something somewhere deep in his brain had gone    click    and he   d eaten his blanket  savaged his owner and dived out through the kitchen window .  in the street outside a labrador four times the size of fido had sniggered at the collar  and thirty seconds later had fled  whimpering .   that had just been the start .   the dog hierarchy was a simple matter .  fido had simply asked around  generally in a muffled voice because he had someone   s leg in his jaws  until he located the leader of the largest gang of feral dogs in the city .  people   that is  dogs   still talked about the fight between fido and barking mad arthur  a rottweiler with one eye and a very bad temper .  but most animals don   t fight to the death  only to the defeat  and fido was impossible to defeat  he was simply a very small fast killing streak with a collar .  he   d hung on to bits of barking mad arthur until barking mad arthur had given in  and then to his amazement fido had killed him .  there was something inexplicably determined about the dog   you could have sandblasted him for five minutes and what was left still wouldn   t have given up and you   d better not turn your back on it .   because big fido had a dream .         is there a problem .     said carrot .      that troll insulted that dwarf     said stronginthearm the dwarf .      i heard acting constable detritus give an order to lance constable   hrolf pyjama     said carrot .     what about it .         he   s a troll .         well .         he insulted a dwarf .         actually  it   s a technical milit   ry term       said sergeant colon .      that damn troll just happened to save my life today     shouted cuddy .      what for .         what for .  what for .     cos it was my life  that   s what for .  i happen to be very attached to it .         i didn   t mean           you just shut up  abba stronginthearm .  what do you know about anything  you civilian .  why   re you so stupid .  aargh .  i   m too short for this shit .      a shadow loomed in the doorway .  coalface was a basically horizontal shape  a dark mass of fracture lines and sheer surfaces .  his eyes gleamed red and suspicious .      now you   re letting it go .     moaned a dwarf .      this is because we have no reason to keep him locked up     said carrot .     whoever killed mr .  hammerhock was small enough to get through a dwarfs doorway .  a troll his size couldn   t manage that .         but everyone knows he   s a bad troll .     shouted stronginthearm .      i never done nuffin     said coalface .      you can   t turn him loose now  sir     hissed colon .     they   ll set on him .         i never done nuffin .         good point  sergeant .  acting constable detritus .         sir .         volunteer him .         i never done nuffin .         you can   t do that .     shouted the dwarf .      ain   t gonna be in no watch     growled coalface .   carrot leaned toward him .     there   s a hundred dwarfs over there .  with great big axes     he whispered .   coalface blinked .      i   ll join .         swear him in  acting constable .         permission to enrol another dwarf  sir .  to maintain parity .         go ahead  acting constable cuddy .      carrot removed his helmet and wiped his forehead .      i think that   s about it  then     he said .   the crowd stared at him .   he smiled brightly .      no one has to stay here unless they want to     he said .      i never done nuffin .         yes   but   look     said stronginthearm .     if he didn   t kill old hammerhock  who did .         i never done nuffin .         our inquiries are proceeding .         you don   t know .         but i   m finding out .         oh  yes .  and when  pray  will you know .         tomorrow .      the dwarf hesitated .      all right  then     he said  with extreme reluctance .     tomorrow .  but it had better be tomorrow .         all right     said carrot .   the crowd dispersed  or at least spread out a bit .  trolls  dwarfs and humans alike  an ankh morpork citizen is never keen on moving on if there   s some street theater left .   acting constable detritus  his chest so swollen with pride and pomposity that his knuckles barely touched the ground  reviewed his troops .      you listen up  you horrible trolls .      he paused  while the next thoughts shuffled into position .      you listen up good right now .  you in the watch  boy .  it a job with opportunity .     said detritus .     i only been doin    it ten minute and already i get promoted .  also got education and training for a good job in civilian street .      this your club with a nail in it .  you will eat it .  you will sleep on it .  when detritus say jump  you say   what color .  we goin    to do this by the numbers .  and i got lotsa numbers .         i never done nuffin .         you coalface  you smarten up  you got a field marshal   s button in your knapsack .         never took nuffin  neither .         you get down now and give me thirty two .  no .  make it sixty four .      sergeant colon pinched the bridge of his nose .  we   re alive  he thought .  a troll insulted a dwarf in front of a lot of other dwarfs .  coalface   i mean  coalface  i mean  detritus is mr .  clean by comparison   is free and now he   s a guard .  carrot laid out mayonnaise .  carrot   s said we   ll sort it all out by tomorrow  and it   s dark already .  but we   re alive .   corporal carrot is a crazy man .   hark at them dogs .  everyone   s on edge  in this heat .      angua listened to the other dogs howling  and thought about wolves .   she   d run with the pack a few times  and knew about wolves .  these dogs weren   t wolves .  wolves were peaceful creatures  on the whole  and fairly simple .  come to think of it  the leader of the pack had been rather like carrot .  carrot fitted into the city in the same way he   d fitted into the high forests .   dogs were brighter than wolves .  wolves didn   t need intelligence .  they had other things .  but dogs   they   d been given intelligence by humans .  whether they wanted it or not .  they were certainly more vicious than wolves .  they   d got that from humans  too .   big fido was forging his band of strays into what the ignorant thought a wolf pack was .  a kind of furry killing machine .   she looked around .   big dogs  little dogs  fat dogs  skinny dogs .  they were all watching  bright eyed  as the poodle talked .   about destiny .   about discipline .   about the natural superiority of the canine race .   about wolves .  only big fido   s vision of wolves weren   t wolves as angua knew them .  they were bigger  fiercer  wiser  the wolves of big fido   s dream .  they were kings of the forest  terrors of the night .  they had names like quickfang and silverback .  they were what every dog should aspire to .   big fido had approved of angua .  she looked very much like a wolf  he said .   they all listened  totally entranced  to a small dog who farted nervously while he talked and told them that the natural shape for a dog was a whole lot bigger .  angua would have laughed  were it not for the fact that she doubted very much if she   d get out of there alive .   and then she watched what happened to a small rat like mongrel which was dragged into the center of the circle by a couple of terriers and accused of fetching a stick .  not even wolves did that to other wolves .  there was no code of wolf behavior .  there didn   t need to be .  wolves didn   t need rules about being wolves .   when the execution was over  she found gaspode sitting in a corner and trying to be unobtrusive .      will they chase us if we sneak off now .     she said .      don   t think so .  meeting   s over  see .         come on  then .      they sauntered into an alley and  when they were sure they hadn   t been noticed  ran like hell .      good grief     said angua  when they had put several streets between them and the crowd of dogs .     he   s mad  isn   t he .         no  mad   s when you froth at the mouf     said gaspode .     he   s insane .  that   s when you froth at the brain .         all that stuff about wolves           i suppose a dog   s got a right to dream     said gaspode .      but wolves aren   t like that .  they don   t even have names .         everyone   s got a name .         wolves haven   t .  why should they .  they know who they are  and they know who the rest of the pack are .  it   s all   an image .  smell and feel and shape .  wolves don   t even have a word for wolves .  it   s not like that .  names are human things .         dogs have got names .  i   ve got a name .  gaspode .     s   my name     said gaspode  a shade sullenly .      well   i can   t explain why     said angua .     but wolves don   t have names .         the moon was high now  in a sky as black as a cup of coffee that wasn   t very black at all .   its light turned the city into a network of silver lines and shadows .   once upon a time the tower of art had been the center of the city  but cities tend to migrate gently with time and ankh morpork   s center was now several hundred yards away .  the tower still dominated the city  though  its black shape reared against the evening sky  contriving to look blacker than mere shadows would suggest .   hardly anyone ever looked at the tower of art  because it was always there .  it was just a thing .  people hardly ever look at familiar things .   there was a very faint clink of metal on stone .  for a moment  anyone close to the tower and looking in exactly the right place might have fancied that a patch of even blacker darkness was slowly but inexorably moving toward the top .   for a moment  the moonlight caught a slim metal tube  slung across the figure   s back .  then it swung into shadow again as it climbed onward .      the window was resolutely shut .      but she always leaves it open     angua whined .      must have shut it tonight     said gaspode .     there   s a lot of strange people about .         but she knows about strange people     said angua    most of them live in her house .         you   ll just have to change back to human and smash the window .         i can   t do that .  i   d be naked .         well  you   re naked now  ain   t you .         but i   m a wolf .  that   s different .         i   ve never worn anything in my whole life .  it   s never bothered me .         the watch house     muttered angua .     there   ll be something at the watch house .  spare chainmail  at least .  a sheet or something .  and the door doesn   t shut properly .  come on .      she trotted off along the street  with gaspode whimpering along behind her .   someone was singing .      blimey     said gaspode     look at that .      four watchmen slogged past .  two dwarfs  two trolls .  angua recognized detritus .      hut  hut  hut .  you without doubt the horriblest recruits i ever see .  pick up them feet .         i never done nuffin .         now you doin somefin for the first time in your horrible life  lance constable coalface .  it a man life in the watch .      the squad rounded the corner .      what   s been going on .     said angua .      search me .  i might know more if one of    em stops for a widdle .      there was a small crowd around the watch house in pseudopolis yard .  they seemed to be watchmen  too .  sergeant colon was standing under a flickering lamp  scribbling on his clipboard and talking to a small man with a large moustache .      and your name  mister .         silas .  cumberbatch .         didn   t you used to be town crier .         that   s right .         right .  give him his shilling .  acting constable cuddy .  one for your squad .         who   s acting constable cuddy .     said cumberbatch .      down here  mister .      the man looked down .      but you   re .  a dwarf .  i never           stand to attention when you   re talking to a superierierior officer .     cuddy bellowed .      ain   t no dwarfs or trolls or humans in the watch  see     said colon .     just watchmen  see .  that   s what corporal carrot says .  of course  if you   d like to be in acting constable detritus    squad           i like dwarfs     said cumberbatch  hurriedly .     always have .  not that there are any in the watch  mind     he added  after barely a second   s thought .      you learn quick .  you   ll go a long way in this man   s army     said cuddy .     you could have a field marshal   s bottom in your napkin any day now .  aaaaaabbbb wut tn .  hut  hut  hut           fifth volunteer so far     said colon to corporal nobbs  as cuddy and his new recruit pounded off into the darkness .     even the dean at the university tried to join .  amazing .      angua looked at gaspode  who shrugged .      detritus is certainly clubbing    em into line     said colon .     after ten minutes they   re putty in his hands .  mind you     he added     after ten minutes anything   s putty in them hands .  reminds me of the drill sergeant we had when i was first in the army .         tough  was he .     said nobby  lighting a cigarette .      tough .  tough .  blimey .  thirteen weeks of pure misery  that was .  ten mile run every morning  up to our necks in muck half the time  and him yelling a blue streak and cussin    us every living moment .  one time he made me stay up all night cleaning the lavvies with a toothbrush .  he   d hit us with a spiky stick to get us out of bed .  we had to jump through hoops for that man  we hated his damn guts  we   d have stuck one on him if any of us had the nerve but  of course  none of us did .  he put us through three months of living death .  but   y   know   after the passing out parade   us looking at ourselves all in our new uniforms an    all  real soldiers at last  seein    what we   d become   well  we saw him in the bar and  well   i don   t mind telling you       the dogs watched colon wipe away the suspicion of a tear .        me and tonker jackson and hoggy spuds waited for him in the alley and beat seven kinds of hell out of him  it took three days for my knuckles to heal .     colon blew his nose .     happy days   fancy a boiled sweet  nobby .         don   t mind if i do  fred .         give one to the little dog     said gaspode .  colon did  and then wondered why .      see .     said gaspode  crunching it up in his dreadful teeth .     i   m brilliant .  brilliant .         you   d better pray big fido doesn   t find out     said angua .      nah .  he won   t touch me .  i worry him .  i   ve got the power .     he scratched an ear vigorously .     look  you don   t have to go back in there  we could go and           no .         story of my life     said gaspode .     there   s gaspode .  give him a kick .         i thought you had this big happy family to go back to     said angua  as she pushed open the door .      eh .  oh  yes .  right     said gaspode hurriedly .     yes .  but i like my  sort of  independence .  i could stroll back home like a shot  any time i wanted .      angua bounded up the stairs  and clawed open the nearest door .   it was carrot   s bedroom .  the smell of him  a kind of golden pink color  filled it from edge to edge .   there was a drawing of a dwarf mine carefully pinned to one wall .  another held a large sheet of cheap paper on which had been drawn  in careful pencil line  with many crossings out and smudges  a map of the city .   in front of the window  where a conscientious person would put it to take as much advantage as possible of the available light so   s not to have to waste too many of the city   s candles  was a small table .  there was some paper on it  and a jar of pencils .  there was an old chair  too  a piece of paper had been folded up and wedged under a wobbly leg .   and that  apart from a clothes chest  was it .  it reminded her of vimes    room .  this was a place where someone came to sleep  not to live .   angua wondered if there was ever a time when anyone in the watch was ever  really  off duty .  she couldn   t imagine sergeant colon in civilian clothes .  when you were a watchman  you were a watchman all the time  which was a bit of a bargain for the city since it only paid you to be a watchman for ten hours of every day .      all right     she said .     i can use a sheet off the bed .  you shut your eyes .         why .     said gaspode .      for decency   s sake .      gaspode looked blank .  then he said     oh  i get it .  yes  i can see your point  def   nitely .  dear me  you can   t have me looking at a naked woman  oh no .  oggling .  gettin    ideas .  deary deary me .         you know what i mean .         can   t say i do .  can   t say i do .  clothing has never been what you might call a thingy of dog wossname .     gaspode scratched his ear .     two metasyntactic variables there .  sorry .         it   s different with you .  you know what i am .  anyway  dogs are naturally naked .         so   re humans        angua changed .   gaspode   s ear flattened against his head .  despite himself  he whimpered .   angua stretched .      you know the worst bit .     she said .     it   s my hair .  you can hardly get the tangles out .  and my feet are covered in mud .      she tugged a sheet off the bed and draped it around herself as a makeshift toga .      there     she said     you see worse on the street every day .  gaspode .         what .         you can open your eyes now .      gaspode blinked .  angua in both shapes was ok to look at  but the second or two in between  as the morphic signal hunted between stations  was not a sight you wished to see on a full stomach .      i thought you rolled around on the floor grunting and growing hair and stretching     he whimpered .   angua peered at her hair in the mirror while her night vision lasted .      whatever for .         does   all that stuff   hurt .         it   s a bit like a whole body sneeze .  you   d think he   d have a comb  wouldn   t you .  i mean  a comb .  everyone   s got a comb           a really   big   sneeze .         even a clothes brush would be something .      they froze as the door creaked open .   carrot walked in .  he didn   t notice them in the gloom  but trudged to the table .  there was a flare and a reek of sulphur as he lit first a match and then a candle .   he removed his helmet  and then sagged as if he   d finally allowed a weight to drop on his shoulders .   they heard him say     it can   t be right .         what can   t .     said angua .   carrot spun around .      what   re you doing here .         your uniform got stolen while you were spying in the assassins    guild     gaspode prompted .      my uniform got stolen     said angua     while i was in the assassins    guild .  spying .     carrot was still staring at her .     there was some old bloke who kept muttering all the time     she went on desperately .      buggrit .  millennium hand and shrimp .         yes  that   s right           foul ole ron .     carrot sighed .     probably sold it for a drink .  i know where he lives  though .  remind me to go and have a word with him when i   ve got time .         you don   t want to ask her what she was wearing when she was in the guild     said gaspode  who had crept under the bed .      shut up .     said angua .      what .     said carrot .      i found out about the room     said angua quickly .     someone called           edward d   eath .     said carrot  sitting down on the bed .  the ancient springs went groing groing grink .      how did you know that .         i think d   eath stole the gonne .  i think he killed beano .  but   assassins killing without being paid .  it   s worse than dwarfs and tools .  it   s worse than clowns and faces .  i hear cruces is really upset .  he   s got assassins looking for the boy all over the city .         oh .  well .  i   d hate to be in edward   s shoes when they find him .         i   d hate to be in his shoes now .  and i know where they are  you see .  they   re on his poor feet .  and they   re dead .         the assassins have found him  then .         no .  someone else did .  and then cuddy and detritus did .  if i   m any judge  he   s been dead for several days .  you see .  that can   t be right .  but i rubbed the beano make up off and took off the red nose  and it was definitely him .  and the wig   s the right kind of red hair .  he must have gone straight to hammerhock .         but   someone shot at detritus .  and killed the beggar girl .         yes .      angua sat down beside him .      and it couldn   t have been edward           hah .     carrot undid his breastplate and pulled off his mail shirt .      so we   re looking for someone else .  a third man .         but there   s no clues .  there   s just some man with a gonne .  somewhere in the city .  anywhere .  and i   m tired .      the springs went glink again as carrot stood up and staggered over to the chair and table .  he sat down  pulled a piece of paper toward him  inspected a pencil  sharpened it on his sword and  after a moment   s thought  began to write .   angua watched him in silence .  carrot had a short sleeved leather vest under his mail .  there was a birthmark at the top of his left arm .  it was crown shaped .      are you writing it all down  like captain vimes did .     she said  after a while .      no .         what are you doing  then .         i   m writing to my mum and dad .         really .         i always write to my mum and dad .  i promised them .  anyway  it helps me think .  i always write letters home when i   m thinking .  my dad sends me lots of good advice  too .      there was a wooden box in front of carrot .  letters were stacked in it .  carrot   s father had been in the habit of replying to carrot on the back of carrot   s own letters  because paper was hard to come by at the bottom of a dwarf mine .      what kind of good advice .         about mining  usually .  moving rocks .  you know .  propping and shoring .  you can   t get things wrong in a mine .  you have to do things right .      his pencil scritched on the paper .   the door was still ajar  but there was a tentative tap on it which said  in a kind of metaphorical morse code  that the tapper could see very well that carrot was in his room with a scantily clad woman and was trying to knock without actually being heard .   sergeant colon coughed .  the cough had a leer in it .      yes  sergeant .     said carrot  without looking around .      what do you want me to do next  sir .         send them out in squads  sergeant .  at least one human  one dwarf and one troll in each .         yessir .  what   ll they be doing  sir .         they   ll be being visible  sergeant .         right  sir .  sir .  one of the volunteers just now   it   s mr .  bleakley  sir .  from elm street .  he   s a vampire  well  technic   ly  but he works up at the slaughterhouse so it   s not really           thank him very much and send him home  sergeant .      colon glanced at angua .      yessir .  right     he said reluctantly .     but he   s not a problem  it   s just that he needs these extra homogoblins in his blo           no .         right .  fine .  i   ll  er  i   ll tell him to go away  then .      colon shut the door .  the hinge leered .      they call you sir     said angua .     do you notice that .         i know .  it   s not right .  people ought to think for themselves  captain vimes says .  the problem is  people only think for themselves if you tell them to .  how do you spell    eventuality    .         i don   t .         ok .     carrot still didn   t look around .     we   ll hold the city together through the rest of the night  i think .  everyone   s seen sense .      no they haven   t  said angua in the privacy of her own head .  they   ve seen you .  it   s like hypnotism .   people live your vision .  you dream  just like big fido  only he dreamed a nightmare and you dream for everyone .  you really think everyone is basically nice .  just for a moment  while they are near you  everyone else believes it too .   from somewhere outside came the sound of marching knuckles .  detritus    troop was making another circuit .   oh  well .  he   s got to know sooner or later        carrot .         hmm .         you know   when cuddy and the troll and me joined the watch   well  you know why it was us three  don   t you .         of course .  minority group representation .  one troll  one dwarf  one woman .         ah .     angua hesitated .  it was still moonlight outside .  she could tell him  run downstairs  change and be well outside the city by dawn .  she   d have to do it .  she was an expert at running away from cities .      it wasn   t exactly like that     she said .     you see  there   s a lot of undead in the city and the patrician insisted that           give her a kiss     said gaspode  from under the bed .   angua froze .  carrot   s face took on the usual vaguely puzzled look of someone whose ears have just heard what their brain is programmed to believe doesn   t exist .  he began to blush .      gaspode .     snapped angua  dropping into canine .      i know what i   m doin    .  a man  a woman .  it is fate     said gaspode .   angua stood up .  carrot shot up too  so fast that his chair fell over .      i must be going     she said .      um .  don   t go           now you just reach out     said gaspode .   it   d never work  angua told herself .  it never does .  werewolves have to hang around with other werewolves  they   re the only ones who understand     but     on the other hand   since she   d have to run anyway     she held up a finger .      just one moment     she said brightly and  in one movement  reached under the bed and pulled out gaspode by the scruff of his neck .      you need me .     the dog whimpered  as he was carried to the door .     i mean  what does he know .  his idea of a good time is showing you the colossus of morpork .  put me        the door slammed .  angua leaned on it .   it   ll end up just like it did in pseudopolis and quirm and        angua .     said carrot .   she turned .      don   t say anything     she said .     and it might be all right .      after a while the bedsprings went glink .   and shortly after that  for corporal carrot  the discworld moved .  and didn   t even bother to stop to cancel the bread and newspapers .      corporal carrot awoke around four a . m .   that secret hour known only to the night people  such as criminals  policemen and other misfits .  he lay on his half of the narrow bed and stared at the wall .   it had definitely been an interesting night .   although he was indeed simple  he wasn   t stupid  and he   d always been aware of what might be called the mechanics .  he   d been acquainted with several young ladies  and had taken them on many invigorating walks to see fascinating ironwork and interesting civic buildings until they   d unaccountably lost interest .  he   d patrolled the whore pits often enough  although mrs .  palm and the guild of seamstresses were trying to persuade the patrician to rename the area the street of negotiable affection .  but he   d never seen them in relation to himself  had never been quite sure  as it were  where he fitted in .   this was probably not something he was going to write to his parents about .  they almost certainly knew .   he slid out of bed .  the room was stifling hot with the curtains drawn .   behind him  he heard angua roll over into the hollow left by his body .   then  with both hands  and considerable vigor  he threw open the curtains and let in the round  white light of the full moon .   behind him  he thought he heard angua sigh in her sleep .   there were thunderstorms out on the plain .  carrot could see lightning flashes stitching the horizon  and he could smell rain .  but the air of the city was still and baking  all the hotter for the distant prospect of storms .   the university   s tower of art loomed in front of him .  he saw it every day .  it dominated half the city .   behind him  the bed went glink .      i think there   s going to be       he began  and turned .   as he turned away  he missed the glint of moonlight on metal from the top of the tower .      sergeant colon sat on the bench outside the baking air of the watch house .   there was a hammering noise from somewhere inside .  cuddy had come in ten minutes before with a bag of tools  a couple of helmets and a determined expression .  colon was damned if he knew what the little devil was working on .   he counted again  very slowly  ticking off names on his clipboard .   no doubt about it .  the night watch had almost twenty members now .  maybe more .  detritus had gone critical  and had sworn in a further two men  another troll and a wooden dummy from outside corksock   s natty clothing co .   if this went on they   d be able to open up the old watch houses near the main gates  just like the old days .   he couldn   t remember when the watch last had twenty men .   it had all seemed a good idea at the time .  it was certainly keeping the lid on things .  but in the morning the patrician was going to get to hear about it  and demand to see the superior officer .   now  sergeant colon was not entirely clear in his own mind who was the superior officer at the moment .  he felt that it should be either captain vimes or  in some way he couldn   t quite define  corporal carrot .  but the captain wasn   t around and corporal carrot was only a corporal  and fred colon had a dreadful apprehension that when lord vetinari summoned someone in order to be ironical at them and say things like    who   s going to pay their wages  pray .     it would be him  fred colon  well and truly up the ankh without a paddle .   they were also running out of ranks .  there were only four ranks below the rank of sergeant .  nobby was getting stroppy about anyone else being promoted to corporal  so there was a certain amount of career congestion taking place .  besides  some of the watch had got it into their heads that the way you got promoted was to conscript half a dozen other guards .  at detritus    current rate of progress  he was going to be high supreme major general by the end of the month .   and what made it all strange was that carrot was still only a     colon looked up when he heard the tinkle of broken glass .  something golden and indistinct crashed through an upper window  landed in the shadows and fled before he could make out what it was .   the watch house door slammed open and carrot emerged  sword in hand .      where   d it go .  where   d it go .         dunno .  what the hell was it .      carrot stopped .      uh .  not sure     he said .      carrot .         sarge .         i should put some clothes on if i was you  lad .      carrot stayed looking into the pre dawn gloom .      i mean  i turned around and there it was  and        he looked down at the sword in his hand as if he hadn   t realized that he was carrying it .      oh  damn .     he said .   he ran back to his room and grabbed his britches .  as he struggled into them  he was suddenly aware of a thought in his head  clear as ice .   you are a pillock  what are you .  picked up the sword automatically  didn   t you .  did it all wrong .  now she   s run off and you   ll never see her again .   he turned .  a small grey dog was watching him intently from the doorway .   shock like that  she might never change back again  said his thoughts .  who cares if she   s a werewolf .  that didn   t bother you until you knew .  incident   ly  any biscuits about your person could be usefully thrown to the small dog in the doorway  although come to think of it the chances of having a biscuit on you right now are very small  so forget you ever thought it .  blimey  you really messed that up  right .      thought carrot .      woof woof     said the dog .   carrot   s forehead wrinkled .      it   s you  isn   t it .     he said  pointing his sword .      me .  dogs don   t talk     said gaspode  hurriedly .     listen  i should know .  i am one .         you tell me where she   s gone .  right now .  or           yeah .  look     said gaspode gloomily     the first thing i remember in my life  right  the first thing  was being thrown into the river in a sack .  with a brick .  me .  i mean  i had wobbly legs and a humorously inside out ear  i mean  i was fluffy .  ok  right  so it was the ankh .  ok  so i could walk ashore .  but that was the start  and it ain   t never got much better .  i mean  i walked ashore inside the sack  dragging the brick .  it took me three days to chew my way out .  go on .  threaten me .         please .     said carrot .   gaspode scratched his ear .      maybe i could track her down     said gaspode .     given the right  you know  encouragement .      he waggled his eyebrows encouragingly .      if you find her  i   ll give you anything you want     said carrot .      oh  well .  if .  right .  oh  yes .  that   s all very well  is if .  what about something up front .  look at these paws  hey .  wear and tear .  and this nose doesn   t smell by itself .  it is a finely tuned instrument .         if you don   t start looking right away     said carrot     i will personally       he hesitated .  he   d never been cruel to an animal in his life .      i   ll turn the matter over to corporal nobbs     he said .      that   s what i like     said gaspode bitterly .     incentive .      he pressed his blotchy nose to the ground .  it was all show  anyway .  angua   s scent hung in the air like a rainbow .      you can really talk .     said carrot .   gaspode rolled his eyes .         course not     he said .      the figure had reached the top of the tower .   lamps and candles were alight all over the city .  it was spread out below him .  ten thousand little earth bound stars   and he could turn off any one he wanted  just like that .  it was like being a god .   it was amazing how sounds were so audible up here .  it was like being a god .  he could hear the howl of dogs  the sound of voices .  occasionally one would be louder than the rest  rising up into the night sky .   this was power .  the power he had below  the power to say  do this  do that   that was just something human  but this   this was like being a god .   he pulled the gonne into position  clicked a rack of six bullets into position  and sighted at random on a light .  and then on another one .  and another one .   he really shouldn   t have let it shoot that beggar girl .  that wasn   t the plan .  guild leaders  that was poor little edward   s plan .  guild leaders  to start with .  leave the city leaderless and in turmoil  and then confront his silly candidate and say  go forth and rule  it is your destiny .   that was an old disease  that kind of thinking .  you caught it from crowns  and silly stories .  you believed   hah   you believed that some trick like  like pulling a sword from a stone was somehow a qualification for kingly office .  a sword from a stone .  the gonne was more magical than that .   he lay down  stroked the gonne  and waited .      day broke .      i never touched nuffin     said coalface  and turned over on his slab .   detritus hit him over the head with his club .      up you get  soldiers .  hand off rock and on with sock .  it another beautiful day inna watch .  lance constable coalface  on your feet  you horrible little man .      twenty minutes later a bleary eyed sergeant colon surveyed the troops .  they were slumped on the benches  except for acting constable detritus  who was sitting bolt upright with an air of official helpfulness .      right  men     colon began     now  as you           you men  you listen up good right now .     detritus boomed .      thank you  acting constable detritus     said colon wearily .     captain vimes is getting married today .  we   re going to provide a guard of honor .  that   s what we always used to do in the old days when a watchman got wed .  so i want helmets and breastplates bright and shiny .  and cohorts gleaming .  not a speck of muck   where   s corporal nobbs .      there was a dink as acting constable detritus    hand bounced off his new helmet .      hasn   t been seen for hours  sir .     he reported .   colon rolled his eyes .      and some of you will   where   s lance constable angua .      dink .     no one   s seen her since last night  sir .         all right .  we got through the night  we   re going to get through the day .  corporal carrot says we   re to look sharp .      dink .     yes  sir .         acting constable detritus .         sir .         what   s that you   ve got on your head .      dink .     acting constable cuddy made it for me  sir .  special clockwork thinking helmet .      cuddy coughed .     these big bits are cooling fins  see .  painted black .  i glommed a clockwork engine off my cousin  and this fan here blows air over       he stopped when he saw colon   s expression .      that   s what you   ve been working on all night  is it .         yes  because i reckon troll brains get too        the sergeant waved him into silence .      so we   ve got a clockwork soldier  have we .     said colon .     we   re a real model army  we are .         gaspode was geographically embarrassed .  he knew where he was  more or less .  he was somewhere beyond the shades  in the network of dock basins and cattleyards .  even though he thought of the whole city as belonging to him  this wasn   t his territory .  there were rats here almost as big as he was  and he was basically a sort of terrier shape  and ankh morpork rats were intelligent enough to recognize it .  he   d also been kicked by two horses and almost run over by a cart .  and he   d lost the scent .  she   d doubled back and forth and used rooftops and crossed the river a few times .  werewolves were instinctively good at avoiding pursuit  after all  the surviving ones were descendants of those who could outrun an angry mob .  those who couldn   t outwit a mob never had descendants  or even graves .   several times the scent petered out at a wall or a low roofed hut  and gaspode would limp around in circles until he found it again .   random thoughts wavered in his schizophrenic doggy mind .      clever dog saves the day     he muttered .     everyone says  good doggy .  no they don   t  i   m only doing it    cos i was threatened .  the marvelous nose .  i didn   t want to do this .  you shall have a bone .  i   m just flotsam on the sea of life  me .  who   s a good boy .  shut up .      the sun toiled up the sky .  down below  gaspode toiled on .      willikins opened the curtains .  sunlight poured in .  vimes groaned and sat up slowly in what remained of his bed .      good grief  man     he mumbled .     what sort of time d   you call this .         almost nine in the morning  sir     said the butler .      nine in the morning .  what sort of time is that to get up .  i don   t normally get up until the afternoon   s got the shine worn off .         but sir is not at work any more  sir .      vimes looked down at the tangle of sheets and blankets .  they were wrapped around his legs and knotted together .  then he remembered the dream .   he   d been walking around the city .   well  maybe not so much a dream as a memory .  after all  he walked the city every night .  some part of him wasn   t giving up  some part of vimes was learning to be a civilian  but an old part was marching  no  proceeding to a different beat .  he   d thought the place seemed deserted and harder to walk through than usual .      does sir wish me to shave him or will sir do it himself .         i get nervous if people hold blades near my face     said vimes .     but if you harness the horse and cart i   ll try and get to the other end of the bathroom .         very amusing  sir .      vimes had another bath  just for the novelty of it .  he was aware from a general background noise that the mansion was busily humming toward w hour .  lady sybil was devoting to her wedding all the directness of thought she   d normally apply to breeding out a tendency toward floppy ears in swamp dragons .  half a dozen cooks had been busy in the kitchens for three days .  they were roasting a whole ox and doing amazing stuff with rare fruit .  hitherto sam vimes    idea of a good meal was liver without tubes .  haute cuisine had been bits of cheese on sticks stuck into half a grapefruit .   he was vaguely aware that prospective grooms were not supposed to see putative brides on the morning of the wedding  possibly in case they took to their heels .  that was unfortunate .  he   d have liked to have talked to someone .  if he could talk to someone  it might all make sense .   he picked up the razor  and looked in the mirror at the face of captain samuel vimes .      colon saluted  and then peered at carrot .      you all right  sir .  you look like you could do with some sleep .      ten o   clock  or various attempts thereof  began to boom around the city .  carrot turned away from the window .      i   ve been out looking     he said .      three more recruits this morning already     said colon .  they   d asked to join    mr .  carrot   s army    .  he was slightly worried about that .      good .         detritus is giving    em very basic training     said colon .     it works  too .  after an hour of him shouting in their ear  they do anything i tell    em .         i want all the men we can spare up on the rooftops between the palace and the university     said carrot .      there   s assassins up there already     said colon .     and the thieves    guild have got men up there  too .         they   re thieves and assassins .  we   re not .  make sure someone   s up on the tower of art as well           sir .         yes  sergeant .         we   ve been talking   me and the lads   and  well           yes .         it   d save a lot of trouble if we went to the wizards and asked them           captain vimes never had any truck with magic .         no  but           no magic  sergeant .         yes  sir .         guard of honor all sorted out .         yes  sir .  their cohorts all gleaming in purple and gold  sir .         really .         very important  sir  good clean cohorts .  frighten the life out the enemy .         good .         but i can   t find corporal nobbs  sir .         is that a problem .         well  it means the honor guard   ll be a bit smarter  sir .         i   ve sent him on a special errand .         er   can   t find lance constable angua  either .         sergeant .      colon braced himself .  outside  the bells were dying away .      did you know she was a werewolf .         um   captain vimes kind of hinted  sir           how did he hint .      colon took a step back .      he sort of said     fred  she   s a damn werewolf .  i don   t like it any more than you do  but vetinari says we   ve got to take one of them as well  and a werewolf   s better than a vampire or a zombie  and that   s all there is to it .     that   s what he hinted .         i see .         er   sorry about that  sir .         just let   s get through the day  fred .  that   s all           abing  abing  a bing bong        we never even presented the captain with his watch     said carrot  taking it out of his pocket .     he must have gone off thinking we didn   t care .  he was probably looking forward to getting a watch .  i know it always used to be a tradition .         it   s been a busy few days  sir .  anyway  we can give it to him after the wedding .      carrot slipped the watch back into its bag .      i suppose so .  well  let   s get organized  sergeant .         corporal nobbs toiled through the darkness under the city .  his eyes had got accustomed to the gloom now .  he was dying for a smoke  but carrot had warned him about that .  just take the sack  follow the trail  bring back the body .  and don   t nick any jewelery .      people were already filing into the great hall of unseen university .   vimes had been firm about this .  it was the only thing he   d held out for .  he wasn   t exactly an atheist  because atheism was a non survival trait on a world with several thousand gods .  he just didn   t like any of them very much  and didn   t see what business it was of theirs that he was getting married .  he   d turned down any of the temples and churches  but the great hall had a sufficiently churchy look  which is what people always feel is mandatory on these occasions .  it   s not actually essential for any gods to drop in  but they should feel at home if they do .   vimes strolled down there early  because there   s nothing more useless in the world than a groom just before the wedding .  interchangeable emmas had taken over the house .   there were already a couple of ushers in place  ready to ask guests whose side they were on .   and there were a number of senior wizards hanging around .  they were automatically guests at such a society wedding  and certainly at the reception afterwards .  probably one roast ox wouldn   t be enough .   despite his deep distrust of magic  he quite liked the wizards .  they didn   t cause trouble .  at least  they didn   t cause his kind of trouble .  true  occasionally they fractured the time space continuum or took the canoe of reality too close to the white waters of chaos  but they never broke the actual law .      good morning  archchancellor     he said .   archchancellor mustrum ridcully  supreme leader of all the wizards in ankh morpork whenever they could be bothered  gave him a cheery nod .      good morning  captain     he said .     i must say you   ve got a nice day for it .         hahaha  a nice day for it .     leered the bursar .      oh dear     said ridcully     he   s off again .  can   t understand the man .  anyone got the dried frog pills .      it was a complete mystery to mustrum ridcully  a man designed by nature to live outdoors and happily slaughter anything that coughed in the bushes  why the bursar  a man designed by nature to sit in a small room somewhere  adding up figures  was so nervous .  he   d tried all sorts of things to  as he put it  buck him up .  these included practical jokes  surprise early morning runs  and leaping out at him from behind doors while wearing willie the vampire masks in order  he said  to take him out of himself .   the service itself was going to be performed by the dean  who had carefully made one up  there was no official civil marriage service in ankh morpork  other than something approximating to    oh  all right then  if you really must .     he nodded enthusiastically at vimes .      we   ve cleaned our organ especially for the occasion     he said .      hahaha  organ .     said the bursar .      and a mighty one it is  as organs go       ridcully stopped  and signalled to a couple of student wizards .     just take the bursar away and make him lie down for a while  will you .     he said .     i think someone   s been feeding him meat again .      there was a hiss from the far end of the great hall  and then a strangled squeak .  vimes stared at the monstrous array of pipes .      got eight students pumping the bellows     said ridcully  to a background of wheezes .     it   s got three keyboards and a hundred extra knobs  including twelve with     .     on them .         sounds impossible for a man to play     said vimes politely .      ah .  we had a stroke of luck there        there was a moment of sound so loud that the aural nerves shut down .  when they opened again  somewhere around the pain threshold  they could just make out the opening and extremely bent bars of fondel   s    wedding march     being played with gusto by someone who   d discovered that the instrument didn   t just have three keyboards but a whole range of special acoustic effects  ranging from flatulence to humorous chicken squawk .  the occasional    oook .     of appreciation could be heard amidst the sonic explosion .   somewhere under the table  vimes screamed at ridcully     amazing .  who built it .         i don   t know .  but it   s got the name b . s .  johnson on the keyboard cover .      there was a descending wail  one last hurdy gurdy effect  and then silence .      twenty minutes those lads were pumping up the reservoirs     said ridcully  dusting himself off as he stood up .     go easy on the vox dei stop  there   s a good chap .         ook .      the archchancellor turned back to vimes  who was wearing the standard waxen pre nuptial grimace .  the hall was filling up quite well now .      i   m not an expert on this stuff     he said     but you   ve got the ring  have you .         yes .         who   s giving away the bride .         her uncle lofthouse .  he   s a bit gaga  but she insisted .         and the best man .         what .         the best man .  you know .  he hands you the ring and has to marry the bride if you run away and so on .  the dean   s been reading up on it  haven   t you  dean .         oh  yes     said the dean  who   d spent all the previous day with lady deirdre waggon   s book of etiquette .     she   s got to marry someone once she   s turned up .  you can   t have unmarried brides flapping around the place  being a danger to society .         i completely forgot about a best man .     said vimes .   the librarian  who   d given up on the organ until it had some more puff  brightened up .      ook .         well  go and find one     said ridcully .     you   ve got nearly half an hour .         it   s not as easy as that  is it .  they don   t grow on trees .         oook .         i can   t think who to ask .         oook .      the librarian liked being best man .  you were allowed to kiss bridesmaids  and they weren   t allowed to run away .  he was really disappointed when vimes ignored him .      acting constable cuddy climbed laboriously up the steps inside the tower of art  grumbling to himself .  he knew he couldn   t complain .  they   d drawn lots because  carrot said  you shouldn   t ask the men to do anything you wouldn   t do yourself .  and he   d drawn the short straw  harhar  which meant the tallest building .  that meant if there was any trouble  he   d miss it .   he paid no attention to the thin rope dangling from the trapdoor far above .  even if he   d thought about it   so what .  it was just a rope .      gaspode looked up into the shadows .   there was a growl from somewhere in the darkness .  it was no ordinary dog growl .  early man had heard sounds like that in deep caves .   gaspode sat down .  his tail thumped uncertainly .      knew i   d find you sooner or later     he said .     the old nose  eh .  finest instrument known to dog .      there was another growl .  gaspode whimpered a bit .      the thing is     he said     the thing is   the actual thing is  see   the thing what i   ve been sent to do        late man heard sounds like that  too .  just before he became late .      i can see you   don   t want to talk right now     said gaspode .     but the thing is   now  i know what you   re thinking  is this gaspode obeyin    orders from a human .      gaspode looked conspiratorially over his shoulder  as if there could be anything worse than what was in front of him .      that   s the whole mess about being a dog  see .     he said .     that   s the thing what big fido can   t get his mind around  see .  you looked at the dogs in the guild  right .  you heard    em howl .  oh  yes  death to the humans  all right .  but under all that there   s the fear .  there   s the voice sayin     bad dog .  and it don   t come from anywhere but inside  right from inside the bones     cos humans made dogs .  i knows this .  i wish i didn   t  but there it is .  that   s the power  knowin    .  i   ve read books  i have .  well  chewed books .      the darkness was silent .      and you   re a wolf and human at the same time  right .  tricky  that .  i can see that .  bit of a dichotomy  sort of thing .  makes you kind of like a dog .     cos that   s what a dog is  really .  half a wolf and half a human .  you were right about that .  we   ve even got names .  hah .  so our bodies tell us one thing  our heads tell us another .  it   s a dog   s life  being a dog .  and i bet you can   t run away from him .  not really .  he   s your master .      the darkness was more silent .  gaspode thought he heard movement .      he wants you to come back .  the thing is  if he finds you  that   s it .  he   ll speak  and you   ll have to obey .  but if you goes back of your own accord  then it   s your decision .  you   d be happier as a human .  i mean  what can i offer you except rats and a choice of fleas .  i mean  i don   t know  i don   t see it as much of a problem  you just have to stay indoors six or seven nights every month        angua howled .   the hairs that still remained on gaspode   s back stood on end .  he tried to remember which was his jugular vein .      i don   t want to have to come in there and get you     he said .  truth rang on every word .      the thing is   the actual thing is   i will  though     he added  trembling .     it   s a bugger  bein    a dog .      he thought some more  and sighed .      oh  i remember .  it   s the one in the throat     he said .      vimes stepped out into the sunlight  except that there wasn   t much of it .  clouds were blowing in from the hub .  and        detritus .      dink .     captain vimes  sah .         who   re all these people .         watchmen  sir .      vimes stared in puzzlement at the half dozen assorted guards .      who   re you .         lance constable hrolf pyjama  sir .         and y   coalface .         i never done nuffin .         i never done nuffin  sah .     yelled detritus .      coalface .  in the watch .      dink .     corporal carrot says there   s some good buried somewhere in everyone     said detritus .      and what   s your job  detritus .      dink .     engineer in charge of deep mining operations  sah .      vimes scratched his head .      that was very nearly a joke  wasn   t it .     he said .      it this new helmet my mate cuddy made me  sir .  hah .  people can   t say  there go stupid troll .  they have to say  who that good looking military troll there  acting constable already  great future behind him  he got destiny written all over him like writing .      vimes digested this .  detritus beamed at him .      and where is sergeant colon .         here  captain vimes .         i need a best man  fred .         right  sir .  i   ll get corporal carrot .  he   s just checking the roofs           fred .  i   ve known you more than twenty years .  good grief  all you have to do is stand there .  fred  you   re good at that .      carrot appeared at the trot .      sorry i   m late  captain vimes .  er .  we really wanted this to be a surprise           what .  what sort of surprise .      carrot fished in his pouch .     well  captain   on behalf of the watch   that is  most of the watch           hold on a minute     said colon     here comes his lordship .      the clop of hooves and the rattle of harness signalled the approach of lord vetinari   s carriage .   carrot glanced around at it .  then he looked at it again .  and looked up .   there was a glint of metal  on the roof of the tower .      sergeant  who   s on the tower .     he said .      cuddy  sir .         oh .  right .     he coughed .     anyway  captain   we all clubbed together and       he paused .     acting constable cuddy  right .         yeah .  he   s reliable .      the patrician   s carriage was halfway toward sator square now .  carrot could see the thin dark figure in the back seat .   he glanced up at the great grey bulk of the tower .   he started to run .      what   s up .     said colon .  vimes started to run  too .   detritus    knuckles hit the ground as he swung after the others .   and then it hit colon   a sort of frantic tingle  as though someone had blown on his naked brain .      oh  shit     he said  under his breath .      claws scrabbled on the dirt .      he drew his sword .         what did you expect .  one minute the lad is on top of the world  he   s got a whole new interest in his life  something probably even better than goin    for walks  and then he turns round and what he sees is  basically  a wolf .  you could of hinted .  it   s that time of the month  that sort of thing .  you can   t blame him for being surprised  really .      gaspode got to his feet .     now  are you going to come on out or have i got to come in there and be brutally savaged .         lord vetinari stood up as he saw the watch running toward him .  that was why the first shot went through his thigh  instead of his chest .   then carrot cleared the door of the carriage and flung himself across the man  which is why the next shot went through carrot .      angua slunk out .   gaspode relaxed slightly .      i can   t go back     said angua .     i        she froze .  her ears twitched .      what .  what .         he   s been hurt .      angua sprang away .      here .  wait for me .     barked gaspode .     that   s the shades that way .         a third shot knocked a chip out of detritus  who slammed into the carriage  knocking it on its side and severing the traces .  the horses scrambled away .  the coachman had already made a lightning comparison between current job conditions and his rates of pay and had vanished into the crowd .   vimes slid to a halt behind the overturned carriage .  another shot spanged off the cobbles near his arm .      detritus .         sir .         how are you .         oozing a bit  sir .      a shot hit the carriage wheel above vimes    head  making it spin .      carrot .         right through my shoulder  sir .      vimes eased himself along on his elbows .      good morning  your lordship     he said  manically .  he leaned back and pulled out a mangled cigar .     got a light .      the patrician opened his eyes .      ah  captain vimes .  and what happens now .      vimes grinned .  funny  he thought  how i never feel really alive until someone tries to kill me .  that   s when you notice that the sky is blue .  actually  not very blue right now .  there   s big clouds up there .  but i   m noticing them .      we wait for one more shot     he said .     and then we run for proper cover .         i appear   to be losing a lot of blood     said lord vetinari .      who would have thought you had it in you     said vimes  with the frankness of those probably about to die .     what about you  carrot .         i can move my hand .  hurts like   heck  sir .  but you look worse .      vimes looked down .   there was blood all over his coat .      a bit of stone must have caught me     he said .     i didn   t even feel it .      he tried to form a mental picture of the gonne .   six tubes  all in a line .  each one with its lead slug and charge of no .   powder  delivered into the gonne like crossbow bolts .  he wondered how long it   d take to put in another six     but we   ve got him where we want him .  there   s only one way down out of the tower .   yep  we might be sitting out here in the open with him shooting lead pellets at us  but we   ve got him just where we want him .      wheezing and farting nervously  gaspode moved at a shambling run through the shades and saw  with a heart that sank even further  a knot of dogs ahead of him .   he pushed and squirmed through the tangle of legs .   angua was at bay in a ring of teeth .   the barking stopped .  a couple of large dogs moved aside  and big fido stepped delicately forward .      so     he said     what we have here is not a dog at all .  a spy  perhaps .  there   s always an enemy .  everywhere .  they look like dogs but  inside  they   re not dogs .  what were you doing .      angua growled .   oh lor     thought gaspode .  she could probably take down a few of    em  but these are street dogs .   he wriggled under a couple of bodies and emerged in the circle .  big fido turned his red eyed gaze on him .      and gaspode  too     said the poodle .     i might have known .         you leave her alone     said gaspode .      oh .  you   ll fight us all for her  will you .     said big fido .      i got the power     said gaspode .     you know that .  i   ll do it .  i   ll use it .         there   s no time for this .     snarled angua .      you won   t do it     said big fido .      i   ll do it .         every dog   s paw   ll be turned against you           i got the power  me .  you back off  all of you .         what power .     said butch .  he was drooling .      big fido knows     said gaspode .     he   s studied .  now  me an    her are going to walk out of here  right .  nice and slow .      the dogs looked at big fido .      get them     he said .   angua bared her teeth .   the dogs hesitated .      a wolf   s got a jaw four times stronger   n any dog     said gaspode .     and that   s just a ordinary wolf           what are you all .     snapped big fido .     you   re the pack .  no mercy .  get them .      but a pack doesn   t act like that  angua had said .  a pack is an association of free individuals .  a pack doesn   t leap because it   s told   a pack leaps because every individual  all at once  decides to leap .   a couple of the bigger dogs crouched     angua moved her head from side to side  waiting for the first assault     a dog scraped the ground with its paw     gaspode took a deep breath and adjusted his jaw .   dogs leapt .      sit .     said gaspode  in passable human .   the command bounced back and forth around the alley  and fifty percent of the animals obeyed .  in most cases  it was the hind fifty percent .  dogs in mid spring found their treacherous legs coiling under them        bad dog .         and this was followed by an overpowering sense of racial shame that made them cringe automatically  a bad move in mid air .   gaspode glanced up at angua as bewildered dogs rained around them .      i said i got the power  didn   t i .     he said .     now run .      dogs are not like cats  who amusingly tolerate humans only until someone comes up with a tin opener that can be operated with a paw .  men made dogs  they took wolves and gave them human things   unnecessary intelligence  names  a desire to belong  and a twitching inferiority complex .  all dogs dream wolf dreams  and know they   re dreaming of biting their maker .  every dog knows  deep in his heart  that he is a bad dog     but big fido   s furious yapping broke the spell .      get them .      angua galloped over the cobbles .  there was a cart at the other end of the alley .  and  beyond the cart  a wall .      not that way .     whined gaspode .   dogs were piling along behind them .  angua leapt on to the cart .      i can   t get up there .     said gaspode .     not with my leg .      she jumped down  picked him up by the scruff of his neck  and leapt back .  there was a shed roof behind the cart  a ledge above that and   a few tiles slid under her paws and tumbled into the alley   a house .      i feel sick .         futupf .      angua ran along the ridge of the roof and jumped the alley on the other side  landing heavily in some ancient thatch .      aargh .         futupf .      but the dogs were following them .  it wasn   t as though the alleys of the shades were very wide .   another narrow alley passed below .   gaspode swung perilously from the werewolf   s jaws .      they   re still behind us .      gaspode shut his eyes as angua bunched her muscles .      oh  no .  not treacle mine road .      there was a burst of acceleration followed by a moment of calmness .  gaspode shut his eyes        angua landed .  her paws scrabbled on the wet roof for a moment .  slates cascaded off into the street  and then she was bounding up to the ridge .      you can put me down right now     said gaspode .     right now this minute .  here they come .      the leading dogs arrived on the opposite roof  saw the gap  and tried to turn .  claws slid on the tiles .   angua turned  fighting for breath .  she   d tried to avoid breathing  during that first mad dash .  she   d have breathed gaspode .   they heard big fido   s irate yapping .      cowards .  that   s not twenty feet across .  that   s nothing to a wolf .      the dogs measured the distance doubtfully .  sometimes a dog has to get right down and ask himself  what species am i .      it   s easy .  i   ll show you .  look .      big fido ran back a little way  paused  turned  ran   and leapt .   there was hardly a curve to the trajectory .  the little poodle accelerated out into space  powered less by muscles than by whatever it was that burned in his soul .   his forepaws touched the slates  clawed for a moment on the slick surface  and found no hold .  in silence he skidded backward down the roof  over the edge        and hung .   he turned his eyes upward  to the dog that was gripping him .      gaspode .  is that you .         yeff     said gaspode  his mouth full .   there was hardly any weight to the poodle but  then  there was hardly any weight to gaspode .  he   d darted forward and braced his legs to take the strain  but there was nothing much to brace them against .  he slid down inexorably until his front legs were in the gutter  which began to creak .   gaspode had an amazingly clear view of the street  three stories down .      oh  hell .     said gaspode .   jaws gripped his tail .      let him go     said angua indistinctly .   gaspode tried to shake his head .      stop ftruggling .     he said  out of the corner of his mouth .     brave dog faves the day .  valiant hound in wooftop wefcue .  no .      the gutter creaked again .   it   s going to go  he thought .  story of my life     big fido struggled around .      what are you holding me up by .         yer collar     said gaspode  through his teeth .      what .  to hell with that .      the poodle tried to twist  flailing viciously at the air .      ftop it  you daft fbugger .  you   ll haf uff all off .     gaspode growled .  on the opposite roof  the dog pack watched in horror .  the gutter creaked again .   angua   s claws scored white lines on the slates .   big fido wrenched and spun  fighting the grip of the collar .   which  finally  snapped .   the dog turned in the air  hanging for a moment before gravity took hold .      free .      and then he fell .   gaspode shot backward as angua   s paws slipped from under her  and landed further up the roof  legs spinning .  both of them made it to the crest and hung there  panting .   then angua bounded away  clearing the next alley before gaspode had stopped seeing a red mist in front of his eyes .   he spat out big fido   s collar  which slid down the roof and vanished over the edge .      oh  thank you .     he shouted .     thank you very much .  yes .  leave me here  that   s right .  me with only three good legs .  don   t you worry about me .  if i   m lucky i   ll fall off before i starve .  oh yes .  story of my life .  you and me  kid .  together .  we could have made it .      he turned and looked at the dogs lining the roofs on the other side of the street .      you lot .  go home .  bad dog .     he barked .   he slithered down the other side of the roof .  there was an alley there  but it was a sheer drop .  he crept along the roof to the adjoining building  but there was no way down .  there was a balcony a story below  though .      lat   ral thinking     he muttered .     that   s the stuff .  now  a wolf  your basic wolf  he   d jump  and if he couldn   t jump  he   d be stuck .  whereas me  on account of superior intelligence  can assess the whole wossname and arrive at a solution through application of mental processes .      he nudged the gargoyle squatting on the angle of the gutter .      ot oo oo ont .         if you don   t help me down to that balcony  i   ll widdle in your ear .         big fido .      yes .      heel .      there were  eventually  two theories about the end of big fido .   the one put forward by the dog gaspode  based on observational evidence  was that his remains were picked up by foul ole ron and sold within five minutes to a furrier  and that big fido eventually saw the light of day again as a set of ear muffs and a pair of fleecy gloves .   the one believed by every other dog  based on what might tentatively be called the truth of the heart  was that he survived his fall  fled the city  and eventually led a huge pack of mountain wolves who nightly struck terror into isolated farmsteads .  it made digging in the middens and hanging around back doors for scraps seem   well  more bearable .  they were  after all  only doing it until big fido came back .   his collar was kept in a secret place and visited regularly by dogs until they forgot about it .      sergeant colon pushed open the door with the end of his pike .   the tower had floors  a long time ago .  now it was hollow all the way up  criss crossed by golden shafts of light from ancient window embrasures .   one of them  filled with glittering motes of dust  lanced down on what  not long before  had been acting constable cuddy .   colon gave the body a cautious prod .  it didn   t move .  nothing looking like that should move .  a twisted axe lay beside it .      oh  no     he breathed .   there was a thin rope  the sort the assassins used  hanging down from the heights .  it was twitching .  colon looked up at the haze  and drew his sword .   he could see all the way to the top  and there was no one on the rope .  which meant     he didn   t even look around  which saved his life .   his dive for the floor and the explosion of the gonne behind him happened at exactly the same time .  he swore afterwards that he felt the wind of the slug as it passed over his head .   then a figure stepped through the smoke and hit him very hard before escaping through the open door  into the rain .      acting constable cuddy .   cuddy brushed himself off .      oh     he said .     i see .  i didn   t think i was going to survive that .  not after the first hundred feet .      you were correct .   the unreal world of the living was already fading  but cuddy glared at the twisted remains of his axe .  it seemed to worry him far more than the twisted remains of cuddy .      and will you look at that .     he said .     my dad made that axe for me .  a fine weapon to take into the afterlife  i don   t think .      is that some kind of burial custom .      don   t you know .  you are death  aren   t you .      that doesn   t mean i have to know about burial customs .  generally  i meet people before they   re buried .  the ones i meet after they   ve been buried tend to be a bit over excited and disinclined to discuss things .   cuddy folded his arms .      if i   m not going to be properly buried     he said     i ain   t going .  my tortured soul will walk the world in torment .      it doesn   t have to .      it can if it wants to     snapped the ghost of cuddy .         detritus .  you haven   t got time to ooze .  get over to the tower .  take some people with you .      vimes reached the doorway of the great hall with the patrician over his shoulder and carrot stumbling along behind him .  the wizards were clustered around the door .  big heavy drops of rain were beginning to fall  hissing on the hot stones .   ridcully rolled up his sleeves .      hell   s bells .  what did that to his leg .         that   s the gonne for you .  sort him out .  and corporal carrot too .         there   s no need     said vetinari  trying to smile and stand up .     it   s just a flesh        the leg collapsed under him .   vimes blinked .  he   d never expected this .  the patrician was the man who always had the answers  who was never surprised .  vimes had a sense that history was flapping loose        we can handle it  sir     said carrot .     i   ve got men on the roofs  and           shut up .  stay here .  that   s an order .     vimes fumbled in his pouch and hung his badge on his torn jacket .     hey  you   pyjama .  i need a sword .      pyjama looked sullen .      i only take orders from corporal carrot           give me a sword right now  you horrible little man .  right .  thank you .  now let   s get to the tow        a shadow appeared in the doorway .   detritus walked in .   they looked at the limp shape in his hands .   he laid it carefully on a bench  without saying a word  and went and sat in a corner .  while the others gathered round the mortal remains of acting constable cuddy  the troll removed his homemade cooling helmet and sat staring at it  turning it over and over in his hands .      he was on the floor     said sergeant colon  leaning against the doorframe .     he must have been pushed off the stairs right at the top .  someone else was in there  too .  must   ve shinnied down a rope and caught me a right bang on the side of the head .         being pushed down the tower   s not worth it for a shilling     said carrot  vaguely .   it was better when the dragon came  thought vimes .  after it   d killed someone it was at least still a dragon .  it went somewhere else but you could say  that   s a dragon  that is .  it couldn   t nip over a wall and become just another person .  you always knew what you were fighting .  you didn   t have to        what   s that in cuddy   s hand .     he said .  he realized he   d been staring at it without seeing it for some time .   he tugged at it .  it was a strip of black cloth .      assassins wear that     said colon blankly .      so do lots of other people     said ridcully .     black   s black .         you   re right     said vimes .     taking any action on the basis of this would be premature .  you know  it   d probably get me fired .      he waved the cloth in front of lord vetinari .      assassins everywhere     he said     on guard .  seems they didn   t notice anything  eh .  you gave them the bloody gonne because you thought they were the best to guard it .  you never thought of giving it to the guards .         aren   t we going to give chase  corporal carrot .     said pyjama .      chase who .  chase where .     said vimes .     he hit old fred on the head and did a runner .  he could trot around a corner  chuck the gonne over a wall  and who   d know .  we don   t know who we   re looking for .         i do     said carrot .   he stood up  holding his shoulder .      it   s easy to run     he said .     we   ve done a lot of running .  but that   s not how you hunt .  you hunt by sitting still in the right place .  captain  i want the sergeant to go out there and tell people we   ve got the killer .         what .         his name is edward d   eath .  say we   ve got him in custody .  say he was caught and badly injured  but he   s alive .         but we haven   t           he   s an assassin .         we haven   t           yes  captain .  i don   t like telling lies .  but it might be worth it .  anyway  it   s not your problem  sir .         it isn   t .  why not .         you   re retiring in less than an hour .         i   m still captain right now  corporal .  so you have to tell me what   s going on .  that   s how things work .         we haven   t got time  sir .  do it  sergeant colon .         carrot  i still run the watch .  i   m the one supposed to give the orders .      carrot hung his head .      sorry  captain .         right .  so long as that   s understood .  sergeant colon .         sir .         put out the news that we   ve arrested edward d   eath .  whoever he is .         yessir .         and your next move  mr .  carrot .     said vimes .   carrot looked at the assembled wizards .      excuse me  sir .         ook .         first  we need to get into the library           first     said vimes     someone can lend me a helmet .  i don   t feel i   m at work without a helmet .  thanks  fred .  right   helmet   sword   badge .  now           there was sound under the city .  it filtered down by all sorts of routes  but it was indistinct  a hive noise .   and there was the faintest of glows .  the waters of the ankh  to use the element in its broadest sense  had washed  to bend the definition to its limit  these tunnels for centuries .   now there was an extra sound .  footsteps padded over the silt  barely perceptible unless ears had become accustomed to the background noise .  and an indistinct shape moved through the gloom  paused at a circle of darkness leading to a smaller tunnel           how do you feel  your lordship .     said corporal nobbs  the upwardly mobile .      who are you .         corporal nobbs  sir .     said nobby  saluting .      do we employ you .         yessir .         ah .  you   re the dwarf  are you .         nossir .  that was the late cuddy  sir .  i   m one of the human begins  sir .         you   re not employed as the result of any   special hiring procedures .         nossir     said nobby  proudly .      my word     said the patrician .  he was feeling a little light headed from loss of blood .  the archchancellor had also given him a long drink of something he said was a marvelous remedy  although he   d been unspecific as to what it cured .  verticality  apparently .  it was wise to remain sitting upright  though .  it was a good idea to be seen to be alive .  a lot of inquisitive people were peering around the door .  it was important to ensure that rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated .   corporal self proclaimed human nobbs and some other guards had closed in around the patrician  on captain vimes    orders .  some of them were a lot bulkier than he rather muzzily remembered .      you there  my man .  have you taken the king   s shilling .     he inquired of one .      i never took nuffin .         capital  well done .      and then the crowds scattered .  something golden and vaguely dog like burst through  growling  its nose close to the ground .  and was gone again  covering the ground to the library in long  easy strides .  the patrician was aware of conversation .      fred .         yes  nobby .         did that look a bit familiar to you .         i know what you mean .      nobby fidgeted awkwardly .      you should   ve bawled her out for not being in uniform     he said .      bit tricky  that .         if i   d run through here without me clothes on  you   d fine me a half a dollar for being improperly dressed           here   s half a dollar  nobby .  now shut up .      lord vetinari beamed at them .  then there was the guard in the corner  another of the big lumpy ones        still all right  your lordship .     said nobby .      who   s that gentleman .      he followed the patrician   s gaze .      that   s detritus the troll  sir .         why is he sitting like that .         he   s thinking  sir .         he hasn   t moved for some time .         he thinks slow  sir .      detritus stood up .  there was something about the way he did it  some hint of a mighty continent beginning a tectonic movement that would end in the fearsome creation of some unscalable mountain range  which made people stop and look .  not one of the watchers was familiar with the experience of watching mountain building  but now they had some vague idea of what it was like  it was like detritus standing up  with cuddy   s twisted axe in his hand .      but deep  sometimes     said nobby  eyeing various possible escape routes .   the troll stared at the crowd as if wondering what they were doing there .  then  arms swinging  he began to walk forward .      acting constable detritus   er   as you were       colon ventured .   detritus ignored him .  he was moving quite fast now  in the deceptive way that lava does .   he reached the wall  and punched it out of the way .      has anyone been giving him sulphur .     said nobby .   colon looked around at the guard .     lance constable bauxite .  lance constable coalface .  apprehend acting constable detritus .      the two trolls looked first at the retreating form of detritus  then at one another  and finally at sergeant colon .   bauxite managed a salute .      permission for leave to attend grandmother   s funeral  sir .         why .         it her or me  sarge .         we get our goohuloog heads kicked in     said coalface  the less circuitous thinker .      a match flared .  in the sewers  its light was like a nova .   vimes lit first his cigar  and then a lamp .      dr .  cruces .     he said .   the chief of assassins froze .      corporal carrot here has a crossbow too     he said .     i   m not sure if he   d use it .  he   s a good man .  he thinks everyone else is a good man .  i   m not .  i   m mean  nasty and tired .  and now  doctor  you   ve had time to think  you   re an intelligent man   what were you doing down here  please .  it can   t be to look for the mortal remains of young edward  because our corporal nobbs has taken him off to the watch morgue this morning  probably nicking any small items of personal jewelery he had on him  but that   s just nobby   s way .  he   s got a criminal mind  has our nobby .  but i   ll say this for him  he hasn   t got a criminal soul .      i hope he   s cleaned the clown make up off the poor chap .  dear me .  you used him  didn   t you .  he killed poor old beano  and then he got the gonne  and he was there when it killed hammerhock  he even left a bit of his beano wig in the timbers  and just when he could have done with some good advice  such as to turn himself in  you killed him .  the point  the interesting point  is that young edward couldn   t have been the man on the tower a little while ago .  not with the stab wound in his heart and everything .  i know that being dead isn   t always a barrier to quiet enjoyment in this city  but i don   t think young edward has been up and about much .  the piece of cloth was a nice touch .  but  you know  i   ve never believed in that stuff   footprints in the flower bed  tell tale buttons  stuff like that .  people think that stuff   s policing .  it   s not .  policing   s luck and slog  most of the time .  but lots of people   d believe it .  i mean  he   s been dead   what   not two days  and it   s nice and cool down here   you could haul him up  i daresay you could fool people who didn   t look too close once he was on a slab  and you   d have got the man who shot the patrician .  mind you  half the city would be fighting the other half by then  i daresay .  some more deaths would be involved .  i wonder if you   d care .     he paused .     you still haven   t said anything .         you have no understanding     said cruces .      yes .         d   eath was right .  he was mad  but he was right .         about what  dr .  cruces .     said vimes .   and then the assassin was gone  diving into a shadow .      oh  no     said vimes .   a whisper echoed around the man made cavern .      captain vimes .  one thing a good assassin learns is        there was a thunderous explosion  and the lamp disintegrated .         never stand near the light .      vimes hit the floor and rolled .  another shot hit a foot away  and he felt the splash of cold water .   there was water under him  too .   the ankh was rising and  in accordance with laws older than those of the city  the water was finding its way back up the tunnels .      carrot     vimes whispered .      yes .     the voice came from somewhere in the pitch blackness to his right .      i can   t see a thing .  i lost my night vision lighting that damn lamp .         i can feel water coming in .         we       vimes began  and stopped as he formed a mental picture of the hidden cruces aiming at a patch of sound .   i should have shot him first  he thought .  he   s an assassin .   he had to raise himself slightly to keep his face out of the rising water .   then he heard a gentle splashing .  cruces was walking toward them .   there was a scratching noise  and then light .  cruces had lit a torch  and vimes looked up to see the skinny shape in the glow .  his other hand was steadying the gonne .   something vimes had learned as a young guard drifted up from memory .  if you have to look along the shaft of an arrow from the wrong end  if a man has you entirely at his mercy  then hope like hell that man is an evil man .  because the evil like power  power over people  and they want to see you in fear .  they want you to know you   re going to die .  so they   ll talk .  they   ll gloat .   they   ll watch you squirm .  they   ll put off the moment of murder like another man will put off a good cigar .   so hope like hell your captor is an evil man .  a good man will kill you with hardly a word .   then  to his everlasting horror  he heard carrot stand up .      dr .  cruces  i arrest you for the murder of bjorn hammerhock  edward d   earth  beano the clown  lettice knibbs and acting constable cuddy of the city watch .         dear me  all those .  i   m afraid edward killed brother beano .  that was his own idea  the little fool .  he said he hadn   t meant to .  and i understand that hammerhock was killed accidentally .  a freak accident .  he poked around and the charge fired and the slug bounced off his anvil and killed him .  that   s what edward said .  he came to see me afterwards .  he was very upset .  made a clean breast of the whole thing  you know .  so i killed him .  well  what else could i do .  he was quite mad .  there   s no dealing with that sort of person .  may i suggest you step back  sire .  i   d prefer not to shoot you .  no .  not unless i have to .      it seemed to vimes that cruces was arguing with himself .  the gonne swung violently .      he was babbling     said cruces .     he said the gonne killed hammerhock .  i said  it was an accident .  and he said no  no accident  the gonne killed hammerhock .      carrot took another step forward .  cruces seemed to be in his own world now .      no .  the gonne killed the beggar girl  too .  it wasn   t me .  why should i do a thing like that .      cruces took a step back  but the gonne swung up toward carrot .  it looked to vimes as though it moved of its own accord  like an animal sniffing the air        get down .     vimes hissed .  he reached out and tried to find his crossbow .      he said the gonne was jealous .  hammerhock would have made more gonnes .  stop where you are .      carrot took another step .      i had to kill edward .  he was a romantic  he would have got it wrong .  but ankh morpork needs a king .      the gun jerked and fired at the same moment as carrot leapt sideways .      the tunnels were brilliant with smells  mostly the acrid yellows and earthy oranges of ancient drains .  and there were hardly any air currents to disturb things  the line that was cruces snaked through the heavy air .  and there was the smell of the gonne  as vivid as a wound .   i smelled gonne in the guild  she thought  just after cruces walked past .  and gaspode said that was all right  because the gonne had been in the guild   but it hadn   t been fired in the guild .  i smelled it because someone there had fired the thing .   she splashed through the water into the big cavern and saw  with her nose  the three of them   the indistinct figure that smelled of vimes  the falling figure that was carrot  the turning shape with the gonne     and then she stopped thinking with her head and let her body take over .  wolf muscle drove her forward and up into a leap  water droplets flying from her mane  her eyes fixed on cruces    neck .   the gonne fired  four times .  it didn   t miss once .   she hit the man heavily  knocking him backward .   vimes rose in an explosion of spray .      six shots .  that   s six shots  you bastard .  i   ve got you now .      cruces turned as vimes waded toward him  and scurried toward a tunnel  throwing up more spray .   vimes snatched the bow from carrot  aimed desperately and pulled the trigger .  nothing happened .      carrot .  you idiot .  you never cocked the damn thing .      vimes turned .      come on  man .  we can   t let him get away .         it   s angua  captain .         what .         she   s dead .         carrot .  listen .  can you find the way out in this stuff .  no .  so come with me .         i   can   t leave her here .  i           corporal carrot .  follow me .      vimes half ran  half waded through the rising water toward the tunnel that had swallowed cruces .  it was up a slope  he could feel the water dropping as he ran .   never give the quarry time to rest .  he   d learned that on his first day in the watch .  if you had to chase  then stay with it .  give the pursued time to stop and think and you   d go round a corner to find a sock full of sand coming the other way .   the walls and ceiling were closing in .   there were other tunnels here .  carrot had been right .  hundreds of people must have worked for years to build this .  what ankh morpork was built on was ankh morpork .   vimes stopped .   there was no sound of splashing  and tunnel mouths all around .   then there was a flash of light  up a side tunnel .   vimes scrambled toward it  and saw a pair of legs in a shaft of light from an open trapdoor .   he launched himself at them  and caught a boot just as it was disappearing into the room above .  it kicked at him  and he heard cruces hit the floor .   vimes grabbed the edge of the hatchway and struggled through it .   this wasn   t a tunnel .  it looked like a cellar .  he slipped on mud and hit a wall clammy with slime .  what was ankh morpork built on .  right     cruces was only a few yards away  scrambling and slipping up a flight of steps .  there had been a door at the top but it had long ago rotted .   there were more steps  and more rooms .  fire and flood  flood and rebuilding .  rooms had become cellars  cellars had become foundations .  it wasn   t an elegant pursuit  both men slithered and fell  clambered up again  fought their way through hanging curtains of slime .  cruces had left candles here and there .  they gave just enough light to make vimes wish they didn   t .   and then there was dry stone underfoot and this wasn   t a door  but a hole knocked through a wall .  and there were barrels  and sticks of furniture  ancient stuff that had been locked up and forgotten .   cruces was lying a few feet away  fighting for breath and hammering another rack of pipes into the gonne .  vimes managed to pull himself up on to his hands and knees  and gulped air .  there was a candle wedged into the wall nearby .      got   you     he panted .   cruces tried to get to his feet  still clutching the gonne .      you   re   too old   to run       vimes managed .   cruces made it up upright  and lurched away .  vimes thought about it .     i   m too old to run     he added  and leapt .   the two men rolled in the dust  the gonne between them .  it struck vimes much later that the last thing any man of sense would do was fight an assassin .  they had concealed weapons everywhere .  but cruces wasn   t going to let go of the gonne .  he held it grimly in both hands  trying to hit vimes with the barrel or the butt .   curiously enough  assassins learned hardly any unarmed combat .  they were generally good enough at armed combat not to need it .  gentlemen bore arms  only the lower classes used their hands .      i   ve got you     vimes panted .     you   re under arrest .  be under arrest  will you .      but cruces wouldn   t let go .  vimes didn   t dare let go  the gonne would be twisted out of his grip .  it was pulled backward and forward between them in desperate  grunting concentration .   the gonne exploded .   there was a tongue of red fire  a firework stink and a zing zing noise from three walls .  something struck vimes    helmet and zinged away toward the ceiling .   vimes stared at cruces    contorted features .  then he lowered his head and yanked the gonne hard .   the assassin screamed and let go  clutching at his nose .  vimes rolled back  gonne in both hands .   it moved .  suddenly the stock was against his shoulder and his finger was on the trigger .   you   re mine .   we don   t need him any more .   the shock of the voice was so great that he cried out .   he swore afterwards that he didn   t pull the trigger .  it moved of its own accord  pulling his finger with it .  the gonne slammed into his shoulder and a six inch hole appeared in the wall by the assassin   s head  spraying him with plaster .   vimes was vaguely aware  through the red mist rising around his vision  of cruces staggering to a door and lurching through it  slamming it behind him .   all that you hate  all that is wrong   i can put it right .   vimes reached the door  and tried the handle .  it was locked .   he brought the gonne around  not aware of thinking  and let the trigger pull his finger again .  a large area of the door and frame became a splinter bordered hole .   vimes kicked the rest of it away and followed the gonne .   he was in a passageway .  a dozen young men were looking at him in astonishment from half open doors .  they were all wearing black .   he was inside the assassins    guild .   a trainee assassin looked at vimes with his nostrils .      who are you  pray .      the gonne swung toward him .  vimes managed to haul the barrel upward just as it fired  and the shot took away a lot of ceiling .      the law  you sons of bitches .     he shouted .   they stared at him .   shoot them all .  clean up the world .      shut up .     vimes  a red eyed  dust coated  slime dripping thing from out of the earth  glared at the quaking student .      where did cruces go .     the mist rolled around his head .  his hand creaked with the effort of not firing .   the young man jerked a finger urgently toward a flight of stairs .  he   d been standing very close when the gonne fired .  plaster dust draped him like devil   s dandruff .   the gonne sped away again  dragging vimes past the boys and up the stairs  where black mud still trailed .  there was another corridor there .  doors were opening .  doors closed again after the gonne fired again  smashing a chandelier .   the corridor gave out on to a wide landing at the top of a much more impressive flight of stairs and  opposite  a big oaken door .   vimes shot the lock off  kicked at the door and then fought the gonne long enough to duck .  a crossbow bolt whirred over his head and hit someone  far down the corridor .   shoot him .  shoot him .   cruces was standing by his desk  feverishly trying to slot another bolt into his bow     vimes tried to silence the singing in his ears .   but   why not .  why not fire .  who was this man .  he   d always wanted to make the city a cleaner place  and he might as well start here .  and then people would find out what the law was     clean up the world .   noon started .   the cracked bronze bell in the teachers    guild began the chime  and had midday all to itself for at least seven clangs before the guild of bakers    clock  running fast  caught up with it .   cruces straightened up  and began to edge toward the cover of one of the stone pillars .      you can   t shoot me     he said  watching the gonne .     i know the law .  and so do you .  you   re a guard .  you can   t shoot me in cold blood .      vimes squinted along the barrel .   it   d be so easy .  the trigger tugged at his finger .   a third bell began chiming .      you can   t just kill me .  that   s the law .  and you   re a guard     dr .  cruces repeated .  he licked his dry lips .   the barrel lowered a little .  cruces almost relaxed .      yes .  i am a guard .      the barrel rose again  pointed at cruces    forehead .      but when the bells stop     said vimes  quietly     i won   t be a guard any more .      shoot him .  shoot him .   vimes forced the butt under his arm  so that he had one hand free .      we   ll do it by the rules     he said .     by the rules .  got to do it by the rules .      without looking down  he tugged his badge off the remains of his jacket .  even through the mud  it still had a gleam .  he   d always kept it polished .  when he spun it once or twice  like a coin  the copper caught the light .   cruces watched it like a cat .   the bells were slackening .  most of the towers had stopped .  now there was only the sound of the gong on the temple of small gods  and the bells of the assassins    guild  which were always fashionably late .   the gong stopped .   dr .  cruces put the crossbow  neatly and meticulously  on the desk beside him .      there .  i   ve put it down .         ah     said vimes .     but i want to make sure you don   t pick it up again .      the black bell of the assassins    guild hammered its way to noon .   and stopped .   silence slammed in like a thunderclap .   the little metallic sound as vimes    badge bounced on the floor filled it from edge to edge .   he raised the gonne and  gently  let the tension ease out of his hand .   a bell started .   it was a tinny  jolly little tune  barely to be heard at all except in this pool of silence     cling  bing  a bing  bong        but much more accurate than hourglasses  waterclocks and pendulums .      put down the gonne  captain     said carrot  climbing slowly up the stairs .   he held his sword in one hand  and the presentation watch in the other .      bing  bing  a bing  cling     vimes didn   t move .      put it down .  put it down now  captain .         i can wait out another bell     said vimes .      a bing  a bing        can   t let you do that  captain .  it   d be murder .         clong  a bing        you   ll stop me  will you .         yes .         bing   bing     vimes turned his head slightly .      he killed angua .  doesn   t that mean anything to you .         bing   bing   bing   bing     carrot nodded .      yes .  but personal isn   t the same as important .      vimes looked along his arm .  the face of dr .  cruces  mouth open in terror  pivoted on the tip of the barrel .      bing   bing   bing   bing   bing        captain vimes .         bing .      captain .  badge      captain .  it   s never had more than dirt on it .      the pounding spirit of the gonne flowing up vimes    arms met the armies of sheer stone headed vimesness surging the other way .      i should put it down  captain .  you don   t need it     said carrot  like someone speaking to a child .   vimes stared at the thing in his hands .  the screaming was muted now .      put that down now  watchman .  that   s an order .      the gonne hit the floor .  vimes saluted  and then realized what he was doing .  he blinked at carrot .      personal isn   t the same as important .     he said .      listen     cruces said     i   m sorry about the   the girl  that was an accident  but i only wanted   there   s evidence .  there   s a        cruces was hardly paying any attention to the watchmen .  he pulled a leather satchel off the table and waved it at them .      it   s here .  all of it  sire .  evidence .  edward was stupid  he thought it was all crowns and ceremony  he had no idea what he   d found .  and then  last night  it was as if           i   m not interested     mumbled vimes .      the city needs a king .         it does not need murderers     said carrot .      but        and then cruces dived for the gonne and scooped it up .   one moment vimes was trying to reassemble his thoughts  and the next they were fleeing to far corners of his consciousness .  he was looking into the mouth of the gonne .  it grinned at him .   cruces slumped against the pillar  but the gonne remained steady  pointing itself at vimes .      it   s all there  sire     he said .     everything written down .  the whole thing .  birthmarks and prophecies and genealogy and everything .  even your sword .  it   s the sword .         really .     said carrot .     may i see .      carrot lowered his sword and  to vimes    horror  walked over to the desk and pulled the bundle of documents out of the case .  cruces nodded approvingly  as if rewarding a good boy .   carrot read a page  and turned to the next one .      this is interesting     he said .      exactly .  but now we must remove this annoying policeman     said cruces .   vimes felt that he could see all the way along the tube  to the little slug of metal that was soon to launch itself at him        it   s a shame     said cruces     if only you had        carrot stepped in front of the gonne .  his arm moved in a blur .  there was hardly a sound .   pray you never face a good man  vimes thought .  he   ll kill you with hardly a word .   cruces looked down .  there was blood on his shirt .  he raised a hand to the sword hilt protruding from his chest  and looked back up into carrot   s eyes .      but why .  you could have been        and he died .  the gonne fell from his hands  and fired at the floor .   there was silence .   carrot grasped the hilt of his sword and pulled it back .  the body slumped .   vimes leaned on the table and fought to get his breath back .      damn   his   hide     he panted .      sir .         he   he called you sire     he said .     what was in that           you   re late  captain     said carrot .      late .  late .  what do you mean .     vimes fought to prevent his brain parting company with reality .      you were supposed to have been married       carrot looked at the watch  then snapped it shut and handed it to vimes .        two minutes ago .         yes  yes .  but he called you sire  i heard him           just a trick of the echo  i expect  mr .  vimes .      a thought broke through to vimes    attention .  carrot   s sword was a couple of feet long .  he   d run cruces clean through .  but cruces had been standing with his back to     vimes looked at the pillar .  it was granite  and a foot thick .  there was no cracking .  there was just a blade shaped hole  front to back .      carrot       he began .      and you look a mess  sir .  got to get you cleaned up .      carrot pulled the leather satchel toward him and slung it over his shoulder .      carrot           sir .         i order you to give           no  sir .  you can   t order me .  because you are now  sir  no offense meant  a civilian .  it   s a new life .         a civilian .      vimes rubbed his forehead .  it was all colliding in his brain now   the gonne  the sewers  carrot and the fact that he   d been operating on pure adrenalin  which soon presents its bill and does not give credit .  he sagged .      but this is my life .  carrot .  this is my job .         a hot bath and a drink  sir .  that   s what you need     said carrot .     do you a world of good .  let   s go .      vimes    gaze took in the fallen body of cruces and  then  the gonne .  he went to pick it up  and stopped himself in time .   not even the wizards had something like this .  one burst from a staff and they had to go and lie down .   no wonder no one had destroyed it .  you couldn   t destroy something as perfect as this .  it called out to something deep in the soul .  hold it in your hand  and you had power .  more power than any bow or spear   they just stored up your own muscles    power  when you thought about it .  but the gonne gave you power from outside .  you didn   t use it  it used you .  cruces had probably been a good man .  he   d probably listened kindly enough to edward  and then he   d taken the gonne  and he   d belonged to it as well .      captain vimes .  i think we   d better get that out of here     said carrot  reaching down .      whatever you do  don   t touch it .     vimes warned .      why not .  it   s only a device     said carrot .  he picked up the gonne by the barrel  regarded it for a moment  and then smashed it against the wall .  bits of metal pinwheeled away .      one of a kind     he said .     one of a kind is always special  my father used to say .  let   s be going .      he opened the door .   he shut the door .      there   s about a hundred assassins at the bottom of the stairs     he said .      how many bolts have you got for your bow .     said vimes .  he was still staring at the twisted gonne .      one .         then it   s a good thing you won   t have any chance to reload anyway .      there was a polite knock at the door .   carrot glanced at vimes  who shrugged .  he opened the door .   it was downey .  he raised an empty hand .      you can put down your weapons .  i assure you they will not be necessary .  where is dr .  cruces .      carrot pointed .      ah .     he glanced up at the two watchmen .      would you  please  leave his body with us .  we will inhume him in our crypt .      vimes pointed at the body .      he killed           and now he is dead .  and now i must ask you to leave .      downey opened the door .  assassins lined the wide stairs .  there wasn   t a weapon in sight .  but  with assassins  there didn   t need to be .   at the bottom lay the body of angua .  the watchmen walked down slowly  and carrot knelt and picked it up .   he nodded to downey .      shortly we will be sending someone to collect the body of dr .  cruces     he said .      but i thought we had agreed that           no .  it must be seen that he is dead .  things must be seen .  things mustn   t happen in the dark  or behind closed doors .         i am afraid i cannot accede to your request     said the assassin firmly .      it wasn   t a request  sir .      scores of assassins watched them walk across the courtyard .   the black gates were shut .   no one seemed about to open them .      i agree with you  but perhaps you should have put that another way     said vimes .     they don   t look at all happy        the doors shattered .  a six foot iron arrow passed carrot and vimes and removed a large section of wall on the far side of the courtyard .   a couple of blows removed the rest of the gates  and detritus stepped through .  he looked around at the assembled assassins  a red glow in his eyes .  and growled .   it dawned on the smarter assassins that there was nothing in their armory that could kill a troll .  they had fine stiletto knives  but they needed sledgehammers .  they had darts armed with exquisite poisons  none of which worked on a troll .  no one had ever thought trolls were important enough to be assassinated .  suddenly  detritus was very important indeed .  he had cuddy   s axe in one hand and his mighty crossbow in the other .   some of the brighter assassins turned and ran for it .  some were not as bright .  a couple of arrows bounced off detritus .  their owners saw his face as he turned toward them  and dropped their bows .   detritus hefted his club .      acting constable detritus .      the words rang out across the courtyard .      acting constable detritus .  atten shun .      detritus very slowly raised his hand .   dink .      you listen to me  acting constable detritus     said carrot .     if there   s a heaven for watchmen  and gods i hope there is  then acting constable cuddy is there right now  drunk as a bloody monkey  with a rat in one hand and a pint of bearhugger   s in the other  and he   s looking up  at us right now and he   s saying  my friend acting constable detritus won   t forget he   s a guard .  not detritus .      there was a long dangerous moment  and then another dink .      thank you  acting constable .  you   ll escort mr .  vimes to the university .     carrot looked around at the assassins .     good afternoon  gentlemen .  we may be back .      the three watchmen stepped over the wreckage .   vimes said nothing until they were well out in the street  and then he turned to carrot .      why did he call you           if you   ll excuse me  i   ll take her back to the watch house .      vimes looked down at angua   s corpse and felt a train of thought derail itself .  some things were too hard to think about .  he wanted a nice quiet hour somewhere to put it all together .  personal isn   t the same as important .  what sort of person could think like that .  and it dawned on him that while ankh in the past had had its share of evil rulers  and simply bad rulers  it had never yet come under the heel of a good ruler .  that might be the most terrifying prospect of all .      sir .     said carrot  politely .      uh .  we   ll bury her up at small gods  how about that .     said vimes .     it   s sort of a watch tradition           yes  sir .  you go off with detritus .  he   s all right when you give him orders .  if you don   t mind  i don   t think i   ll be along to the wedding .  you know how it is           yes .  yes  of course .  um .  carrot .     vimes blinked  to drive away suspicions that clamored for consideration .     we shouldn   t be too hard on cruces .  i hated the bastard like hell  so i want to be fair to him .  i know what the gonne does to people .  we   re all the same  to the gonne .  i   d have been just like him .         no  captain .  you put it down .      vimes smiled wanly .      they call me mister vimes     he said .      carrot walked back to the watch house  and laid the body of angua on the slab in the makeshift morgue .  rigor mortis was already setting in .   he fetched some water and cleaned her fur as best he could .   what he did next would have surprised  say  a troll or a dwarf or anyone who didn   t know about the human mind   s reaction to stressful circumstances .   he wrote his report .  he swept the main room   s floor  there was a rota  and it was his turn .  he had a wash .  he changed his shirt  and dressed the wound on his shoulder  and cleaned his armor  rubbing with wire wool and a graded series of cloths until he could  once again  see his face in it .   he heard  far off  fondel   s    wedding march    scored for monstrous organ with miscellaneous farmyard noises accompaniment .  he fished out a half bottle of rum from what sergeant colon thought was his secure hiding place  poured himself a very small amount  and drank a toast to the sound  saying     here   s to mr .  vimes and lady ramkin .     in a clear  sincere voice which would have severely embarrassed anyone who had heard it .   there was a scratching at the door .  he let gaspode in .  the little dog slunk under the table  saying nothing .   then carrot went up to his room  and sat in his chair and looked out of the window .   the afternoon wore on .  the rain stopped around teatime .   lights came on  all over the city .   presently  the moon rose .   the door opened .  angua entered  walking softly .   carrot turned  and smiled .      i wasn   t certain     he said .     but i thought  well  isn   t it only silver that kills them .  i just had to hope .         it was two days later .  the rain had set in .  it didn   t pour  it slouched out of the grey clouds  running in rivulets through the mud .  it filled the ankh  which slurped once again through its underground kingdom .  it poured from the mouths of gargoyles .  it hit the ground so hard there was a sort of mist of ricochets .   it drummed off the gravestones in the cemetery behind the temple of small gods  and into the small pit dug for acting constable cuddy .   there were always only guards at a guard   s funeral  vimes told himself .  oh  sometimes there were relatives  like lady ramkin and detritus    ruby here today  but you never got crowds .  perhaps carrot was right .  when you became a guard  you stopped being everything else .   although there were other people today  standing silently at the railings around the cemetery .  they weren   t at the funeral  but they were watching it .   there was a small priest who gave the generic fill in deceased   s name here service  designed to be vaguely satisfactory to any gods who might be listening .  then detritus lowered the coffin into the grave  and the priest threw a ceremonial handful of dirt on to the coffin  except that instead of the rattle of soil there was a very final splat .   and carrot  to vimes    surprise  made a speech .  it echoed across the soggy ground to the rain dripping trees .  it was really based around the only text you could use on this occasion  he was my friend  he was one of us  he was a good copper .   he was a good copper .  that had got said at every guard funeral vimes had ever attended .  it   d probably be said even at corporal nobbs    funeral  although everyone would have their fingers crossed behind their backs .  it was what you had to say .   vimes stared at the coffin .  and then a strange feeling came creeping over him  as insidiously as the rain trickling down the back of his neck .  it wasn   t exactly a suspicion .  if it stayed in his mind long enough it would be a suspicion  but right now it was only a faint tingle of a hunch .   he had to ask .  he   d never stop thinking about it if he didn   t at least ask .   so as they were walking away from the grave he said     corporal .         yessir .         no one   s found the gonne  then .         no  sir .         someone said you had it last .         i must have put it down somewhere .  you know how busy it all was .         yes .  oh  yes .  i   m pretty sure i saw you carry most of it out of the guild           must have done  sir .         yes .  er .  i hope you put it somewhere safe  then .  do you  er  do you think you left it somewhere safe .      behind them  the gravedigger began to shovel the wet  clinging loam of ankh morpork into the hole .      i think i must have done  sir .  don   t you .  seeing as no one has found it .  i mean  we   d soon know if anyone   d found it .         maybe it   s all for the best  corporal carrot .         i certainly hope so .         he was a good copper .         yes  sir .      vimes went for broke .      and   it seemed to me  as we were carrying that little coffin   slightly heavier    .         really  sir .  i really couldn   t say i noticed .         but at least he   s got a proper dwarf burial .         oh  yes .  i saw to that  sir     said carrot .      the rain gurgled off the roofs of the palace .  the gargoyles had taken up their stations at every corner  straining gnats and flies via their ears .   corporal carrot shook the drops off his leather rain cape and exchanged salutes with the troll on guard .  he strolled through the clerks in the outer rooms and knocked respectfully on the door of the oblong office .      come .      carrot entered  marched to the desk  saluted and stood at ease .   lord vetinari tensed  very slightly .      oh  yes     he said .     corporal carrot .  i was expecting   something like this .  i   m sure you   ve come to ask me for   something .      carrot unfolded a piece of grubby paper  and cleared his throat .      well  sir   we could do with a new dartboard .  you know .  for when we   re off duty .      the patrician blinked .  it was not often that he blinked .      i beg your pardon .         a new dartboard  sir .  it helps the men relax after their shift  sir .      vetinari recovered a little .      another one .  but you had one only last year .         it   s the librarian  sir .  nobby lets him play and he just leans a bit and hammers the darts in with his fist .  it ruins the board .  anyway  detritus threw one through it .  through the wall behind it  too .         very well .  and .         well   acting constable detritus needs to be let off having to pay for five holes in his breastplate .         granted .  tell him not to do it again .         yes  sir .  well  i think that   s about it .  except for a new kettle .      the patrician   s hand moved in front of his lips .  he was trying not to smile .      dear me .  another kettle as well .  what happened to the old one .         oh  we still use it  sir  we still use it .  but we   re going to need another because of the new arrangements .         i   m sorry .  what new arrangements .      carrot unfolded a second  and rather larger  piece of paper .      the watch to be brought up to an establishment strength of fifty six  the old watch houses at the river gate  the deosil gate and the hubwards gate to be re opened and manned on a twenty four hour basis        the patrician   s smile remained  but his face seemed to pull away from it  leaving it stranded and all alone in the world .         a department for  well  we haven   t got a name for it yet  but for looking at clues and things like dead bodies  e . g .   how long they   ve been dead  and to start with we   ll need an alchemist and possibly a ghoul provided they promise not to take anything home and eat it  a special unit using dogs  which could be very useful  and lance constable angua can deal with that since she can  um  be her own handler a lot of the time  a request here from corporal nobbs that watchmen be allowed all the weapons they can carry  although i   d be obliged if you said no to that  a        lord vetinari waved a hand .      all right  all right     he said .     i can see how this is going .  and supposing i say no .      there was another of those long  long pauses  wherein may be seen the possibilities of several different futures .      do you know  sir  i never even considered that you   d say no .         you didn   t .         no  sir .         i   m intrigued .  why not .         it   s all for the good of the city  sir .  do you know where the word    policeman    comes from .  it means    man of the city     sir .  from the old word polis .         yes .  i do know .      the patrician looked at carrot .  he seemed to be shuffling futures in his head .  then      yes .  i accede to all the requests  except the one involving corporal nobbs .  and you  i think  should be promoted to captain .         ye es .  i agree  sir .  that would be a good thing for ankh morpork .  but i will not command the watch  if that   s what you mean .         why not .         because i could command the watch .  because   people should do things because an officer tells them .  they shouldn   t do it just because corporal carrot says so .  just because corporal carrot is   good at being obeyed .     carrot   s face was carefully blank .      an interesting point .         but there used to be a rank  in the old days .  commander of the watch .  i suggest samuel vimes .      the patrician leaned back .     oh  yes     he said .     commander of the watch .  of course  that became a rather unpopular job  after all that business with lorenzo the kind .  it was a vimes who held the post in those days .  i   ve never liked to ask him if he was an ancestor .         he was  sir .  i looked it up .         would he accept .         is the high priest an offlian .  does a dragon explode in the woods .      the patrician steepled his fingers and looked at carrot over the top of them .  it was a mannerism that had unnerved many .      but  you see  captain  the trouble with sam vimes is that he upsets a lot of important people .  and i think that a commander of the watch would have to move in very exalted circles  attend guild functions        they exchanged glances .  the patrician got the best of the bargain  since carrot   s face was bigger .  both of them were trying not to grin .      an excellent choice  in fact     said the patrician .      i   d taken the liberty  sir  of drafting a letter to the cap   to mr .  vimes on your behalf .  just to save you trouble  sir .  perhaps you   d care to have a look .         you think of everything  don   t you .         i hope so  sir .      lord vetinari read the letter .  he smiled once or twice .  then he picked up his pen  signed at the bottom  and handed it back .      and is that the last of your dema   requests .      carrot scratched his ear .      there is one  actually .  i need a home for a small dog .  it must have a large garden  a warm spot by the fire  and happy laughing children .         good heavens .  really .  well  i suppose we can find one .         thank you  sir .  that   s all  i think .      the patrician stood up and limped over to the window .  it was dusk .  lights were being lit all over the city .   with his back to carrot he said     tell me  captain   this business about there being a heir to the throne   what do you think about it .         i don   t think about it  sir .  that   s all sword in a stone nonsense .  kings don   t come out of nowhere  waving a sword and putting everything right .  everyone knows that .         but there was some talk of   evidence .         no one seems to know where it is  sir .         when i spoke to captain   to commander vimes he said you   d got it .         then i must have put it down somewhere .  i   m sure i couldn   t say where  sir .         my word  i hope you absent mindedly put it down somewhere safe .         i   m sure it   s   well guarded  sir .         i think you   ve learned a lot from cap   commander vimes  captain .         sir .  my father always said i was a quick learner  sir .         perhaps the city does need a king  though .  have you considered that .         like a fish needs a   er   a thing that doesn   t work underwater  sir .         yet a king can appeal to the emotions of his subjects  captain .  in   very much the same way as you did recently  i understand .         yes  sir .  but what will he do next day .  you can   t treat people like puppet dolls .  no  sir .  mr .  vimes always said a man has got to know his limitations .  if there was a king  then the best thing he could do would be to get on with a decent day   s work           indeed .         but if there was some pressing need   then perhaps he   d think again .     carrot brightened up .     it   s a bit like being a guard  really .  when you need us  you really need us .  and when you don   t   well  best if we just walk around the streets and shout all   s well .  providing all is well  of course .         captain carrot     said lord vetinari     because we understand one another so well  and i think we do understand one another   there is something i   d like to show you .  come this way .      he led the way into the throne room  which was empty at this time of day .  as he hobbled across the wide floor he pointed ahead of him .      i expect you know what that is  captain .         oh  yes .  the golden throne of ankh morpork .         and no one has sat in it for many hundreds of years .  have you ever wondered about it .         exactly what do you mean  sir .         so much gold  when even the brass has been stripped off the brass bridge .  take a look behind the throne  will you .      carrot mounted the steps .      good grief .      the patrician looked over his shoulder .      it   s just gold foil over wood           quite so .      it was hardly even wood any more .  rot and worms had fought one another to a standstill over the last biodegradable fragment .  carrot prodded it with his sword  and part of it drifted gently away in a puff of dust .      what do you think about this  captain .      carrot stood up .      on the whole  sir  it   s probably just as well that people don   t know .         so i have always thought .  well  i will not keep you .  i   m sure you have a lot to organize .      carrot saluted .      thank you  sir .         i gather that you and  er  constable angua are getting along well .         we have a very good understanding  sir .  of course  there will be minor difficulties     said carrot     but  to look on the positive side  i   ve got someone who   s always ready for a walk around the city .      as carrot had his hand on the door handle lord vetinari called out to him .      yes  sir .      carrot looked back at the tall thin man  standing in the big bare room beside the golden throne filled with decay .      you   re a man interested in words  captain .  i   d just invite you to consider something your predecessor never fully grasped .         sir .         have you ever wondered where the word    politician    comes from .     said the patrician .         and then there   s the committee of the sunshine sanctuary     said lady ramkin  from her side of the dining table .     we must get you on that .  and the country landowners    association .  and the friendly flamethrowers    league .  cheer up .  you   ll find your time will just fill up like nobody   s business .         yes  dear     said vimes .  the days stretched ahead of him  just filling up like nobody   s business with committees and good works and   nobody   s business .  it was probably better than walking the streets .  lady sybil and mr .  vimes .   he sighed .   sybil vimes  n  e ramkin  looked at him with an expression of faint concern .  for as long as she   d known him  sam vimes had been vibrating with the internal anger of a man who wants to arrest the gods for not doing it right  and then he   d handed in his badge and he was   well  not exactly sam vimes any more .   the clock in the corner chimed eight o   clock .  vimes pulled out his presentation watch and opened it .      that clock   s five minutes fast     he said  above the tinkling chimes .  he snapped the lid shut  and read again the words on it     a watch from  your old freinds in the watch    .   carrot had been behind that  sure enough .  vimes had grown to recognize that blindness to the position of    i   s and    e   s and that wanton cruelty to the common comma .   they said goodbye to you  they took you out of the measure of your days  and they gave you a watch        excuse me  m   lady .         yes  willikins .         there is a watchman at the door  m   lady .  the tradesman   s entrance .         you sent a watchman to the tradesman   s entrance .     said lady sybil .      no  m   lady .  that   s the one he came to .  it   s captain carrot .      vimes put his hand over his eyes .     he   s been made captain and he comes to the back door     he said .     that   s carrot  that is .  bring him on in .      it was barely noticeable  except to vimes  but the butler glanced at lady ramkin for her approval .      do as your master says     she said  gallantly .      i   m no one   s mas       vimes began .      now  sam     said lady ramkin .      well  i   m not     said vimes sullenly .   carrot marched in  and stood to attention .  as usual  the room subtly became a mere background to him .      it   s all right  lad     said vimes  as nicely as he could manage .     you don   t need to salute .         yes i do  sir     said carrot .  he handed vimes an envelope .  it had the seal of the patrician on it .   vimes picked up a knife and broke the seal .      probably charging me five dollars for unnecessary wear and tear on my chainmail     he said .   his lips moved as he read .      blimey     he said eventually .     fifty six .         yes  sir .  detritus is looking forward to breaking them in .         including undead .  it says here open to all  regardless of species or mortal status           yes  sir     said carrot  firmly .     they   re all citizens .         you mean you could have vampires in the watch .         very good on night duty  sir .  and aerial surveillance .         and always useful if you want to stake out somewhere .         yes  sir .      vimes watched the feeble pun go right through carrot   s head without triggering his brain .  he turned back to the paper .      hmm .  pensions for widows  i see .         yessir .         re opening the old watch houses .         that   s what he says  sir .      vimes read on       we consider particularly that  this enlarged watch will need an expereinced man in charge who  is held in esteem by all parts of society and  we are convinced that you should fulfil this roll .  you will therefore take up your duties immediately as  commander of the ankh morpork city watch .  this post traditionally carreis with it the rank of knight which  we are minded to resurrect on this one occasion .   hoping this finds you in good health  yrs .   faithfully  havelock vetinari  patrician     vimes read it again .   he drummed his fingers on the table .  there was no doubt that the signature was genuine .  but        corp   captain carrot .         sah .     carrot stared straight ahead of him with the glistening air of one busting with duty and efficiency and an absolute resolve to duck and dodge any direct questions put to him .      i       vimes picked up the paper again  put it down  picked it up  and then passed it over to sybil .      my word .     she said .     a knighthood .  not a moment too soon  either .         oh  no .  not me .  you know what i think about the so called aristocrats in this city   apart from you  sybil  of course .         perhaps it   s about time the general stock was improved  then     said lady ramkin .      his lordship did say     said carrot     that no part of the package was negotiable  sir .  i mean  it   s all or nothing  if you understand me .         all    .         yessir .            or nothing .         yessir .      vimes drummed his fingers on the table .      you   ve won  haven   t you .     he said .     you   ve won .         sir .  don   t understand  sir     said carrot  radiating honest ignorance .   there was another dangerous silence .      but  of course     said vimes     there   s no possible way i could oversee this sort of thing .         what do you mean  sir .     said carrot .   vimes pulled the candelabra toward him and thumped the paper with a finger .      well  look what it says here .  i mean  opening those old watch houses .  on the gates .  what   s the point in that .  right out there on the edge .         oh  i   m sure matters of organization detail can be changed  sir     said carrot .      keep a general gate guard  yes  but if you   re going to have any kind of finger on the pulse of   look  you   d need one along elm street somewhere  close to the shades and the docks  and another one halfway up short street  and maybe a smaller one in kingsway .  somewhere up there  anyway .  you   ve got to think about population centers .  how many men based per watch house .         i thought ten  sir .  allowing for shifts .         no  can   t do that .  use six at most .  a corporal  say  and one other per shift .  the rest you   ll move around on  oh  a monthly rota .  you want to keep everyone on their toes  yes .  and that way everyone gets to walk every street .  that   s very important .  and   wish i had a map here   oh   thank you  dear .  right .  now  see here .  you   ve got a strength of fifty six  nominal  ok .  but you   re taking over day watch too  plus you   ve got to allow for days off  two grandmother   s funerals per year per man   gods know how your undead   ll sort out that one  maybe they get time off to go to their own funerals   and then there   s sickness and so on .  so   we want four shifts  staggered around the city .  got a light .  thanks .  we don   t want the whole guard changing shift at once .  on the other hand  you   ve got to allow each watch house officer a certain amount of initiative .  but we should maintain a special squad in pseudopolis yard for emergencies   look  give me that pencil .  now give me that notebook .  right        cigar smoke filled the room .  the little presentation watch played every quarter of an hour  entirely unheeded .   lady sybil smiled and shut the door behind her  and went to feed the dragons .          dearest mumm and dad   well here is amazing news for  i am now captain .  .  it has been a very busy and vareid week all round as  i shall now recount          and only one thing more     there was a large house in one of the nicer areas of ankh  with a spacious garden with a children   s tree house in it and  quite probably  a warm spot by the fire .   and a window  breaking     gaspode landed on the lawn  and ran like hell toward the fence .  flower scented bubbles streamed off his coat .  he was wearing a ribbon with a bow on it  and carrying in his mouth a bowl labelled mr .  huggy .   he dug his way frantically under the fence and squirmed into the road .   a fresh pile of horse droppings took care of the floral smell  and five minutes of scratching removed the bow .      not a bloody flea left     he moaned  dropping the bowl .     an    i had nearly the complete set .  whee ooo .  i   m well out of that .  huh .      gaspode brightened up .  it was tuesday .  that meant steak and suspicious organs pie at the thieves    guild  and the head cook there was known to be susceptible to a thumping tail and a penetrating stare .  and holding an empty bowl in your mouth and looking pathetic was a sure fire winner  if gaspode was any judge .  it shouldn   t take too long to claw off mr .  huggy .   perhaps this wasn   t the way it ought to be .  but it was the way it was .   on the whole  he reflected  it could have been a lot worse .       about the author   terry pratchett is one of the most popular living authors in the

discreet plaques under them modestly recording the name of the person who   d killed them .  this was the assassins    portrait gallery  after all .        from the point of view of the species as a whole .  not from the point of view of the dragon now landing in small pieces around the landscape .        fingers mazda  the first thief in the world  stole fire from the gods .  but he was unable to fence it .  it was too hot         he got really burned on that deal .        the battle of koom valley is the only one known to history where both sides ambushed each other .        there   s always one .        this is another survival trait .        because he was an early form of free thinking scientist  and did not believe that human beings had been created by some sort of divine being .  dissecting people when they were still alive tended to be a priestly preoccupation  they thought mankind had been created by some sort of divine being and wanted to have a closer look at his handiwork .        suicide  for example murder was in fact a fairly uncommon event in ankh morpork  but there were a lot of suicides .  walking in the night time alleyways of the shades was suicide .  asking for a short in a dwarf bar was suicide .  saying    got rocks in your head .     to a troll was suicide .  you could commit suicide very easily  if you weren   t careful .        a survey by the ankh morpork guild of merchants of tradespeople in the dock areas of morpork found     women who gave their profession as    seamstress .     oh   and two needles .        in fact  trolls traditionally count like this  one  two  three   many  and people assume this means they can have no grasp of higher numbers .  they don   t realize that many can be a number .  as in  one  two  three  many  many one  many two  many three  many many  many many one  many many two  many many three  many many many  many many many one  many many many two  many many many three  lots .        more usually a landlady would ask    are you decent .      but mrs .  cake knew her lodgers .        brown       and brown       it works like this .  phrenology  as everyone knows  is a way of reading someone   s character  aptitude and abilities by examining the bumps and hollows on their head .  therefore   according to the kind of logical thinking that characterizes the ankh morpork mind   it should be possible to mould someone   s character by giving them carefully graded bumps in all the right places .  you can go into a shop and order an artistic temperament with a tendency to introspection and a side order of hysteria .  what you actually get is hit on the head with a selection of different size mallets  but it creates employment and keeps the money in circulation  and that   s the main thing .        rat and cream cheese is only one of the famous discworld dishes available in cosmopolitan ankh morpork .  according to the guild of merchants    publication wellcome to ankh morpork  citie of one thousand surprises     also to be bought in its well stuffed emporia are slumpie  jammy devils  fikkun haddock  distressed pudding  clooty dumpling    and  not to be forgotten  the knuckle sandwich  made from finest pig knuckles .  not for something is it said  for a true taste of ankh morpork  try a knuckle sandwich .         not to be confused with the scottish clootie dumpling  which is a kind of suet pudding full of fruit .  the ankh morpork version sits on the tongue like finest meringue  and on the stomach like a concrete bowling ball .        wrong .  vimes didn   t travel much except on foot  and knew little of the lancre suicide thrush  for example  or the shadowing lemma  which exists in only two dimensions and eats mathematicians  or the quantum weather butterfly .  but it is possible that the strangest  and possibly saddest  species on discworld is the hermit elephant .  this creature  lacking the thick hide of its near relatives  lives in huts  moving up and building extensions as its size increases .  it   s not unknown for a traveller on the plains of howondaland to wake up in the morning in the middle of a village that wasn   t there the night before .        the axiom    honest men have nothing to fear from the police    is currently under review by the axioms appeal board .        probably no other world in the multiverse has warehouses for things which only exist in potentia  but the pork futures warehouse in ankh morpork is a product of the patrician   s rules about baseless metaphors  the literal mindedness of citizens who assume that everything must exist somewhere  and the general thinness of the fabric of reality around ankh  which is so thin that it   s as thin as a very thin thing .  the net result is that trading in pork futures   in pork that doesn   t exist yet   led to the building of the warehouse to store it in until it does .  the extremely low temperatures are caused by the imbalance in the temporal energy flow .  at least  that   s what the wizards in the high energy magic building say .  and they   ve got proper pointy hats and letters after their name  so they know what they   re talking about .        it has probably been gathered that although leonard da quirm was absolutely the greatest technological genius of all time  he was a bit of a detritus when it came to thinking up names .        it didn   t need to .  cuddy  belonging to a race that worked underground for preference  and detritus  a member of a race notoriously nocturnal  had excellent vision in the dark .  but mysterious caves and tunnels always have luminous fungi  strangely bright crystals or at a pinch merely an eldritch glow in the air  just in case a human hero comes in and needs to see in the dark .  strange but true .        rather like british rail       which can mean   well   meanings include     pardon me  you   re hanging from my rubber ring  thank you so very much        it may be just vital biomass oxygenating the planet to you  but it   s home to me    and    i   m sure there was a rain forest around here a moment ago .           who stoked the boiler .        five more embraced it as a holy weapon and instructed that it be used on all infidels  heretics  gnostics and people who fidgeted during the sermon .        it runs     he who chains down a troll  especially taking advantage of the situation to put the boot in a few times  had better not be the one who unchains it again .           and was the origin  long after the events chronicled here were over  of an ankh morpork folk song scored for tin whistle and nasal passage      as i was a walking along lower broadway   the recruiting party came picking up people by their ankles and saying they were going to volunteer to join the watch unless they wanted their goohuloog heads kicked in   so i went via peach pie street and holofernes instead   singing  too ra li  etc .      it never really caught on .        to trolls  heaven is below .
