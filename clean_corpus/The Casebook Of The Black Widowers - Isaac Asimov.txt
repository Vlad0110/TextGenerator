the casebook of the black widowers  isaac asimov  i  .  the cross of lorraine  emmanuel rubin did not  as a general rule  ever allow a look of relief to cross his face .  had one done so  it would have argued a prior feeling of uncertainty or apprehension  sensations he might feel but would certainly never admit to .   this time  however  the relief was unmistakable .  it was monthly banquet time for the black widowers  rubin was the host  and it was he who was supplying the guest  and here it was about twenty minutes after seven and only now   with but ten minutes left before the banquet was to start   only now did his guest arrive .   rubin bounded toward him  careful  however  not to spill a drop of his second drink .      gentlemen     he said  clutching the arm of the newcomer     my guest  the amazing larri   spelled l   a   r   r   i .     and in a lowered voice  over the hum of pleased   to   meet   yous     where the hell were you .      larri muttered     the subway train stalled .     then returned smiles and greetings .      pardon me     said henry  the perennial   and nonpareil   waiter at the black widower banquets     but there is not much time for the guest to have his drink before dinner begins .  would you state your preference  sir .         a good notion  that     said larri  gratefully .     thank you  waiter  and let me have a dry martini  but not too darned dry   a little damp  so to speak .         certainly  sir     said henry .   rubin said     i   ve told you  larri  that we members all have our ex officio doctorates  so now let me introduce them in nauseating detail .  this tall gentleman with the neat mustache  black eyebrows  and straight back is dr .  geoffrey avalon .  he   s a lawyer and he never smiles .  the last time he tried  he was fined for contempt of court .      avalon smiled as broadly as he could and said     you undoubtedly know manny well enough  sir  not to take him seriously .         undoubtedly     said larri .  as he and rubin stood together  they looked remarkably alike .  both were of a height   about five feet  five   both had active  inquisitive faces  both had straggly beards  though larri   s was longer and was accompanied by a fringe of hair down either side of his face as well .   rubin said     and here  dressed fit to kill anyone with a real taste for clothing  is our scribble expert .  dr .  mario gonzalo  who will insist on producing a caricature of you in which he will claim to see a resemblance .  dr .  roger halsted inflicts pain on junior   high students under the guise of teaching them what little he knows of mathematics .  dr .  james drake is a superannuated chemist who once conned someone into granting him a ph . d .  and finally .  dr .  thomas trumbull  who works for the government in an unnamed job as code expert and who spends most of his time hoping congress doesn   t find out .         manny     said trumbull wearily     if it were possible to cast a retroactive blackball  i think you could count on five .      and henry said     gentlemen  dinner is served .      it was one of those rare black widower occasions when the entree was lobster  rarer now than ever because of the increase in prices .   rubin  who as host bore the cost  shrugged it off .     i made a good paperback sale last month and we can call this a celebration .         we can celebrate     said avalon     but lobster tends to kill conversation .  the cracking of claws and shells  the extraction of meat  the dipping in melted butter  takes one   s full concentration .        and he grimaced with the effort he was putting into the compression of the nutcracker .      in that case     said the amazing larri     i shall have a monopoly on the conversation     and he grinned with satisfaction as a large platter of prime   rib roast was dexterously placed before him by henry .      larri is allergic to seafood     said rubin .   conversation was indeed subdued as avalon had predicted until the various lobsters had been clearly worsted in culinary battle  and then  finally  halsted asked     what makes you amazing  larri .         stage name     said larri .     i am a prestidigitator  an escapist extraordinaire  and the greatest living exposeur .      trumbull  who was sitting to larri   s right  formed ridges on his bronzed forehead .     what the devil do you mean by exposeur .      rubin beat a tattoo on his water glass at this point and said     no grilling till we   ve had our coffee .         for god   s sake     said trumbull     i   m just asking the definition of a word .         host   s decision is final     said rubin .   trumbull scowled blackly in rubin   s direction .     then i   ll guess the answer .  an exposeur is one who exposes fakes  people who  using trickery of one sort or another  pretend to produce effects they attribute to supernatural or paranatural forces .      larri thrust out his lower lip  raised his eyebrows  and nodded his head .     pretty good for a guess .  i couldn   t have put it better .      gonzalo said     you mean that whatever someone did by what he claimed was real magic  you could do by stage magic .         exactly     said larri .     for instance  suppose that some mystic claimed he had the capacity to bend spoons by means of unknown forces .  i can do the same by using natural force  this way .     he lifted his spoon and  holding it by its two ends  he bent it half an inch out of true .   trumbull said     that scarcely counts .  anyone can do it that way .         ah     said larri     but this spoon you saw me bend is not the amazing effect at all .  that spoon you were watching merely served to trap and focus the ethereal rays that did the real work .  those rays acted to bend your spoon .  dr .  trumbull .      trumbull looked down and picked up his spoon  which was bent nearly at right angles .     how did you do this .      larri shrugged .     would you believe ethereal forces .      drake laughed and  pushing his dismantled lobster toward the center of the table  lit a cigarette .  he said     larri did it a few minutes ago  with his hands  when you weren   t looking .      larri seemed unperturbed by exposure .     when manny banged his glass .  dr .  trumbull  you looked away .  i had rather hoped you all would .      drake said     i know better than to pay attention to manny .         but     said larri     if no one had seen me do it  would you have accepted the ethereal forces .         not a chance     said trumbull .      even if there had been no way in which you could explain the effect .  here  let me show you something .  suppose you wanted to flip a coin  .   .   .      he fell silent for a moment while henry passed out the strawberry shortcake  pushed his own out of the way  and said     suppose you wanted to flip a coin  without actually lifting it and turning it   this penny  for instance .  there are a number of ways it could be done .  the simplest would lie simply to touch it quickly  because  as you all know  a finger is always slightly sticky  especially so at mealtime  so that the coin lifts up slightly as the finger is removed and can be made to flip over .  it is tails now  you see .  touch it again and it is heads .      gonzalo said     no prestidigitation there  though .  we see it flip .         exactly     said larri     and that   s why i won   t do it that way .  let   s put something over it so that it can   t be touched or flipped .  suppose we use a  .   .   .     he looked about the table for a moment and seized a salt shaker .     suppose we use this .     he placed the salt shaker over the coin and said     now it is showing heads .   .   .   .         hold on     said gonzalo .     how do we know it   s showing heads .  it could be tails and then  when you reveal it later  you   ll say it flipped  when it was tails all along .         you   re perfectly right     said larri     and i   m glad you raised the point .  dr .  drake  you   ve got eyes that caught me before .  would you check this on behalf of the assembled company .  i   ll lift the salt shaker and you tell me what the coin shows .      drake looked and said     heads .     in his softly hoarse voice .      you   ll all take dr .  drake   s word  i hope  gentlemen .  please  watch me place the salt shaker back on the coin and make sure it doesn   t flip in the process .   .   .   .         it didn   t     said drake .      now to keep my fingers from slipping while performing this trick  i will put this paper napkin over the salt shaker .      larri molded the paper napkin neatly and carefully over the salt shaker  then said     but  in manipulating this napkin  i caused you all to divert your attention from the penny and you may think i have flipped it in the process .     he lifted the salt shaker with the paper about it and said     dr .  drake  will you check the coin again .      drake leaned toward it .     still heads     he said .   very carefully and gently  larri put back the salt shaker  the paper napkin still molded about it  and said     the coin remained as is .         still heads     said drake .      in that case  i now perform the magic .     larri pushed down on the salt shaker  and the paper collapsed .  there was nothing inside .   there was a moment of shock  and then gonzalo said     where   s the salt shaker .         in another plane of existence     said larri airily .      but you said you were going to flip the coin .         i lied .      avalon said     there   s no mystery .  he had us all concentrating on the coin as a diversion tactic .  when he picked up the salt shaker with the napkin around it to let jim look at the coin  he just dropped the salt shaker into his hand and placed the empty  molded napkin over the coin .         did you see me do that  dr .  avalon .     asked larri .      no .  i was looking at the coin  too .         then you   re just guessing     said larri .   rubin  who had not participated in the demonstration at all  but who had eaten his strawberry shortcake instead and now waited for the others to catch up  said     the tendency is to argue these things out logically and that   s impossible .  scientists and other rationalists are used to dealing with the universe  which fights fair .  faced with a mystic who does not  they find themselves maneuvered into believing nonsense and  in the end  making fools of themselves .      magicians  on the other hand     rubin went on     know what to watch for  are experienced enough not to be misdirected  and are not impressed by the apparently supernatural .  that   s why mystics generally won   t perform if they know magicians are in the audience .      coffee had been served and was being sipped at  and henry was quietly preparing the brandy  when rubin sounded the water glass and said     gentlemen  it is time for the official grilling  assuming you idiots have left anything to grill .  geoff  will you do the honors today .      avalon cleared his throat portentously and frowned down upon the amazing larri from under his dark and luxuriant eyebrows .  using his voice in the deepest of its naturally deep register  avalon said     it is customary to ask our guests to justify their existences  but if today   s guest exposes phony mystics even now and then  i  for one  consider his existence justified and will pass on .      the temptation is to ask you how you performed your little disappearing trick of a moment ago  but i quite understand that the ethics of your profession preclude your telling us .  even though everything said here is considered under the rose  and though nothing has ever leaked  i will refrain from such questions .      let me instead  then  ask after your failures .  sir  you describe yourself as an exposeur .  have there been any supposedly mystical demonstrations you have not been able to duplicate in prestidigitous manner and have not been able to account for by natural means .      larri said     i have not attempted to explain all the effects i have ever encountered or heard of  but where i have studied an effect and made an attempt to duplicate it  i have succeeded in every case .         no failures .         none .      avalon considered that  but as he prepared for the next question  gonzalo broke in .  his head was leaning on one palm  but the fingers of that hand were carefully disposed in such a way as not to disarray his hair .  he said     now  wait  larri  would it be right to suggest that you tackled only easy cases .  the really puzzling cases you might have made no attempts on .         you mean     said larri     that i shied away from anything that might spoil my perfect record or that might upset my belief in the rational order of the universe .  if so  you   re quite wrong  dr .  gonzalo .  most reports of apparent mystical powers are dull and unimportant  are crude and patently false .  i ignore those .  the cases i do take on are precisely the puzzling ones that have attracted attention because of their unusual nature and their apparent divorce from the rational .  so you see  the ones i take on are precisely those you suspect i avoid .      gonzalo subsided and avalon said     larri  the mere fact that you can duplicate a trick by prestidigitation doesn   t mean that it couldn   t have been performed by the mystic through supernatural means .  the fact that human beings can build machines that fly doesn   t mean that birds are man   made machines .         quite right     said larri     but mystics lay their claims to supernatural powers on the notion  either expressed or implicit  that there is no other way of producing the effect .  if i show that the same effect can be produced by natural means  the burden of proof then shifts to them to show that the effect can be produced after the natural means i have used are made impossible .  i don   t know of any mystic who has accepted the conditions set by professional magicians to guard against trickery and who then succeeded .         and nothing has ever puzzled you .  not even the tricks other magicians have developed .         oh yes  there are effects produced by some magicians that puzzle me in the sense that i don   t know quite how they do it .  i might duplicate it but perhaps using a different method .  in any case  that   s not the point .  as long as an effect is produced by natural means  it doesn   t matter whether i can reproduce it or not .  i am not the best magician in the world .  i am just a better magician than any mystic is .      halsted  his high forehead flushed with anxiety  and stuttering slightly in his eagerness to speak  said     but then nothing would startle you .  no disappearance like that you carried through on the salt shaker .   .   .   .         you mean that one .     asked larri  pointing .  there was a salt shaker in the middle of the table  but no one had seen it placed there .   halsted  thrown off a moment  recovered and said     have you ever been startled by any disappearance .  i heard once that magicians have made elephants disappear .         actually  making elephants disappear is childishly simple .  i assure you there   s nothing puzzling about disappearances in a magic act .     and then a peculiar look crossed larri   s face  a flash of sadness and frustration .     not in a magic act .  just .  .  .         yes .     said halsted .     just what .         just in real life     said larri  smiling and attempting to toss off the remark lightheartedly .      just a minute     said trumbull     but we don   t let that pass .  if there has been a disappearance in real life you can   t explain  we want to hear about it .      larri shook his head     no  no  dr .  trumbull .  it is not a mysterious disappearance or an inexplicable one .  nothing like that at all .  i just lost   something  and can   t find it and it   saddens me .         the details     said trumbull .         it wouldn   t be worth it     said larri .     it   s a   silly story and somewhat  .   .   .     he fell into silence .      goddamn it     thundered trumbull     we all sit here and voluntarily refrain from asking anything that might result in your being tempted to violate your ethics .  would it violate the ethics of the magician   s art for you to tell this story .         it   s not that at all .   .   .   .         well  then  sir  i repeat what geoff has told you .  everything said here is in confidence and the agreement surrounding these monthly dinners is that all questions must be answered .  manny .      rubin shrugged .     that   s the way it is  larri .  if you don   t want to answer the question  we   ll have to declare the meeting at an end .      larri sat back in his chair and looked depressed .     i can   t very well allow that to happen  considering the fine hospitality i   ve been shown .  i will tell you the story and you   ll find there   s nothing to it .  i met a woman quite accidentally  i lost touch with her  i can   t locate her .  that   s all there is .         no     said trumbull     that   s not all there is .  where and how did you meet her .  where and how did you lose touch with her .  why can   t you find her again .  we want to know the details .      gonzalo said     in tact  if you tell us the details  we may be able to help you .      larri laughed sardonically     i think not .         you   d be surprised     said gonzalo .     in the past .   .   .      avalon said     quiet  mario .  don   t make promises we might not be able to keep .  would you give us the details  sir .  i assure you we   ll do our best to help .      larri smiled wearily .     i appreciate your offer  but you will see that there is nothing you can do sitting here .      he adjusted himself in his seat and said     i was done with my performance in an upstate town   i   ll give you the details when and if you insist  but for the moment they don   t matter  except that this happened about a month ago .  i had to get to another small town some hundred fifty miles away for a morning show and that meant a little transportation problem .      my magic  unfortunately  is not the kind that can transport me a hundred fifty miles in a twinkling  or even conjure up a pair of seven   league boots .  i did not have my car with me   just as well  for i don   t like to travel the lesser roads at night when i am sleepy   and the net result was that i would have to take a bus that would make more stops than a telegram and would take nearly four hours to make the journey .  i planned to catch some sleep while on wheels and make it serve a purpose anyway .      but when things go wrong  they go wrong in battalions  so you can guess that i missed my bus and that the next one would not come along for two more hours .  there was an enclosed station in which i could wait  one that was as dreary as you could imagine   with no reading matter except for some fly   blown posters on the wall   no place to buy a paper or a cup of coffee .  i thought grimly that it was fortunate it wasn   t raining  and settled down to drowse  when my luck changed .      a woman walked in .  i   ve never been married  gentlemen  and i   ve never even had what young people today call a    meaningful relationship .     some casual attachments  perhaps  but on the whole  though it seems trite to say so  i am married to my art and find it much more satisfying than women  generally .      i had no reason to think that this woman was an improvement on others  but she had a pleasant appearance .  she was something over thirty  and was just plump enough to have a warm  comfortable look about her  and she wasn   t too tall .      she looked about and said  smiling     well  i   ve missed my bus  i see .         i smiled with her .  i liked the way she said it .  she didn   t fret or whine or act annoyed at the universe .  it was a flat  good   humored statement of fact  and just hearing it cheered me up tremendously because actually i myself was in the mood to fret and whine and act annoyed .  now i could be as good   natured as she and say .     two of us  madam  so you don   t even have the satisfaction of being unique .            so much the better     she said     we can talk and pass the time that much faster .         i was astonished .  she did not treat me as a potential rapist or as a possible thief .  god knows i am not handsome or even particularly respectable in appearance  but it was as though she had casually penetrated to my inmost character and found it satisfactory .  you have no idea how flattered i was .  if i were ten times as sleepy as i was  i would have stayed up to talk to her .      and we did talk .  inside of fifteen minutes  i knew i was having the pleasantest conversation in my life   in a crummy bus station at not much before midnight .  i can   t tell you all we talked about  but i can tell you what we didn   t talk about .  we didn   t talk about magic .      i can interest anyone by doing tricks  but then it isn   t me they   re interested in  it   s the flying fingers and the patter they like .  and while i   m willing to buy attention in that way  you don   t know how pleasant it is to get the attention without purchase .  she apparently just liked to listen to me  and i know i just liked to listen to her .      fortunately  my trip was not an all   out effort  so i didn   t have my large trunk with the show   business advertising all over it  just two rather large valises .  i told her nothing personal about myself  and asked nothing about her .  i gathered briefly that she was heading for her brother   s place  that he was right on the road  that she would have to wake him up because she had carelessly let herself be late   but she only told me that in order to say that she was glad it had happened .  she would buy my company at the price of inconveniencing her brother .  i liked that .      we didn   t talk politics or world affairs or religion or theater .  we talked people   all the funny and odd and peculiar things we had observed about people .  we laughed for two hours  during which not one other person came to join us .  i had never had anything like that happen to me  had never felt so alive and happy  and when the bus finally came at      a . m .   it was amazing how sorry i was .  i didn   t want the bus to come  i didn   t want the night to end .      when we got onto the bus  of course  it was no longer quite the same thing  even though it was sufficiently nonfull for us to find a double seat we could share .  after all  we had been alone in the station and there we could talk loudly and laugh .  on the bus we had to whisper  people were sleeping .      of course  it wasn   t all bad .  it was a nice feeling to have her so close to me  to be making contact .  despite the fact that i   m rather an old horse  i felt like a teen   ager .  enough like a teen   ager  in fact  to be embarrassed at being watched .      immediately across the way were a woman and her young son .  he was about eight years old  i should judge  and he was awake .  he kept watching me with his sharp little eyes .  i could see those eyes fixed on us every time a street light shone into the bus and it was very inhibiting .  i wished he were asleep but  of course  the excitement of being on a bus  perhaps  was keeping him awake .      the motion of the bus  the occasional whisper  the feeling of being quite out of reality  the pressure of her body against mine   it was like confusing dream and fact  and the boundary between sleep and wakefulness just vanished .  i didn   t intend to sleep  and i started awake once or twice  but then finally  when i started awake one more time  it was clear that there had been a considerable period of sleep  and the seat next to me was empty .      halsted said     i take it she had gotten off .         i didn   t think she had disappeared into thin air     said larri .     naturally  i looked about .  i couldn   t call her name  because i didn   t know her name .  she wasn   t in the rest room  because its door was swinging open .      the little boy across the aisle spoke in a rapid high treble   in french .  i can understand french reasonably well  but i didn   t have to make any effort  because his mother was now awake and she translated .  she spoke english quite well .      she said     pardon me  sir  but is it that you are looking for the woman that was with you .            yes     i said .     did you see where she got off .            not i  sir .  i was sleeping .  by my son says that she descended at the place of the cross of lorraine .         at the what .         she repeated it  and so did the child  in french .      she said     you must excuse my son  sir .  he is a great hero   worshiper of president charles de gaulle  and though he is young he knows the tale of the free french forces in the war very well .  he would not miss a sight like a cross of lorraine .  if he said he saw it  he did .         i thanked them and then went forward to the bus driver and asked him  but at that time of night  the bus stop wherever a passenger would like to get off  or get on .  he had made numerous stops and let numerous people on and off  and he didn   t know for sure where he had stopped and whom he had left off .  he was rather churlish  in fact .      avalon cleared his throat .     he may have thought you were up to no good and was deliberately withholding information to protect the passenger .         maybe     said larri despondently     but what it amounted to was that i had lost her .  when i came back to my seat  i found a little note tucked into the pocket of the jacket i had placed in the rack above .  i managed to read it by a street light at the next stop  where the french mother and son got off .  it said     thank you so much for a delightful time .  gwendolyn .         gonzalo said     you have her first name  anyway .      larri said     i would appreciate having had her last name  her address  her telephone number .  a first name is useless .         you know     said rubin     she may deliberately have withheld information because she wasn   t interested in continuing the acquaintanceship .  a romantic little interlude is one thing  a continuing danger is another .  she may be a married woman .         or she may have been offended at your falling asleep     said gonzalo .      maybe     said larri .     but if i found her  i could apologize if she were offended  or i could reassure her if she feared me  or i might cultivate her friendship if she were neither offended nor afraid .  rather that than spend the rest of my life wondering .         have you done anything about it .     asked gonzalo .      certainly     said larri  sardonically .     if a magician is faced with a disappearing woman he must understand what has happened .  i have gone over the bus route twice by car  looking for a cross of lorraine .  if i had found it  i would have gone in and asked if anyone there knew a woman by the name of gwendolyn .  i   d have described her .  i   d have gone to the local post office or the local police station  if necessary .         but you have not found a cross of lorraine  i take it     said trumbull .      i have not .      halsted said     mathematically speaking  it   s a finite problem .  you could try every post office along the whole route .      larri sighed .     if i get desperate enough  i   ll try .  but  mathematically speaking  that would be so inelegant .  why can   t i find the cross of lorraine .         the youngster might have made a mistake     said trumbull .      not a chance     said larri .     an adult  yes  but a child  riding a hobby .  never .  adults have accumulated enough irrationality to be very unreliable eyewitnesses .  a bright eight   year   old is different .  don   t try to pull any trick on a bright kid  he   ll see through it .      just the same     he went on     nowhere on the route is there a restaurant  a department store  or anything else with the name cross of lorraine .  i think i   ve checked every set of yellow pages along the entire route .         now wait a while     said avalon     that   s wrong .  the child wouldn   t have seen the words because they would have meant nothing to him .  if he spoke and read only french  as i suppose he did  he would know the phrase as croix de lorraine .  the english would have never caught his eyes .  he must have seen the symbol  the cross with the two horizontal bars  like this .     he reached out and henry obligingly handed him a menu .   avalon turned it over and on the blank back drew the following                       actually     he said     it is more properly called the patriarchal cross or the archiepiscopal cross  since it symbolized the high office of patriarchs and archbishops by doubling the bars .  you will not be surprised to hear that the papal cross has three bars .  the patriarchal cross was used as a symbol by godfrey of bouillon  who was one of the leaders of the first crusade  and since he was duke of lorraine  it came to be called the cross of lorraine .  as we all know  it was adopted as the emblem of the free french during the hitlerian war .     he coughed slightly and tried to look modest .   larri said  a little impatiently     i understand about the symbol  dr .  avalon  and i didn   t expect the youngster to note words .  i think you   ll agree  though  that any establishment calling itself the cross of lorraine would surely display the symbol along with the name .  i looked for the name in the yellow pages  but for the symbol on the road .         and you didn   t find it .     said gonzalo .      as i   ve already said  i didn   t .  i was desperate enough to consider things i didn   t think the kid could possibly have seen at night .  i thought  who knows how sharp young eyes are and how readily they may see something that represents an overriding interest .  so i looked at signs in windows  at street signs   even at graffiti  damn it .         if it were a graffito     said trumbull     then  of course  it could have been erased between the time the child saw it  and the time you came to look for it .         i   m not sure of that     said rubin .     it   s my experience that graffiti are never erased .  we   ve got some on the outside of our apartment house .   .   .   .         that   s new york     said trumbull .     in smaller towns  there   s less tolerance for these evidences of anarchy .         hold on     said gonzalo .     what makes you think graffiti are necessarily signs of anarchy .  as a matter of fact .   .   .         gentlemen .  gentlemen .     and as always  when avalon   s voice was raised to its full baritone splendor  a silence fell .     we are not here to argue the merits and demerits of graffiti .  the question is  how can we find this woman who disappeared .  larri has found no restaurant or other establishment with the name of cross of lorraine  he has found no evidence of the symbol along the route taken .  can we help .      drake held up his hand and squinted through the curling smoke of his cigarette .     hold on  there   s no problem .  have you ever seen a russian orthodox church .  do you know what its cross is like .     he made quick marks on the back of the menu and shoved it toward the center of the table .     here .   .   .   .      he said     the kid  being hipped on the free french  would take a quick look at that and see it as the cross of lorraine .  so what you have to do  larri  is look for some russian orthodox church en route .  i doubt that there would be more than one .      larri thought about it  but did not seem overjoyed .     the cross with that second bar set at an angle would be on the top of the spire  wouldn   t it .         i imagine so .         and it wouldn   t be floodlighted  would it .  how would the child be able to see it at four o   clock in the morning .      drake stubbed out his cigarette .     well  now  churches usually have bulletin board affairs near the entrance .  i don   t know  there could have been a russian orthodox cross on the  .   .   .         i would have seen it     said larri firmly .      could it have been a red cross .     asked gonzalo feebly .     you know  there might be a red cross headquarters along the route .         the red cross     said rubin     is a greek cross with all four arms equal .  i don   t see how that could possibly be mistaken for a cross of lorraine by a free french enthusiast .  look at it  .   .   .      halsted said     the logical thing  i suppose  is that you simply missed it  larri .  if you insist that  as a magician  you   re such a trained observer that you couldn   t have missed it  which sounds impossible to me  then maybe it was a symbol on something movable   on a truck in a driveway  for instance   and it moved on after sunrise .         the boy made it quite clear that it was at the place of the cross of lorraine     said larri .     i suppose even an eight   year   old can tell the difference between a place and a movable object .         he spoke french .  maybe you mistranslated .         i   m not that bad at the language     said larri     and his mother translated and french is her native tongue .         but english isn   t .  she might have gotten it wrong .  the kid might have said something else .  he might not even have said the cross of lorraine .      avalon raised his hand for silence and said     one moment  gentlemen  i see henry  our esteemed waiter  smiling .  what is it  henry .      henry  from his place at the sideboard  said     i   m afraid that i am amused at your doubting the child   s evidence .  it is quite certain  in my opinion  that he did see the cross of lorraine .      there was a moment   s silence and larri said     how can you tell that  henry .         by not being oversubtle  sir .      avalon   s voice boomed out .     i knew it .  we   re being too complicated .  henry  how is it possible to gain greater simplicity .         why  mr .  avalon  the incident took place at night .  instead of looking at all signs  all places  all varieties of cross  why not begin by asking ourselves what very few things can be easily seen on a highway at night .         a cross of lorraine .     asked gonzalo incredulously .      certainly     said henry     among other things .  especially if we don   t call it a cross of lorraine .  what the youngster saw as a cross of lorraine  out of his special interest  we would see as something else so clearly that its relationship to the cross of lorraine would be invisible .  what has been happening just now has been precisely what happened earlier with mr .  larri   s trick with the coin and salt shaker .  we concentrated on the coin and didn   t watch the salt shaker  and now we concentrate on the cross of lorraine and don   t look for the alternative .      trumbull said     henry  if you don   t stop talking in riddles  you   re fired .  what the hell is the cross of lorraine  if it isn   t the cross of lorraine .      henry said gravely     what is this .     and carefully he drew on the back of the menu  .   .   .   trumbull said     a cross of lorraine   tilted .         no  sir  you would never have thought so  if we hadn   t been talking about the cross .  those are english letters and a very common symbol on highways if you add something to it .   .  .  .  he wrote quickly and the tilted cross became   exxon     the one thing     said henry     that is designed to be seen  without trouble  day or night  on any highway is a gas   station sign .  the child saw the cross of lorraine in this one  but mr .  larri  retracing the route  sees only a double x  since he reads the entire word as exxon .  all signs showing this name  whether on the highway  in advertisements  or on credit cards  show the name in this fashion .      now larri caught fire .     you mean  henry  that if i go into the exxon stations en route and ask for gwendolyn  .   .   .         the proprietor of one of them is likely to be her brother  and there would not be more than five or six at most to inquire at .         good god  henry     said larri     you   re a magician .         merely simpleminded     said henry     though perhaps in the nonperjorative sense .         the cross of lorraine      afterword  eleanor sullivan  the delightful managing editor of ellery queen   s mystery magazine  who was the first to see the story after i had written it  was struck by the fact that although she had seen the sign    exxon    any number of times  she had never noticed the cross of lorraine it incorporated .   she decided to try an experiment .  not long after she had read the story  she was driving her car with a friend as passenger .   she said     there   s a prominent cross of lorraine on some of the signs of the highway .  can you point it out to me .      the passenger knew what a cross of lorraine was and began to look .   it must have acted as a damper on conversation  i suspect  though eleanor did not say so .    eleanor even made it easier by deliberately driving into an exxon gasoline station in order to tank up  but the passenger never saw it .  in the end eleanor had to explain .   it   s not surprising  really .  you don   t necessarily see what there is to see  you see what you expect to see .  you know there are two x   s in exxon and that   s all you expect to see and all you do see .      the cross of lorraine    appeared in the may      eqmm .     .  the family man  mario gonzalo  the artist member of the black widowers  seemed oddly disheveled as he said vehemently     i cannot teach what i do because i don   t know what i do  but that doesn   t mean i can   t do it .      and emmanuel rubin  his straggly beard seeming to shoot sparks out of each gray bristle  bent his eyes  magnified through the thick lenses before them  at gonzalo and said     if you don   t know what you   re doing  you   re a paint dauber and not an artist .         you   re a madman  manny .  if knowing were everything  michelangelo could teach you to be michelangelo  but the fact is that michelangelo couldn   t teach anyone to be michelangelo .  for that matter  no one could have taught michelangelo to be michelangelo either .  he was born michelangelo .         you miss the entire point .  teaching doesn   t necessarily imply the making of an equal .  michelangelo could give the kind of instruction from which others might profit .  if he couldn   t create equals  he could create somewhat less miserable marble tappers .  you bet he knew what he was doing even if he could only pound a limited amount into the heads of mere mortals .         ah     said gonzalo gleefully     mere mortals .  and what made them mere mortals .  the lack of genius .  and what were the components of that genius .  could michelangelo himself know .      thomas trumbull  staring over his scotch and soda  and apparently irritated at being excluded from a conversation that the loud voices of gonzalo and rubin had made into a private dialog  scowled and said     since michelangelo is dead and can   t be consulted on the subject  why don   t we drop this foolish argument .         no     said gonzalo passionately     i appeal from the sublime to the ridiculous and ask manny .  you   re a writer  manny   after a fashion .  can you teach what you do .         i not only can     said rubin     i have .  i   ve written articles for the writer and i   ve lectured at writers    conferences .         and you   ve told them about query letters  and the necessity of rewriting  i suppose .  do you tell them how you know where you start your story  just which incident you put after which  how you break up your dialog  how you make the denouement inevitable without giving it away .         i could do that .         then do it right now .  explain it to me .      roger halsted  flushing to the roots of his receding line of hair  said  in his soft voice     don   t do it  manny .  we   ll be sitting here all night and none of us is interested .  not even mario .         i won   t   but i can .         you can   t     said gonzalo     because you can   t describe the intuition involved .  enough intuition is talent  and a hell of a lot of it is genius  and intuition can   t be taught .      geoffrey avalon  standing tall  said in his solemn baritone     you stand with the greeks  mario .  they were quite certain that any outstanding ability was the result of divine inspiration  the working of a god who possessed the person .  the word    enthusiasm     expressing this process  means    the god within    in greek .  naturally  one can   t explain the workings of a god to a mere mortal  and that  i take it  is your position  mario .         bull .     said rubin .     bull to you  geoff  and to mario and to the greeks .  there is nothing mysterious about intuition at all .         if you can understand it     said mario     explain it .         i will     said rubin .     all a man knows is what he observes and learns .  there is nothing innate except a few biological instincts   certainly nothing cultural .  it may be that with experience   with experience  damn you  mario   a person learns to interpret  very rapidly  what he observes  or to draw inferences  or to do something based on deduction or induction from those observations and his past experience .  he does it so rapidly that he generally doesn   t bother to isolate the step in the procedure or even to be aware they exist  so he calls it intuition .  yes  henry .      henry  the perennial waiter at the black widowers    monthly dinner meetings  his bland and uncreased sixtyish face displaying no emotion  said  gently     dinner is served  mr .  rubin .  it you will sit down  i am sure the rest will follow .      rubin said     i suppose i am the natural leader .         no     said james drake  stubbing out his cigarette     as host today  i   m the leader .  however  the rest of us are naturally afraid you   ll eat everything in sight if we don   t all sit down to protect our rights .         that depends     said rubin     on what we are having today .  henry .      henry said     the chef is in an old english mood today and it will be rib roast and yorkshire pudding  preceded by a seafood quiche .         that   s not old english     said rubin .      the chef is rarely entirely consistent     said henry     and i   m afraid his judgment of what will constitute a success for dinner is largely intuitive .         and largely right  too     said gonzalo  approving .     whatever you say intuition is  manny  some people have more of it than others  and why is that .         some people have more talent than  .   .   .         aha .     said gonzalo .   rubin looked haughty and said with stiff politeness     if i am to be allowed to finish my sentence  i will go on to explain that talent is the capacity for such fast thought  plus  perhaps  muscular deftness  and undoubtedly depends on the physiology of the brain and on nothing more mysterious than that .         that   s mysterious enough     said drake .      mysterious now  but not necessarily forever     said rubin     and when we learn enough about the brain  talent and genius will be as nonmysterious as eye color .         that   s just your intuitive guess     shot back gonzalo .   rubin   s reply was lost in quiche  and the dinner conversation grew more general .   through all the argument  the guest of the evening had maintained a steady and clearly amused silence .  quietly  he listened and as quietly  he sipped at his martini .   his name was simon alexander .  his black hair and black mustache  each thick and luxuriant enough to give him a satanic appearance  or  failing that  a levantine one  were his most prominent features .  the small and persistent smile on his face seemed to accentuate the satanism .   when the coffee was served  however  and drake tapped his spoon against the water glass  alexander  as though in anticipation  grew serious .   drake said     gentlemen  it is time to grill our esteemed guest  and manny  since you   ve been clattering away more insupportably even than usual  suppose you supervise the grilling .      rubin said     i   m sorry you find mental stimulation insupportable  jim  but i   m not surprised .     he took a quick sip at his coffee  signaled henry for a bit of a freshener  then said      well  mr .  alexander  or  if you prefer  simon  how do you justify your existence .      alexander   s smile returned .     by seeing to it that the american people pay their legal taxes in full and on time .      there was a stir about the table  and even henry was betrayed into pausing in the precise performance of his duties long enough to cast a penetrating glance at the guest .   trumbull said  with a distinct suggestion of outrage     are you in the employ of the irs .         i am     said alexander .     i   m in the division of fraud .         good god     said trumbull     and you offer that as justification for your existence .  horse   whipping with barbed wire is what it justifies .     he cast a lowering glance at drake .   drake said     give him a chance  tom .  it takes all kinds to make a world and  aside from his profession  simon is one of nature   s noblemen .      alexander waved his hand .     it   s all right  jim .  tax collectors have always been the favorite villains of humanity from the moment they first appeared on scene in ancient sumeria five thousand years ago and invented writing in order to keep score .  besides  i think mr .  trumbull was merely expressing himself colorfully and didn   t really mean it .         the hell i didn   t     muttered trumbull .   rubin  who had held his peace in a markedly aggrieved manner  now raised his voice     since i   m grilling today  may i continue .  do you mind keeping quiet  tom .      trumbull said     circumstances moved me .      rubin waited for silence and said     mr .  alexander   i withdraw the simon  since through the common law of humanity  you can have no friends here  or possibly anywhere   how can your role in tax collection be taken as justifying your existence .      alexander said     i think it is not difficult to see that the irs represents the single essential arm of the government .  presidents can die and be replaced at once  with but a slight and perfunctory hiccup of emotion .  congress can bumble  the supreme court can drag  and we can lose ground diplomatically  economically even militarily  yet perhaps make it all up afterward .  natural disasters are local  temporary  and pass by .      however  let the tax structure of the nation falter and the government can no longer function .  that would mean a spreading paralysis far wider and longer and deeper than anything that can possibly occur short of a thermonuclear war .      rubin said     but the tax structure is not likely to falter  is it .         not in the sense that the physical machinery is likely to break apart or that the computers will stop working .  no  the weak link is the taxpayer himself .  the american budget now approaches half a trillion dollars annually  and the largest part of this is collected out of the unwilling wallets of americans everywhere .         sorry  manny     said trumbull angrily     but i   ve got to interrupt .  what the hell has    unwilling    got to do with it .  you enforce your own interpretation of the rules  act as prosecuting attorney and judge  hound us relentlessly  treat us as guilty till we prove ourselves innocent  and are perfectly ready to jail us if you can .  what do you care if we   re unwilling .         in the first place     said alexander     our judgments can be appealed to the courts .  we are not the last word .  second  it would be much more harmful if we were not relentless .  despite everything we do  we cannot audit everyone  we cannot check into everything .  if we tried  the cost would far outweigh what additional money we could collect .  no  we are forced to depend on the average american filling out a reasonably honest return and we can count on this only as long as that average american is convinced of the essential honesty of the system .  within the bounds of the law   and the law is not completely equitable  but that   s not our fault   we must show neither favor nor mercy or the structure will break down .      thus  although al capone could commit theft on a grand scale and could murder with impunity  he could be grabbed on income   tax evasion .  there is nothing ironical in this .  income   tax evasion is the greatest of these .  similarly  nothing that nixon and agnew did prior to their forced resignations was as mischievous as their tampering with the irs and their making out of dubious income   tax returns .  that they were willing to shake the faith of the american people in the honesty of the tax structure was of all their misdeeds the most unforgivable .      rubin said     you   re serious about this now .  you   re not pulling our legs .         dead serious .         good god  jim     rubin said     we ought to ask for your resignation .  you   ve brought in a guy who   s going to make it difficult for me to indulge in a little bit of honest expense   padding next time around .      avalon cleared his throat .     i don   t consciously pad  but i must admit that the irs and i might not agree on just what constitutes a deductible expense in the first place .         then you deduct it till we tell you otherwise     said alexander  agreeably .     that   s the tax man   s version of keeping you innocent till proven guilty   but none of this is what i came here prepared to talk about .         oh     said rubin     what are you prepared for .         jim told me     said alexander     that the black widowers like to hear some tale that involves a bit of a puzzle  and i happen to have one .         jim was wrong to tell you that     said avalon  austerely .     we meet for the purpose of participating in stimulating conversation  and a puzzle is not necessary  however       alexander smiled .     in that connection  i was amused by the preprandial quarrel over the nature of intuition  since it is with a matter of intuition that my story is concerned .         telepathy .     said gonzalo at once .      no  i think not     said alexander .     the whole conversation illustrated mr .  rubin   s thesis  actually .  i agree with him that intuition is undetected observation and deduction  and i would like to point out that what is often considered telepathy is the same .  thus  when jim introduced me  he said   and i think these are his exact words        this is simon alexander  an investigator of sorts and a very good one .  he can actually sense criminality by some kind of inner magic  i think .     isn   t that what you said  jim .         i think so     said drake .      i notice you said     an investigator of sorts        growled trumbull .     you didn   t say he was from the irs .      alexander said     i am trying to make the point that the introduction took place when the drinks were being passed around   as the brandy is now  i see .  henry  do we have any curacao .         i believe so  sir .         i   ll have some then .  with everyone concentrating on alcohol  i don   t think anyone heard the introduction .  does anyone recall having heard it .      there were no bites on that one  and alexander smoothed his mustache with one forefinger and accepted the small glass with its orange   colored content from henry .      but it rubin and gonzalo did not consciously hear it     he said     they nevertheless heard it  i   m convinced  and that bit about sensing criminality by some kind of inner magic sparked the argument on intuition .  of course  i don   t use some kind of inner magic  i use reason  and i am always quite conscious of the details of the reasoning .  except once  .   .   .     he looked thoughtful .   drake lit a cigarette from the dying stub of hid old one and said     tell us  simon .         i intend to     said alexander     but it has a certain personal confidentiality about it .  i have been given to understand that everything that goes on here is confidential .         everything .     said trumbull pointedly     and that includes everything we say .  we take it for granted that nothing you hear here can be used against us as tar as our taxes are concerned .         agreed     said alexander     but please be careful what you say  as i would rather not be asked to place too great a load on my integrity .      alexander sipped at his curacao  looked pensive  and  for some reason  particularly satanic .      you know  of course     he said     that computers are now the lifeblood of t lie irs .  we couldn   t operate without them .  because they never hesitate  never tire  never grow bored  they are our great strength .  because they never think  they are our great weakness .      to exploit a computer  however  and take advantage of its weakness  we must know every detail of a computer   s working  and this eliminates almost all the human race .  and it puts us off our guard .      some years ago  the irs was royally diddled by someone who knew his computers  by a mathematician who was tired of the type of remuneration that mathematicians receive .      halsted  who taught mathematics at a junior high school  sighed and said     i know the type .         the long details of his operation don   t concern you  but he managed to get a job that would involve the servicing of certain of our computers .  for the purpose  he built himself a new statistical background  a new name  a new appearance  all the way down to a new social security number .  how he managed that i won   t tell you since  confidentiality or not  there is no point in spreading knowledge of the techniques of successful knavery .         i agree     said avalon  nodding .      nor     said alexander     will i tell you exactly how he managed to reprogram one key computer   for in that case  i don   t understand it myself .  i am no mathematician .  still it was done .  for a period of five years  our mathematician   let us call him johnson  to save syllables   received large tax refunds while paying no taxes .  he received more money in that interval than he could have earned in a lifetime of honest endeavor .      he might still be receiving the money but for the accidental uncovering of an inconsistency in the program .  the detection was the result of a most unusual coincidence  and i assure you the irs could not have been more dismayed  or embarrassed  at the event .  naturally  two things were at once essential .  the money leak must be stopped and the computer programs so modified as to make the johnson type of knavery impossible in the future .  that was carried through at once in the greatest secrecy .  the secrecy was needed not so much to keep individual officials from looking personally ridiculous  though that was a factor  but to keep the service itself from losing the confidence of the american people .         they will never learn the truth from any of us     said gonzalo  with suspiciously intense gravity     i assure you .         the second thing     alexander went on     was to catch johnson  make him disgorge what money was left  and clap him in jail for as long as ever the law would allow .  it was the al capone reasoning  you see .  johnson might get away with murder without shaking the foundation of american civilization  but he could not be allowed to get away with income   tax fraud .  and that was where i came in .  i was placed on the case .      my reputation in the service is  perhaps  an exaggerated one .  more than one person there suspects  as jim told you  that i solve my cases with some inner magic  with some mysterious intuitive faculty that defies analysis .  it has been said among us  for instance  that i can look at a tax return that seems clean enough to have been etched in snowflakes and yet tell that somewhere money was clinging to fingers that smelled of garbage .  or that i could interview a person and know for certain that there was a thief hidden behind the saint .      actually  there was no magic in it at all .  i have a certain cleverness at observation and reasoning and a great deal of experience .  my memory is excellent and i have encountered all varieties of behavior patterns   and all the ways of laundering returns  too .  what seems like magic or intuition boils down to noting small things that others don   t and attaching the proper importance to those things .      it works the other way around  too .  i can often detect the saint beneath the thief .  i am quite certain  for instance  that you  mr .  trumbull  are not short on your returns by even as much as fifty dollars .  i suspect that you are ashamed of your relative honesty  and take it out by vilifying the office you dare not defraud .  and that   s not a guess  i   ve met others like you .      it was hard for trumbull to flush through his tan  but his expression made the flush unnecessary .   avalon said     i   m afraid your reputation is ruined  tom .  please go on  mr .  alexander .         to put it in figures  in nearly a quarter of a century at my job  i have almost never pointed a finger in the direction of either guilt or innocence and been proven entirely wrong .         a quarter of a century .     said avalon .     how old are you  mr .  alexander .         fifty   two .         you don   t look it     and avalon   s finger went unconsciously to his own graying mustache .   alexander said     there   s gray in my hair  too  but i touch it up a little .  not so much out of vanity  you understand  as because the darkness seems to give me a forbidding appearance that is useful to me in my line of work .  however  .  .  .         johnson was not an easy quarry .  he could tell  somehow  that the game was up  and when the next refund came   this time under the eyes of the service   it remained uncollected .  it   s not impossible he had an ally within the service  but never mind that .  tracing him wasn   t easy .  he had quit his job long before and all records we had concerning him were false  down to his social security number  which  we suddenly discovered  was attached to no human being .      i was forced to follow the most evanescent clues and to build up the picture of the human being who had done the deed .  we left absolutely nothing unturned that might lead us to the identity of the thief and we finally had several possibilities  all dim and uncertain .  different operatives were assigned to each one .  the task was somehow to locate enough evidence to warrant a concentration of forces  a full   scale investigation of one particular man   an arrest  of course  if possible .      my own target was a rather mousey man of average weight and height and of undistinguished appearance .  that  in itself  was a good sign  because the job had had to be carried through by someone who could be unnoticeable at crucial moments .  he had a vague background that could not easily be traced without tipping our hand too soon   again a hopeful circumstance .  at crucial periods  he seemed to be particularly untraceable .      unfortunately  all this was negative and such things could never be made to stick .  we needed some positive correspondence .  we had to locate him at the site of action each time  prove computer expertise  and so on .  for that  i haunted him like the ghost of a vulture .      in fact  i managed to collect a circle of mild acquaintances that i held in common with him  and i labored to be present at social gatherings along with him .      then  at one gathering in early november  where both of us were present  he quiet and watchful  nursing a single drink for an hour  and i almost as quiet  certainly as watchful  and as abstemious  the host spoke of halloween .  he had a seven   year   old daughter who had gone out trick   or   treating  along with several older friends  and who had come back in ecstasies .      that rang true for me  for i remembered very well my own daughter   s first experience of the sort and i said     yes  i have always thought that  were it not for the enormous commercial overweighting of the yuletide  a child   s spontaneous reaction would be to treat halloween with the full excitement of christmas .         and  surprisingly  my quarry spoke up .  as though overwhelmed by an emotion that forced his naturally quiet personality into the limelight  he said  with a warm smile that lightened and almost transfigured his face     you are quite right .  in a way  halloween may be considered precisely equal to christmas .     those were his exact words  gentlemen  for i noted them at the time with particular care .      rubin asked     why .         because  as a result of that comment  i instantly and completely eliminated him as a suspect .  so certain was i that i remember having the distinct impulse to clap him on the shoulder and invite him out for a drink to celebrate his innocence .  i couldn   t  though  for i suppose his own unexpected warmth had scared him .  as soon as he made the remark  he flushed  looked frightened  and melted away .  my own attention was distracted for a moment  and when i turned to find him  he was gone .      alexander paused and finished his last bit of curacao .  he said     at the time  my sudden conviction of innocence might have seemed pure intuition   even to myself   but it wasn   t  of course .  i cling to rubin   s hypothesis the intuition is undetected reasoning .  here is the reasoning as i worked it out later .      working laboriously from the tiniest beginnings  we had drawn a picture of our criminal  this johnson .  he was a mathematician and had no family .  the chances were that he was not only unmarried and childless  but also that he had no siblings and that his parents may have died while he was young .  he was cold  utterly cold   and i don   t mean by that that he was ruthless and sadistic   merely that he lacked any occasion or desire for love and affection .  let me put it in a way that has great significance for me .  he was not  in any way  a family man .      halsted pleated the tablecloth absently and said     you  i take it  are a family man .         completely .  my parents  two brothers  and a sister all live  and we are all close .  i married a childhood sweetheart  have three children  and a grandson newly born  plus nieces and nephews .  i know the emotions of a family man and no one  no one  could have spoken with such genuine warmth of children   s holidays unless he had experienced the kind of love and affection that accompanies those days .  my quarry spoke that way  johnson could not have  conclusion  my quarry was not johnson and was innocent .  what seemed like intuition was  after all  reason .      intuition or reason  i reported my belief in his innocence to my superiors  and the tracking of the remaining possibilities grew correspondingly more intense .  five months later we caught the criminal  and he is now in prison and likely to remain there a long time .  some of the money has been recovered  not all  of course .      he paused and avalon broke the short silence that followed  saying     i am delighted to have a happy ending for the department  but you spoke of a puzzle and i see none .      simon alexander sighed     the happy ending is a qualified one .  having dismissed my suspect  we nevertheless found the other suspects fading as well .  one after another  they proved to be incompatible with the conditions of the fraud .  one day  out of nothing but desperation  i returned to my own dismissed suspect and  in the interval  something unexpected that had arisen cast a new light on affairs .  astounded  i followed it up and had him   my own suspect whose innocence i had previously maintained and  virtually  guaranteed .  he was the criminal after all .      what puzzles me and  even now  keeps me awake occasionally  is the incongruity of it .  he did indeed turn out to be what we had suspected he was   a man without family  love  or affection .  yet his remark about christmas and halloween  and the tone in which it was uttered  indicated the reverse .  how is this contradiction possible and how could he have used it to throw me off the scent .      there was a silence around the table as alexander waited for an answer .   avalon finally spoke  staring at his empty brandy glass     mr .  alexander  despite easy theorization  the fact remains that human beings are complicated and inconsistent creatures .  there are undoubtedly contradictory aspects in the character of your suspect or of any man .  you   ll have to chalk it up to a bad break .         i   d like to     said alexander     and i   ve tried to do so  but it is my experience that in fundamentals human beings are not inconsistent .  a man who always puts on his left shoe first  may switch party allegiance and swap wives  but he will always put on his left shoe first .         nothing will stop him from putting on his right shoe first  however uncomfortable that might be     said halsted     if it is necessary to do so to fool someone .  he stepped purposely out of character to mislead you .      alexander didn   t answer at once .  then he said     i doubt that .  even if he knew i was at his heels  and that   s a possibility  he couldn   t possibly have known me so well as to be sure that one short  apparently irrelevant sentence would deflect me .      rubin said     the remark might have been misanthropically in character  and you interpreted it wrongly because of your own happy associations with the holidays .  what the suspect might have meant was that christmas was just as superstitious and nonsensical as halloween .      alexander said     an interesting thought  but the expression on his face and the tone of his voice did not fit .  they were happy  delighted .  i am still sure he meant it sincerely as a loving remark .      gonzalo said     he could be a    peanuts    fan and was thinking of linus   s    great pumpkin     which is a kind of satire on santa claus .  that would set up a strong association between halloween and christmas .      there was a general hoot from the audience  but alexander held up his hand .     actually  that   s the first suggestion i hadn   t thought of myself .  it doesn   t sound in the least likely to me  but i will check whether the thief was a    peanuts    fan .      trumbull said     we don   t have enough to go on .  i don   t think anything can be deduced from what he said to set your mind at ease .  sorry .      drake said     i agree  but we haven   t heard from henry yet .         henry .     said alexander in surprise  swiveling in his seat .   henry cleared his throat .     i admit  gentlemen  that a thought had entered my mind at the moment mr .  alexander gave us the suspect   s remark .         oh .     said alexander     and just what thought was that .         the suspect  sir  did not say  as you or i might have said  that halloween was just like christmas or just as good as christmas  or even equivalent to christmas .  if you quoted him correctly he said halloween was    precisely equal    to christmas .  surely that sounds like a mathematician speaking and would be in character .      alexander snorted .     feeble .  feeble .  a nonmathematician might have happened to put it that way if he were a prissy and meticulous person .      henry said softly     perhaps .  yet we might find more in the statement if we treat it mathematically than anyone has yet pointed out .  after all  it your suspect were indeed the guilty man he would be not only a mathematician  but also a computer specialist .      alexander looked annoyed .     what has that to do with it .      henry said     mr .  alexander  listening to the gentlemen of the black widowers month after month is an education in itself and there have been times when i have directed my readings in the directions they have opened up for me .  mr .  halsted  for instance  once discussed the rationale behind positional notation  the manner in which our arabic numerals are constructed  and i went on to read further concerning the matter .  if you   d care to have me explain it  i   m sure mr .  halsted will be glad to correct me if i   ve made a mistake .      halsted said     i   ll be glad to  henry  but i don   t see what you   re driving at .         you will in a moment  sir .  our ordinary numbers are written to the base ten .  the first column at the right are the ones .  the next to the left are the tens  the next are the hundreds or ten times tens  the next are the thousands or ten times ten times ten  and so on .  thus the number      is one times a thousand plus two times a hundred plus three times ten plus one and that comes to one thousand  two hundred thirty   one .         right so far     said halsted .      but there   s no need to consider ten the only possible base for a number system     said henry .     you could use nine  for instance .  the right   hand column in a nine   based system would be ones  the next to the left would be nines  the next would be eighty   ones or nine times nine  the next would be   uh   seven hundred twenty   nines or nine times nine times nine  and so on .  the number      would  in the nine   based system  be one times seven hundred twenty   nine plus two times eighty   one  plus three times nine  plus one .  that would be  if you would allow me a moment to work it out   the equivalent of nine hundred nineteen in our ordinary ten   based system .      he scribbled hastily on a napkin and held it up .     you could write the result this way        nine   based         ten   based  .      halsted  drake  and rubin nodded .  avalon and trumbull looked thoughtful  and alexander shook his head impatiently .   gonzalo said     that   s ridiculous .  why would anyone use that nine   based system and multiply nines .      halsted said     the other number bases look complicated  mario  only because our number system is designed to fit ten as a base .  mathematically  all are equivalently rational  though some are more convenient than others .  for instance  in computers  it is particularly useful at times to use   uh  oh  .   .   .      he looked at henry with a grin and said     i may be getting it .  henry  but you keep on and finish .         thank you  sir     said henry .     as mr .  halsted was about to say  the eight   base system is  i understand  useful to computers .  the number     for instance  in the ten   base system is  of course  three times ten plus one  or thirty   one .  in the eight   base system  however  it is three times eight plus one  or twenty   five .      we can therefore write      he used the napkin again      this      eight   base      ten   base  .   he went on     the different number bases are sometimes given names derived from the latin names of the numbers .  the latin for ten is decem  so a ten   base number belongs to the decimal system .  the latin for eight is octo  so eight   based numbers are octal .  we can therefore write this      octal      decimal  .      by coincidence  we have the months october and december .   .   .   .      rubin roared out in sudden delight     no coincidence at all .  the ancient romans started their year in march before julius caesar   s time .  by that system  october was the eighth month and december the tenth month and they were named accordingly .      henry nodded his head and said     thank you  sir .  if  then  we abbreviate the terms    octal    and    decimal    in a natural way and omit the parentheses  we have    october    december .  how can this be described better than by saying that halloween  which falls on    october  is precisely equal to christmas  which falls on    december .      alexander   s mouth had tended to slacken through this but now he tightened his jaw muscle and said     are you trying to tell me that the thief  blurting out his remark without thinking  gave away the fact that he was a computer expert .         yes  sir     said henry .     it was not out of shyness that a look of alarm crossed his face and that he left as soon as he could .  it must have been out of fright at the thought of having slipped into his real character .  at that moment  if the significance of his remark had been seen by you  it would have been wise to begin arrangements for having him arrested .      alexander looked chagrined .     well  i didn   t see it .  i interpreted it just wrong .  but wait  all this is clever and may even be right considering that the man in question proved to be indeed the criminal  but how would you account for that look of love on his face .  that was what threw me .      henry said softly     you are a family man  sir  and that is your weakness .  you naturally interpret love in human terms alone .  i  myself  am not a family man  and i know that love is broader than that .  even a misanthrope who hates the human race could love  and deeply  too .         love what .     said alexander impatiently .      the beauty and surprises of mathematics  for one thing     said henry .      the family man      afterword  those of you who have read the first two volumes of the black widowers tales know that there is a real organization called    the trap door spiders    to which i belong  and which serves as an inspiration for everything about the black widowers  but the mysteries .  occasionally  i even make use of a real   life guest   at least for appearance and general background .   for instance  there was indeed a meeting of the trap door spiders at which a magician  very much like the amazing lanni of the first story in this volume  did dine with us as our guest .   there was no mystery introduced  of course  in the real   life occasion .    and at another meeting  which i hosted  i brought my accountant as my guest .  he is a very amiable gentleman with whom i share a million laughs as he strips me to the bone for the sake of good old uncle sam and then gnaws at the bones for his fee .   i used him as an inspiration for simon alexander in    the family man     changing him from an accountant to a tax auditor  the enemy  and carrying on from there .     .  the sports page     is    blain    an english word .     asked mario gonzalo  as the company of the black widowers sat down to their monthly banquet .      brain .     asked james drake  scraping his chair toward the table and looking over the selection of bread and rolls .      blain     said gonzalo sharply .      how do you spell it .     asked roger halsted  who had no difficulty in deciding to take two slices of pumpernickel .  he was buttering them .      what   s the difference how it   s spelled .     said gonzalo in annoyance .  he placed his napkin carefully over his lightly striped and definitely pink trousers .     spell it any way you want .  is it an english word .      thomas trumbull  host for the evening  furrowed his bronzed forehead and said     damn it  mario  we   ve had a pretty sensible session so far .  what   s all this about    blain .            i   m asking you a question .  why don   t you answer it .         all right .  it   s not an english word .      gonzalo looked about the table     everyone agree    blain    isn   t english .      there was a hesitant chorus of agreement .  even emmanuel rubin  his eyes magnified by his glasses and his straggly beard a bit shorter than usual  as though it had recently been absent   mindedly trimmed  finally muttered     no such word .      lawrence pentili  who had arrived as trumbull   s guest  and who was an elderly man with sparse white hair  and with muttonchop side   whiskers grown long  as though they were announcing that hair could still be produced  smiled and said     never heard that word .      only geoffrey avalon held his peace .  sitting bolt upright as always  he frowned and with his middle finger stirred the ice in the unfinished half of his second drink .      all right     said gonzalo     we all agree it   s not an english word .  you can see that in a second .  but how do you see it .  do you go through a list of all the english words you know and see that blain    isn   t on it .  do you check the sound for familiarity .  do you  .   .   .      halsted   s soft voice interrupted     no one knows how human recall works  so why ask .  even people who have theories about how the mechanism of memory works don   t understand how information can be fished out once it has been inserted .  every word i use has to be recalled from my vocabulary  and each is there when i need it .      trumbull said     there are lots of times when you can   t think of the word you want .      halsted had just turned with satisfaction to the turtle soup that henry  the incomparable waiter of the black widowers  had placed before him .  he said  stuttering slightly as he often did under stress     yes  and that upsets you .  most people take it hard when they can   t think of a word  get very upset  as though something has gone wrong that shouldn   t have gone wrong .  me  i tend to stutter when i can   t think of a word .      now at last avalon   s deep baritone sounded  and dominated the table .     well  wait now .  as a matter of fact  there is such a word as    blain .     it   s archaic  but it   s english .  it   s some sort of animal ailment  or blister .         right     said gonzalo with satisfaction .  the word is used in the bible in connection with the plagues of egypt in the book of exodus .  i knew someone here would get it .  i thought it would be manny .      rubin said indignantly     i thought you meant current english .         i didn   t say so     said gonzalo .     besides  it   s part of the word    chilblains     and that   s current english .         no  it   s not     said rubin  heating up further     and besides  .   .   .      trumbull said  loudly     don   t get defensive  manny .  what i want to know is how mario knows all this .  and  incidentally  we   re having finnan haddie today at my request  and if anyone here doesn   t like it  he can negotiate with henry for substitutes .  well  mario .      gonzalo said     i read it in a psychology book .  there   s nothing that says i have to be born knowing everything  the way manny claims he   s been .  i pick up knowledge by keeping my eyes and ears open .  and what i want to do now is make a point .  remembering too well is dangerous .         it   s a danger you   ll never face     muttered rubin .      i don   t care     said gonzalo .     look  i asked a question and i got a quick and certain response from everyone here but jeff .  he was uncertain and hesitated because he remembered too much .  he remembered the use of    blain    in the bible .  well  human beings are faced with choices every minute .  there has to be a decision and the decision has to be based on what he knows .  and if he knows too much  he   ll hesitate .         and so     asked drake who  having speared some of the finnan haddii on his fork and placed it in his mouth  looked first thoughtful and then satisfied .      so that   s bad     said gonzalo .     in the long run  what counts is a quick response and action .  even a less than good decision is better than indecision  most times .  that   s why human beings have evolved an imperfect memory .  forgetting has survival value .      avalon smiled and nodded .     that   s not a bad notion  mario     he said  with  perhaps  a trace of condescension .     have i ever told you my theory of the evolutionary value of contentiousness .  in a hunting society  .   .   .      but gonzalo held up both arms .     i   m not finished  jeff .  don   t you all see that   s why henry here does so much better than we do in solving the puzzles that arise from time to time .  every one of us here at the table practices being deep  .   .   .         not everybody  mario     said rubin     unless you   re about to start .      gonzalo ignored him .     henry doesn   t .  he doesn   t gunk his mind up with irrelevant information  so he can see clearly .      henry  who was clearing some of the excess dishes  said gently     if i may interpose  mr .  gonzalo  i   m afraid that whatever i do could not be done  were it not that you gentlemen usually eliminate all that would otherwise confuse me .     his unlined  sixtyish face showed only imperturbable efficiency  as he next poured several refills of the white wine .   trumbull said     mario  your theory is junk and  henry  that false modesty is unbecoming to you .  you have more brains than any of us do  henry  and you know it .         no  sir     said henry .     with respect  the most i   ll admit is that i have a faculty for seeing the obvious .         because     said gonzalo     you don   t have the difficulty of trying to look at the obvious through layers of crud  as manny does .      henry bowed his head slightly and seemed almost relieved when the infuriated rubin launched into an analysis of the value of miscellaneous knowledge to the writer  and of the fact   which he announced as such with fervor   of the equation of general intelligence with the ability to remember  recall  analyze  and synthesize .   but pentili  the guest  seemed to have lost interest in the conversation .  his eyes followed henry thoughtfully .   waiting for the precise moment when the desserts had been eaten and when several of the coffees were about ready for the refill  trumbull tapped his water glass with his spoon and announced it was time for the grilling .      since i am host     he growled     i am delighted to be disqualified as griller .  mario  you did all that preaching over the soup .  why don   t you grill our guest .      gonzalo said     dee   lighted     and cleared his throat ostentatiously .     mr .  pentili  how do you justify your existence .      pentili smiled broadly so that a round little ball of flesh bunched up over each cheekbone  giving him the look of a beardless santa claus in mufti .     thank heaven  i no longer have to .  i am retired and i have either already justified my existence or have already failed .         and in the days when you might have been justifying it  what were you doing to make your existence possible .         breathing .  but if you mean  how did i make my living  i served uncle sam in the same fashion  more or less  that tom does .         you were a cipher expert .         no  but i was involved in intelligence .         and that justifies your existence .     put in rubin .      shall we argue the point .     said pentili agreeably .      no     said trumbull .     it   s been argued fifty times .  go ahead  mario .      gonzalo looked eager .     the last time tom had a guest here  he had a problem .  do you have one .         at the present time  certainly not .  i leave problems to tom and the others these days .  i   m a more or less happy observers .  but i have a question  if i may ask one .         go ahead .      pentili said     you had said that henry   who  i take it  is our waiter        trumbull said     henry is a valued member of the black widowers and the best of us all .         i see .  but i take it that henry solves puzzles .  what kind .      a shade of uneasiness crossed henry   s face but disappeared almost at once .  he said     some questions arise at one time or another on the occasion of these banquets  sir  and the members have been able to propose answers .         you have proposed them     said gonzalo energetically .   avalon raised his hand .     i protest .  this is not a fit subject for discussion .  everything said here is entirely confidential  and we ought not to talk about previous sessions in front of our guest .         no  no     said pentili  shaking his head .     i ask for no confidences .  it just occurred to me that  if it were appropriate to do so  i could pose a problem for henry .      gonzalo said     i thought you said you didn   t have a problem .         i don   t     said pentili  twinkling     but i once had a problem  many years ago  and it was never solved to my satisfaction .  it is of no importance any longer  you understand  except as an irritating grain of sand inside the tissues of my curiosity .         what was that  larry .     asked trumbull with sudden interest .      you had just entered the department  tom .  it didn   t involve you   or almost anyone  but me .         may we hear it .     said gonzalo .      as i said     said pentili     it   s entirely unimportant and i assure you i had not meant to bring it up .  it was just that when mention was made specifically of henry   s facility with  .   .   .      henry said softly     if i may be allowed a word  sir .  i am not the expert at solving puzzles that mr .  gonzalo is kind enough to think me .  there have been occasions when  indeed  i have been helpful in that direction but that has only been when the membership has considered the problem and eliminated much of what is not essential .  if  in that case  some simple thread is left exposed  i can pick it up as well as another  but i can do no more than that .         oh .     pentili looked abashed .     well  i   m perfectly willing to present the problem to the membership generally .         in that case  sir     said avalon     we are all ears .      pentili  having finished his brandy and having declined a refill  said     i will ask you  gentlemen  to cast your mind back to      .  john f .  kennedy was in the first months of his tragically abbreviated administration  and an invasion of cuba by cuban exiles was being planned .  kennedy had inherited those plans and had refused to chance the repercussions of having the invaders granted american air support .  he was assured by intelligence reports that it was quite certain the cuban populace would rise in support of the invaders .  a free cuban government would quickly be formed  and at its request the united states might move .      it is easy  in hindsight  to realize how wretchedly we had underestimated castro   s hold on his army and his people  but at the time we saw everything through a pinkly optimistic haze .  you all know what happened .  the invaders landed at the bay of pigs and were met at once by well   organized castroites .  the cuban people did not rise  and in the absence of effective air support  the invaders were all either killed or taken .  it was a tragic affair for them and an embarrassing fiasco for the united states .  kennedy accepted the responsibility since he was president and had given the final kickoff signal .  although others were clearly more to blame  no one stepped forward to take his medicine .  as kennedy said  victory has a thousand fathers  but defeat is an orphan .         rubin  who had been staring at his coffee cup  said suddenly     i remember that .  at the time  kennedy said it was an old saying  but no one  to my knowledge  has ever discovered the source .  it will have to go into the quotation books with kennedy   s name under it .      avalon cleared his throat .     a defeat or even a humiliation does not stand alone in time .  smarting from the bay of pigs  kennedy was determined not to submit again  so the next year he faced down the soviets on the cuban missiles affair and won for us our greatest victory of the cold war .      rubin said  with vehemence     and victories don   t stand alone  either .  president johnson  determined not to appear less macho than his predecessor  led us step by step into the quagmire of vietnam  and this led to our           come on  you idiots     shouted trumbull .     this isn   t a contemporary history class .  we   re listening to larry pentili .      in the sudden silence that followed  pentili said  with a bit of gloominess flitting over his face     actually  it is all pertinent .  you see  the real villain of the bay of pigs affair was faulty intelligence .  had we known quite accurately what the situation was in cuba  kennedy would have canceled the invasion or given it effective air support .  in that case  there would have been no fiasco to give either castro or khrushchev the false notion that they could get away with establishing missile sites ninety miles off florida and then  if we accept rubin   s psychohistorical interpretation  there would have been no vietnam .      and in my opinion  information need not have been faulty .  we had one operative who had been planted in cuba and who was back in washington some half a year before the bay of pigs with reports he had been unable to radio out .   .   .   .         why not .     said gonzalo  at once .      because he was playing a difficult role that he dared not risk .  he was a soviet agent  you see  and his whole value to us was that the soviets allowed him to travel to the united states freely and to circulate in washington freely because they thought he was spying on us for them .         maybe he was     said drake  peering through his cigarette smoke .     how can you tell which side a double agent is fooling .         maybe both sides     said halsted .      maybe     conceded pentili     but the soviets never discovered anything more than we deliberately had this russian of ours reveal .  on the other hand  through him we learned a great many useful things that the soviets could not conceivably have wanted us to know .         i wonder     said rubin  with something more than a trace of sarcasm in his voice     if the soviets might not have reasoned in precisely the same way .         i don   t think so     said pentili     for in the end it was the soviets who eliminated him and not we .  how they caught on to him  how he had given himself away  we never discovered  but it was clear that the soviets finally came around to agreeing with us that he was essentially our russian and not theirs .  too bad  but  of course  from their standpoint he was a traitor .  in reverse  we   d have done the same thing .      avalon said     frankly  i would hesitate to trust a traitor .  a man who betrays once can betray again .         yes     said pentili     and for that reason he never knew anything more than it was considered safe for him to know .  yet i  for one  did trust him .  it was always my opinion that he chose us because he came to believe in the american ideal .  during the three years he worked with us  he never gave us any ground for concern .      his name was stepan and he was an earnest man  rather humorless  who went about his task with a conscious dedication .  he was determined to learn idiomatic english and to speak it with a general american accent .  he was therefore a faithful listener to news programs not for their contents but for the sanitized pronunciations of men like walter cronkite .  to develop his vocabulary  stepan worked at crossword puzzles  with indifferent success  and was very fond of the word game scrabble  at which he usually lost .      avalon said     scrabble is that game that involves small wooden tiles with letters on them out of which you form words on a board .         it has its complications .   .   .   .     began rubin .   pentili overrode him .     you have the essentials  mr .  avalon .  i mention the game because it has something to do with the problem .  stepan never achieved his aim fully .  he retained his russian accent  and his vocabulary was never as unlimited as he would have liked it to be  but we encouraged him because we felt it to be a sign of increasing dedication to us .  the soviets probably supported it because they felt it would make him a more efficient spy on us and for them .         they may have been right     said rubin dryly .      they killed him  remember     said pentili .     in september       stepan arrived from cuba .  we had only the most indirect notion of his activities in that country  but his initial guarded contact with us gave us every reason to think he had information of the most vital importance .  it remained only to get that information in such a way as not to blow his cover .      in very indirect fashion  we arranged to make contact with him in a hotel room .  the trouble was that  although neither he nor we knew it at the time  his cover was already blown .  someone got to him before we did  and when our man finally arrived  stepan was dead  knifed .  what it was he meant to tell us  we never learned .      avalon ran his finger thoughtfully around the rim of his long   empty coffee cup .     are you certain  sir  that he was killed by the soviets .  we live in a violent society and people are killed every day for a variety of reasons .      pentili sighed .     to have an agent killed just at the point of delivery of a vital message  and to have that killing come about through some unrelated cause  is asking too much of coincidence .  besides  the washington police were bound to treat it as an ordinary killing  and we helped them since the man was a soviet national .  nothing was turned up  no theft  no plausible motive arising out of his private life .  there were no traces left behind of any kind  an ordinary culprit would have left some .      second  there was some interest in the murder on the part of the soviet embassy  but not enough .  they were just a shade too easily satisfied .  third  certain avenues of information  which would have remained open had stepan been in the clear and had he died for reasons not connected with his work  were closed .  no  mr .  avalon  there was no doubt in my mind that he died the death of an agent .      gonzalo  suddenly aware of crumbs defacing the fine cut of his lapel  brushed at himself delicately and said     where   s the puzzle  though  mr .  pentili .  you mean who killed him .  now .  after all these years .         no  it doesn   t matter a hippie   s curse who killed him .  even after he was knifed  though  stepan must have tried to get across something  perhaps enough to give us the essential core of what we needed  but if so  he failed .  i have been wondering frequently  and painfully  in the years since my retirement whether a greater shrewdness or persistence on our part might not have saved our country some of its losses in the years since that murder .      halsted said     i   m sorry if this question is embarrassing  mr .  pentili  but was your retirement forced on you because of stepan   s death .         you mean that i might have been fired as punishment for not having kept him alive .  no .  the episode did not reflect any discredit on me and i retired only a few years ago  in the ordinary course of events  with a generous pension  the expressed esteem of my confreres  and an award handed me by president nixon .  in fact  danger came to me not through stepan   s death but through my insistence that he was trying to tell us something significant .  the department dismissed the matter  erroneously  in my opinion  and i was more or less forced to dismiss it  too .  but i have wondered about it since  all the more so  since my retirement .      gonzalo said     what was stepan   s way of getting across the information .      pentili said     we are quite certain that stepan had no documents on him  no letters  no written message .  he didn   t work that way .  he had what any traveler might be expected to have in a hotel room .  he had clothes  toiletries  and so on  in a single suitcase  and an extra suit in a garment bag .  there were signs of a search  but it was a skillful one that left a minimum of disarray .  something may have been taken away  of course  but if so  we cannot tell what it was  and that has nothing to do with the problem .      the only items that might not be considered perfectly routine were a crossword puzzle book  with approximately half the puzzles worked out completely or nearly completely in stepan   s own handwriting  the scrabble set he always carried with him  .   .   .      rubin interrupted     so he could strike up games with occasional strangers .      pentili said     no .  he had the habit of playing four   handed games with himself when he had nothing to do and using a pocket dictionary to help .  he said there was nothing better for developing a vocabulary .  the dictionary was there  in his jacket pocket  with the jacket hanging in the closet .      he was knifed while standing  apparently  and that was the one flaw in an otherwise flawless performance  for he was not killed outright .  the killer or killers had to leave rapidly  and they left a spark of life behind .  stepan had collapsed just next to the desk and  when they were gone  he managed to pull himself upright .  on the desk was a newspaper   the washington post  by the way   and the scrabble set .      he opened the top desk drawer and pawed about for the pen .  he found it and tried to write with it but it was dry   a common situation in hotel rooms   so he dropped it to the floor .  his own pen was in his inner jacket pocket at the other end of the room  and he knew he couldn   t make it there .  he had a couple of minutes to live and he had to make use of whatever objects were on the desk .      the newspaper  at the time of the knifing  was folded as it had been when he had bought it an hour earlier  but he  .   .   .      halsted said     how did you find out all this .         circumstantial .  i assure you we are expert at this .  the desk drawer was open  the pen  quite dry  was on the floor .  most of all  stepan was bleeding  partly from his right hand  which he had instinctively used to try to ward off the weapon  and his own blood marked his every movement and everything he had touched .      as i say  he unfolded the newspaper to the sports page .  he then lifted the top of the box of the scrabble set  removed the board  and managed to take out five letters  which he put in the wooden holder used for the purpose .  then he died .  the letters were    e        p        o        c     and    k .            in that order .     asked drake .      in that order  left to right .         epock is a period of time in history  isn   t it .     said gonzalo .      it   s a point in time     said rubin     marked by some significant historical event and later used as a reference  but it   s spelled e   p   o   c   h .  it ends with an   h .            making a mistake in spelling under the conditions isn   t surprising     said gonzalo defensively .     the man was dying and maybe he could hardly see .  maybe the    k    looked like an v to him .  besides  he was a russian  and he might not have known how to spell the word .      pentili said  with a trace of impatience     that is not really the point .     epock    or    epoch        k    or    h     what does it mean .      avalon said     actually  tom is the code expert .   .   .   .      trumbull shrugged .     larry has come to you men .  you work at it .  it anything occurs to me  i   ll interrupt .      avalon said     would you have a code book  mr .  pentili  in which    epock    stands for some phrase or sentence .  is it a recognized code .         i assure you that neither    epock    nor    epoch    means anything in any code of which stepan had knowledge .  no  the answer had to be in the sports page  and if the letters had any meaning it was in connection with the sports page .         why do you say that .     asked halsted .      let me explain further     said pentili   then interrupted himself to say     i will have a little more brandy  henry  if you don   t mind .  you   re listening to all this  i hope .         yes  sir     said henry .      good .     said pentili .     now in the ordinary course of events  stepan might have  in an emergency  transmitted information more densely   that is  with the greatest information per symbol   by transmitting a number .  each number could represent a given phrase .  that   s an inflexible message  of course  since the proper phrase might not exist  but a number might give a fair approximation  and in the extremity of approaching death  he could do no more .  he opened the paper to a page on which there were numbers and where one number might be significant .      halsted said     he might merely have wanted a sheet of paper to write on .      he had nothing to write with     said pentili .      his blood .      pentili twisted his mouth distastefully .     he might have done that but he didn   t .  he might not even have been aware he was bleeding .  and if he wanted to do that  why open the paper .  the front page would have been enough .         he might have opened it at random     said halsted stubbornly .      why .  he was a professional .  he had lived with death for years and he knew that the information he carried was more important than his life .  what he did would have to be to pass on that information .      trumbull said     come on  roger  you   re being trivial .      pentili said     it   s all right  tom .  as a matter of fact  the general opinion in the department was that there was no puzzle  that gregory   s attempt at the point of death meant nothing  that whatever he tried to do had failed .  i was the only one who wanted to follow it up  and i must admit i never succeeded in translating the message .      the trouble was  you see  that he had opened to the sports page .  about the only page in the paper that could have been more littered with numbers was the financial page .  how can we look at all the numbers on the sports page and select the one that was significant .      avalon said     if we assume that gregory knew what he was doing  then despite all the numbers  the particular significant number must have been obvious  or should have been .  for instance  all the numbers on the page may have had no meaning at all .  it may have been the number of the page that counted .         first thought .  however  it was page     and    stood for    cancel previous message .     there was no previous message  and that was not it .      avalon said     what was on the sports page .         i can   t reproduce it from memory  of course  and i don   t have a xerox copy to show you .  that page dealt with baseball almost entirely  for the baseball season was in its last few weeks .  it had baseball standings on it  the box scores of particular games  some pitching statistics .         and was stepan knowledgeable about baseball .         to a limited extent     said pentili .     he was professionally interested in america  reading american history avidly  for instance  so he would be interested in the national game .  you remember world war ii movies with their cliche that any nazi spy  no matter how cleverly schooled  would always give himself away by his ignorance of last year   s world series .  stepan intended not to be caught in this fashion  but he could scarcely make himself an expert .         well     said avalon stiffly     if ignorance of baseball is the hallmark of the nazi spy  i had better turn myself in .  i know nothing of the game .         nor i     said drake  shrugging .   gonzalo said     come on  nobody can read the papers  watch television  or talk to people without knowing something about the game .  you guys are just indulging in snobbery .  why don   t we figure this out .  what kind of a number ought it to be .  how many digits .      pentili said     at least two digits  possibly three .  not more than three .         all right .  if gregory was no baseball expert  he would have to pick something simple and obvious .  batting averages are in three digits .  maybe there was some batting average that made the headlines .      pentili shook his head .     there were no numbers in the headlines .  we would have been on to that like a shot .  i assure you that nowhere on the page  nowhere  was there any one number that stood out from the rest .  no  gentlemen  i am quite convinced that the sports page by itself was insufficient  that gregory in his last moments used it only because there was nothing else he could do .  the number was there but there was no way of picking it out without a hint   so he prepared one .      rubin said     you mean the scrabble letters .     epock    .         yes .         i don   t see what kind of hint that might be .      gonzalo said     he might not have finished  you know .  he managed to get five letters out and then died .  maybe he gave up on the sports page and was trying to spell out the number  only he didn   t finish .  if he wanted to write    one hundred twenty   two     for instance  that would take a lot more than five letters .      rubin said     are you telling us there   s a number that begins with    epock    .     he rolled his eyes upward in exasperation .   gonzalo said     the letters don   t have to be in order .  in scrabble  you   re always arranging and rearranging your letters   like in anagrams .  after he had all the letters he wanted  he   d have rearranged them into the number he was spelling .  he died too soon .      halsted said     sorry  mario  that   s not possible .  the written forms of the numbers have an odd distribution of letters .  for instance     his mathematician   s eyes gleamed      do you know that you can write all the numbers from zero to nine hundred ninety   nine without using the letter    a    .         so .     said gonzalo .     there   s no    a    in    epock .            no  but there   s a    p    and a    c    .  write out the numbers in order and you won   t come to a    p    till you reach   uh   one heptillion  which has twenty   four digits .  and you won   t reach a    c    till one octillion  which has twenty   seven .  of course  that   s in the american system of numeration .  in the british system  .   .   .         you made your point     growled trumbull .   rubin said     he could still have been incomplete  though .  he may have given up on the sports page altogether  started fresh  and intended to take out those five letters plus a    t     rearranging the whole to spell    pocket .     there may have been something in his pocket that carried the message .   .   .   .         there wasn   t     interposed pentili curtly .      it may have been removed after the knifing and he was too far gone to realize it .         that   s a second   order conjecture .  you assume an additional    t    and then a pocket   picking as well to account for it .  unlikely .         might    pocket    have been a code word .     said rubin .      no .     pentili waved his hand left and right  palm outward  in a gesture of impatience .     gentlemen  it is amusing to listen to your conjectures but you are moving in the wrong direction .  habit has a firm hold even at the moment of death .  stepan was a neat person  and when death came he had his hand on the top of the scrabble box and was clearly making an effort to replace it .  there is no question in my mind that he had taken out all the tiles he was going to .  we have these five letters  no more .      halsted said     he would not have had time to rearrange the letters .      pentili sighed .     there are exactly     different ways in which   different letters can be arranged .  not one of the rearrangements is an english word  any more than    blain    is     he smiled briefly .     one arrangement is    kopec     which is a small russian coin usually spelled    kopek     but that has no significance that any of us could see .  no  there must be a reference to a number .      avalon said suddenly     was there anything on the sports page besides sports .  i mean  were there advertisements  for instance .      pentili looked with concentration into the middle distance as though he were concentrating on an invisible sheet of paper .  he said  thoughtfully     no advertisements .  there was  however  a bridge column .         ah  could the letters have referred to that .  see here  mr .  pentili  i am not a bridge buff in the real sense  but i play the game and sometimes read a bridge column .  they invariably have a hand shown under the heads     north        south        east     and    west .     each hand has its cards listed according to suit     spades        hearts        diamonds        clubs     and under each suit the cards are listed in descending order of value .         well .     said pentili stonily .      so consider    epock .     the    e may stand for    east     the    c    for    clubs .     east   s hand may have five clubs  which may  as an example  be j             .  the jack and the   are excluded because they are occupied by letters that do not stand for digits .  that leaves     as your code .      pentili looked at him with some surprise .  he said     i must admit that i   ve never thought of this .  when i am back in my office i will look at the bridge hand .  amazing  mr .  avalon  i would not have thought a new notion could have been advanced at this stage of the game .      avalon said  flushing a little     i can but do my poor best  sir .         however     said pentili     i don   t believe your suggestion can be useful .  poor stepan was not  to my knowledge  a bridge player  and it seems to me only a monomaniac on the subject would have tried to use bridge for a code like that at the point of death .  it has to be very simple .  he might have used the page number as the code  but i suspect he could no longer see the tiny symbols on the newspaper page .  he recognized the sports page as a whole and he could still see the large letters of the scrabble set .  and we can find nothing simple there .      gonzalo said     unless henry has a suggestion .         ah     said pentili     then it comes to henry in the end .  what does all this mean  henry .      henry  who had been remaining silently at the sideboard throughout the discussion  said     i cannot say  sir  unless the number    would be of signifi        he was interrupted by a suddenly frowning pentili .     twenty .  is that a guess  henry .         not entirely  sir .  is it significant  then .         significant .  i   ve spent years gloomily suspecting he was trying to tell us twenty .  twenty meant    government in firm control .     i haven   t mentioned twenty in the course of the story  have i .     there was a chorused negative .      if i could have shown     said pentili     that stepan was trying to tell us twenty  i might have been able to stop the bay of pigs .  at least i would have tried  god  i would have tried .  but i don   t see how you get twenty out of this  henry .         why  sir  if it is true that mr .  stepan was only moderately knowledgeable in baseball  then he would see on the sports page only what other moderately knowledgeable people would see   like myself  for instance .  as mr .  gonzalo would say  i speak from ignorance when i say that all i see on the sports page is the result of the games   the score in other words   and that brings    twenty    rather forcibly to mind .      avalon  possibly smarting at the failure of his own suggestion  said     i don   t think much of that  henry .     score    is rather an archaic word .  would stepan have known it .         i imagine he would  mr .  avalon     said henry     mr .  pentili has said that stepan was an avid reader of american history  and one of the best   known historical phrases is    fourscore and seven years ago  .   .   .         pentili looked disappointing     it   s a clever notion  henry  but not convincing .  too bad .         it becomes convincing  sir  when you realize that the scrabble letters also signify twenty .         in what way .         when mr .  gonzalo asked his question about    blain    he specifically asked if it were an english word .  no one has specified that    epock    must be english .      gonzalo said delightedly     you mean it   s russian for twenty .      pentili said     no  it is not russian for twenty .  i   ve already mentioned the    kopec   kopek    possibility  but that has nothing to do with twenty  surely .         i   m not thinking of russian words     said henry .     as you have said  habits are hard to break even at the point of death  and mr .  stepan must have found himself using russian letters .   .   .   .         the cyrillic alphabet     said rubin .      yes  mr .  rubin .  now  i have seen the ussr written in russian in letters that look like cccp .  i suspect therefore that the russian    c    is equivalent to our    s    and the russian    p    is equivalent to our    r .            quite so     said pentili  looking dumbfounded .      and the russian    k    is equivalent to our hard    c    so that in our letters     epock    becomes    erosc     and that can be rearranged to read    score .         pentili seemed overcome by a deep depression .     you win  henry .  why couldn   t you have told me all this in      .         had i but known  sir     said henry .      the sports page      afterword  in some ways  there is a certain inflexibility about my scheme for writing black widower stories .  there is always the banquet and the general conversation  then the grilling and the presentation of a mystery  then the discussion and solution .   but there is a certain flexibility as well  for the mystery itself can be anything at ail .  it can be a murder  or a theft  or a spy story  or a missing   will story .   it can even  on occasion  be that hoariest of devices  the dying   clue mystery .  why not .  they   re always fun .      the sports page    appeared in the april      eqmm .   by the way  readers occasionally write me to offer alternative solutions to my black widowers .  in the case of this story  two readers came up with identical alternate solutions that were  in my opinion  cleverer than the one i had constructed .  one was dan button  editor of science digest  and the other was paul edwin kennedy  a boston lawyer .  let me quote the latter     he  stepan  left us the cryptic message    epock .     any person    moderately familiar    with baseball is familiar with the box scores .  to him  the letters    e        po     and    k    stand for    error        put out     and    strike     respectively .  we can then translate    epock    as    error put out c strike .     surely it   s obvious then that    c    stands for cuban .      dan button  using identical reasoning  interprets the message as either    you will strike out  suffer disaster  if you go ahead with the plan     or    the strike  invasion  is out  because of the erroneous information you   ve received .      unbelievable that  without knowing it  while constructing one solution  i had laid the groundwork for another that was even more subtle .     .  second best  when the black widowers opened the new season with their september banquet  following hard upon the national conventions  it was not surprising that the talk turned to politics .   emmanuel rubin  who was host  had  as might be expected  considerable fault to find with both candidates  and a minute analysis of their shortcomings left each sounding highly unacceptable .   thomas trumbull scowled .  he said     who   s your write   in candidate  then .         himself     said mario gonzalo quickly  smoothing the lapel of a jacket that bore the pattern of a patchwork quilt of the louder sort .     manny has voted the straight rubin ticket for years .      rubin said     it certainly doesn   t make sense to vote for someone i know to be less capable than i am .  if  for the sake of argument  i admit i lack the capacity to be president of the united states  then any lesser man  ipso facto  should not get my vote  or anyone   s .      geoffrey avalon  sipping slowly at his second drink  which had not yet reached the midpoint at which he automatically stopped  said austerely     all things being equal  i don   t think it good practice to oust a sitting president .  experience and continuity count for a great deal .      james drake  peering through cigarette smoke  cleared his throat and said softly     how much experience did he have two years ago when  .   .   .      rubin interrupted and overrode drake .     don   t reason with him  jim .  geoff voted for nixon in       .     his straggly beard lifted and he glared through the thick lenses of his eyeglasses .   avalon stood more stiffly than usual and a faint flush rose to his cheeks .     i   m not ashamed of that .  the chief issue in       was foreign policy  and i believe to this day that nixon   s foreign policy was a rational and useful one .         he was corrupt     said rubin .      that was not known at the time .  i cannot vote on the basis of future knowledge .         what future knowledge .  i   ve known he was not to be trusted ever since he entered congress in      .         we don   t all have your         hindsight vision  manny     said avalon with wounded dignity .      hindsight  hell     said rubin .     i can produce a hundred witnesses who heard me denounce nixon over a period of thirty years .         we all heard you many times right here at the black widowers     said roger halsted  looking over the hors d   oeuvres tray critically .   avalon  reaching the halfway mark of his drink  put it down firmly and said     i believe we   re allowed our political differences  manny .  membership in the black widowers does not deprive me of my civil rights .         vote as you please     said rubin     but i would like to remind you that you were the only black widower to vote republican that year .      avalon touched his neat graying mustache as though to convince himself his drink had not wetted it and said     does that include henry .      gonzalo said eagerly     whom did you vote for in        henry .      avalon said     you needn   t answer  henry .  your political opinions are your own .      henry  the invaluable waiter at the black widower banquets  was putting the final touches at the table .  he said     i have no reason to keep it secret  mr .  avalon .  like mr .  rubin  i distrusted the president and so  with some misgiving  i voted for the other man .         six to one against you  geoff     said rubin  grinning widely .   avalon said     what about your guest .     with perhaps just a touch of spite  he added     for whom  after all  you   re putting on this show .         because he   s interviewing me .     began rubin indignantly .   the guest closed his notebook with a snap  loudly enough to draw all eyes  and said  in a surprisingly gentle voice     actually  i voted for nixon .  i   m not really keyed into politics  but i generally vote republican .         six to two     said avalon  in low   voiced satisfaction  shooting a swift glance at rubin  who looked a little put out .   gonzalo said  looking up from the portrait he was quickly sketching of the guest     how can you be a reporter and not be keyed in to politics .         i   m not exactly a  .  .  .      trumbull lifted his voice .     save it for the grilling  mario  damn you .  if you   d come on time  you could have been introduced to mr .  gardner .         i don   t have to take lessons in early arrival from you  tom     said gonzalo  hurt .     they   re paving park avenue  and my taxi .   .   .      henry  waiting patiently  sent his voice through a momentary hole in the conversation .     gentlemen  at the request of mr .  rubin  tonight   s host  our chef has been pleased to prepare a smorgasbord .  if you will all be kind enough to help yourselves from the dishes on the sideboard  .   .   .      they lined up with the avidity of healthy trenchermen and halsted  whose incipient paunch was eloquent evidence of his brotherly affection for calories  said     we   ve never had a smorgasbord before  manny .         nothing wrong with trying something new     said rubin .      oh i approve   i approve .     halsted   s eyes wandered avidly over the selection .   gonzalo said     that leaves you only semi   employed tonight  henry .     henry smiled paternally and said     i shall try to keep myself occupied  mr .  gonzalo .      the sideboard   s contents had been reduced to fragments  coffee was at its second cup  and brandy was being served  when rubin clattered spoon on water glass and said     brother black widowers  it is time for the grilling  and mario has clamored for the chance .  very much against my better judgment  i   m going to let him .  mario  .   .   .      gonzalo smiled and leaned back in his seat  draping an arm negligently over the back .  he said     mr .  gardner  i apologize for having been late .  park avenue was being paved .   .   .   .         we know all that     said rubin .     get on with it .         i managed to catch up over the meal  however .  you are arthur gardner  and you work on a free   lance basis for personalities magazine .  am i correct so far .         yes  sir .     gardner   s gray hair  thick  moderately long  and well arranged  made him look the fiftyish he was  but none of his other features concurred .  with a bit of hair dye he could easily have passed for something under forty .  his teeth were good but his smile was uneasy .  he didn   t seem quite at home with the company .   gonzalo said     i further gather that your current assignment is that of interviewing manny rubin for a piece in personalities .         that   s right .  front   of   the   book piece .         and you   ve come to this dinner  as manny   s guest  as part of the assignment .         yes     said gardner .     i do not conduct a simple interview .  i try to sample mr .  rubin   s activities  so to speak .         ah     said gonzalo     that brings us to the key question .  if your activities are concerned with presenting manny to the public  how can you possibly justify your existence .      gardner said     if mr .  rubin can justify his  then mine is automatically justified .      avalon laughed loudly .     that   s a good answer .  you   re squelched  mario .         he was primed     said gonzalo indignantly     but never mind .  mr .  gardner  before dinner you said you weren   t familiar with politics .  isn   t that a handicap in your line of work .         no  sir .  if i were a political reporter  it would be  but i deal with personalities .         what if your personality is a politician .         i know enough for that .         have you ever messed up an assignment because of your ignorance of politics .         i   m not ignorant of politics     said gardner softly  and not noticeably annoyed .     i have never needed more than i have  even when   i have done an interview  for instance  with hubert hum       trumbull broke in     hold it  mario .  mr .  gardner  we of the black widowers have grown sensitive over small things .  you said     even when       then paused  and changed subjects on us .  please unchange .  even when what .      gardner looked genuinely puzzled     i don   t understand .         you were about to say something and didn   t .  now  what were you about to say .      gardner comprehended .     oh   that   s a war story that seems to bother me a bit every presidential election year .  it   s not important .         could you tell us just the same .         but it happened a quarter of a century ago .  it   s all over .         even so  that   s the turn the grilling has taken .  i   m afraid it   s part of the requirements of the game that you must answer .  i assure you everything said here is confidential .      gardner looked about him  rather helplessly .     there   s nothing confidential about it .  it was the winter of      .  in korea  the army under general macarthur had reached the manchurian border in late november and we were all going to be home by christmas .         i know     said drake  with dry reminiscence .     then the chinese came pouring south and caught us with our pants down .         you   re so right     said gardner bitterly .     to this day  i don   t know how we could have been caught so flat   footed .  anyway  the south korean divisions just melted away .  after all  they could become part of the countryside .  take off the uniform and each of them is just another local peasant .  for americans and the few western allies  it was another thing .  we just had to scurry south as fast as we could and stay together as best we could till we had built a line that would hold .      lots of us were separated from our units .  i was .  for five days i made my way southward wondering when some chinese unit might spot me or when some korean peasants might trap me for what i wore and carried .      i hid by day and moved on by night .  my rations were gone and after a while i went hungry .  i didn   t know what was ahead or if there was an american army anywhere at all .  it was the worst defeat in the field an american army had ever suffered since the civil war .      the third day i came across another american soldier .  i nearly shot him before i recognized him as one of us .  he nearly shot me  for that matter .  he was wounded and had difficulty moving .  i helped him along but that slowed me down quite a bit and a dozen times i thought of leaving him behind .  i couldn   t quite make myself do that .  i   d like to say it was a humanitarian impulse but he was another pair of eyes and he might see something that i alone would see too late .  besides that  he was company .  god  i would do anything for company .      the fifth night  he was dying .  i knew it and he knew it .  i didn   t know what to do to help him  or to just make it easier for him .  so i stayed with him and he talked .  i didn   t really listen  you know .  i just kept trying to watch all sides at once and was half wishing he would die so that i could move on  and half wishing he wouldn   t die and leave me alone .      he was lightheaded and rambled on from topic to topic .  he talked american politics .  he said truman was through and the republicans would probably put taft in the white house in       .  i remember he said that would be the fourth set of relatives to become presidents and the second father   son combination .  that rather stuck in my mind   i don   t know why   but everything else he said is just gone  except that it was all about presidents .  i think he must have been a presidential buff and that he knew everything about them .      just before the end  he talked about himself and his family .  he was married and had a kid  a little girl two months old whom he had never seen .  he managed to get something out of a pocket and give it to me .     get it to her     he said     please .  she   ll know i at least saw her holding the little girl  that i thought of them at the last .     he tried to kiss it .  it was the photograph of a woman and a baby and i suppose it had reached him just before the army had fallen apart .      i said     okay .  what   s your name .  where do you live .     in the two days we had been together  we hadn   t exhanged names .  names hadn   t been important those two days .      his eyes were glazing and he was mumbling .  he said     my name .  a good name .  presidential name .  no relative  of course .  second   best vote   getter on the list .  they love him .     his voice trailed away  but i remember his exact words .  i thought of it a lot  you see .      i shook him  but he was dead .  well  what could i do .  i certainly wasn   t going to linger behind to give him a christian burial or anything like that .  i just wanted out .  but i did try to reach for his dog tags so i could hand them in if i ever got back to any american line .  also to get his name so i could deliver the photo .  i thought that if i ever got back i had the obligation to try to do that .      my hand never touched him .  i heard the sound of chinese   i guess it was chinese   and someone was on top of me .  i think he tripped over me .  i tore away  using my rifle as a club  and then i ran .  i heard shots but nothing hit me  and i kept running .  then up ahead i heard someone swearing in english and i raised my hand  shouting     american .  american .         i was with an american company and that was it .  it was two more days before i got my thoughts sorted out  and part of that time i think i was on a stretcher .      there was a pause and halsted said     so you never got the soldier   s dog tags .         no  sir     said gardner emphatically .     we were retreating .  we didn   t stop and turn till we were well south of seoul  and then we came back only to the boundary between the two koreas more or less .  my buddy  whoever he was  died deep in north korea  and he remains in north korea to this day .         then you couldn   t deliver the photo .     said halsted .   gardner said     i tried .  the trouble was i didn   t even know what his unit was and we lost a great many men in that retreat .  i checked as far as i could .  i suppose i could have run a copy of the picture in some national magazine and waited for a woman to come and claim it  but that took more money than i was willing to spend .      it bothers me a bit .  his daughter should be in her late twenties now  and his wife should be my age .  his wife might be dead or married again  his daughter may be a mother herself and she may never give a thought to a father she   s never seen .  still   it   s just possible it might be nice for them to have some little thing he touched as he was dying  some assurance they filled his dying thoughts .  but what can i do .  still  when presidential elections are in the air  i think of it more than i usually do .      avalon said     one can   t blame one   s self for something that is completely outside one   s control .      halsted said     but you said you tried  mr .  gardner .  how could you possibly have tried .  you had nothing to go on .      gardner said     sure i did .  he said he had the name of one of the american presidents .  it was probably the accident of his name that made him such a presidential buff .  and he said the president was the second     best vote   getter in the list and that the people loved him .  that seemed clear enough to me .  after i got out  i wrote to washington and i was able to have them run a check on the names of those missing in action in the course of the retreat .  it seemed certain to me that his body was never recovered so he wouldn   t be listed as killed in action  and that cut down on the numbers a bit .         i take it you didn   t find anything     said drake  lighting a fresh cigarette .      nothing .  there wasn   t a single roosevelt on the list .      rubin exploded .     roosevelt .  why roosevelt .      gardner looked surprised .     why not roosevelt .  it   s the obvious name considering what he said .  the only name .  i don   t know why there wasn   t someone by that name missing in action .  it could be typical army snafu  but since there wasn   t i came to a dead end .         how do you make out roosevelt .     said rubin .      surely you   re old enough to remember the      election .  i was ten years old then  but i remember the fuss it made .  franklin roosevelt carried forty   six of the forty   eight states and left poor alf landon with maine and vermont only   eight electoral votes .         and that made him second best .         well  washington was elected twice by unanimous vote of the electoral college  in      and in      .  that put him in first place .  you can   t do better than unanimous .  and fdr is in second place .      avalon  sitting bolt upright  his neat little pepper   and   salt beard giving him the air of a sage whenever he drew his eyebrows together and grew portentous  said     actually not .  in       james monroe  our fifth president  was running for re   election .  the united states was practically a one   party nation at the time .  the federalist party had virtually committed suicide by engaging injudiciously in what came to be considered treasonable activity during the war of      .  everyone who counted politically  therefore  called himself a democratic   republican .  later on new factions and new parties formed about several of the dominant personalities  but that time had not yet come .  therefore  monroe ran for re   election with no formal opposition .     he paused and gazed about at the others with a touch of complacence fr  tom trumbull said     come on  geoff  you just happened to read all about this recently  so don   t make it sound as though you   re dredging it up from some deep well of remembered knowledge .  what are you getting at .         i did not read about it recently .  these are facts every schoolchild knows  or would know if schools were worth anything these days .  the point is that monroe got every electoral vote but one .  the lone dissenter   from new hampshire  i believe   cast his vote for john quincy adams  for the express purpose of keeping it from being unanimous .  no man but washington  he said  should be elected unanimously .      you see  then     avalon continued     that if washington is in first place as a vote   getter  monroe is in second place  f . d . r is only in third .  that is why you found no roosevelts among the missing in action .  the dead soldier   s name must have been monroe .   .   .   .      gardner stared about him with astonishment .     incredible .     he said .     i can   t believe it .  i never thought for one minute there was anyone other than roosevelt that it could be .  are you sure .      avalon shrugged .     we can look it up .  we have a couple of almanacs on the reference shelf .         don   t bother to get the almanac  henry     said rubin .     geoff is right  at least in this case .      gardner said     i suppose i can get back to washington on this .  the army must keep its records forever .  you know  i feel rotten .  if i hadn   t been so cocksure  i might have found the wife and child a quarter of a century ago .         i don   t know     said drake thoughtfully .     it seems to me there are two parts to the identification .  the president was the second   best vote   getter  and the people loved him .  i   ll grant roosevelt   s popularity  but how did monroe stand .         nowhere     said rubin at once .     nowhere .  he inherited the presidency because it had become almost traditional at the time to have it go to a virginian .  he was the fourth virginian out of five presidents  the four being washington  jefferson  madison  and monroe .  monroe was the last and the least of them .  his only great accomplishment was the monroe doctrine  and that was really the product of john quincy adams  his secretary of state .         well  then  was it monroe or wasn   t it monroe .     said gardner .     you   ve got me completely mixed up .  what   s the answer .         i   m not sure     said  rubin     but i   m positive it wasn   t monroe .  look  the constitution gives the right to elect the president to the electoral college  and for the first eight elections or so there aren   t even any records of any popular vote .  no presidential candidate had to squeeze votes out of the general public in those years  he had to intrigue for the votes of a few electors .  that wasn   t vote   getting in our modern sense and if we   re going to try to figure out first and second place in vote   getting  we   ll have to eliminate the early presidents .  i   m sure the soldier never thought of either washington or monroe in any vote   getting capacity .      gardner rubbed the line of his jawbone .     when did the vote   getting start .      rubin said  frowning     the first modern election campaign  a libelous circus featuring dirty tricks  was in      .  that was william henry harrison winning over martin van buren .  i suspect we ought to start with him .      avalon said     no  manny .  the      election may have set the style but i think we   ve got to start with andrew jackson back in      .         all right     said rubin  casting his right hand upward as though negligently tossing away a point .     start with andy jackson .      drake  sitting back in his chair  peered at the rest out of his contact lenses and said     johnson got a landslide vote in      and nixon got one in       but the soldier died in late      .   .   .   .         right     said gardner .     truman was president then  so we have to stop with him .      avalon said     i   m pretty sure that if we restrict ourselves to the presidents between jackson and truman  both included  then the greatest vote   getter was roosevelt in      and the second greatest   and i   m certain of this   was warren harding over james cox in      .      gardner said     are you saying then it   s harding .         no  we   re not     said rubin quickly .     no one in their right mind can possibly suppose that your soldier friend would be proud of the presidential aspect of his name if he were named harding .      drake said     if geoff is right and harding won by the second biggest landslide in terms of percentages  then harding it is .  you can   t argue with figures .         yes  you can     said rubin .     you can deny that one particular set of figures is the basis of the judgment .  the fact is that in all the history of the presidency no one can possibly be considered for the top mark as a vote   getter but roosevelt  that   s why i was so astonished when gardner decided on him as second   best .  but why is roosevelt considered tops .  not through percentage points  but because he was elected in four successive presidential years                    and       and no other president has been elected more than twice .  it   s the number of elections that counts .      gardner said     that doesn   t do any good .  who   s in second place  then .      rubin said     well  i don   t know .  it should be one of the two   term presidents  but how can we say which .  it depends on your soldier friend   s prejudices and predilections .         perhaps not     said avalon .     if he was a presidential buff  he must have had some logical criterion for his choice and we ought to be able to find it .      gonzalo said     there   s the bit about his being loved .  which president was most loved by the people after roosevelt .  that should tell us .      rubin said     i don   t think so .  all presidents were loved by most of those who voted for him .  it   s a kind of automatic reflex .  hell  i would say that right now there is a quarter of the electorate that think nixon was done dirt and that love him still .  i think we ought to be careful how we use that criterion .      avalon said     well  let   s not talk aimlessly .  roosevelt was our only four   term winner and there were no three   term winners .  therefore we have to pick our second   best vote   getter out of those presidents who won two elections .  from jackson to truman there were six two   election winners  if i count correctly .  i   ll name them and you check me off  manny  and if we get into an argument  we   ll refer to the almanac .  the two   term winners are andrew jackson  abraham lincoln  ulysses s .  grant  grover cleveland  william mckinley  and woodrow wilson .      now we can start eliminating  and manny  you continue to correct me  if necessary .  lincoln   s first election in      was a fluke and no tribute really to his vote   getting ability .  it so happened that he faced a disunited democratic party  which ran both stephen douglas and john breckenridge against him .  i think a fellow called bell also ran .  had lincoln faced a united opposition  he   d have been snowed under .  as it was  he managed to get a majority of the electoral votes with a minority of the popular vote .      the same is true of woodrow wilson  who faced both theodore roosevelt and william howard taft in      .  if the republican party had been united  wilson would have been badly beaten .  as for grover cleveland  he won twice but not in successive election years .  he beat james blaine in      and benjamin harrison in       but was defeated in      .  that makes him both twenty   second and twenty   fourth president  the only man in american history to get two presidential numbers .      that leaves just three presidents who won two successive elections without benefit of a major split in the opposition  and they were jackson  grant  and mckinley .  the second best has to be one of them .      avalon stopped for a few minutes  then said     only i   m not sure which .      trumbull said     what   s the good of an analysis that leaves us with three candidates .      gonzalo said     i still say we   ve got to remember that the soldier said the people loved him .  it has to play some part .      rubin shrugged .     i don   t know  i mistrust that .  but let   s see .  for instance  mckinley was a gentle and lovable soul in his private life  but he was a weak president and stirred few hearts .  in fact  it was his losing opponent  william jennings bryan  who received the fanatical adoration of his followers .      gonzalo said     that makes mckinley all the better as a vote   getter  if he ran against a strong opponent .         maybe     said rubin     but we   re working now on the supposition that the man we   re after won and was loved .  so it   s not mckinley .  grant was a war hero  so there were plenty of people to idolize him .  however  his victories were over another part of the nation  and they didn   t love him in the southern states .         besides  he was corrupt  wasn   t he .     said gonzalo .      not he himself .  those around him .  and that was not fully realized till after the re   election victory of       so it has nothing to do with the case .  that leaves us andrew jackson  a strong vote   getter  idolized by many of those who were for him and with his popularity spread widely over the nation .         he was well hated by some     growled trumbull .      every president is .  even f . d . r .  no  i   m pretty sure that second best would have to be jackson .  and it   s a common name  too .  i   ll bet there were a number of jacksons missing in action in that winter retreat in korea .      there was a longish silence  and then gardner said     well  i   ll try to track down the jacksons .  maybe to play it safe i ought to get names and addresses on the hardings and monroes and mckinleys too .      avalon said     maybe you   ll have to make a list of anyone with a presidential name .  manny   s argument is ingenious  but it   s too refined to carry conviction .  i suspect manny realizes that  too .      rubin was stung into instant defense .     no such thing .  there is no other sensible way of working out the problem  given the data .  if anyone can supply one  i should like to hear it  that   s all .         is that a general challenge .     said gonzalo .      it is     said rubin .      even to henry .         even to henry     said rubin  after a slight hesitation .     i don   t see how he can improve it .         that   s your cue  henry     said gonzalo  grinning .     knock him dead .      henry  who had long since cleared the sideboard and who had been listening with the greatest interest  said     i can scarcely claim to know more of american history than mr .  rubin or mr .  avalon .      gonzalo said     come on  henry  they   ll tell you any history you want to know .  just improve on manny   s argument .         i   m not sure that i can     said henry cautiously     but i have a question of mr .  gardner  if i may .      gardner  who looked puzzled at the sudden entry of the waiter into the argument  said     yes  of course .      several of the gentlemen  and you yourself  have spoken of the second   best vote   getter having been loved by the people .  that  however  is not my recollection of the wording in your account .  did the dying soldier say     the people loved him    .      gardner thought for a moment .     no .  he said     they love him .            are you sure  sir .  it was years ago .         i admit that .  but i thought about it a lot that first year and it was    they love him .         gonzalo said     i see what henry   s driving at .  the    they    doesn   t refer to people generally  and once we figure out to whom it does refer  we   ve got it .  right  henry .         well  no  mr .  gonzalo     said henry .     i rather imagine it does refer to the people  i just wanted to get the exact wording .  mr .  gardner  was it a complete statement  or was the soldier trying to add something to it .         there you   ve got me  henry .  i don   t know .         but it was the last thing he said .     they love him .     he didn   t say anything after that .  he might have intended to say something more  to add to the statement  but couldn   t make it .         i suppose so  but i don   t know .      trumbull said impatiently     what   s all this about  henry .      henry said     i   m not quite certain  yet .  i am curious  however  about something mr .  rubin said .  sir  did you say that grover cleveland was elected for two nonconsecutive terms .         that   s right  henry     said rubin     in      and      .         and he was defeated in      .         yes  by benjamin harrison  on whom he turned the tables in      .  it was very unusual .  a president in office was defeated for re   election in two elections running  and the same two candidates in those elections swapped victory and defeat .      henry said patiently     yes  mr .  rubin  but the point is that grover cleveland ran as a candidate of one of the major parties three times in succession .         so he did .  but he only won twice .         i understand .  of the other five two   term candidates  did any other run a third time .         andrew jackson did .  he ran three times and was elected only twice .      avalon said     henry clay and william jennings bryan ran three times each and each lost every time .  henry clay  .   .   .      trumbull overrode him hastily     nixon ran three times and won twice but that was after truman .      henry said     how did cleveland do in the middle race .  the one he lost .      rubin said     i can   t give you the exact figures  but i think it was a narrow loss .      henry said     perhaps we should now turn to the almanac .     he went to the reference shelf and brought it back .   rubin said     let me look it up .  i know about where it is .      he riffled the pages  then ran his fingers down one page  whistling softly .     here it is .  oh good god  he lost in the electoral college     to     but he had the lead in the popular vote .  he was nearly         votes ahead of harrison .  not an absolute majority because there were a couple of minor candidates in the field  prohibitionists and laborites .      henry said     then it seems to me that if franklin d .  roosevelt led the field in four successive elections  grover cleveland led the field in three successive elections and he can be considered the second   best vote   getter .      avalon  however  said     hold on .     he had been running through the almanac   s pages .     manny said jackson ran a third time  too .  he ran and was defeated in       but he had the plurality in that year .  jackson also led the field in three successive elections .     he held the page up before henry   s eyes .      that is so  sir     said henry     but mr .  rubin had discarded victories over a split opposition .  in       jackson ran against three major opponents .  cleveland led the field three times in a row against a single unified opposition each time .  he   s still second best .      rubin said     well  henry  you convince me .  but how did you know .  did you just happen to know that cleveland led harrison in the popular vote the time cleveland lost .      gonzalo said     it   s no mystery .  while we were all arguing .  henry just looked up all the statistics in the almanac .  right  henry .         no  sir     said henry     it wasn   t necessary to go to the almanac .         frankly     said gardner impatiently     i don   t think that henry   s analysis is any more convincing than the others .         it would not be     said henry     if it depended on the election statistics  but i just used those to confirm a decision made on other grounds .         on what other grounds  henry .     said avalon sternly .     don   t play games with us .         it did occur to me  mr .  avalon  when mr .  gardner told his story  that it was possible the dying soldier was not merely making a statement when he said .  they love him     but was attempting to complete a quotation .  this is especially so since  if mr .  gardner   s memory is right  he used the present tense .         well  henry .         i seemed to recall that there is a well   known quotation in the history of politics that goes     they love him most for the enemies he has made .     i thought the reference might have been to franklin roosevelt  but i didn   t really know .  while you were arguing  therefore  i consulted bartlett .  the remark was made on july          by one edward stuyvesant bragg  who was  at the time  seconding the nomination of grover cleveland .      and the awed silence that followed was broken by gardner  who said softly     you   ve sold me  henry .  mind if i do an article on you someday .      henry smiled and shook his head .     i   d rather you didn   t  sir .  i value my anonymity .         second best      afterword     second best    was written in august      in the heat of a presidential campaign .  i suppose it was inevitable that  with my mind on what was taking place  i would do a black widowers story that dealt with elections .   that was not very bright of me .  i am experienced enough to understand that one should not deal with things that are topical at the time of writing   but at the time of publishing .  after all  it takes about nine months between the time a story is accepted by eqmm and the time it is published .   though i submitted the story quite confidently  since i was fond of it   fred dannay shot it right back .  it would have to appear after the election  and the readers would be sated with the subject by then .   it was embarrassing to make so elementary a mistake  but it had its advantage  too .  in each of the first two books of this series  i included three stories that had not appeared in any form prior to book publication  and i intended to have three such stories in this third book as well .     second best    was hied away cheerfully as the first of them .     .  the missing item  emmanuel rubin  resident polymath of the black widowers society  was visibly chafed .  his eyebrows hunched down into the upper portion of his thick   lensed spectacles and his sparse gray beard bristled .      not true to life     he said .     imagine .  not true to life .      mario gonzalo  who had just reached the head of the stairs and had accepted his dry martini from henry  the unsurpassable waiter  said     what   s not true to life .      geoffrey avalon looked down from his seventy   four inches and said solemnly     it appears that manny has suffered a rejection .         well  why not .     said gonzalo  peeling off his gloves .     editors don   t have to be stupid all the time .         it isn   t the rejection     said rubin .     i   ve been rejected before by better editors and in connection with better stories .  it   s the reason he advanced .  how the hell would he know if a story were true to life or not .  what   s he ever done but warm an office chair .  would he  .   .   .      roger halsted  whose career as a math teacher in a junior high school had taught him how to interrupt shrill voices  managed to interpose .     just what did he find not true to life  manny .      rubin waved a hand passionately outward .     i don   t want to talk about it .         good     said thomas trumbull  scowling from under his neatly waved thatch of white hair .     then the rest of us can hear each other for a while .  roger  why don   t you introduce your guest to the late mr .  gonzalo .      halsted said     i   ve just been waiting for the decibel level to decrease .  mario  my friend jonathan thatcher .  this is mario gonzalo  who is an artist by profession .  jonathan is an oboist  mario .      gonzalo grinned and said     sounds like fun .         sometimes it almost is     said thatcher     on days when the reed behaves itself .      thatcher   s round face and plump cheeks would have made him a natural to play santa claus at any christmas benefit  but he would have needed padding just the same  for his body had that peculiar ersatz slimness that seemed to indicate forty pounds recently lost .  his eyebrows were dark and thick  and one took it for granted that they were never drawn together in anger .   henry said     gentlemen  dinner is ready .      james drake stubbed out his cigarette and said     thanks  henry .  it   s a cold day and i would welcome hot food .         yes  sir     said henry with a gentle smile .     lobster thermidor today  baked potatoes  stuffed eggplant .   .   .         but what   s this  henry .     demanded rubin  scowling .      hot borscht  mr .  rubin .      rubin looked as though he were searching his soul and then he said grudgingly     all right .      drake  unfolding his napkin  said     point of order  roger .         what is it .         i   m sitting next to manny  and if he continues to look like that he   ll curdle my soup and give me indigestion .  you   re host and absolute monarch  i move you direct him to tell us what he wrote that isn   t true to life and get it out of his system .         why .     said trumbull .     why not let him sulk and be silent for the novelty of it .         i   m curious  too     said gonzalo     since nothing he   s ever written has been true to life .   .  .  .         how would you know  since you can   t read .     said rubin suddenly .      it   s generally known     said gonzalo .     you hear it everywhere .         oh god  i   d better tell you and end this miasma of pseudowit .  look  i   ve written a novelette  about fifteen thousand words long  about a worldwide organization of locksmiths .   .   .   .         locksmiths .     said avalon  frowning as though he suspected he had not heard correctly .      locksmiths     said rubin .     these guys are experts  they can open anything   safes  vaults  prison doors .  there are no secrets from them  and nothing can be hidden from them .  my global organization is of the cream of the profession and no man can join the organization without some document or object of importance stolen from an industrial  political  or governmental unit .      naturally  they have the throat of the world in their grip .  they can control the stock market  guide diplomacy  make and unmake governments and  at the time my story opens  they are headed by a dangerous megalomaniac .   .   .   .      drake interrupted even as he winced in his effort to crack the claw of the lobster .     who is out to rule the world  of course .         of course     said rubin     and our hero must stop him .  he is himself a skilled locksmith .   .   .   .      trumbull interrupted .     in the first place  manny  what the hell do you know about locksmithery or locksmithmanship or whatever you call it .         more than you think     retorted rubin .      i doubt that very much     said trumbull     and the editor is right .  this is utter and complete implausibility .  i know a few locksmiths  and they   re gentle and inoffensive mechanics with iq   s  .   .   .      rubin said     and i suppose when you were in the army you knew a few corporals and  on the basis of your knowledge  you   ll tell me that napoleon and hitler were implausible .      the guest for that evening  who had listened to the exchange with a darkening expression  spoke up .     pardon me  gentlemen  i know i   m to be grilled at the conclusion of dinner .  does that mean i cannot join the dinner conversation beforehand .         heavens  no     said halsted .     talk all you want   it you can get a word in now and then .         in that case  let me put myself forcefully on the side of mr .  rubin .  a conspiracy of locksmiths may sound implausible to us who sit here  but what counts is not what a few rational people think but what the great outside world does .  how can your editor turn down anything at all as implausible when everything  .   .   .     he caught himself  took a deep breath  and said  in an altered tone     well  i don   t mean to tell you your business .  i   m not a writer .  after all  i don   t expect you to tell me how to play the oboe     but his smile as he said it was a weak one .      manny will tell you how to play the oboe     said gonzalo     if you give him a chance .         still     thatcher said  as though he had not heard gonzalo   s comment     i live in the world and observe it .  anything these days is believed .  there is no such thing as    not true to life .     just spout any nonsense solemnly and swear it   s true and there will be millions rallying round you .      avalon nodded magisterially and said     quite right  mr .  thatcher .  i don   t know that this is simply characteristic of our times  but the fact that we have better communications now makes it easier to reach many people quickly so that a phenomenon such as herr hitler of unmourned memory is possible .  and to those who can believe in mr von daniken   s ancient astronauts and in mr .  berlitz   s bermuda triangle  a little thing like a conspiracy of locksmiths could be swallowed with the morning porridge .      thatcher waved his hand .     ancient astronauts and bermuda triangles are nothing .  suppose you were to say that you frequently visited mars in astral projection and that mars was  in fact  a haven for the worthy souls of this world .  there would be those who would believe you .         i imagine so     began avalon .      you don   t have to imagine     said thatcher .     it is so .  i take it you haven   t heard of tri   lucifer .  that   s t   r   i .         tri   lucifer .     said halsted  looking a little dumfounded .     you mean three lucifers .  what   s that .      thatcher looked from one face to another and the black widowers all remained silent .   and then henry  who was clearing away some of the lobster shells  said     if i may be permitted  gentlemen  i have heard of it .  there were a group of them soliciting contributions at this restaurant last week .         like the moonies .     said drake  pushing his dish in henry   s direction and preparing to light up .      there is a resemblance     said henry  his face a bit thoughtful     but the tri   luciferians  if that is the term to use  give a more other   worldly appearance .         that   s right     said thatcher     they have to divorce themselves from this world so as to achieve astral projection to mars and facilitate the transfer of their souls there after death .         but why       began gonzalo .   and trumbull suddenly roared out with a blast of anger     come on  roger  make them wait for the grilling to start .  change the subject .      gonzalo said     i just want to know why they call them  .   .   .      halsted sighed and said     let   s wait a while  mario .      henry was making his way about the table with the brandy when halsted tapped his water glass and said     i think we can begin the grilling now  and manny  since it was your remark about true   to   lifeness that roused jonathan   s interest over the main course  why don   t you begin .         sure .     rubin looked solemnly across the table at thatcher and said     mr .  thatcher  at this point it would be traditional to ask you how you justify your existence  and we would then go into a discussion of the oboe as an instrument of torture for oboists .  but let me guess and say that at this moment you would consider your life justified if you could wipe out a few tri   luciferians .  am i right .         you are  you are     said thatcher  energetically .     the whole thing has filled my life and my thoughts for over a month now .  it is ruining  .   .   .      gonzalo interrupted .     what i want to know is why they call themselves triluciferians .  are they devil worshipers or what .      rubin began     you   re interrupting the man .   .  .  .         it   s all right     said thatcher .     i   ll tell him .  i   m just sorry that i know enough about that organization to be able to tell him .  apparently  lucifer means the morning star  though i   m not sure why .   .   .   .         lucifer     said avalon  running his finger about the lip of his water glass     is from latin words meaning    light bringer .     the rising of the morning star in the dawn heralds the soon   following rising of the sun .  in an era in which there were no clocks that was an important piece of information to anyone awake at the time .         then why is lucifer the name of the devil .     asked gonzalo .   avalon said     because the babylonian king was apparently referred to as the morning star by his flattering courtiers  and the prophet isaiah predicted his destruction .  can you quote the passage  manny .      rubin said     we can read it out of the bible  if we want to .  it   s the fourteenth chapter of isaiah .  the key sentence goes     how art thou fallen from heaven  o lucifer  son of the morning .     it was just a bit of poetic hyperbole  and very effective too  but it was interpreted literally later  and that one sentence gave rise to the whole myth of a rebellion against god by hordes of angels under the leadership of lucifer  which came to be considered satan   s name while still in heaven .  of course  the rebels were defeated and expelled from heaven by loyalist angels under the leadership of the archangel michael .         as in paradise lost .     said gonzalo      exactly as in paradise lost .      thatcher said     the devil isn   t part of it  though .  to the tri   luciferians  lucifer just means the morning star .  there are two of them on earth  venus and mercury .      drake squinted through the curling tobacco smoke and said     they   re also evening stars  depending on which side of the sun they happen to be .  they   re either east of the sun and set shortly after sunset  or west of the sun and rise shortly before sunrise .      thatcher said  with clear evidence of hope     do they have to be both together  both one or both the other .         no     said drake     they move independently .  they can be both evening stars  or both morning stars  or one can be an evening star and one a morning star .  or one or the other or both can be nearly in a line with the sun and be invisible altogether  morning or evening .         too bad     said thatcher  shaking his head     that   s what they say .  anyway  the point is that from mars you see three morning stars in the sky  or you can see them if they   re in the right position  not only mercury and venus  but earth as well .         that   s right     said rubin .      and     said thatcher     i suppose then it   s true that they can be in any position .  they can all be evening stars or all morning stars  or two an be one and one can be the other .         yes     said drake     or one or more can be too close to the sun to be visible .      thatcher sighed .     so they call mars by their mystic name of tri   lucifer   the world with the three morning stars .         i suppose     said gonzalo     that jupiter would have four morning stars  mercury  venus  earth  and mars  and so on out to pluto  which would have eight morning stars .         the trouble is     said halsted     that the farther out you go  the dimmer the inner planets are .  viewed from one of the satellites of jupiter  for instance  i doubt that mercury would appear more than a medium   bright star  and it might be too close to the sun for anyone ever to get a good look at it .         what about the view from mars .  could you see mercury .     asked thatcher .      oh yes  i   m sure of that     said halsted     i could work out what the brightness would be in a matter of minutes .         would you .     said thatcher .      sure     said halsted     if i   ve remembered to bring my pocket calculator .  yes  i have it .  henry  bring me the columbia encyclopedia  would you .      rubin said     while roger is bending his limited mathematical mind to the problem  mr .  thatcher  tell us what your interest is in all this .  you seem to be interested in exposing them as fakers .  why .  have you been a member .  are you now disillusioned .         no  i   ve never been a member .  i  .  .  .     he nibbed his temple hesitantly .     it   s my wife .  i don   t like talking about it  you understand .      avalon said solemnly     please be assured  mr .  thatcher  that whatever is said here never passes beyond the bounds of this room .  that includes our valued waiter  henry .  you may speak freely .         well  there   s nothing criminal or disgraceful in it .  i just don   t like to seem to be so helpless in such a silly  .   .   .  it   s breaking up my marriage  gentlemen .      there was a discreet silence around the table  broken only by the mild sound of halsted turning the pages of the encyclopedia .   thatcher went on .     roger knows my wife .  he   ll tell you she   s a sensible woman .   .  .   .      halsted looked up briefly and nodded .     i   ll vouch for that  but i didn   t know you were having this  .   .   .         lately  carol has not been social  you understand  and i certainly haven   t talked about it .  it was with great difficulty  you know  that i managed to agree to come out tonight .  i dread leaving her to herself .  you see  even sensible people have their weaknesses .  carol worries about death .         so do we all     said drake .      so do i     said thatcher     but in a normal way  i hope .  we all know we   ll die someday and we don   t particularly look forward to it  and we may worry about hell or nothingness or hope for heaven  but we don   t think about it much .  carol has been fascinated  however  by the possibility of demonstrating the actual existence of life after death .  it may have all started with the bridey murphy case when she was a teen   ager   i don   t know if any of you remember that  .   .   .         i do     said rubin .     a woman under hypnosis seemed to be possessed by an irishwoman who had died a long time before .         yes     said thatcher .     she saw through that  eventually .  then she grew interested in spiritualism and gave that up .  i always relied on her to understand folly when she finally stopped to think about it   and then she came up against the tri   luciferians .  i never saw her like this .  she wants to join them .  she has money of her own and she wants to give it to them .  i don   t care about the money   well  i do  but that   s not the main thing   i care about her .  you know  she   s going to join them in their retreat somewhere  become a daughter of tri   lucifer  or whatever they call it  and wait for translation to the abode of the blessed .  one of these days  she   ll be gone .  i just won   t see her anymore .  she promised me it wouldn   t be tonight  but i wonder .      rubin said     i take it you suppose that the organization is just interested in her money .         at least the leader of it is     said thatcher grimly .     i   m sure of it .  what else can he be after .         do you know him .  have you met him .     said rubin .      no .  he keeps himself isolated     said thatcher     but i hear he has recently bought a fancy mansion in florida  and i doubt that it   s for the use of the membership .         funny thing about that     said drake .     it doesn   t matter how lavishly a cult leader lives  how extravagantly he throws money around .  the followers who support him and see their money clearly used for that purpose never seem to mind .         they identify     said rubin .     the more he spends  the more successful they consider the cause .  it   s the basis of ostentatious waste in governmental display  too .         just the same     said thatcher     i don   t think carol will ever commit herself entirely .  she might not be bothered by the leader   s actions  but if i can prove him wrong  she   ll drop it .         wrong about what .     asked rubin .      wrong about mars .  this head of the group claims he has been on mars often   in astral projection  of course .  he describes mars in detail  but can he be describing it accurately .         why not .     asked rubin .     if he reads up on what is known about mars  he can describe it as astronomers would .  the viking photographs even show a part of the surface in detail .  it   s not difficult to be accurate .         yes  but it may be that somewhere he has made a mistake  something i can show carol .      halsted looked up and said     here  i   ve worked out the dozen brightest objects in the martian sky  together with their magnitudes .  i may be off a little here and there  but not by much .     he passed a slip of paper around .   mario held up the paper when it reached him .     would you like to see it  henry .         thank you  sir     murmured henry  and as he glanced at it briefly  one eyebrow raised itself just slightly  just briefly .   the paper came to rest before thatcher eventually and he gazed at it earnestly .  what he saw was this   sun       phobos    .    deimos    .    earth    .    jupiter    .    venus    .    sirius    .    saturn    .    canopus    .    alpha centauri       .    arcturus    .    mercury   .    thatcher said     phobos and deimos are the two satellites of mars .  do these numbers mean they   re very bright .         the greater the negative number     said halsted     the brighter the object .  a     object is   .   times brighter than a     object  and a     object is   .   times brighter still  and so on .  next to the sun  phobos is the brightest object in the martian sky  and deimos is next .         and next to the sun and the two satellites  earth is the brightest object in the sky  then .         yes  but only at or near its maximum brightness     said halsted .     it can be much dimmer depending on where mars and earth are in their respective orbits .  most of the time it   s probably less bright than jupiter  which doesn   t change much in brightness as it moves in its orbit .      thatcher shook his head and looked disappointed .     but it can be that bright .  too bad .  there   s a special prayer or psalm or something that the tri   luciferians have that appears in almost all their literature .  i   ve seen it so often in the stuff carol brings home  i can quote it exactly .  it goes     when earth shines high in the sky  like a glorious jewel  and when the other lucifers have fled beyond the horizon  so that earth shines alone in splendor  single in beauty  unmatched in brightness  it is then that the souls of those ready to receive the call must prepare to rise from earth and cross the gulf .     and what you   re saying  roger  is that earth can be the brightest object in the martian sky .      halsted nodded .     at night  if phobos and deimos are below the horizon  and earth is near maximum brightness  it is certainly the brightest object in the sky .  it would be   times as bright as jupiter  if that were in the sky  and   times as bright as venus at its brightest .         and it could be the only morning star in the sky .         or the only evening star .  sure .  the other two  venus and mercury  could be on the other side of the sun from earth .      thatcher kept staring at the list .     but would mercury be visible .  it   s at the bottom of the list .      halsted said     the bottom just means that it   s twelfth brightest  but there are thousands of stars that are dimmer and still visible .  there would be only four stars brighter than mercury as seen from mars  sirius  canopus  alpha centauri  and arcturus .      thatcher said     if they   d only make a mistake .      avalon said in a grave and somewhat hesitant baritone     mr .  thatcher  i think perhaps you had better face the facts .  it is my experience that even if you do find a flaw in the thesis of the tri   luciferians it won   t help you .  those who follow cults for emotional reasons are not deterred by demonstrations of the illogic of what they are doing .      thatcher said     i agree with you  and i wouldn   t dream of arguing with the ordinary cultist .  but i know carol .  i have seen her turn away from a system of beliefs she would very much like to have followed  simply because she saw the illogic of it .  if i could find something of the sort here  i   m sure she   d come back .      gonzalo said     some of us here ought to think of something .  after all  he   s never really been on mars .  he   s got to have made a mistake .         not at all     said avalon .     he probably knows as much about mars as we do .  therefore  even if he   s made a mistake it may be because he fails to understand something we also fail to understand and we won   t catch him .      thatcher nodded his head .     i suppose you   re right .         i don   t know     said gonzalo .     how about the canals .  the tri   luciferians are bound to talk about the canals .  everyone believed in them and then just lately we found out they weren   t there  isn   t that right .  so if he talks about them  he   s caught .      drake said     not everybody believed in them  mario .  hardly any astronomers did .         the general public did     said gonzalo .   rubin said     not lately .  it was in      that mariner   took the first pictures of mars and that pretty much gave away the fact the canals didn   t exist .  once mariner   mapped the whole planet in      there was no further argument .  when did the tri   luciferians come into existence  mr .  thatcher .         as i recall     said thatcher     about      .  maybe      .         there you are     said rubin .     once we had mars down cold this guy  whoever he is who runs it  decided to start a new religion based on it .  listen  if you want to get rich quick  no questions asked  start a new religion .  between the first amendment and the tax breaks you get  it amounts to a license to help yourself to everything in sight .  i   ll bet he talks about volcanoes .      thatcher nodded .     the martian headquarters of the astral projections are in olympus mons .  that means mount olympus  and that   s where the souls of the righteous gather .  that   s the big volcano  isn   t it .         the biggest in the solar system     said rubin .     at least  that we know of .  it   s been known since      .      thatcher said     the tri   luciferians say that g .  v .  schiaparelli   he   s the one who named the different places on mars   was astrally inspired to name that spot olympus to signify it was the home of the godly .  in ancient greece  you see  mount olympus was  .   .   .         yes     said avalon  nodding gravely     we know .         isn   t schiaparelli the fellow who first reported the canals .     asked gonzalo .      yes     said halsted     although actually when he said canal he meant natural waterways .         even so  why didn   t the same astral inspiration tell him the canals weren   t there .     asked gonzalo .   drake nodded and said     that   s something you can point out to your wife .         no     said thatcher     i guess they thought of that .  they say the canals were part of the inspiration because that increased interest in mars and that that was needed to make the astral   projection process more effective .      trumbull  who had maintained a sullen silence through the discussion  as though he were waiting his chance to shift the discussion to oboes  said suddenly     that makes a diseased kind of sense .      thatcher said     too much makes sense .  that   s the trouble .  there are times when i want to find a mistake not so much to save carol as to save myself .  i tell you that when i listen to carol talking there   s sometimes more danger she   ll argue me into being crazy than that i   ll persuade her to be rational .      trumbull waved a hand at him soothingly .     just take it easy and let   s think it out .  do they say anything about the satellites .         they talk about them  yes .  phobos and deimos .  sure .         do they say anything about how they cross the sky .     trumbull   s smile was nearly a smirk .      yes     said thatcher     and i looked it up because i didn   t believe them and i thought i had something .  in their description of the martian scene  they talk about phobos rising in the west and setting in the east .  and it turns out that   s true .  and they say that whenever either phobos or deimos cross the sky at night  they are eclipsed by mars   s shadow for part of the time .  and that   s true  too .      halsted shrugged .     the satellites were discovered a century ago  in       by asaph hall .  as soon as their distance from mars and their period of revolution were determined  which were almost at once  their behavior in mars   s sky was known .         i didn   t know it     said thatcher .      no     said halsted     but this fellow who started the religion apparently did his homework .  it wasn   t really hard .         hold on     said trumbull truculently     some things aren   t as obvious and don   t get put into the average elementary   astronomy textbook .  for instance  i read somewhere that phobos can   t be seen from the martian polar regions .  it   s so close to mars that the bulge of mars   s spherical surface hides the satellite  if you go far enough north or south .  do the tri   luciferians say anything about phobos being invisible from certain places on mars  thatcher .         not that i recall     said thatcher     but they don   t say it   s always visible .  if they just don   t mention the matter  what does that prove .         besides     said halsted     olympus mons is less than twenty degrees north of the martian equator  and phobos is certainly visible from there any time it is above the horizon and not in eclipse .  and if that   s the headquarters for the souls from earth  mars would certainly be described as viewed from that place .         whose side are you on .     grumbled trumbull .      the truth   s     said halsted .     still  it   s true that astronomy books rarely describe any sky but earth   s .  that   s why i had to figure out the brightness of objects in the martian sky instead of just looking it up .  the only trouble is that this cult leader seems to be just as good at figuring .         i   ve got an idea     said avalon .     i   m not much of an astronomer  but i   ve seen the photographs taken by the viking landers and i   ve read the newspaper reports about them .  for one thing  the martian sky in the daytime is pink  because of fine particles of the reddish dust in the air .  in that case  isn   t it possible that the dust obscures the night sky so that you don   t see anything .  good lord  it happens often enough in new york city .      halsted said     as a matter of fact  the problem in new york isn   t so much the dust as the scattered light from the buildings and highways  and even in new york you can see the bright stars  if the sky isn   t cloudy .      on mars  it would have to work both ways .  if there is enough dust to make the sky invisible from the ground  then the ground would be invisible from the sky .  for instance  when mariner   reached mars in       mars was having a globewide duststorm and none of its surface could be seen by mariner .  at that time  from the martian surface  the sky would have had to be blanked out .  most of the time  though  we see the surface clearly from our probes  so from the martian surface  the sky would be clearly visible .      in fact  considering that mars   s atmosphere is much thinner than earth   s  less than a hundredth as thick  it would scatter and absorb far less light than earth   s does  and the various stars and planets would all look a little brighter than they would with earth   s atmosphere in the way .  i didn   t allow for that in my table .      trumbull said     geoff mentioned the viking photographs .  they show rocks all over the place .  do the tri   luciferians mention rocks .         no     said thatcher     not that i ever noticed .  but again  they don   t say there aren   t any .  they talk about huge canyons and dry riverbeds and terraced icefields .      rubin snorted .     all that   s been known since      .  more homework .      avalon said     what about life .  we still don   t know if there   s any life on mars .  the viking results are ambiguous .  have the tri   luciferians committed themselves on that .      thatcher thought  then said     i wish i could say i had read all their literature thoroughly  but i haven   t .  still carol has forced me to read quite a bit since she said i ought not defame anything without learning about it first .         that   s true enough     said avalon     though life is short and there are some things that are so unlikely on the surface that one hesitates to devote much of one   s time to a study of it .  however  can you say anything as to their attitude toward martian life from what you   ve read of their literature .      thatcher said     they speak about mars   s barren surface  its desert aridity and emptiness .  they contrast that with the excitement and fullness of the astral sphere .         yes     said avalon     and of course  the surface is dry and empty and barren .  we know that much .  what about microscopic life .  that   s what we   re looking for .      thatcher shook his head .     no mention of it  as far as i know .      avalon said     well  then  i can   t think of anything else .  i   m quite certain this whole thing is nonsense .  everyone here is  and none of us need proof of it .  if your wife needs proof  we may not be able to supply it .         i understand     said thatcher .     i thank you all  of course  and i suppose she may come to her senses after a while  but i must admit i have never seen her quite like this .  i would join the cult with her just to keep her in sight but  frankly  i   m afraid i   ll end up believing it  too .      and in the silence that followed  henry said softly     perhaps  mr .  thatcher  you need not go to that extreme .      thatcher turned suddenly .     pardon me .  did you say something  waiter .      halsted said     henry is a member of the club  jonathan .  i don   t know that he   s an astronomer exactly  but he   s the brightest person here .  is there something we   ve missed  henry .      henry said     i think so  sir .  you said  mr .  halsted  that astronomy books don   t generally describe any sky but earth   s  and i guess that must be why the cult leader seems to have a missing item in his description of mars .  without it  the whole thing is no more true to life than mr .  rubin   s conspiracy of locksmiths   if i may be forgiven  mr .  rubin .         not if you don   t supply a missing object  henry .      henry said     on earth  mercury and venus are the morning and evening stars  and we always think of such objects as planets  therefore .  consequently  from mars  there must be three morning and evening stars  mercury  venus  plus earth in addition .  that is memorialized in the very name of the cult and from that alone i could see the whole thing fails .      halsted said     i   m not sure i see your point  henry .         but  mr .  halsted     said henry     where is the moon in all this .  it is a large object  our moon  almost the size of mercury and closer to mars than mercury is .  if mercury can be seen from mars  surely the moon can be  too .  yet i noticed it was not on your list of bright objects in the martian sky .      halsted turned red .     yes  of course .  the list of planets fooled me  too .  you just list them without mentioning the moon .     he reached for the paper .     the moon is smaller than earth and less reflective  so that it is only one seventieth as bright as the earth  at equal distance and phase  which means   a magnitude of   .   .  it would be just as bright as mercury and in fact it could be seen more easily than mercury could be because it would be higher in the sky .  at sunset .  mercury as evening star would never be higher than    degrees above the horizon  while earth could be as much as    degrees above   pretty high in the sky .      henry said     mars  therefore  would have four morning stars  and the very name tri   lucifer is nonsense .      avalon said     but the moon would always be close to earth  so wouldn   t earth   s light drown it out .         no     said halsted .     let   s see now   never get a pocket calculator that doesn   t have keys for the trigonometric functions   the moon would be  at times  as much as    minutes of arc away from earth  when viewed from mars .  that   s three quarters the width of the moon as seen from earth .      henry said     one more thing .  would you repeat that verse once again  mr .  thatcher  the one about the earth being high in the sky .      thatcher said     certainly .     when earth shines high in the sky  like a glorious jewel  and when the other lucifers have fled beyond the horizon  so that earth shines alone in splendor  single in beauty  unmatched in brightness  it is then that the souls of those ready to receive the call must prepare to rise from earth and cross the gulf .         henry said     earth may be quite high in the sky at times  and mercury and venus may be on the other side of the sun and therefore beyond the horizon   but earth cannot be    alone in splendor    .  the moon has to be with it of course  there would be times when the moon is very nearly in front of earth or behind it  as seen from mars  so that the two dots of light merge into one that seems to make earth brighter than ever  but the moon is not then beyond the horizon .  it seems to me  mr .  thatcher  that the cult leader was never on mars  because if he had been he would not have missed a pretty big item  a world       miles across .  surely you can explain this to your wife .         yes     said thatcher  his face brightening into a smile     she would have to see the whole thing as a fake .         if it is true  as you say     said henry quietly     that she is a rational person .         the missing item      afterword  a few of the stories in the first two volumes of black widowers stories did not appear in eqmm  but in the magazine of fantasy and science fiction  f   sf  instead .  this was a bit difficult  for i couldn   t make a black widowers tale an outright fantasy or science fiction .   once in a while  though  i  being what i am  constructed one of the stories in such a way that it dealt at least tangentially with science fiction or fantasy  and then f   sf would get it .   or did get it  anyway .  in       a new magazine reached the news   stands  a sister magazine of eqmm .  the new magazine was isaac asimov   s science fiction magazine  msfm   and  of course  it was thereafter no longer cricket for me to give a story to any science   fiction magazine unless it had first been offered to iasfm .   in fact  i deliberately tried to construct as distinct a science   fiction mystery as i could for my own magazine  and    the missing item    was the result .  it appeared in the winter      issue of iasfm .   the magazine was a quarterly in its first year .      .   the next day  emmanuel rubin   s glasses always gave the illusion of magnifying his eyes with particular intensity when he was aroused .  he said  in an intense whisper     you brought an editor as your guest .      james drake   s train from new jersey had arrived late and he had  in consequence  almost committed the solecism of being late to his own hostship over the monthly banquet of the black widowers .  he was in an uncharacteristically snappish mood therefore and said     why not .      he flicked the ash from his cigarette and added     if we can have writers for guests  and even as members  zeus help us  why not editors .      rubin  a writer  of course  said haughtily     i wouldn   t expect a chemist to understand .     he looked briefly in the direction of the guest  who was tall and spare  with longish red   blond hair and with the kind of abbreviated mustache and beard that gave him a robin hood air .   drake said     i may be a chemist to you  manny  and to all the world besides  but i   m a writer to him .     drake tried to look modest  and failed signally .     i   m doing a book .         you .     said rubin .      why not .  i can spell and  judging by your career  that   s the only requirement .         if your guest thinks it is  he has about the mental equipment needed for an editor .  what   s his name again .         stephen bentham .         and what firm is he with .      drake stubbed out his cigarette .     southby publications .         a shlock outfit     said rubin  with contempt .     they   re a sex   and   sensation house .  what do they want with you .      drake said     i   m doing a book on recombinant dna  which is a sensational subject these days   not that you know anything about it .      mario gonzalo had just entered  brushing at his brown velvet jacket to remove the city fly   ash .  he said     come on  jim  all the papers are full of it .  that   s the stuff they   re going to make new disease germs with and depopulate the world .      rubin said     if mario   s heard about it  jim  you   ll have to admit i have  too   and everyone else in the world has .         good .  then my book is what the world needs     said drake .   gonzalo said     the world needs it about as much as it needs air pollution .  i   ve seen two books on the subject advertised already .         ha     said drake     they   re talking about the controversy  the politics .  i   m going to talk about the chemistry .         then it will never sell     said rubin .   it was at this point that henry  that paragon of waiters  without whom no black widowers banquet could endure  announced softly to drake that the gentlemen might seat themselves .   geoffrey avalon drifted toward henry  having now had the pleasure of a sedate conversation with the guest   with whom he had talked eye to eye  something which  from his    inches of height  he could not often do .      i detect a fishy aroma  henry     he said .     what has been planned for this evening .         a bouillabaisse  sir     said henry .     an excellent one  i believe .      avalon nodded gravely  and roger halsted  smiling  said     even an average bouillabaisse is excellent  and with henry   s encomium  i stand ready to be delighted .      avalon said     i hope  mr .  bentham  that you have no objection .         i can   t say i   ve ever eaten it .     bentham spoke in a distinct  but not exaggerated  english accent     but i   m prepared to have a go at it .  a french dish  i believe .         marseillaise in origin     said halsted  looking as though he were coming very close to licking his chops     but universal in appeal .  where   s tom  by the way .         right here     came an exasperated voice from the steps .     damn taxi driver .  thanks  henry .     thomas trumbull  his tanned forehead creased and furrowed into fifty lines of anger  gratefully took the scotch and soda .     you haven   t started eating  have you .         just about     said gonzalo     and if you hadn   t arrived  roger would have had your share of the bouillabaisse  so it would have been a silver lining for someone .  what was with the taxicab .      trumbull seated himself  took another invigorating sip of his drink  buttered a roll  and said     i told the idiot to take me to the milano and the next thing i knew i was at some dive movie on west eighty   sixth street called the milano .  we had to make our way through four extra miles of manhattan streets to get here .  he claimed he had never heard of the milano restaurant  but he did know that flea dive .  it cost me three bucks extra in taxi fare .      rubin said     you   re pretty far gone  tom  if you couldn   t tell he was going northwest when you wanted to go southeast .         you don   t think i was watching the streets  do you .     growled trumbull .     i was lost in thought .      avalon said austerely     you can   t rely on the local wisdom of the new york taxi driver .  you ought to have said explicitly     fifth avenue and thirteenth street .            thanks a lot     said trumbull .     i shall instantly turn the clock back and say it .         i presume there   ll be a next time  tom  and that you   re capable of learning from experience     said avalon  and received a scowl for his pains .   after the bouillabaisse arrived  there was a lull in the conversation for a while as the banqueters concentrated on the evisceration of mussels and the cracking of lobster shells .   it was drake who broke it .  he said     if we consider recombinant dna           we aren   t     said rubin  spearing a scallop neatly .       .   .  then what it amounts to is that the whole argument is about benefits that no one can demonstrate and dangers that no one can really pinpoint .  there are only blue   sky probabilities on either side  and the debaters make up for their lack of hard knowledge by raising their voices .  what i propose to do is to go into the chemistry and genetics of the matter and try to work out the real chances and significance of specific genetic change .  without that  both sides are just searching in a dark room for a black cat that isn   t there .      avalon said     and all this for the general public .         certainly .         isn   t that rather heavy going for the general public .         it isn   t for the comic   book audience  but i think i can manage the scientific american to natural history range .  tell them  bentham     said drake  with perhaps a trace of smugness     you   ve seen the sample chapters .      bentham  who had tackled the bouillabaisse with a certain tentativeness but had grown steadily more enthusiastic  said     i can only judge by myself  to be sure  but i suspect that since i follow the line of argument  the average college man ought to .         that still limits your audience     said gonzalo .   bentham said     we can   t say that .  it   s a very hot subject and  properly promoted  .   .   .         a southby specialty     muttered rubin .      it could catch on     bentham said .     people who don   t really understand might nevertheless buy it to be in fashion  and who knows  they might read it and get something out of it .      drake tapped his water glass as henry doled out the brandy .  drake said     if everyone is sufficiently defishified and if henry will remove the towels and finger bowls  i think we may start to grill our guest  mr .  stephen bentham .  tom  will you do the honors .         glad to     said trumbull .     mr .  bentham  it is our custom  ordinarily  to inquire as to how a guest may justify his existence .  in this case  i suppose we can allow the fact that you are involved with the production of a book by our esteemed colleague  dr .  drake  to speak for you .  we will therefore pass on to more mundane questions .  you seem young .  how old are you .         twenty   eight .         i have the feeling you have not been long in the united states .  am i right .         i   ve been living and working here for about five months now  but i have been here on brief visits before .  three times .         i see .  and what are your qualifications for your post  as editor  that is .         not overwhelming .     bentham smiled suddenly  an oddly charming and rueful smile .     i have done some editing with fearn and russell in london .  rather happy with them   low   key concern  you know  but then  british publishing generally is low   key .         why throw that over to take a job with an american firm where the pressures are bound to be greater .  they are greater  i assume .         very much so     again the rueful smile     but there   s no mystery as to why i came .  the explanation is so simple that it embarrasses me to advance it .  in a word   money .  i was offered three times my british salary  and all moving expenses paid .      halsted intervened suddenly .     are you a married man  mr .  bentham .         no  mr .  halsted .  quite single  though not necessarily celibate .  however  single men can use money  too .      rubin said     if you don   t mind  tom  i would like to add the reverse of the question you asked .  i can see why you   ve joined southby publications .  money is a potent argument .  but why the hell did that shlock concern hire you .  you   re young  without much experience  and they   re not the kind of firm to hire promising young men out of benevolence .  yet they triple your salary and pay moving expenses .  what have you got on them .      bentham said     i met mr .  southby on one of my earlier trips and i think he was rather taken with me .     his fair skin turned a noticeable pink .     i suspect it was my accent and my appearance .  perhaps it seemed to him i would lend an air of scholarship to the firm .         a touch of class     murmured avalon  and bentham turned pinker still .   trumbull resumed the questioning     manny calls southby publications a shlock concern .  do you agree with that .      bentham hesitated .     i don   t know .  what docs the expression mean .      rubin said     cheap  worthless books  sold by high   pressure campaigns hinting at sex and sensationalism .      bentham remained silent .   drake said     go ahead  bentham .  anything you say here will never go beyond these walls .  the club observes complete confidentiality .         it isn   t that  jim     said bentham     but if i were to agree  it might wound your feelings .  you   re an author of ours .      drake lit another cigarette .     that wouldn   t bother me .  you   re hired to give the firm a touch of class and you   ll do my book as another touch of class .      bentham says     i grant you that i don   t think much of some of the books on the list  but dr .  drake is right .  mr .  southby doesn   t object to good books if he thinks they will sell .  he is personally pleased with what he has seen of dr .  drake   s book  even enthusiastic .  perhaps the firm   s character can be improved .      avalon said     i would like to put in my oar  tom  if you don   t mind .  mr .  bentham  i am not a psychologist  or a tracer of men   s thoughts through their expressions .  i am just a humble patent attorney .  however  it seems to me that you have looked distinctly uneasy each time you mentioned your employer .  are you sure that there is nothing you are keeping from dr .  drake that he ought to know .  i want an unequivocal answer .         no     said bentham quickly     there is nothing wrong with dr .  drake   s book .  provided he completes the book and that the whole is of the quality of the parts we have seen  we will publish and then promote it adequately .  there are no hidden reservations to that statement .      gonzalo said     then what are you uneasy about .  or is geoff all wrong about your feelings in the first place .     he was gazing complacently at the caricature of bentham he had produced for the guest gallery that lined the walls of the meeting room .  he had not missed the robin hood resemblance and had even lightly sketched in a feathered hat in green  of the type one associated with the merry men .   bentham said  in sudden anger     you could say i   m uneasy  considering that i   m about to be bloody well slung out on my can .         fired .     said gonzalo  on a rising note .      that   s the rough one   syllable version of what i have just said .         why .     said drake  in sudden concern .      i   ve lost a manuscript     said bentham .     not yours  dr .  drake .      gonzalo said     in the mails .         no .  through malice  according to southby .  actually  i did every j ruddy thing i could do to get it back .  i don   t know what was in that man   s mind .         southby   s .         no  the author   s .  joshua fairheld   s his name .         never heard of him     said rubin .   trumbull said     suppose you tell us what happened  mr .  bentham .      bentham said     it   s a grim  stupid thing .  i don   t want to cast a pall over a very pleasant evening .      trumbull said     sorry  mr .  bentham  but i think jim warned you that answering our questions was the price of the meal .  please tell us exactly what happened .      benthan said     i suppose the most exciting thing that can happen in a publishing house is to have something good come in over the transom  something good that has not passed through the hands of a reputable agent and is not by a recognized author  something that has reached you by mail  written by someone whom no one has ever heard of .      aside from the sheer pleasure of the unexpected windfall  there is the possibility that you have a new author who can be milked for years to come  provided the product is not that of a one   book author   which is not an unheard   of phenomenon .      rubin began     margaret mitchell  .   .   .     and stopped when trumbull  who sat next to him  elbowed him ungently .      anyway     said bentham  jarred only momentarily by the interruption     southby thought he had one .  one of the readers brought it to him in excitement  as well he might  for readers don   t often get anything that   s above the written   in   crayon   on   lined   paper level .      he should have gone to an editor   not necessarily me   with the manuscript  but he chose to go directly to southby .  i presume he felt there might be a deal of credit for the discovery and he didn   t want southby to be unaware of the discoverer .  i can   t say i blame him .      in any case  southby was infatuated with the manuscript  called an editorial conference  said he was accepting the book and had notified the author .  he explained  quite enthusiastically  that it was to get the full southby treatment .   .   .   .      rubin said indignantly     up to and including cooking the best   seller lists .  tom  if you give me the elbow again  i   ll break it off .      bentham said     i dare say you   re right  mr .  rubin  but this book deserved all it could get   potentially .  southby said he thought it needed work and he gave it to me to edit .  that struck me as a remarkable sign of confidence and i was rather gung   ho on the matter .  i saw quick promotions on the horizon if i could manage to carry it off .  the other editors didn   t seem to mind  though .  one of them said to me     it   s your butt that   s in the sling if this doesn   t work  because southby   s never wrong .         avalon said gravely     it sometimes happens that when the boss makes a mistake  the underling tabbed to reverse the mistake is fired if he fails .      bentham nodded .     the thought occurred to me  eventually  but it excited me further .  the scent of dangers sharpens the desire to be in at the kill  you know .      you can see  then  i went over the manuscript in a painstaking manner .  i went through it once at moderate speed to get a sense of the whole and was not displeased .  southby   s description of it was not  on the whole  wrong .  it had a good pace and was rich in detail .  a long family saga   a rough and domineering father  a smooth and insinuating mother in a rather subtle battle over the sons  their wives  and their children .  the plot was interlocking  never halting  and there was enough sex to be suitable for southby  but the sex worked .  it fit the story .      i turned in a favorable report of my own on the book  indicating its chief flaws  and how i proposed to handle them .  it came back with a large    very good    on it  so i got to work .  it had to be tightened up .  the last thing any beginner  however talented  learns is to tighten .  some scenes were misplaced or misemphasized  and that had to be corrected .      i am not myself a great writer and could never be  but i   ve studied writing that is great sufficiently closely to be able to amend and improve what is already written well  even if  from a cold start  i could not produce anything nearly as good .  it took me some six weeks of intense work to complete the job .  i knew that my head was on the line and i was not about to lose the war for lack of a horseshoe nail .      it wasn   t till after i had done a thorough piece of work that i called in the author  joshua fairfield .  i thought it better that way .  had i called him in en route  so to speak  there would have been bound to be acrimonious arguments over the changes  and much time would be wasted on trivial points .  if he could see the revisions as a whole  i felt he would be satisfied .  any minor disagreements could be easily settled .      or so i reasoned  and perhaps i had need of a little experience myself .  the author arrived and we met  actually  for the first time .  i can   t say i particularly liked his looks .  he was about my age but he had a rather somber cast of countenance  small  dark eyes   almost beady   and poor teeth .      i went through the amenities .  we shook hands .  i told him how pleased we all were with the book  how well it was going to do  the promotion we would give it  and so on .      i then said  rather casually  in order to emphasize the minor nature of the changes   compared to what was not changed  you know   that i had taken the liberty of introducing some small emendations here and there .  at that  he sat upright and his small eyes bulged .  he seized the manuscript  which was on the table before us  shook some of it out of one of the boxes  riffled through the pages where i had made the necessary changes in a fine   point pencil  done quite lightly to allow of further changes  and shrieked .      he really did .  he screamed that i had written something on every page and that he would have to get the whole thing retyped and that the bill would go straight to me .  then he seized the boxes and was gone .  i couldn   t stop him .  i swear to you  i couldn   t move  i was that thunder   struck .      but not panicky  either .  the manuscript was photocopied and i had made copious notes of the changes i had made .  since he was under contract   or so i assumed   we could publish over his objections .  he might proceed to sue us  but i don   t think he could have won  and the publicity  i couldn   t help but think  would simply sell more books .      the trouble is that when i went to see southby to tell him what had happened  it turned out there was no contract and everything came apart .  it seemed that southby and fairfield were haggling over the advance .  i suppose i might have been more diplomatic when i heard this .  it was not a good idea to ask southby if  in view of the advertising budget being planned  it made much sense to haggle over a matter of two thousand dollars in the advance .      rubin grunted .     well  now you know something about southby .         i know he didn   t like to have it made to look as though it were his fault .  he ordered me to get that manuscript back and he made it pretty clear that i was in for it if i did not .      it proved difficult from the start .  i tried fairfield at his apartment  i tried him on the phone .  it took me three days and then he finally answered the phone .  i managed to keep him on the phone .  i told him he could have the advance he wanted .  i told him that every change was negotiable and that we could go over the book line by line   which was exactly what i had tried desperately to avoid in the first place   and i warned him that no publisher would take it precisely as it was .      he said  with a rather snide and unpleasant snicker  that that was not so  that another publisher would take it exactly as was .  he had still not turned it over to that other publisher  but he hinted that he might .      i took that as a bluff and didn   t let it rattle me .  i just told him quietly that no firm could guarantee a best seller as southby could  reminded him of some of our other books .   .   .   .      rubin said     sure .  trash like dish for the gods .      avalon said     let him speak  manny .         well     said bentham     we were on the phone for over an hour and he finally put it to me straight .  would i publish it as written .  i said  just as straight  that we could negotiate every change  but that there would have to be some   for his own good .      he remained truculent and nasty  but he gave in  just like that .  he said he would deliver it the next day and i said enthusiastically   and trying to hide my relief   that that was top hole  and that he was to go to it  the sooner   the better  and i would send a messenger if he   d like .  he said  no  he didn   t want any stinking messenger  and hung up .      halsted said     happy ending .         no  because he never delivered the manuscript .  we waited a week and then southby finally got him on the phone and all he got out of fairfield were snarls to the effect that his paid monkey  bentham  could keep his stinking sarcasm and shove it and we would get no manuscript from him on any terms  or words to that effect .      that   s where it stands .  needless to say  i was not sarcastic .  i was perfectly reasonable and diplomatic at all times .  i was firm on the key point of revision  but not offensively so .  in fact  he had agreed to deliver it the next day .  as far as southby was concerned  however  i had lost the manuscript through my malicious treatment of the man  and he   s out of his mind with rage .      drake said     but he hasn   t fired you yet  bentham .  and if he hasn   t  maybe he won   t .         no  because he still has hopes .  i told him that fairfield was probably bluffing and was probably psychotic  but he   s not listening to me these last few days .      in fact  i may soon be sliding along the street with southby   s boot   marks clearly imprinted on my rear end .  this is all the more certain since he must realize that none of this would have happened if he had not played silly haggling games over pin money .  he would certainly have had the man under contract otherwise .  firing me will be the evidence he needs for all the world  and most of all for himself  to see that i was to blame and not he .      halsted said     but it would be difficult for you to work for southby after this anyway  wouldn   t it .  you   d be better off somewhere else .      bentham said     unquestionably   but in my own time and at my own resignation .  after all  the editorial field is not exactly wide open now  and i might have difficulty finding a new position  and with an as   yet thin reserve of savings  that prospect does not fill me with delight .  southby might well try to see to it that my chances were even less than normal .      rubin said     you mean  he would try to blacklist you .  i wouldn   t put it past him .      bentham   s gloom showed him to be in full agreement .  he said     still  what   s worst is that with my editing we would have had a good book there .  it would be something we could be proud of .  southby and fairfield could make a fortune and i could make a reputation that would move me on to a much better position elsewhere .  and the world would have a whacking good first novel with the promise of better things to come .         fairfield has the makings of a great novelist  blast his soul  and i have my editorial pride and wanted to be part of that greatness .  and i was not sarcastic and he did give in .  he did say he   d deliver it the next day .  why in the devil   s name didn   t he .  that   s what bothers me .  why didn   t he .      there was a rather dank pause .  avalon finally said     there may be an explanation for this .  there have been first   class men of genius who have been monsters of villainy in their private lives .  richard wagner was one  jean jacques rousseau was another .  if this man  fairfield  is bluffing  and i rather guess he is  too  then he may simply have judged southby to be a kindred soul and he feels that you will be fired .  it   s what he would do in southby   s place .  then  when you are gone  he will show up with the manuscript .         but why .     said bentham .      no puzzle there  i think     said avalon .     in the first place  you dared tamper with his manuscript and he feels you must be punished .  in the second  once you are gone he can be reasonably certain that southby  after all this  will publish his manuscript as written .         then why did he say he would deliver it the next day .      avalon bent his formidable eyebrows together for a moment and said     i suppose he felt you would tell southby  ebulliently  that the thing was in the bag   as you did   and that southby   s anger  sharply intensified by falsely raised hopes  would explode and make certain your rapid firing .         and all that stuff about my sarcasm would then just be designed to further infuriate southby .         i should think so .  yes .      bentham thought about it .     that   s a pretty dismal picture you   ve painted .  between fairfield and southby there   s no escape .      avalon looked uneasy .     i   m sorry  mr .  bentham  but that   s the way it looks to me .      bentham said     i can   t believe it  though .  i spoke to the man for an hour or more on the phone .  he did not sound vindictive .  stubborn and nasty  yes  but not personally vindictive .      avalon said     i hate to be the insistent advocate of a solution personally abhorrent to me  but surely you were not looking for vindictiveness and would not be expected to see it if it were not absolutely in plain view .      bentham said desperately     but there   s more .  i have read his book and you have not .  i believe no one  however skillful  can write a book alien to his own philosophy and  .   .   .         that   s nonsense     said rubin .     i can write a piece of fiction hewing to any philosophy you please .  i could write one from the nazi point of view if i were of a mind to  which i   m not .         you couldn   t     said bentham .     please don   t interpret that as a challenge  but you couldn   t .  in fairfield   s book there were a variety of motivations  but none was out of the kind of motiveless malignity some people attribute to iago .  there was no unreasoning anger arising over trivial           but that   s the very point     said avalon .     it seems a trivial cause to you but you don   t see through this man   s eyes .  changing his novel in even a minor way is to him unforgivable and he   ll hound you down over it .      trumbull said in a troubled voice     i hate to join in this gallows fiesta  mr .  bentham  but geoff sounds as though he might be right .         ah     said rubin suddenly     but i don   t think he is .      bentham turned in his direction eagerly .     you mean you don   t think fairfield is out to get me .      rubin said     no .  he   s mad at you  surely  but not to the point of wanting to cut his own throat .  what we   ve got to do is look at this thing carefully with writer psychology in mind .  no  mr .  bentham  i don   t mean trying to see a writer   s personality in his writing  which i still say can   t be done for any really good writer .  i mean something that holds for any beginning writer .      i grant that a beginner might feel psychotic enough to fly into a fury at any changes imposed on his golden prose  but even that pales into nothing compared to another need   that of getting into print .      remember  this guy was haggling with southby over a few thousand dollars in advance money  and what was that to him .  we sneer at southby for sticking at a small sum when millions might be in view .  isn   t it queerer that the author should do so and risk not only millions  but publication altogether .  is it conceivable that a beginner who must have worked on his book for years would even dream of chancing failure to publish by haggling over the advance .      avalon said     if he were the semipsychotic individual whom mr .  bentham has described  why not .      rubin said     isn   t it much more likely that he already had another publisher on the string  and that he tried southby only because of the firm   s reputation for turning out best sellers .  his quarrel over the advance was his effort to make the two firms bid against each other in an auction they didn   t know was taking place .  then  when bentham tried to make changes  he turned back to the other publisher  who perhaps was willing to make fewer changes  or even none .      bentham said     do you mean  mr .  rubin  that fairfield originally went to some publisher   call him x .  x read the manuscript  suggested a revision  and fairfield took it back  presumably to revise  but brought it to us instead .  when we offered a lower advance and suggested greater revision  he took it back to x .         yes  and you marked up his copy     said rubin .     i think that annoyed him more than the revision itself had .  it meant he had to have the copy retyped in toto before submitting it .  even erasing the pencil marks would leave some marks  and he might be a little shy of letting x know he was playing tricks with the manuscript .  after all  you got him on the phone three days after he had stormed out and he already had another publisher on the hook .  after three days .      bentham said     that   s why i assumed he was bluffing .         and risk publication .  no  publisher x exists  all right .      trumbull said     i must be going crazy  but i   ve switched sides .  you   ve convinced me  manny .      bentham said     even if you   re right  mr .  rubin  i   m still in a hopeless position .         not if you can prove this fairfield was playing games .  once southby sees that  he   ll be furious with the author  not with you .  then you can bide your time and resign at such time as suits yourself .      bentham said     but for that i would have to know who publisher x is  and i don   t .  and without that  he simply won   t believe the story .  why should he .      rubin said     are you sure fairfield didn   t mention the publisher .         i   m sure .      halsted said  with a mild stutter     how would you know .  you   ve only been in the country a few months and may not know all the publishers .         there are hundreds in new york and surrounding areas and i certainly don   t know them all     said bentham .     i know the larger ones though .  surely x would be among the larger ones .      rubin said     i should think so .  no hint at all .         if there was  it whizzed by me .      rubin said     think .  go over the conversation in your mind .      bentham closed his eyes and sat quietly .  no one else made a noise except drake  whose bolo   tie tip clinked against his water glass when he reached forward to stub out a cigarette .   bentham opened his eyes and said     it   s no use .  there   s nothing there .      drake looked leftward toward the sideboard where henry was standing .     this is a serious situation  henry .  do you have any suggestions .         only the publisher   s name  sir .      bentham looked around in astonishment     what .      trumbull said hastily     henry is one of us  mr .  bentham .  what are you talking about  henry .  how can you know .         i believe the author  mr .  fairfield  mentioned it in his phone conversation with mr .  bentham .      bentham said  on the edge of anger     he did not .      henry   s unlined face showed no emotion .     i beg your pardon  sir  i do not mean to offend you  but you inadvertently omitted an important part of the story .  it was rather like mr .  trumbull   s misadventure in the cab when he left out an important part of the direction .  or like dr .  drake   s point that those who argue about recombinant dna do so without adequate knowledge of the fundamentals .      gonzalo said     you mean we   re looking in a dark room for a black cat that is there .         yes  sir .  if mr .  bentham had told his story otherwise  the whereabouts of the black cat would be obvious .         in what way could i have told the story otherwise .     demanded bentham .          you told the story with indirect quotations throughout  sir  and thus we never got the exact words anyone used .         for a very good reason     said bentham .     i don   t remember the exact words .  i   m not a recording device .         yet sometimes in indirect quotation  a person is reported as saying something he could not possibly have said in direct quotation .         i assure you     said bentham coldly     my account was accurate .         i   m sure it is  within its limitations  sir .  but if there is a publisher x  why did mr .  fairfield promise to deliver the manuscript the next day .      bentham said     oh god  i forgot about that .  are we back to motiveless malignity .         no  sir .  i would suggest he didn   t say that .         yes  he did  henry     said bentham .     i   m unshakable in that .         do you wish to put his remark into direct quotations and maintain that he said     i will deliver the manuscript the next day .     .      bentham said     oh i take your meaning .     the next day    is a paraphrase  of course .  he said     i will deliver the manuscript tomorrow .     what   s the difference .      henry said     and then you agreed enthusiastically  urged him to do so at once  and offered to place a messenger at his service .  you don   t think that sounded like sarcasm  sir .         no .  he said     i will deliver the manuscript tomorrow    and i was enthusiastic .  where   s the sarcasm .         to morrow     said henry carefully  pronouncing it as two words .      good god     said bentham blankly .   rubin brought his fist down on the table     damn .  william morrow   company     he said     one of new york   s larger publishing houses .         yes  sir     said henry .     i looked it up in the telephone book  to make certain  immediately after mr .  bentham   s account of the phone conversation .  it is at     madison avenue  about a mile from here .      gonzalo said     there you are  mr .  bentham .  just tell your boss that it   s with william morrow   company and that the author had it in to them first .         and he can then fire me for stupidity .  which i deserve .         not a chance     said gonzalo .     don   t tell him the literal truth .  tell him that as a result of your own clever detective work you uncovered the facts of the case through a confidential source you cannot reveal .      henry said     after all  sir  confidentiality is the policy of the black widowers .         the next day      afterword  i had a mild coronary on may           and you   d think the world was coming to an end the way janet carried on .  in july of that year  for instance  i wrote    the next day     and just because we were having a heat wave with temperatures in excess of a hundred degrees  janet wouldn   t let me leave our air   conditioned apartment to take it down to the eqmm offices .  i had to mail it in .   this was a horrible blow because whenever i submit a story to eqmm  i always spend some time chaffing with the beautiful eleanor sullivan  managing editor of the magazine .   by chaffing  of course  i mean chasing her around and around the desk   and janet thought that wouldn   t be good for my heart  either .    fortunately  eleanor bore up under the horror of being deprived of my company and sent on the story to fred anyway .  he took it and it appeared in the may      eqmm .   i sometimes wonder on how small an ambiguity it is possible to hang a black widower plot .  this story may represent the record .     .  irrelevance .      i think     said mario gonzalo     that i know henry   s secret  how he gets the answer when we don   t .     gonzalo nodded in the direction of the waiter  who was quietly serving the drinks that were prelude to the monthly banquet of the black widowers .   james drake stubbed out his cigarette and said     i   ve known it all along   he   s smarter than we are .         sure     said gonzalo  flicking tobacco ash from the sleeve of his velvet jacket and helping himself to some brie on a cracker     but being smarter isn   t enough .         being dumber isn   t enough  either     broke in emmanuel rubin  glowering through his thick   lensed glasses     so what good will the secret do you  mario .         being really dumb     said gonzalo coolly     is to be afraid to listen for fear of learning something .  so i suppose you   re not interested  manny .         what  and miss a good laugh .     said rubin .     go ahead  mario .      geoffrey avalon  having accepted his drink from henry  approached and said     a good laugh about what .         about mario   s idea as to how henry manages to come up with solutions     said rubin .     henry  you can listen  too .  mario has your secret .      henry smiled discreetly .     i have made no secret of what i do .  the gentlemen of the black widowers analyze the problems carefully  remove all the useless adornments  and leave a plain picture for me to describe .         not at all     said gonzalo     not at all .  you just say that to throw us off .  the secret is   irrelevance .      there was a short pause .  then rubin   s scanty beard bristled and he said in high   pitched disbelief     is that what i   m supposed to listen to so that i can learn something .         sure     said gonzalo .     we   re all of us reasoning men   even you  sometimes  manny   and we try to solve any little puzzle presented to us by catching at all the relevant angles .  but if it were the relevant matters that mattered  so to speak  there   d be no puzzle .  anyone would then see the answer .  it   s henry   s trick of seeing the irrelevant that gives him the answer .      drake said     this is a contradiction in terms  mario .  something that is irrelevant has nothing to do  .   .   .      gonzalo interposed patiently     something that seems irrelevant but isn   t .  we see that it seems irrelevant  henry sees that it really isn   t irrelevant .  right  henry .      henry   s face showed no expression beyond a general benevolence .     it is certainly an interesting suggestion     he said .   avalon drew his formidable eyebrows together .     it is surely more than that  mario .  henry sees what we do not  because he looks clearly at life while the rest of us do not have his direct and simple honesty and are not capable of doing so .  even if you were to see what henry does  you would not get the answer .      gonzalo said     i bet i can .  five dollars says that if there   s a puzzle today  i   ll use henry   s technique and get the answer before he does .         you   re on     said rubin at once .      good     said mario .     geoff  you hold the stakes .  but remember  no bet if there   s no problem .      drake said     oh there   ll be a problem .  personally  i think we   re each of us deliberately choosing our guests for their problematical content .         and yet perhaps not this time     said avalon     since the guest has not arrived   nor tonight   s host  either  unless the steps on the stairs  .   .   .  no  it   s tom .      thomas trumbull   s white and crisply waved hair made its appearance  followed by the rest of his body as he mounted the stairs .   he said     if you   re worried about the host   s whereabouts  geoff  roger halsted   s just arrived downstairs with a stranger who  i presume  is our guest for tonight .  i raced ahead since i am a dying man who needs a dr   ah thank you  henry .      gonzalo had taken his seat next to halsted and  spreading out his napkin with a practiced flick  said     we almost thought we would have to  start without a host or a guest  roger .  what happened .  decided you couldn   t stand the expense .      halsted reddened and his mild stutter seemed a shade more pronounced .     not my fault  really .  burry was delayed  dan burry  my guest .  his phone rang just as i was picking him up and he grew very upset .  i couldn   t very well press him too hard and urge him to hang up .  for a while  in fact  i thought i   d have to leave without him .         what was it about  do you know .  the phone call  i mean .      halsted looked in the direction of his guest .     i don   t know .  something involving one of his students .  he   s a school principal  you know .         your school .         no  but why don   t you save your questions for the grilling .         do you mind letting me start it .         not at all .     and halsted turned his attention to the crabmeat soup .   dan burry was a rather large man with dark hair as crisply waved as trumbull   s and with a brief mustache of the kind adolf hitler had put out of fashion for at least a generation .  his jowled face bore a worried look and he tackled his roast duck with an enthusiasm dulled by absence of mind .   he did not participate in the general conversation and seemed to listen only distantly as rubin and drake debated the respective values of nuclear fusion and solar power as the ultimate energy source .   burry seemed unprepared  therefore  for the suddenness with which the focus of attention suddenly shifted .  while henry freshened the coffee and produced brandy  gonzalo said     mr .  burry  how do you justify your existence .      burry looked at gonzalo with what seemed a momentary flash of indignation but then muttered in a depressed sort of way     ah yes  roger warned me that there would be a question   and   answer period .         yes     said gonzalo     and in return for the dinner  you are expected to answer frankly and fully  under terms of strict confidentiality  of course .  so how do you justify your existence .      burry said     i try to maintain an atmosphere and organization at a city high school such that at least some of the student body can gain an education and a respect for learning .  that is justification enough  i think  whenever i succeed .         do you succeed often .         not often .      avalon cleared his throat .     the education of the young of any species begins with discipline .            those who believe so     said burry     all too frequently believe it ends with discipline  too  and confuse the purpose of a school with the purpose of a prison .      gonzalo said     i understand that just as you were leaving for dinner tonight  you received an unsettling phone call .  did that involve school business .      burry cast a hard glance in halsted   s direction .  halsted reddened and slid     i was explaining why we were late  dan .      gonzalo said     what was the phone call about .      burry shook his head .     it is not something i should discuss .  it is an unfortunate matter that involves a minor .         a minor what .         i   m using the word as a noun  mr .  gonzalo  not as an adjective .  it involves a human being who is only seventeen .      gonzalo said     we understand your reluctance to discuss the matter  but i assure you  the fact that a minor is involved is irrelevant .     he paused and seemed to savor the word for a moment .     the terms of the dinner are that you answer our questions .  roger should have explained that to you .         may i stress again     interrupted avalon     the confidentiality of our proceedings .         including the waiter     said trumbull  scowling     who is a valued member of this organization .      burry glanced briefly at henry  who had now taken up his post at the sideboard with his usual look of quiet attention  and said     i won   t deny  gentlemen  that i   d welcome a discussion of the matter  for i have been very frustrated over it .  still  i cannot use the name of the young man .  will it suit the rules of your organization if i refer to him only as john .      rubin said     it   s our experience  mr .  burry  that that kind of subterfuge always fails .  you   ll slip and use his real name .         john is his real name  mr .  rubin  and is as nearly anonymous as a given name can be .  i will merely refrain from using his full name .      halsted said     i think we can allow that .      burry said     let me tell you about john first .  he   s a good   looking young man  a bit undersized but keen  quick  and intelligent .  his intelligence attracted the attention of his teachers at once and i  of course  am always on the lookout for such things .  all students are  in theory  of equal importance and all deserve the best education we can give them  but the unusually bright ones are  of course  our special delight and  too often  our special heartbreak .         why heartbreak .     asked gonzalo quickly .      because very often a bright child is as much the victim of his social handcuffs as he would be if he had not a brain in his head .  it   s a mistake to think that intelligence alone can lift you out of the mud  and there is no use in citing examples to the contrary .  it may happen  given special circumstances  in most cases  it does not happen .         i presume     said rubin sardonically     john is a child of the ghetto     as was my father in his time .      burry said in a deliberate and even tone     john is a child of the ghetto  but not as your father was  mr .  rubin .  your father and you can  if you are circumspect  hide your origin .  you may change your name  be careful with your speech  abandon your idiosyncrasies  and you might pass .  it would take a special law to pin an identifying badge on you .  john and others like him  however  are born with the identifying badge  and long before you can know them as individuals you recognize them as blacks .      rubin looked uncomfortable .     i meant no offense .         none taken .  some blacks do need identification  i might say .  by the convention of our society a single black ancestor makes one black .  a man might therefore be apparently white but socially black .  as myself .  i am black .         that makes no difference to us  sir     said avalon austerely .      why should it .     said burry .     nor does it seem to make a difference to some of the students .  one prominent nonobscene graffito in the fourth   floor toilet reads     burry is five fourths white .     just the same  my one ancestor does make a difference in my attitude toward john .      i   m desperate to give a youngster like that the kind of chance he might have if he looked like me .  in the gathering crisis of our times  the human species cannot afford to waste brains  and this one may be wasted .         drugs .     asked trumbull .   burry shrugged .     pot  of course .  that   s a rite of passage with kids these days   like smoking a pipe was to tom sawyer  or to mark twain  for that matter .  and then for all the talk about the damage done by marijuana  the evidence is not as strong as for the damage done by tobacco  yet not only is tobacco smoking legal and socially acceptable  but also the government subsidizes the tobacco growers .         you start with pot and you go on to heroin     said avalon dryly .     another rite of passage .         sometimes   especially if you make both equally illegal  so that the pot smoker fails to see much difference   but only sometimes .  one can go from social drinking to alcoholism  a condition as dangerous as heroin and far more common  yet society does not for that reason condemn or outlaw social drinking .      in any case     burry went on     john is not deeply involved in pot and does not have the makings of a heroin addict .  no  i   m afraid john   s temptations lie in another direction   crime .      avalon said     what kind of crime  mr .  burry .         nothing exceedingly dramatic .  i suspected him of being a purse snatcher  a shoplifter  a petty thief .  it was only a suspicion  until tonight .  now  i   m afraid  it   s a certainty .         is that what the phone call was about .     asked gonzalo .      it was about john     said burry despondently .     it was  indeed  from him .  he was in trouble and he turned to me .  there is some small satisfaction in that .  i managed to obtain a lawyer for him and i promised to supply reasonable bail  it necessary .  it was that which delayed our arrival .  and yet i can take only minimal satisfaction from being of help now .  i suspect i failed him to begin with .         in what way .     asked gonzalo .      if i had been more ingenious  i might have persuaded him to cooperate with the police .         not much chance of that  dan     said halsted .     anyone who   s a schoolteacher knows that in the bright lexicon of youth  there is no such word as    squeal .     the guys who keep their mouths shut go to jail  but they are heroes and are taken care of .  the squealers may stay out of jail but they   re ostracized and very likely beaten up .         i know that  roger     said burry     i need no education in the mores of the street  but i might have done it if i were smart enough .  i   ll see him tonight after this meal   if you won   t mind my leaving by ten   thirty at the latest   and if he   ll co   operate  i   ll get him out of the city .  there are agencies who will help in this respect and i   ve used them before .  these people we   re after won   t mount an intercity hunt for him .  it isn   t the syndicate we   re talking about .      avalon twiddled his empty brandy glass and said     what are we talking about  mr .  burry .         a burglary ring organized by medium   sized racketeers who employ high   school students as their field operatives .  the kids bring in their takings and receive a percentage .  it saves them the trouble of trying to peddle the goods themselves   but if they hold out for their own profit  and are caught at it  they are beaten up .      trumbull said     it sounds very much like a fagin operation .         it   s exactly a fagin operation     said burry .     you don   t suppose the practice died out with oliver twist  do you .         and you   re after fagin himself  i take it     said trumbull .   burry said     it certainly does no good to pick up the kids .  they   re eventually let go and the game goes on .  even if they were not let go  replacements are easily obtained  and the game still goes on .  you   ve got to get the corrupters themselves .  and beyond that     he added sadly     the quirks in our society that make such things possible .         if you can cure those quirks     said avalon     you will have achieved a first for our ten thousand years of so   called civilization .         then at least the corrupters     said burry .     if i were smart enough to see my way into persuading john to go in with me  .  .  .      gonzalo interrupted .     that   s twice now you   ve said you needed to be smart enough .  why smart enough .  persuasive enough  i can see  eloquent enough  unscrupulous enough  threatening enough .  why smart enough .      burry hesitated and rubbed his chin  as though wondering what to say .   he decided  apparently  and said     the police have been after the burglary ring and  among others  they have consulted me .  they had reason to think that some of the students at my school were involved and they wanted me to co   operate with them in finding the students .  to be truthful  i wasn   t anxious to do this .         to squeal .     asked drake  stony   faced .   for a moment  burry stiffened with quite apparent indignation .  then he relaxed .     you   re right .  i don   t want to squeal  but that   s just a gut reaction .  there   s more to it than that .  as i told you  picking up the youngsters does not solve the problem  but it may manufacture hardened criminals .  were i to find some youngster i suspected of being involved  what i would hope to do would be to obtain the necessary information from him and turn over the information  not the youngster  to the police .      avalon said     i don   t think you would get the necessary information by kindly persuasion  mr .  burry .  the police might have better arguments than you have .      trumbull slapped the table with the palm of his hand .     geoff  that   s stupid .  those kids are heroes to their peers if they resist the police  and if any police officer tried to beat anything out of them  not only is any information he gets inadmissible as evidence  but also the policeman involved will be up on charges .         i call that hobbling the police to the cost of the honest citizen     said avalon .      i call it forcing the police to a single standard of conduct and having them treat the poor  the ill   educated  the unpopular as circumspectly as they would treat those with money and lawyers     said trumbull .      why not enforce the single standard by treating the well   to   do criminal as roughly as the poor ones  then .     demanded avalon .   trumbull said     because they   re only suspected criminals .  the state of actual criminality comes only after trial and judgment  and until then the person in custody has all the rights and privileges of a free american  including decent treatment at the hands of the guardians of the very law that says so .  mr .  burry  i think your attitude is a good one .      burry said     thank you  but good or not  it didn   t work .  what the police need is evidence .  they have suspicions as to the identity of the ringleaders  the fagins  but until they can find them in action  surrounded by their stolen goods  they aren   t likely to be able to prove it .  one of the difficulties appears to be that the criminals change their base of operation frequently  and are never in one place long enough to leave a clear trail .  of course  if we knew in advance where they would be  we would have a chance .  and that is the kind of information the youngsters would have  for they have to know where to bring the loot .      without that   well  the poorer sections of new york are an incredible rabbit   warren that could swallow up an army of police searchers who would encounter frozen   faced inhabitants denying all knowledge of anything .  from the pattern of the robberies  the police suspect the scene of operations must be on manhattan   s west side somewhere between eightieth street and    th street  but that   s not much of a hint .  but i had my eye on john .         why him .     asked drake .      money     snapped burry .     it comes to that .  we live in a society that measures all values by money  and that delivers unending pressures by advertising in every medium urging the possession of material things that can be had only for money .  sex standards are set by the beautiful people  and those can be met only with money .  well  then  if you don   t have money  what do you do .  devote your life to gaining those skills that will make money in the end .  what if you firmly believe that the disadvantages you were born with will make it impossible for you to make money even if you gain those skills .  you give up  perhaps  and get the money by the shortest route   and another youngster is lost both to himself and to society .      drake said     yes  but this is true for many of the students at the school  i   m sure .  why john .         of course  it   s true of many .  that   s why the youngsters are so easily recruited .  but i have been interested in john  so my eye has been on him  and in recent months he has shown money .         in what way .     asked rubin  who had been absently doodling dollar signs on his napkin .      better clothes  for one thing  an air of self   confidence  for another .  something amounting almost to arrogance in his attitude toward girls .  there   s no point in having money if you don   t show it  and i know the signs .  i had no proof  of course  no real evidence  and i didn   t want to confront john with my suspicions if  by any chance  i happened to be wrong .      then last monday  i passed him in the hall  quite by accident  and he had a piece of paper in his hand .  it seemed to me it had been passed to him .  i had not been looking in his direction  it had been an impression out of the corner of my eye .  i certainly didn   t see who had done the passing  for it was between periods and the halls were quite crowded .  it   s good to be in the halls at unpredictable intervals at such times  by the way .  the possible presence of authority does impose some sense of discipline at such times  however minimal .     burry sighed  and smiled rather weakly .   gonzalo said     but what about the paper .         i had no reason to think the paper had anything to do with the robberies  but it seemed unusual  and i have learned to respond at once to anything unusual .     what   s that paper you   re holding  john .     i asked in what i hoped was a friendly tone .      the paper  mr .  burry .     he asked  and my suspicions were aroused at once .  to repeat a question is almost invariably a play for time .  so i asked to see it  i held out my hand for it .  by now  the main flood of students had passed  though some turned for a quick look backward .      trumbull said     could you force him to hand over the paper .  he has a right to his personal property  hasn   t he .      burry said     i would not have used force  naturally  but within the school my powers to enforce discipline are  in theory  considerable .  i might have suspended him from his classes for failure to comply  and that would have been an unhappy position for john .  he enjoyed his classes .  in any case  he complied .      he hesitated  said     it   s just a piece of paper i picked up  mr .  burry     glanced at it carelessly  and handed it over  saying with an air of mocking virtue     i was going to put it in a wastebasket  mr .  burry .  you wouldn   t want the halls all littered .         i resisted the temptation to point out that one more piece of paper would have made no difference in the extent of litter and said     i am pleased at your thoughtfulness .  i   ll see to it that this is thrown away     and put it in my pocket without looking at it .  i then asked him how he was doing with his schoolwork and he answered easily enough .  he seemed in no way perturbed at my having the paper in my possession .      i waited till i was back in my office before i looked at it  and i must say i was disappointed .  it was a typewritten sheet  xeroxed  not very professionally done  and it urged students to demand decent educational facilities  a message i wholeheartedly agreed with .      but there was nothing conspiratorial about it   or at least i could see nothing as conspiratorial .  i didn   t trust my own judgment in the matter  so i called the detective lieutenant who had approached me on the matter of the burglary ring .  he visited me after hours  in plainclothes  of course  and i showed him the letter without telling him the name of the youngster from whom i had obtained it .      trumbull said     surely  he asked the name .      burry said     i told the story in such a way that no one youngster of whatever name was implicated .      trumbull who  as a cryptographer by profession  might have been particularly interested  said     by withholding information  you may have deprived the lieutenant of crucial clues in the understanding of the message .         he didn   t think so     said burry .     he laughed  and told me it was nonsense .  i think he would have torn it up if i hadn   t rescued it   perhaps out of disappointment  for when i called him  i may have given him the impression i had something .  i   ve kept studying it myself the past few days .  heaven help me  i even tried warming it over a hot plate in case invisible ink showed up .      now it is too late .  young john was arrested in what must have been the central clearing place  taken in clear guilt  with identifiable stolen goods in his possession .  john called me from the police station  that was the phone call .  and i   ve spoken to my detective friend .  and if i had been clever enough to understand the letter  i might have stopped john .      avalon said     if the letter had significance .  not every piece of innocent literature conceals a guilty secret .         this one does  though     said rubin  his eyes flashing  his voice strident .     let me ask you a few questions  mr .  burry .  you say john was taken .  you mentioned no one else  not even by inference .  was he alone .         it   s my understanding he was .         and had john been holding the paper for some indefinite period when you first became aware of it  or had he just received it .         i can   t answer that question definitely  mr .  rubin     said burry     but it was my impression that it had been passed to him even as i watched .  i wish i had seen who it was who passed it  but i didn   t .      rubin said triumphantly     then the passer was there and watched you ask john to hand over the paper and watched him do so .  the passer turned that information to the higher   ups of the burglary ring  and they had to take into account the possibility that john might talk .  if the letter gave some sort of information that told john where to take the stolen goods  that information was quickly changed .  john  being no longer trustworthy  would not be told of the change and he would walk in alone to the meeting place that was no longer to be a meeting place and was taken .      trumbull said     wait .  hold on .  how had the police known about the meeting place  old or new .      burry studied his fingers and said     according to my detective friend  to whom i also talked before coming here  john had been under quiet surveillance for some time .  through nothing i said     he added hurriedly .     he had been identified at the scene of a burglary   not with certainty  you understand  but they were keeping an eye on him .  i hadn   t known that .      trumbull said     then if you hadn   t taken that paper and roused suspicion   assuming manny rubin   s notion is correct   john would have led the police to an active clearinghouse  and right to some of the controlling figures .      burry nodded .     the thought had occurred to me .      gonzalo said hotly     how the devil could mr .  burry know this  tom .         i   m returning to an earlier point     said trumbull .     our guest showed the letter to the detective and it was ignored .  he did not mention the name of the young man involved and i said that might be vital evidence .  i was right .  if the detective had known it was taken from a young man who was under surveillance  he would have treated it much more seriously .         you   re right     said burry .     i   ll have to tell them now .         wait     said gonzalo .     i have a better idea .  why not tell them what the letter means .  if you could be of help to them  they might be willing to go a bit easier on john if you asked them to .         john     rumbled avalon     may think he   s been double   crossed already .  he may think the burglary ring deliberately let him walk into a trap to pay him back for handing over the piece of paper .  he may be willing to cooperate now .         the catch is     said burry     that i don   t know what the letter means  so i can   t use it to win either consideration from the police or co   operation from john .      gonzalo said eagerly     do you remember what the letter said  mr .  burry .  can you repeat it .         i don   t have to     said burry .     i have it with me .  i   ve been carrying it in my pocket since i got it   and taking it out to stare at it now and then  for all the good it did me .      he took it out .  it was tightly creased and dog   eared .  he unfolded it  flattened it out  and passed it to gonzalo .  it made its way about the table  and after it reached drake  that gentleman passed it on to henry  even as burry   s hand had reached out to take it .  henry glanced at it quickly and then returned it to burry .   the typewriting did not have a professional touch  nor did the xeroxing .  it had an all   capital headline   protest national discrimination against new york .   underneath  it said     join the march on city hall on october    .  demand that congress recognize the rights of the poor to a quality education .  there is no disgrace in being a new yorker .  we are americans  every bit as much americans as the people of tar heel  north carolina  and we want our rights as americans .  no more  but certainly no less .         is that all .     said avalon in astonishment .      that   s all     said burry .      what a remarkably stupid message     said avalon .     why march on city hall .  city hall is helpless .  what   s more  no one is ever going to get much sympathy from small   town america by making fun of them .  tar heel  north carolina .  i admit that    tarheeler    is a nickname for a north carolinian because of the early production of rosin and tar from pine trees in that state  but that kind of name only sounds well when used by those who are so named .  to make up a name like tar heel  north carolina  is a deliberate insult .  it would be like having a southerner refer to the town of damyankee  massachusetts .  what do they hope to gain .         nothing     said rubin  smiling     because it   s not a call to action .  i   ll bet there isn   t any march scheduled for october     is there  mr .  burry .         i don   t know     said burry .     i haven   t heard of one .         then it   s a message  all right     said rubin .   burry said     where .  i tried looking at initial letters  final letters  every other word  every third word .  i can   t find anything .      mario gonzalo shook his head slowly and with a moderately insufferable air of superiority .     it couldn   t possibly be any of those things  mr .  burry .  i could have told you that before i ever saw the letter .      there was a moment   s complete silence and every other black widower turned to stare at gonzalo .     good god     said drake  blinking through cigarette smoke     he sounds like sherlock holmes .      gonzalo said     if you don   t mind  there   s five dollars riding on this  so just listen .     he put aside the free   flowing caricature of burry that he had drawn in the course of the discussion and said     john got the message as mr .  burry was watching  and he handed it over promptly .  but he looked at it first  isn   t that right  mr .  burry .  just a glance .     burry hesitated and said     yes  just a quick look .         exactly .  if it was a message  he had to see what it was before he handed it over  and if a quick look was enough  then he had no time to match up first letters or last letters or skip words .  and if we take just a glance at the letter we   ll see what he saw .      rubin said with elaborate politeness     and would you kindly tell us what you see .      gonzalo said     i told you what to look for at the start of the evening .  look for the irrelevancy .  tar heel  north carolina  is irrelevant .  they could have made up the name of any other town   jet air  utah  or lollipop  south dakota .  why insist on tar heel .  because it   s the key .  john took one quick look at the letter to see the name of the town  and once he had it  that was all he needed  and he could give the paper away .      avalon said thoughtfully     well  you know  there   s something to that .         nothing much     said rubin     unless mario can tell us what tar heel  north carolina  means .         it could be an anagram .         like what .     gonzalo said      i   ve been working on one     al  the not real corn hair .         there was a sticky silence  and then trumbull brought his fist down on the table .     damn it  mario  what does that mean .         i don   t know .  there could be other anagrams .  or it could be a cryptogram .  or there could be a book somewhere that has a list of word equivalents .  maybe it means     cheese it  the cops .     i don   t know .  but it means something .      rubin said     that   s a big help  telling us it means something .      gonzalo said  in an aggrieved tone     then let   s do some thinking .  it won   t hurt if we spend a few minutes trying to anagram it  or something  and maybe work out what it means .      the minutes passed in a dead silence and finally burry looked at his watch and sighed .  he said     i really must get down to the police station .  i suppose the letter is really meaningless .         well  now  dan     said halsted  stroking his hair back from his receding hairline     we can   t really say that till we   ve asked henry .         the waiter .         why  yes .  he has an uncommon knack for seeing the obvious .  except that i don   t see him .  henry .      henry   s head appeared as he climbed the stairs with a rapidity quite different from his usual gentle flow .     i beg your pardon  mr .  halsted     he said     i did not intend to be gone long .  may i ask mr .  burry a question .      burry had risen and was clearly on his way to the cloakroom .  he said     well  yes  but nothing too complicated  i hope .         unless you said something about it during the brief interval in which i was absent  sir  i believe you did not mention the actual place   the address   at which the student was apprehended .         no  i did not .         do you know the place .      burry sucked his lower lip inward and bit at it thoughtfully     it was mentioned .  yes .  but i don   t think i remember it .      henry said     was it  by any chance      west   nd street .      burry stared at henry for a moment  then sat down .     yes  it was  now that you mention it .  that was precisely the address .  how did you know .         it   s in the letter  sir .         where .     said avalon .     show us where .      henry said     mr .  gonzalo   s reasoning seemed to me perfectly correct in every detail when he pointed out the irrelevance and  therefore  the importance of the town of tar heel  north carolina .  there seemed to be a general impression that it was a manufactured name  but it occurred to me that it might be a real one .  there are very many peculiar names among the small towns of the united states  tar heel would be sedate and conservative compared to some .  and if it were real  it would have unmistakable significance  so i went down to look it up .      avalon said     you mean there is a tar heel  north carolina .         there is  mr .  avalon .         and it   s listed in the gazetteer .         it may be  but i tried another source .  the all   inclusive recording of all the inhabited places in the united states large enough to include a post office is in a zip code directory  and we have one downstairs .  tar heel  north carolina  is included  and  of course  so is its zip code .  the directory is the book that mr .  gonzalo referred to when he spoke of a list of word equivalents .         i was thinking of phrases     said gonzalo .      it is numbers  but that   s a mere detail .  the number equivalent is  of course  unique .  tar heel has a zip code of       and no other  and if the clearinghouse is on the upper west side      west   nd street would seem the likely interpretation .  undoubtedly  there are ways of coding for the east side or the west side  or if not all the numbers are used  as in   west   nd street  or it a named street such as amsterdam avenue is used .  still  the prevalence of numbered streets and avenues in manhattan make a zip code code  if i may use the phrase  particularly useful .      burry said blankly     how could i miss that .      drake grunted .     we always ask ourselves that after henry sees whatever there is to see .      burry said     it i show this to the police  they   ll see that the correspondence between the zip code and the address can   t be a coincidence .  and if they know that much  then they may learn more .         if they concentrate on the letter     said rubin     they might learn something about the typewriter  the xeroxing  and so on .  and if you confront john with what you know and indicate that the gang will assume the information came from him  he might be willing to tell more .  he can be in no worse trouble with them and he might improve his standing with the police .      burry had his coat and hat on .     thank you  all of you .  thank you  henry .     he whirled out .   avalon said     happy ending .         not for everyone     said henry .      what do you mean .      henry said     mr .  gonzalo clearly had the answer  all but the trivial  final step .  in my opinion  mr .  rubin owes him five dollars .         irrelevance .       afterword  in late january       i attended a convention of mystery tans at mohonk mountain house  near new paltz  new york  .  it was the second of what had been planned to be annual affairs  and it was every bit as much fun as the first had been .   at the end  there was an auction to raise money for the mohonk trust fund  and one of the items auctioned off was the privilege of having one   s name used in a black widowers tale .   the high bidder was one dan burry  and three months later  when i wrote    irrelevance .     i had the guest at the banquet named dan burry .  i used only the name  of course  and not the appearance  the job  or anything else about the auction winner .   the story appeared in the march      eqmm under the title of    a matter of irrelevance    but  as usual  i prefer the shorter title and restore my own .   the story came out just in time for the third annual meeting of mystery readers at mohonk  and dan burry was beaming .  he said that by an odd coincidence the views of the fictional dan burry bore a close resemblance to his own .     .  none so blind  roger halsted  normally soft   spoken  did on occasion become emphatic when the matter under discussion was something that struck at the inner core of his affections .   he said     you   re quite wrong  manny .  not only is the limerick an authentic and respectable verse form  it is to the english language what the haiku is to japanese  an authentic and peculiar possession .      halsted   s high forehead was pink and his slight stammer was emphasized as he grew  for him  passionate .  the others present at the preprandial stage of the monthly banquet of the black widowers fell briefly silent in astonishment at halsted   s single   handed bearding of emmanuel rubin .   rubin  who grew passionate even over weather announcements  seemed afire with contradiction .     are you trying to tell me  roger  that limericks can   t be written in any language .         of course not     said halsted .     i know a number of limericks in french and german .  it   s just that it doesn   t come naturally to those languages or to any other than english .  they   re not designed for it .  for heaven   s sake  you can write haikus in english  it   s just a matter of counting syllables  but it doesn   t have the same effect as in japanese .         subjective nonsense     said rubin  his sparse gray beard bristling belligerently .     it   s what you   re used to .  teach american children haiku in grade school and they   ll appreciate it in english as japanese children learn to appreciate it in japanese .         you underestimate the difference involved in the fact that syllables in japanese are more regular in sound than those in english .  and where limericks are concerned  what counts is the anarchy of the english language .         you call it anarchy  roger  because you know no grammar .         that   s my point     said halsted .     english grammar is incredibly loose .  it consists almost entirely of a collection of exceptions .  and the english vocabulary  through a succession of historical accidents  is far larger than that of any other language .  every word in english has twenty synonyms  no two of which are exactly alike in meaning .         i grant the flexibility of english     said rubin .      then you grant my argument .  a limerick is made up of thirteen metrical feet divided into five lines with three  three  two  two  three feet each .  there are two unaccented  syllables between each accented one in each line  one or two unaccented syllables at the start of each line  and zero  one  or two unaccented syllables at the end of each line .  if  .   .   .      at this point  mario gonzalo  the black widowers    resident artist  who had been following the argument over a martini and was smacking his lips over both  said     come on  roger  we all know what a limerick is .      halsted said     the point i   m trying to make is that the rules for a limerick are rigid and allow almost no leeway .  we can get away with it in english because we can shift from a word to its synonym  we can alter word order  use a noun for an adjective  and so on .  in other languages  you are not so free   there are too few synonyms  too fixed a word order  too inflexible a set of word properties .      at this point  the one nonmember of the club  the guest brought in by the host of the evening  broke in eagerly .  he had been hovering at the edge of the argument waiting for a chance to insert himself  and he now said     my favorite limerick goes     from a crypt in the church of st .  giles           halsted said     good .  take that one .  i   ve often heard the second line given as    came a scream that rang out for a mile .     now that   s wrong .  between the two accented syllables    scream    and    rang    there is only one unaccented syllable .         not so     said james drake  touching his small gray mustache as though to reassure himself of its microscopic presence .     you can say it     came a scream that rang out for a mile .         halsted looked annoyed     that defies the ordinary rhythm of english speech .  if you were to read the line as prose  you would sound illiterate if you placed the accent on    out .     you could say    came a screaming that rang out for a mile     but now you have three unaccented syllables between    rang and    mile     and that   s impermissible too .  so you change it to    came a screaming that rang out for miles     which sounds better and which  incidentally  preserves the rhyme  a matter that most amateur limericists are very cavalier about .  however  the phrase    came a screaming     while permissible english   almost anything is   is a trifle unnatural .  so you change it to    came a scream that resounded for miles    and you have a perfect limerick line .      geoffrey avalon   s deep baritone rolled out  effortlessly rising above the general conversation     and as henry is trying to tell you  roger  we have a perfect banquet waiting for us if you   ll only shut up and let everyone sit down .      henry  whose role as waiter at the monthly banquet made him the one indispensable man of the evening  said quietly     i cannot guarantee perfection  gentlemen  but there will be roast goose that i think you will find acceptable .      halsted sat down at once .  it was widely rumored that the one way to stop him from composing limericks was to place food in front of him  and halsted had more than once admitted the possibility of there being some truth to that .  he was a valiant trencherman  he said .   the guest tried halsted again after the stuffed mushrooms had been disposed of and bones sprouted from the plates .  he said     i take it you know the st .  giles limerick  then .      thomas trumbull  scowling out of his tanned face under his thatch of white hair  said     he has heard every limerick invented and  thanks to his insufferable mania and our own incomprehensible tolerance  so have we .      avalon said     since you came late as usual  tom  i haven   t had a chance to introduce my guest to you .  this is ananias st .  john  a cousin of my wife   s but a splendid fellow all the same .         ananias .     said trumbull  with a thoughtful look in his eye .      ananias     said st .  john jovially .     my parents had a perverted sense of humor .  however  the bible is so rarely read these days that the natural allusion is lost .  well  almost so  it wasn   t last week  i think .  usually  the trouble i have is in pronunciation .  which reminds me  geoff  please overcome your anglophilic love of elision and don   t pronounce my last name sinjon .  accent the last syllable and make it sinjon  or  better yet  give it the full sounding of saint john .      halsted said     elisions can be useful     there was a young fellow named sinjon  who said to his wife     honest injun     .   .   .         trumbull shouted     damn it  roger  i   d tell you not to torture us with another limerick  except that you won   t find another rhyme for st .  john  however execrable .      halsted said quietly        i was having no fling  with that pretty young thing .  just a small bit of fatherly pinchin    .               execrable    is the word  all right  tom     said avalon .      can you do better .     demanded halsted .      who wants to .     said trumbull .     to want to compose a better limerick is the mark of a man with micro   ambition .      avalon tapped his water glass with his spoon as henry passed around the brandy in his usual unobtrusive way .      roger     avalon said     you were unaccustomedly forward earlier in the evening .  suppose we take advantage of your brashness and ask you to conduct the grilling now .      trumbull let out a roar of disapproval .     come on  geoff .  roger will get this thing turned into a competition of limericks  and i swear i   ll leave .      avalon looked austere .     as host  i make the decisions  and there are no appeals .  roger  you do the grilling  and the subject of limericks is not to be brought up .      halsted said  eyebrows lifted     i wouldn   t dream of it .  i   ve had my say .  mr .  st .  john     he pronounced the name carefully as two equally stressed words      it is customary  but not obligatory  to ask each guest to justify his existence  and in this case i choose not to .  it i do  we may get off on a tangent and  instead  i want to move directly to a nonlimerical point .   .   .   .         grill .  don   t orate .     muttered trumbull .      quiet  tom     said avalon  with a stiff gesture .   halsted said     earlier  during the dinner  you said that few people saw the natural allusion to your name  ananias .  you mean  of course  the fact that it is used  metaphorically  to mean a liar .         that   s right     said st .  john cheerfully .     ananias and his wife  sapphira  tried to withhold property from the common fund by lying about it and were struck dead by peter in consequence .  you   ll find it at the beginning of the fifth chapter of acts .      rubin said     have you ever thought of changing your name .         why should i .     said st .  john .  i like it .  it gives me a bit of individuality .  i   m the only ananias i ever met and that suits me fine .      halsted said     back to the point  though .  you also said that there were allusions made last week .  in other words  someone thought you were a liar .  why .      st .  john frowned and his round face assumed an anxious look .     did i say anything about last week .         you did     said drake  nodding .     i heard it  too .         i shouldn   t have     said st .  john .     i   ve been asked not to talk about it .      trumbull leaned forward intently and said     wait .  are you the st .  john who was connected with the winston arms incident .      st .  john said cautiously  as though expecting entrapment     i live in winston arms .         okay .  all i knew was your initial .  if i had known your full first name i would have known on the instant of introduction .  look  mr .  st .  john  the incident doesn   t exactly fall under my jurisdiction and i know of it only from some distance  but it   s all right to talk about it here .  everything said here never goes beyond the walls  and that includes henry  our esteemed waiter .      st .  john   s caution did not abandon him     how do i know you have the authority to  .  .  .      avalon said     it   s all right  ni .  if tom says you can go ahead  you can .  the only thing is that i do try to pick my guests carefully and avoid these damned puzzles .  ni st .  john is an electrical engineer with an unimpeachably quiet life  and now look .         it only happened last week  geoff     said st .  john weakly .     i   m sorry .         would you tell us about it .     said halsted .   there was one last moment of hesitation and then st .  john said     to make it short  i found a dead man and i   m not sure the fbi doesn   t think i may have been the killer .      the company of black widowers emitted a collective sigh .      murder .     whispered gonzalo .     we hardly ever get anything like that .      halsted said     let the man speak .  would you start from the beginning  mr .  st .  john .         there isn   t much to tell     said st .  john .     last friday  i was leaving my apartment at the winston arms on a routine errand .  i had a day off and my wife thought i ought to do some shopping lest unaccustomed leisure rot my moral fiber  i suppose .  i was engaged in locking the door   three locks in new york  of course   when  behind me  i heard the door of the elevator open .  that meant someone was getting off or going in  so i shouted     hold it  please     because one can easily wait five or ten minutes for an elevator  if you   ve just missed a chance .  when i got there  though  all three elevator doors were closed .  no one was in sight and in the ten seconds it had taken me to get to the elevator bank  anyone getting off would not have had time to vanish into an apartment door .  that meant someone had gotten on .      rubin  who lived in a large apartment complex of his own  said     elevators aren   t that faultless .  it might have stopped at the floor by way of a misfunctioning signal and no one either got on or off .         as it happened     said st .  john     there turned out to be every reason to suppose someone had got on   a murderer  in fact  which  selfishly speaking  makes it just as well i had my back to the hall and was delayed by the three locks .  it i had seen him and tried to get on the elevator with him  he might have tried to kill me  too .         what time was it .     asked halsted .      about four in the afternoon .         i should think he took a big chance on being seen .      st .  john said     not necessarily .  the peephole in the door of the apartment he came out of commands a view of the length of the hall .  i imagine he made sure the hall was empty before going out to signal for the elevator .  anyway  i knew nothing of this at the time .  i just knew someone hadn   t held the door for me and i chafed quite a bit and walked up and down to pass the time .  the wait for an elevator always seems twice as long if you just stand there and stare at a closed door .      at the end of the corridor  the opposite end from my apartment  there was an apartment door  from within which i heard a distinct moaning  and the door was just a trifle ajar .  i called out     hi .  something wrong .     and shoved the door open a bit .  the moaning was a bit louder and i thought i did hear the word    help .     i went in  very reluctantly .  oh it   s easy to sneer  but getting involved can be troublesome and  in fact  it was .      there was a dying man in the living room .  he had been knifed and it was sticking out of his chest and you   ll excuse me if i don   t go into details  but i don   t revel in such things .  he was a man i had seen in the elevator occasionally  and we had waited for it together once or twice  but we had never spoken .  it   s traditional in new york  you know  to ignore your neighbors .      i was rather paralyzed .  i   m not a doctor  i didn   t know what to do .  i might have run out yelling for help  or i might have run back to my apartment and used the intercom to alert the doorman .  but i just stood there frozen and the man looked at me and said  quite distinctly     the blind man     and then his neck tendons just went loose .  i had never seen anyone die  but there was no doubt in my mind that i had just seen it happen .      st .  john paused at this point and said     waiter  might i have a refill on the brandy .      henry  as always  seemed to have anticipated the request .  the black widowers remained silent and finally st .  john cleared his throat and said     i didn   t know what to do then  either .  how could i be sure he was dead .  was i supposed to apply first aid to save his life   when i knew nothing about first aid .  besides  i also thought that if he were dead  i wasn   t supposed to move the body or touch anything .  i was afraid of touching even the phone  but then i picked it up with a handkerchief at one end and dialed the police .      i went back to my apartment after that to tell my wife what had happened  and she took some quieting  you can imagine .  then i returned to the dead man to wait for the police .      gonzalo said     how did i come to miss the news story .  a murder in a posh apartment house usually makes the lower left   hand corner of the times front page and scare headlines in the news and the post .      st .  john shrugged .     i suspect there was an attempt to keep it as quiet as possible .  it made its way through the apartment house  though  because my wife called the office .  the tenants have already had a meeting on the problem of security  but that doesn   t really have anything to do with the story .  the fact is that when the policemen came  there were intelligence agents along with them and it was one of those who interviewed me .  when i gave him my name  he looked at me sharply and asked if i had my driver   s license with me .  it seemed to me he thought i was giving him a false name .  i produced it  along with a few credit cards  and there it was   ananias  in clear print .            how well did you know this man .     he asked .      i said     not at all .  i   d see him in the corridor or in the elevator  but i never spoke to him .            you   re neighbors .  you live on the same floor        i tried to explain about new york .  he listened  showed no expression .  he said     did you straighten up in here .            not in any way     i said .     i touched nothing but the phone  except that i pushed the door open  stepped across the floor  and may have put my hand somewhere on the furniture .     i wasn   t trying to be funny .  i just wanted to be perfectly honest .      he said     did you do that .         he pointed to the window shade  which hung crookedly as though it were broken  then to some books on a coffee table that seemed disarrayed .  i hadn   t evert noticed that  and i said so .  he asked if i had touched one of the ashtrays and i said i hadn   t .      he asked me to tell him what had happened and i did   exactly as i told it to you earlier .      he said     it   s your opinion  then  that a blind man came in here and did this .         i said i had no such opinion .  the dying person had said     the blind man     and that   s all .  he hadn   t said a blind man had knifed him or had come in or anything .  three words and he had died .      the agent said     what do you think he meant .            i don   t know     i said .  by now i was pretty wild because it seemed to me i could see how things were going .  there was no real sign of a struggle .  there seemed to have been no search and maybe nothing was stolen .  it looked like a sudden quarrel between friends .  there i was on the same floor .  i could be the friend .  i could have killed him and then tried to cover by calling the police with a story about the murderer going down the elevator and the dead man muttering a senseless phrase .      they finally let me go  but not until after i had begun to be sure that i was going to be arrested .  i   m convinced  though  that if my name had not been ananias  that agent wouldn   t have been half convinced i was lying and he might not have given me such a hard time .  anyway  they warned me not to talk about it  and that   s it .  the whole story .      trumbull broke in .     i   m sure your name had nothing to do with it  mr .  st .  john .  the fact is that there   s more to this than you can guess  and that   s why it had to be kept reasonably quiet .  what i am going to do   it i can get over my astonishment at the coincidence of having you here one week after the event   is to tell you as little as possible  and as much as is necessary .      the fact is that the dead man  whom we   ll call jones  was an undercover agent .  who and what he was investigating is of no concern to us here  but things were so delicate that he remained completely out of touch with us except on rare occasions and even then only by very tenuous devices concerning which i know no details .  as i said  i was not directly concerned .  he lived at winston arms for two years  had a complicated and thoroughly established cover  and went quietly about his very dangerous business .      rubin muttered     that kind of storybook spy activity never rings true to me .  who would want to live such a life .         very few     said trumbull     but it has to be done  it   s very well paid  and the fringe benefits in the way of early retirement  medical insurance  and pension plans are attractive .  but let me go on .   .   .   .         somehow  we now see in hindsight  his cover was blown .  somehow  he was murdered .  it might have been a nonassociated murder  having nothing to do with his job  but we don   t believe in pure coincidence in such matters .      avalon said     to be dramatic is not always to be correct .  why couldn   t it have been someone who came in to burglarize the apartment  found jones there  knifed him  and then fled in panic without taking anything .      trumbull looked scornful .     there was no sign of a forcible entry  and jones would not be likely to let himself be knifed by a two   bit sneak   thief at four in the afternoon .  no  it had to be a carefully planned entry designed to catch jones off   guard  and it could only have been carried through by a well   organized cabal .      halsted said     why the apartment .  why not arrange an automobile accident .  why not have him mugged in central park .      trumbull said     it could be done that way .  it has  on occasion .  but this was a special case  and it was a matter of psychological warfare  in a way .  at least  so we believe .  look at it this way  people living this dangerous life have to be aware of danger at every moment anywhere in the street or in public buildings or in empty places .  one   s own home  though  is a place of refuge .  if there weren   t somewhere you could feel safe  the life would become unbearable .  to be tracked down  then  and killed in your own apartment  not only gets rid of an important agent but may well demoralize the entire agency .      the question is not why it was done there  but how .  jones had a gun and it wasn   t used .  he was a thoroughgoing expert in the various techniques of self   defense  yet there was no sign of a struggle .  combine that with the fact that the killer had gotten into the apartment with every sign of having been invited in .      to whom could jones have said     come in .     jones could not possibly have allowed anyone to enter his apartment under any but the most unambiguous conditions .  i doubt that i could have gotten into his apartment even if i had flashed my identification .  he didn   t know me personally and he would have taken into account the fact that my card might have been forged .      st .  john said eagerly     in that case  maybe the agent who questioned me had the right idea .  a blind man could do it .         why should he let in a blind man  ni .     asked avalon .      why not .  a blind man isn   t dangerous .  i know there are stories about blind men being able to get around in the dark when sighted men can   t .  but this was midafternoon on a sunny day .  there was no advantage to being blind .      avalon said     but if a blind man isn   t dangerous  how could he kill jones .      st .  john said     it all works out .  jones would be completely unsuspicious just because the man was blind .  the blind man would hold out his left hand and jones would automatically take it .  the blind man could have an athlete   s grip like pew in treasure island  pull jones off   balance  and before jones could collect his wits he would be a dead man with a knife between his ribs .  or  actually  almost a dead man .      avalon said     why would a blind man want to get into jones    apartment .  what would be his excuse .  a blind man comes to the door  let us say .  what does he say to get in .      st .  john said     he could be collecting for some charity .  it   s hard to refuse a blind man .  if jones opened the door that might be all the murderer needed .  the grip of a hand  a sudden twist  a push inward  the knife  and out again .  the whole thing might take no more than fifteen seconds .         and how     asked avalon     would he know the corridor was clear  either when he was trying to get in or trying to get out .         a blind man     said st .  john     would have learned to rely on his hearing .  people in corridors talk  hum  drum their fingers  shift from foot to foot .      rubin  with the thick lenses of his glasses magnifying his eyes into orbs of fury  contained himself no longer .     what garbage .     he said .     jones wouldn   t open the door for a blind man under any circumstances .  tom  if he wouldn   t let you in because he would suspect a forged identity card  why should he let in a blind man who could be a fraud .  what do you need to fake blindness .  dark glasses and a white cane and you   ve got it .  jones wouldn   t fall for that .         besides     said trumbull     there   s no blind man who lives in the apartment house  and no blind man was seen entering or leaving at the time of the murder .  the building is high   security  with doormen on duty  of course  and no one is allowed in without being announced .         well  if it comes to that     said rubin  switching sides at once     i live in an apartment house with a doorman  and that means nothing .  a doorman has a thousand jobs .  he   s on the phone  he rushes out to open a taxi door or help an older resident with her bundles  and a man can slip in .  or else  even with the doorman watching  he just waits for a resident to walk in and then walks in with him  saying cheerfully     so how did things go .     the resident  puzzled but polite  says     fine  fine     and the doorman assumes the invader is a guest of the resident and lets him pass without a word .      trumbull said sarcastically     a blind man could pull those clever tricks  could he .      rubin shrugged .     i said there was no blind man .      st .  john said  his voice squeaking into a higher register     he mentioned a blind man .         sure     said gonzalo .     someone who seemed blind .  the murderer sneaks into the apartment house in the way manny describes .  once inside and up to the right apartment  he puts on the dark glasses and takes out the cane .   .   .   .         where does he get the cane .     demanded rubin .     they   re something like three or four feet long .  does it telescope .  if not  how does he hide it while sneaking in .      gonzalo said     all right .  dark glasses  then .  he pretends he   s blind to get in and then  .   .   .      rubin said flatly     jones wouldn   t open the door to a stranger on the strength of dark glasses  or a cane  either .  right  tom .         right     said trumbull .     the whole question hinges on who the hell he could possibly say    come in    to .  it would have to be someone he knew .  an ill neighbor  perhaps  with whom he   d gotten friendly .         he wasn   t friendly with me     said st .  john .     does that mean  though  that every person living in winston arms is going to have to be investigated on suspicion of friendship with intent to kill .      trumbull said     this is not a funny situation  mr .  st .  john .  but to answer your question  if i were running the investigation  why  yes  that is what i would do .      gonzalo said     but jones mentioned a blind man .  how do you get away from that .  do we suppose st .  john is lying .         my name may be ananias     began st .  john heatedly     but .  .  .     avalon cut him off with a wave of his hand .  he said     no dying man is going to enunciate clearly or know for sure what he is saying .  it could have been anything and it could have meant anything .      st .  john said     just the same  geoff  i heard it .  the man may not have known what he was saying  but what he said was    the blind man .         drake lit a cigarette  squinted through the smoke  and said     could you swear he didn   t say     the blond man    .      st .  john looked confounded .        blond man    .         sure .  it   s not so different from    blind man .            n   no     said john .     it was    blind man .         drake said     could you swear to it in a court of law  under oath .      st .  john hesitated .     i   m not sure .      rubin  who for a few moments had seemed withdrawn  said suddenly     no  it was    blind man .            stay on one side  damn it     said trumbull .      listen     said rubin earnestly     the problem remains that he said    come in    to someone .  it couldn   t be a neighbor .  his apartment had to remain sanctuary .  no mere friend could get in .  it would have to be something more than that .  think about it .  who are the only people he would let in .      gonzalo said  with a wide grin     women .      rubin looked disgusted     oh god .      gonzalo  galvanized suddenly into seriousness  said     why not .  you   re not trying to tell me jones is a eunuch .  so they got to his girl   friend .  he would let her in  you bet .  they   d embrace and while they   re kissing  she slips a nice little blade between his ribs .  do you think it never happened .      st .  john said  outraged     i   ve never seen a strange woman on our floor .         with a little bit of luck  you wouldn   t have seen the murder  either     said gonzalo .     a blond girl  i   ll bet .  jim drake   s right .  the word was blond .         st .  john said        blind man .     even if you switch    blind    to    blond     which i don   t admit  i stick by    man .            besides     said avalon  whose face had taken on an air of strong disapproval the moment the sex motif had been introduced     surely he   d know the girl   s name .  he wouldn   t call her    the blonde .     he would say    fifi    or    tootsie    or even    my girl .            if i can get a word in edgewise     roared trumbull     i   ll be glad to explain that the rules on sexual involvement during the kind of work jones was doing are strict .  the agents have to follow certain well   understood guides .  i don   t have to give the details  but you can take it as certain there was no light   o   love in jones    apartment .      gonzalo said  stubbornly     people don   t always follow rules .      rubin said     back to where i was  then  before mario introduced nonsense .  who are the only ones jones would admit into the apartment .  who could get close enough to draw a knife .  a fellow agent .         what .     said trumbull angrily .      why not .     demanded rubin .     if there have been murdering mistresses before this  so have there been traitorous double agents .  besides  jones said as much .         when .  how .     trumbull   s anger had not abated .      think about it .  assuming a traitorous agent  what would have been jones    last emotion .  maybe not sorrow over dying .  he must have made peace with that possibility years before .  what must have gotten right into his gizzard was the horror over the betrayal .  his trusted coworker  on the inside  burrowing unsuspected .  how was it no one had seen it .  and as he lay dying  he is conscious of someone bending over him and his last words were a bitter and wondering     they   re blind  man .     rubin sat back  triumphant .   there was silence  and st .  john said     that wasn   t the intonation of the words .  it didn   t have the music of that phrase .  it was flat   informational  nothing else .      trumbull said     i don   t believe a traitor was involved .         well  of course not     said rubin     that   s the downfall of half the organizations of your type .  by the time you can believe that any of the good old boys are bad old fakes  you   ve been diddled .     he went on .     besides  it all makes sense .  the guy has been in the apartment before  but he has gotten in without being seen by the doorman in any of a dozen ways .  he doesn   t want to be seen on the floor either .  he knows the elevator can take several minutes to arrive  he   s been there before .  so he checks the corridor through the peephole  then leaves the door slightly ajar behind him .      if he hears a noise at any door that signifies someone coming to join him in the corridor  he retreats into the apartment till the coast is clear .  if the elevator is about to stop at the floor  he has time to move back  close the apartment door  and still get to the elevator .      gonzalo said     what if someone gets off the elevator while he   s getting on .         two people passing each other for two seconds isn   t the same as having someone wait with you in the corridor and go down the elevator with you .  the trouble was that  by a bad coincidence for the murderer  st .  john stepped out of his apartment door just as the elevator came .      if he now dashed back to the apartment he might still be safe  but the elevator door was opening and the temptation was to get in and down while he had the chance .  and he did that   a split   second decision that was wrong  for he left the apartment door ajar behind him .      gonzalo said     what a lot of horsefeathers .  if he didn   t want to be associated with the floor  why didn   t he just walk down several flights and calmly wait for the elevator on another floor .      rubin said sardonically     the trouble with you  mario  is that you live in a brownstone .  anyone involved in a high   rise never uses the stairs .  you don   t even let yourself know the stairs are there .         all very pretty     said trumbull     but how do you prove it .         i don   t have to     said rubin .     i   ve presented you with a case that answers every objection you can raise  and it   s up to you to prove it .  don   t have the organization waste its time checking the apartment   house residents .  let it check its own men .  it   ll find the culprit   and i hope it   s not you  tom .      trumbull snarled .     if you think our own men aren   t under continuous surveillance  manny  you   re crazier than you   re always making yourself sound .  we spend too much time trying to corrupt the opposition to suppose that they   re not trying to corrupt us .  and from the fact that we succeed now and then  we deduce that they succeed now and then .  i won   t say that it   s absolutely certain one of our men didn   t do this  but it   s a pretty damn close approach to certain .  i wouldn   t believe in betrayal unless i couldn   t think of a single alternative explanation .         well  can you .     demanded rubin .     can you offer any explanation that will account for jones saying    come in    to someone and for then saying something that sounds like    the blind man    .      trumbull said with sudden energy     where   s henry .     he shouted     henry .         yes  sir     came henry   s quiet voice .     is there anything you wish .         certainly .  have you been listening to the conversation .         yes  sir .         then tell manny he   s wrong .      the trace of a smile appeared on henry   s unlined but sixtyish face .     mr .  rubin is  as always  extremely ingenious and persuasive .  i suspect everything he says is correct except for the identity of the murderer .         that so  henry .     said rubin .     are you telling us you know who did it .         i believe the murderer   s name is peter wanko .  that at least is the name he goes under .  it would have been unwise for him to disappear immediately after the murder  but i understand he has given notice and  .   .   .         henry .     roared trumbull .     what the hell are you talking about .      henry said     i   m sorry  sir  but in your anxiety to impress the company with mr .  jones    intense privacy  you forgot that any apartment resident  however private and however suspicious  will welcome into his apartment  at almost any time  a number of different people .         and who are those .         why  sir  the service staff .  repairs must be made now and then  and it isn   t likely that mr .  jones will not demand that such repairs be made when they arc necessary .  if the opposition organization wished to kill mr .  jones and if they could place one of their own agents on the apartment   house service staff  the rest is a matter of time .      gonzalo nodded vigorously .     of course .  as soon as jones needed something repaired  .   .   .         perhaps not that soon  mr .  gonzalo     said henry .     the ordinary procedure would be for jones to call the office and for the office to send a repairman .  it would be known where the repairman was and when he was there .  the repairman would be under instant and fatal suspicion .  even a dedicated assassin would prefer to escape afterward if he could .         well  then .     asked trumbull .      i imagine  sir  that this peter wanko cultivated a friendship with mr .  jones   took to greeting him respectfully  asking if all was well .  wanko joined the staff over a year ago and there was ample time for that .  as for mr .  jones  he would be polite  i   m sure  even though he might never have learned the serviceman   s name .  i imagine when wanko was in the apartment to do some assigned task  he did it efficiently  was well tipped  and was suitably grateful .  it must have seemed natural for him to urge mr .  jones to call him directly for small jobs and bypass the office .     i   ll take care of you  sir     he may have said     and it will get done sooner .         and eventually  mr .  jones did call wanko directly .  he might have passed him in the lobby and told him he needed something done and would be home at   p . m that day .  wanko went upstairs with no record as to where he would be then  taking care not to be seen .  since he appeared on a legitimate summons  mr .  jones would not hesitate to let him in .  whereupon wanko killed him .      the silence was dense until  finally  st .  john said     but this seems more out   of   the   way than mr .  rubin   s theory .  i know peter wanko and he   s a completely harmless person .  where   s the evidence .      henry said     there are the last words of mr .  jones  which you yourself reported .  you   ll remember that in the argument over limericks before dinner  mr .  halsted spoke of the flexibility of the english language and of how individual words can serve as different parts of speech .  it occurred to me at once  therefore  when you told us of mr .  jones saying    the blind man    that while the normal use of    blind    is as an adjective meaning    unsighted     it could also be used as a noun .  you mentioned a window shade hanging crookedly as though broken  and a blind man could be a man who fixed blinds .      toward the end of this evening   s discussion  then  i called the winston arms  got the evening doorman  said i had an important job that needed good workmanship  and that the man who took care of the window blinds at the winston arms had been recommended .     oh  you mean peter wanko     said the doorman .     he   s not supposed to do any work outside the building  but he   s given notice  so maybe you can use him .     then he gave me wanko   s phone number and address .         good god .     said trumbull .  he leaped for the stairs and was back in just under five minutes .  he was grinning broadly .     it   s all right .  henry  they got the guy .  they arrested him three hours ago   while we were all having our first drinks .         what gave him away .     asked st .  john .      apparently     said trumbull  with satisfaction     they followed the same line of reasoning henry used   except that it took them seven days to do it .         they didn   t have the help of the black widowers  sir     said henry .      none so blind      afterword  as is well known to many people  i don   t fly and i don   t like to travel by any conveyance .  i   m a homebody .   when i take vacations  then  and seize the opportunity to write a black widowers tale  i am usually somewhere in upstate new york or in a similar not   very   distant locality .   every once in a while  though  i do take a cruise  i don   t mind going somewhere by ship .  in fact  i love being on a ship as long as i can keep my mind off the fact that there is but an inch of steel between myself and a miles   deep stretch of water .   so it happens that    none so blind    was written in bermuda .  in fact  when the air conditioning on the statendam  our ship on the occasion  was briefly shut down for repairs  janet and i wandered off to a plush hotel  found an air   conditioned conference room that was not in use  and stayed there a couple of hours in perfect comfort while i finished the story .      none so blind    appeared in the june      issue of eqmm .  just to show you that i don   t always turn down fred   s title changes  my own original title was    come in .     as soon as i discovered what fred was calling it i was overwhelmed at my dullwittedness in not thinking of it myself .     .  the backward look  if emmanuel rubin knew how not to be didactic  he never exercised that knowledge .      when you write a short story     he said     you had better know the ending first .  the end of a story is only the end to a reader .  to a writer  it   s the beginning .  if you don   t know exactly where you   re going every minute you   re writing  you   ll never get there   or anywhere .      thomas trumbull   s young guest at this particular monthly banquet of the black widowers seemed all eyes as he watched rubin   s straggly gray beard quiver and his thick   lensed glasses glint  and all ears as he listened to rubin   s firm  decibelic voice .   the guest himself was clearly in his early twenties  quite thin  with a somewhat bulging forehead and a rather diminutive chin .  his clothing almost glistened in its freshness  as though he had broken out a brand   new costume for the great occasion .  his name was milton peterborough .   he said  a small quiver in his voice     does that mean you have to write an outline  mr .  rubin .         no     said rubin emphatically .     you can if you want to  but i never do .  you don   t have to know the exact road you   re going to take .  you have to know your destination  that   s all .  once that   s the case  any road will take you there .  as you write you are continually looking backward from that known destination  and it   s that backward look that guides you .      mario gonzalo  who was quickly and carefully drawing a caricature of the guest  making his eyes incredibly large and filling them with a childlike innocence  said     come on  manny  that sort of tight plotting might fit your cockamamy mysteries  but a real writer deals with character  doesn   t he .  he creates people and they behave in accordance with their characters and that guides the story  probably to the surprise of the author .      rubin turned slowly and said     if you   re talking about long  invertebrate novels  mario   assuming you   re talking about anything at all   it   s possible for an experienced or gifted writer to meander along and produce something passable .  but you can always tell the i   don   t   know   where   i   m   going   but   i   m   going book .  even if you forgive it its amorphous character for the sake of its virtues  you have to forgive it  and that   s a strain and a drawback .  a tightly plotted story with everything fitting together neatly is  on the other hand  the noblest work of literature .  it may be bad  but it never need ask forgiveness .  the backward look  .   .   .      at the other end of the room  geoffrey avalon glanced with resignation at rubin and said     i think it was a mistake  tom  to tell manny at the start that the young man was an aspiring writer .  it brings out the worst in him  or  at any rate  the longest   winded .     he stirred the ice in his drink with his forefinger and brought his dark eyebrows together forbiddingly .      actually     said thomas trumbull  his lined face uncharacteristically placid     the kid wanted to meet manny .  he admires his stories  god knows why .  well  he   s the son of a friend of mine and a nice youngster and i thought i   d expose him to the seamy side of life by bringing him here .      avalon said     it won   t hurt us to be exposed to youth now and then  either .  but i hate being exposed to rubin   s theories of literature .  henry .      the quiet and smoothly efficient waiter  who served at all the black widowers banquets  was at his side at once without seeming to have moved in order to have achieved that     yes  sir .         henry     said avalon     what are these strange manifestations .      henry said     tonight we will have a buffet dinner .  the chef has prepared a variety of indian and pakistani dishes .         with curry .         rather heavy on the curry  sir .  it was mr .  trumbull   s special request .      trumbull flared under avalon   s accusing eye .     i wanted curry and i   m the host .         and manny won   t eat it and will be unbearable .      trumbull shrugged .   rubin was not entirely unbearable but he was loud  and only roger halsted seemed unaffected by the rubinian tirade against all things indian .  halsted said     a buffet is a good idea     patted his lips with his napkin  and went back for a third helping of everything  with a beatific smile on his face .   trumbull said     roger  if you don   t stop eating  we   ll start the grilling session over your chewing .         go ahead     said halsted cheerfully .     i don   t mind .         you will later tonight     said rubin     when your stomach wall burns through .      trumbull said     and you   re going to start the grilling .         if you don   t mind my talking with my mouth full     said halsted .      get started  then .      halsted said thickly     how do you justify your existence  milton .         i can   t     said peterborough  a little breathlessly .     maybe after i get my degrees .         what   s your school and major .         columbia and chemistry .         chemistry .     said halsted .     i would have thought it was english .  didn   t i gather during the cocktail hour that you were an aspiring writer .         anyone is allowed to be an aspiring writer     said peterborough .      aspiring     said rubin darkly .      and what do you want to write .     said halsted .   peterborough hesitated and said  with a trace of defensiveness in his voice     well  i   ve always been a science   fiction fan .  since i was nine  anyway .         oh god     muttered rubin  his eyes rolling upward in mute appeal .  gonzalo said instantly     science fiction .  that   s what your friend isaac asimov writes  isn   t it  manny .         he   s not my friend     said rubin .     he clings to me out of helpless admiration .      trumbull raised his voice .     will you two stop having a private conversation .  go on  roger .         have you written any science fiction .         i   ve tried  but i haven   t submitted anything .  i   m going to  though .  i have to .         why do you have to .         i made a bet .         what kind .         well     said peterborough helplessly     it   s rather complicated   and embarrassing .         we don   t mind the complications     said halsted     and well try not to be embarrassed .         well     said peterborough  and there appeared on his face something that had not been seen at the black widowers banquets for years  a richly tinted blush .     there   s this girl .  i   m sort of cra   i like her  but i don   t think she likes me  but i like her anyway .  the trouble is she goes for a basketball player  a real idiot   six   foot   five to his eyebrows and nothing above .      peterborough shook his head and continued .     i don   t have much going for me .  i can   t impress her with chemistry  but she   s an english lit major  so i showed her some of my stories .  she asked me if i had ever sold anything  and i said  no .  but then i said i intended to write something and sell it  and she laughed .      that bothered me and i thought of something .  it seems that lester del rey       rubin interposed .     who .         lester del rey .  he   s a science   fiction writer .         another one of those .     said rubin .     never heard of him .         well  he   s no isaac asimov     admitted peterborough     but he   s all right .  anyway  the way he got started was once when he read a science   fiction story and thought it was terrible .  he said to his girl     hell  i can write something better than that     and she said     i dare you     and he did and sold it .      so when this girl laughed  i said     i   ll bet i write one and sell it     and she said     i   ll bet you don   t     and i said     i   ll bet you a date against five dollars .  if i sell the story  you go with me to a dinner and dance on a night of my choosing .     and she agreed .      so i   ve just got to write the story now  because she said she   d go out with me if i wrote the story and she liked it  even if it didn   t sell   which may mean she likes me more than i think .      james drake  who had been listening thoughtfully  brushed his gray stub of a mustache with one finger and said     or that she   s quite confident that you won   t even write the story .         i will     said peterborough .      then go ahead     said rubin .      there   s a catch .  i can write the story  i know .  i   ve got some good stuff .  i even know the ending so i can give it that backward look you mentioned  mr .  rubin .  what i don   t have is a motive .         a motive .     said rubin .     i thought you were writing a science     fiction story .         yes  mr .  rubin  but it   s a science   fiction mystery  and i need a motive .  i have the modus operandi of the killing  and the way of the killing  but i don   t know the why of the killing .  i thought  though  if i came here  i could discuss it with you .         you could what .     said rubin  lifting his head .      especially you  mr .  rubin .  i   ve read your mystery stories   i don   t read science fiction exclusively   and i think they   re great .  you   re always so good with motivation .  i thought you could help me out .      rubin was breathing hard and gave every appearance of believing that that breath was flame .  he had made his dinner very much out of rice and salad  plus  out of sheer famishing  two helpings of coupe aux marrons  and he was in no mood for even such sweet reason as he was  on occasion  observed to possess .   he said     let me get it straight  joe college .  you   ve made a bet .  you   re going to get a chance at a girl  or such chance as you can make of it  by writing a story she likes and maybe selling it   and now you want to win the bet and cheat the girl by having me write the story for you .  is that the way it is .         no  sir     said peterborough urgently     that   s not the way it is .  i   ll write it .  i just want help with the motive .         and except for that  you   ll write it     said rubin .     how about having me dictate the story to you .  you can still write it .  you can copy it out in your own handwriting .         that   s not the same at all .         yes it is  young man  and you can stop right there .  either write the story yourself or tell the girl you can   t .      milton peterborough looked about helplessly .   trumbull said     damn it  manny  why so much on the high horse .  i   ve heard you say a million times that ideas are a dime a dozen  that it   s the writing that   s hard .  give him an idea  then  he   ll still have the hard part to do .         i won   t     said rubin  pushing himself away from the table and crossing his arms .     if the rest of you have an atrophied sense of ethics  go ahead and give him ideas   if you know how .      trumbull said     all right  i can settle this by fiat since i   m the host  but i   ll throw it open to a vote .  how many favor helping the kid if we can .      he held up his hand  and so did gonzalo and drake .   avalon cleared his throat a little uncertainly .     i   m afraid i   ve got to side with manny .  it would be cheating the girl     he said .   halsted said     as a teacher  i   ve got to disapprove of outside help on a test .         tie vote     said rubin .     what are you going to do  tom .     trumbull said     we haven   t all voted .  henry is a black widower  and his vote will break the tie .  henry .      henry paused a brief moment .     my honorary position  sir  scarcely gives me the right to  .   .   .         you are not an honorary black widower  henry .  you are a black widower .  decide .      rubin said     remember  henry  you are the epitome of honest men .  where do you stand on cheating a girl .         no electioneering     said trumbull .     go ahead  henry .      henry   s face wrinkled into a rare frown .     i have never laid claim to extraordinary honesty  but if i did  i might treat this as a special case .  juliet told romeo     at lovers    perjuries they say jove laughs .     might we stretch a point .         i   m surprised  henry     said rubin .   henry said     i am perhaps swayed by the fact that i do not view this matter as lying between the young man and the young woman .  rather it lies between a bookish young man and an athlete .  we are all bookish men and  in our time  we may each have lost a young woman to an athlete .  i am embarrassed to say that i have .  surely  then  .   .   .      rubin said     well  i haven   t .  i   ve never lost a girl to      he paused a moment in sudden thought  then said in an altered tone      well  it   s irrelevant .  all right  if i   m outvoted  i   m outvoted .  so what   s the story  peterborough .      peterborough   s face was flushed and there was a trickle of perspiration at one temple .  he said     i won   t tell you any of the story i   ve been planning except the barest essentials of the point i need help on .  i don   t want anything more than the minimum .  i wouldn   t want that even  if this didn   t mean   so much  .   .   .     he ran down .   rubin said  with surprising quietness     go on .  don   t worry about it .  we understand .      peterborough said     thanks .  i appreciate it .  i   ve got two men  call them murderer and victim .  i   ve worked out the way murderer does it and how he gets caught and i won   t say a word about that .  murderer and victim are both eclipse buffs .      avalon interrupted     are you an eclipse buff  mr .  peterborough .         yes  sir  i am .  i have friends who go to every eclipse anywhere in the world even if it   s only a   per center  but i can   t afford that  and don   t have the time .  i go to those i can reach .  i   ve got a telescope and photographic equipment .      avalon said     good .  it helps  when one is going to talk about eclipses  if one knows something about them .  trying to write on a subject concerning which one is ignorant is a sure prescription for failure .      gonzalo said     is the woman you   re interested in an eclipse buff .         no     said peterborough .     i wish she were .         you know     said gonzalo     if she doesn   t share your interests  you might try finding someone who does .      peterborough shook his head .     i don   t think it works that way  mr .  gonzalo .         it sure doesn   t     said trumbull .     shut up  mario  and let him talk .      peterborough said     murderer and victim are both taking eclipse photographs and  against all expectations  victim  who is the underdog  the born loser  takes the better photograph  and murderer  unable to endure this  decides to kill victim .  from there on  i have no trouble .      rubin said     then you have your motive .  what   s your problem .         the trouble is  what kind of a better photograph .  an eclipse photograph is an eclipse photograph .  some are better than others  but  assuming that both photographers are competent  not that much better .  not a murder   s   worth better .      rubin shrugged     you can build the story in such a way as to make even a small difference murderworthy   but i admit that would take an experienced hand .  drop the eclipse .  try something else .         i can   t .  the whole business of the murder  the weapon and the detection  depends on photography and eclipses .  so it has to stay .      drake said softly     what makes it a science   fiction story  young man .         i haven   t explained that  have i .  i   m trying to tell as little as possible about the story .  for what i   m doing  i need advanced computers and science   fictional photographic gimmickry .  one of the two characters   i   m not sure which   takes a photograph of the eclipse from a stratospheric jet           in that case  why not go whole hog .     said gonzalo .     if it   s going to go science   fictional  .   .   .  look  let me tell you how i see it .  murderer and victim are eclipse buffs and murderer is the better man   so make it murderer who   s on that plane  and taking the best eclipse photograph ever seen  using some new photographic gimmick he   s invented .  then have victim  against all expectation  beat him out .  victim goes to the moon and takes the eclipse photograph there .  murderer is furious at being beaten  goes blind with rage  and there you are .      rubin said energetically     an eclipse photo on the moon .         why not .     said gonzalo  offended .     we can get to the moon right now  so we can certainly do it in a science   fiction story .  and there   s a vacuum on the moon  right .  there   s no air .  you don   t have to be a scientist to know that .  and you get a better picture without air .  you get a sharper picture .  isn   t that right  milton .      peterborough said     yes  but .   .   .      rubin overrode him .     mario     he said     listen carefully .  an eclipse of the sun takes place when the moon gets exactly between the sun and the earth .  observers on earth then see the sun blacked out because the opaque body of the moon is squarely in front of it .  we on earth are in the moon   s shadow .  now  if you   re on the moon     his voice grew harsh     how the hell can you be in the moon   s shadow .      avalon said     not so fast  manny  an eclipse is an eclipse   is an eclipse .  there is such a thing as a lunar eclipse  when the earth gets between the sun and the moon .  the moon is in the earth   s shadow in that case  and the whole moon gets dark .      the way i see it  then  is that murderer takes a beautiful photograph of an eclipse on earth  with the moon moving in front of the sun .  he has advanced equipment that he has invented himself so that no one can possibly take a better photo of the moon in front of the sun .  victim  however  goes him one better by taking an even more impressive photograph of an eclipse on the moon  where  as mario says  there is no air  with the earth moving in front of the sun .      peterborough mumbled     not the same thing .         it sure isn   t     said halsted  who had pushed his coffee cup to one side and was doing some quick figuring .     as seen from earth  the moon and the sun have the same apparent width  almost exactly .  pure coincidence  of course  no astronomical necessity at all .  in fact  aeons past  the moon was closer and appeared larger  and aeons future  the moon will be   well  never mind .  the fact is that the earth is larger than the moon  and from the moon you see the earth at the same distance that you see the moon when you   re standing on earth .  the earth in the moon   s sky is therefore as much larger than the moon in appearance as it is in actuality .  do you get that .         no     said gonzalo flatly .   halsted looked annoyed .     well  then  don   t get it .  take my word for it .  the earth in the moon   s sky is about   .    times as wide in appearance as the moon is in the earth   s sky .  that means the earth in the moon   s sky is also that much bigger than the sun  because the sun looks just the same from the moon as from the earth .         so what   s the difference .     said gonzalo .     if the earth is bigger  it gets in the way of the sun that much better .         no     said halsted .     the whole point about the eclipse is that the moon just fits over the sun .  it hides the bright circle of the gleaming sun and allows its corona   that is  its upper atmosphere   to shine all about the hidden sun .  the corona gleams out in every direction with the light of the full moon and does so in beautifully delicate curves and streamers .      on the other hand  if you get a large body like the earth in front of the sun  it covers up the shining sphere and the corona as well .  you don   t see anything .      avalon said     that   s assuming the earth goes squarely in front of the sun .  when you see the eclipse before or after midpoint  at least part of the corona will stick beyond the earth   s sphere .      peterborough said     part isn   t the whole .  it wouldn   t be the same thing .      there was a short silence and then drake said     i hope you don   t mind if a fellow chemist tries his hand at this  young man .  i   m trying to picture the earth in the sky  getting in the way of the sun .  and if we do that  then there   s this to consider  the earth has an atmosphere and the moon has not .      when the moon moves in front of the sun  as viewed from the earth  the moon   s surface is sharp against the sun .  when the earth moves in front of the sun  as viewed from the moon  the earth   s boundary is fuzzy and the sun shines through earth   s atmosphere .  does that make a difference that you can use in the story .         well     said peterborough     i   ve thought of that  actually .  even when the sun is completely behind the earth  its light is refracted through the earth   s atmosphere on every side  and a red   orange light penetrates it and reaches the moon .  it   s as though the moon can see a sunset all around the earth .  and that   s not just theory .  when there   s a total eclipse of the moon  you can usually see the moon as a dull brick   red circle of light .  it gleams in earth   s sunset atmosphere .      as the eclipse  as viewed from the moon  progresses  that side of the atmosphere that has just passed over the sun is brighter  but grows gradually dimmer while the other side grows brighter .  at eclipse midpoint  if you are viewing it from a part of the moon that sees both earth and sun centered with respect to each other  the red   orange ring is evenly bright all the way around   assuming there isn   t too much in the way of clouds in earth   s atmosphere at the time .      drake said     well  for god   s sake  isn   t that a sufficiently spectacular sight for victim to photograph .  the earth would be a black hole in the sky  with a thin orange rim all around .  it would be  .   .   .         no  sir     said peterborough .     it isn   t the same thing .  it   s too dull .  it would be just a red   orange ring .  once the photograph is taken the first time  that would be it .  it wouldn   t be like the infinitely varying corona .      trumbull said     let me try .  you want the corona visible all around  is that it  milton .         yes  sir .         stop me if i   m wrong  but in my reading  i   ve been given to understand that the sky is blue because light is scattered by the atmosphere .  on the moon  where there is no atmosphere  the sky is black .  the stars  which on earth are washed out by the scattered light of our blue sky  would not be washed out in the moon   s airless sky .  they would be visible .         yes  though i suspect the sun   s glare would make them hard to see .      trumbull said     that   s not important .  all you would have to do is cut an opaque circle of metal and hold it up in the air at the proper distance from your photographic equipment in order to just block out the sun   s blazing disc .  you can   t do that on earth  because even if you blocked out the sun  the scattered light of the sky obscures the corona .  on the moon  there   s no scattered light in the sky and the corona would shine out .      peterborough said     in theory  that   s possible .  in fact  it can even be done on earth on mountaintops  making use of a coronagraph .  it still wouldn   t be the real thing  though  for it   s not just a matter of light scattered by the atmosphere .  there   s light scattered and reflected by the ground .      the lunar surface would be very brightly lit up and light would be coming in from every angle .  the photographs you would take would not be good ones .  you see  the reason the moon does the good job it does here on earth is that its shadow doesn   t just fall on the telescope and camera .  it falls on all the surrounding landscape .  the shadow of the moon can  under ideal conditions  be     miles wide and cover        square miles of the earth   s surface .  usually  it   s considerably smaller than that  but generally it   s enough to cover the immediate landscape   that is  if it happens to be a total eclipse .      trumbull said     a bigger opaque object  then  .   .   .         it would have to be quite big and quite far away     said peterborough     to achieve the effect .  that would be too cumbersome .      halsted said     wait  i think i have it .  you would need something big for the purpose  all right .  suppose there were spherical space settlements in the moon   s orbit .  if victim is in a spaceship and gets the space settlement between himself and the sun  that would be exactly what he wants .  he could arrange to be close enough to have the shadow   which  of course  is conical and narrows to a point if you get tar enough away   to be just thick enough to enclose his entire ship .  there would be no world surface to reflect light  and there you are .      peterborough said uneasily     i hadn   t thought of that .  it   s possible .      halsted grinned  and a flush of pleasure mounted to the hairline he had once had .     that   s it  then .      peterborough said     i don   t want to be troublesome  but   but if we introduce the space motif  it   s going to create some problems in the rest of the story .  it   s sort of important that everything stay on or near the earth and yet that there be something so startling and unexpected that it would  .   .   .      he paused and rubin completed the sentence for him     so startling and unexpected that it would drive murderer to rage and vengeance .         yes .         well     said rubin     since i   m the master of mystery here  i think i can  work it out for you without leaving earth very far behind  just as soon as i get some points straightened out .  you said that murderer is taking thephotographs from a plane .  why .         oh .  that   s because the moon   s shadow  when it falls on earth  moves quickly   up to       miles an hour or about   .   mile a second .  if you   re standing in one place on earth  the longest possible duration of a total eclipse is   minutes and then the shadow has moved beyond you .  that   s when the earth is as deep into the moon   s shadow as it ever gets .  when the earth isn   t as deep in and is nearer the final point of the shadow  the total eclipse may last only a couple of minutes  or even only a few seconds .  in fact  more than half the time  the moon   s shadow during an eclipse doesn   t reach the earth   s surface at all  and when the moon is squarely in front of the sun  the sun overlaps it on all sides .  that   s an    annular eclipse     and enough sunlight then slips past the moon to wash out everything .  an annular eclipse is no good at all .         but in the airplane .     prompted rubin .      in an airplane  you can race along with the shadow and make the total eclipse last for an hour or more even if it would only endure a very short time on one position on earth .  you have a great deal more time to take photographs and make scientific observations .  that   s not science   fictional  it   s done right now .         can you take very good pictures from the plane .     asked rubin .     does it allow a steady enough basis for photography .         in my story     said peterborough     i   ve got a computer guiding the plane  allowing for wind movements  and keeping it perfectly steady .  that   s one of the places where the science fiction comes in .         still  the moon   s shadow eventually leaves the earth   s surface altogether  doesn   t it .         yes  the eclipse track covers a fixed portion of the earth   s surface  and it has an overall starting point and an overall ending point .         exactly     said rubin .     now  murderer is confident that his photographs taken from the stratosphere are going to include the best views of an eclipse ever seen  but he doesn   t count on victim   s having a spaceship .  don   t worry  there   s no need to leave earth very far .  it   s just that the spaceship follows the moon   s shadow after it leaves the earth .  victim has a still longer chance to take photographs  a steadier base  and no atmospheric interference whatever .  murderer is hoist on his own petard  for he sees that poor simp  victim  do exactly what he does but go him one better .  he snaps and becomes a killer .      gonzalo waved both arms in the air in excitement .     wait .  wait .  we can do even better than that .  listen  what about that annular eclipse you mentioned a while ago .  you said the shadow doesn   t reach the earth .         it doesn   t reach the surface .  that   s right .         how high off the surface is it .         that depends .  under extreme conditions  the end point of the shadow could miss the earth by hundreds of miles .         yes     said gonzalo     but could that end point miss earth by  say  ten miles .         oh sure .         would it still be annular  and no good .         that   s right     said peterborough .     the moon would come just barely short of covering the sun .  there would be just the thinnest sliver of sun around the moon  and that would give enough light to spoil things .  if you took photographs  you   d miss the prominences  the flares  and the corona .         but what if you went ten miles up into the atmosphere .     said gonzalo .     then you   d see it total  wouldn   t you .         if you were in the right spot  yes .         there it is  then .  one of those annular eclipses comes along  and murderer thinks he   ll pull a fast one .  he gets into his stratoplane  goes ten miles up to get into the point of the shadow or just over it  and follows it along .  he   s going to make a total eclipse out of an annular one   and victim  the usual loser  does the same thing  except he uses a spaceship and follows it out into space and gets better pictures .  what can get old murderer more torn up than having him play his ace   and getting trumped .      avalon nodded his head .     good  mario .  that is an improvement .      rubin looked as if he had unexpectedly bitten into a lemon .     i hate to say it  mario  .   .   .         you don   t have to say it  manny     said gonzalo .     i see it all over you .  there you are  kid .  write the story .      peterborough said  with a sigh     yes  i suppose that is the best that can be done .         you don   t sound overjoyed     said gonzalo .      i was hoping for something more   uh   outrageous  but i don   t think it exists .  if none of you could think up anything .  .  .         may i interrupt  sir .     said henry .      huh .  oh   no  i don   t want any more coffee  waiter     said peterborough  absently .      no  sir .  i mean concerning the eclipse .      trumbull said     henry   s a member of the club  milton .  he broke the ice on the matter of the discussion .  remember .      peterborough put a hand to his forehead .     oh sure .  ask away   uh   henry .         actually  sir  would the photographs be that much better in a vacuum than in the thin air of the stratosphere .  would the difference in quality be enough to result in murder  unless murderer was a close approach to a homicidal maniac .         that   s the thing     said peterborough  nodding .     that   s what bothers me .  that   s why i keep saying i need a motive .  these differences in quality of photos aren   t big enough .         let us consider  then     said henry     mr .  rubin   s dictum that in telling a story one should look backward .         i know the ending     said peterborough .     i have the backward look .         i mean it in another sense   that of deliberately looking in the other direction  the unaccustomed direction .  in an eclipse  we always look at the moon   just the moon in a lunar eclipse  and the moon covering the sun in a solar eclipse   and that   s what we take photographs of .  what if we take a backward look at the earth .         what   s to see on the earth  henry .     asked gonzalo .      when the moon moves into the earth   s shadow  it is always in the full phase and it is usually completely darkened .  what happens to the earth when it moves into the moon   s shadow .  it certainly doesn   t darken completely .         no     said peterborough emphatically .     the moon   s shadow is thinner and shorter than the earth   s  and the earth itself is larger than the moon .  even when earth passes as deeply as it can into the moon   s shadow  only a tiny bit of the earth is darkened  a little dot of darkness that makes up  at most  about one six   hundredth of the earth   s circle of light .         could you see it from the moon .     asked henry .      if you knew where to look and especially if you had a good pair of binoculars .  you would see it start small  move west of east across the face of the earth  getting bigger  then smaller  and then vanish .  interesting  but certainly not spectacular .         not from the moon  sir     said henry .     now suppose we reverse the role of the characters .  it is victim who has the airplane and who can get a photograph from the stratosphere .  it is murderer who intends to trump his opponent   s ace by taking a better photograph from space   a marginally better photograph .  suppose  though  that victim  against all expectations  from his airplane overtrumps murderer in his spaceship .      avalon said     how can he do that  henry .         victim  in his plane  suddenly realizes he needn   t look at the moon .  he looks backward at the ground and sees the moon   s shadow racing toward him .  the moon   s shadow is just a dark dot when seen from the moon  it   s just the coming of temporary night as seen from the earth   s surface   but from a plane in the stratosphere  it is a racing circle of darkness moving at       miles an hour  swallowing up the land and sea   and clouds  for that matter   as it goes .  the plane can move ahead of it  and it is no longer necessary to take single snapshots .  a movie camera can produce the most dramatic film .  in this way  murderer  having fully expected to outdo victim  finds that victim has captured world attention even though he had only an airplane to murderer   s spaceship .      gonzalo broke into loud applause and trumbull said     right on .     even rubin smiled and nodded .   as for peterborough  he fired up at once  saying     sure .  and the approaching shadow would have a thin red rim  for at the moment the shadow overtakes you  the red prominences cast their light unmasked by the sun   s white light .  that   s it  henry .  the backward look does it .  if i write this one properly  i don   t care even if it doesn   t sell .  i won   t care even     his voice shook     if   uh   she doesn   t like it and doesn   t go out with me .  the story is more important .      henry smiled gently and said     i   m glad to hear that  sir .  a writer should always have a proper sense of priorities .         the backward look      afterword  george scithers  the clever and efficient editor of iasfm  who won the hugo as best editor in the      world science fiction convention after having edited only seven issues of the magazine   a speedy and well   deserved appreciation   decided that    the missing item    had gone over well with the readers .  he therefore asked me for another black widowers item relating to science fiction .   i complied with    the backward look     which appeared in the september      iasfm .   in its second year of existence  iasfm rose to bimonthly appearances  and in its third year  it became a monthly .    in this story  by the way  i have someone refer to isaac asimov as a well   known science   fiction writer  and manny rubin  as always  reacts with a certain impatience at having asimov termed a friend of his .  i do this every once in a long while  and it is a trap door spiders in   joke .   this is self   indulgence  of course  but the bond between myself and my gentle readers is a close and friendly one and i like to think they won   t mind an occasional self   indulgence on my part .  this time  i made the in   joke a degree of magnitude sharper by bringing in lester del rey and having him described as    well  he   s no isaac asimov  but he   s all right .      naturally  i wait  in some apprehension  for lester to decide on a suitable riposte .  the fact is that lester and i are very good friends and have been so for nearly forty years .  it   s just that we   ve been baiting each other for nearly forty years  too .      .  what time is it .   the monthly banquet of the black widowers had proceeded its usually noisy course and then  over the coffee  there had fallen an unaccustomed quiet .   geoffrey avalon sipped at his coffee thoughtfully and said     it   s the little things   the little things .  i know a couple who might have been happily married forever .  he was a lay reader at an episcopalian church and she was an unreformed atheist  and they never gave each other a cross look over that .  but he liked dinner at six and she liked it at seven  and that split them apart .      emmanuel rubin looked up owlishly from his part of the table  eyes unblinking behind thick lenses  and said     what   s    big    and what   s    little     geoff .  every difference is a little difference if you   re not involved .  there   s nothing like a difference in the time sense to reduce you to quivering rage .      mario gonzalo looked complacently at the high polish on his shoes and said     ogden nash once wrote that some people like to sleep with the window closed and some with the window open and each other is whom they marry .      since it was rather unusual that at any black widowers banquet three successive comments should be made without an explosive contradiction  it didn   t really surprise anyone when thomas trumbull furrowed his brows and said     that   s a lot of horsehair .  when a marriage breaks up  the trivial reason is never the reason .      avalon said mildly     i know the couple  tom .  it   s my brother and sister   in   law   or ex   sister   in   law .         i   m not arguing that they don   t say they   ve split over a triviality  or even that they don   t believe it     said trumbull .     i just say there   s something deeper .  if a couple are sexually compatible  if there are no money problems  if there is no grave difference in beliefs or attitudes  then they   ll stick together .  if any of these things fail  then the marriage sours and the couple begin to chafe at trivialities .  the trivialities then get blamed   but that   s not so .      roger halsted  who had been chasing the last of the apple pie about his plate  now cleansed his mouth of its slight stickiness with a sip of black coffee and said     how do you intend to prove your statement  tom .         it doesn   t require proof     said trumbull  scowling .     it stands to reason .         only in your view     said halsted  warmly  his high forehead flushing pinkly  as it always did when he was moved .     i once broke up with a young woman i was crazy about because she kept saying    isn   t it a riot .     in and out of season .  i swear she had no other flaw .         you   d be perjuring yourself unconsciously     said trumbull .     listen  jim  call a vote .      james drake  host for the evening  stubbed out his cigarette and looked amused .  his small eyes  nested in finely wrinkled skin  darted around the table and said     you   ll lose  tom .         i don   t care if i win or lose     said trumbull     i just want to see how many jackasses there are at the table .         the usual number  i suppose     said drake .     all those who agree with tom raise their hands .      trumbull   s arm shot up and was the only one to do so .     i   m not surprised     he said  after a brief look  left and right .     how about you  henry .  are you voting .      henry  the unparalleled waiter at all the black widower banquets  smiled paternally     actually  i was not  mr .  trumbull  but it i had voted  i would have taken the liberty of disagreeing with you .     he was passing about the table  distributing the brandy .      you  too  brutus .     said trumbull .   rubin finished his coffee and put the cup down with a clatter .     what the devil  all differences are trivial .  forms of life that are incredibly different superficially are all but identical on the biochemical level .  there seems a world of difference between the worm and the earth it burrows in  but  considering the atoms that make it up  both of them  .   .   .      trumbull said     don   t wax poetical  manny  or  if you must  wax it in your garage and not here .  i suspect jackassery is universal but  just to make sure  i   ll ask our guest if he is voting .      drake said     let   s make that part of the grilling then .  it   s time .  and you can do the grilling  tom .      the guest was barry levine  a small man  dark   haired  dark   eyed  slim  and nattily dressed .  he was not exactly handsome  but he had a cheerful expression that was a good substitute .  gonzalo had already sketched his caricature  exaggerating the good cheer into inanity  and henry had placed it on the wall to join the rest .   trumbull said     mr .  levine  it is our custom at these gatherings of ours to ask our guest  to begin with  to justify his existence .  i shall dispense with that since i will assume that your reason for existence at the moment is to back me up  if you can  in my statement   self   evident  to my way of thinking   that trivialities are trivial .      levine smiled and said  in a slightly nasal voice     trivialities on the human level  or are we talking about earthworms .         we are talking about humans  if we omit manny .         in that case  i join the jackassery  since  in my occupation  i am concerned almost exclusively with trivia .         and your occupation  please .         i   m the kind of lawyer  mr .  trumbull  who makes his living by arguing with witnesses and with other lawyers in front of a judge and jury .  and that immerses me in triviality .      trumbull growled     you consider justice a triviality  do you .         i do not     said levine  with equanimity     but that is not with what we are directly concerned in the courtroom .  in the courtroom  we play games .  we attempt to make favorable testimony admissible and unfavorable testimony inadmissible .  we play with the rules of questioning and cross   examination .  we try to manipulate the choosing of favorable jurors  and then we manipulate the thoughts and emotions of the jurors we do get .  we try to play on the prejudices and tendencies of the judge as we know them to be at the start or as we discover them to be in the course of the trial .  we try to block the opposition attorney or  if that is not possible  to maneuver him into overplaying his hand .  we do all this with the trivia and minutiae of precedence and rationale .      trumbull   s tone did not soften .     and where in all this litany of judicial recreation does justice come in .      levine said     centuries of experience with our anglo   american system of jurisprudence has convinced us that in the long run and on the whole  justice is served .  in the short run  and in a given specific case  however  it may very well not be .  this can   t be helped .  to change the rules of the game to prevent injustice in a particular case may  and probably will  insure a greater level of injustice on the whole   though once in a while an overall change for the better can be carried through .         in other words     interposed rubin     you despair of universal justice even as a goal of the legal profession .         as an attainable goal  yes     said levine .     in heaven  there may be perfect justice  on earth  never .      trumbull said     i take it  then  that if you are engaged in a particular case  you are not the least interested in justice .      levine   s eyebrows shot upward .     where have i said that .  of course i am interested in justice .  the immediate service to justice is seeing to it that my client gets the best and most efficient defense that i can give him  not merely because he deserves it  but also because american jurisprudence demands it  and because he is deprived of it at your peril  for you may be next .      nor is it relevant whether he is guilty or innocent  for he is legally innocent in every case until he is proven guilty according to law  rigorously applied .  whether the accused is morally or ethically innocent is a much more difficult question  and one with which i am not primarily concerned .  i am secondarily concerned with it  of course  and try as i might  there will be times when i cannot do my full duty as a lawyer out of a feeling of revulsion toward my client .  it is then my duty to advise him to obtain another lawyer .      still  if i were to secure the acquittal of a man i considered a scoundrel  the pain would not be as intense as that of failing to secure the acquittal of a man who  in my opinion  was wrongfully accused .  since i can rarely feel certain whether a man is wrongfully accused or is a scoundrel past redemption  it benefits both justice and my conscience to work for everyone as hard as i can  within the bounds of ethical legal behavior .      gonzalo said     have you ever secured the acquittal of someone you considered a scoundrel .         on a few occasions .  the fault there lay almost always in mistakes made by the prosecution   their illegal collection of evidence  or their slovenly preparation of the case .  nor would i waste pity on them .  they have the full machinery of the law on their side and the boundless public purse .  if we allow them to convict a scoundrel with less than the most legal of evidence and the tightest of cases simply because we are anxious to see a scoundrel punished  then where will you and i find safety .  we  too  may seem scoundrels through force of circumstance or of prejudice .      gonzalo said     and have you ever failed to secure the acquittal of someone you considered wrongfully accused .     here levine   s face seemed to crumple .  the fierce joy with which he defended his profession was gone and his lower lip seemed to quiver for a moment .     as a matter of fact     he said  softly     i am engaged in a case right now in which my client may well be convicted despite the fact that i consider him wrongfully accused .      drake chuckled and said     i told you they   d get that out of you eventually  barry .     he raised his voice to address the others generally .     i told him not to worry about confidentiality  that everything here was sub rosa .  and i also told him it was just possible we might be able to help him .      avalon stiffened and said in his most stately baritone     do you know any of the details of the case  jim .         no  i don   t .         then how do you know we can help .         i called it a possibility .      avalon shook his head .     i expect that from mario   s enthusiasm  but not from you  jim .      drake raised his hand .     don   t lecture  geoff .  it doesn   t become you .      levine interposed .     don   t quarrel  gentlemen .  i   ll be pleased to accept any help you can offer  and if you can   t  i will be no worse off .  naturally  i want to impress on you the fact that even though confidentiality may be the rule here  it is particularly important in this case .  i rely on that .         you may     said avalon stiffly .   trumbull said     all right  now .  let   s stop this dance and get down to it .  would you give us the details of the case you   re speaking of  mr .  levine .         i will give you the relevant data .  my client is named johnson  which is a name that i would very likely have chosen if i were inventing fictitious names  but it is a real name .  there is a chance that you might have heard of this case  but i rather think you haven   t  for it is not a local case and  if you don   t mind  i will not mention the city in which it occurred  for that is not relevant .      johnson  my client  was in debt to a loan shark  whom he knew   that is  with whom he had enough of a personal relationship to be able to undertake a personal plea for an extension of time .      he went to the hotel room that the loan shark used as his office   a sleazy room in a sleazy hotel that fit his sleazy business .  the shark knew johnson well enough to be willing to see him  and even to affect a kind of spurious bonhomie  but would not grant the extension .  this meant that when johnson went into default he would  at the very least  be beaten up  that his business would be vandalized  that his family  perhaps  would be victimized .      he was desperate   and i am  of course  telling you johnson   s story as he told it to me   but the shark explained quite coolly that if johnson were let off then others would expect the same leniency .  on the other hand  if johnson were made an example of  it would nerve others to pay promptly and perhaps deter some from incurring debts they could not repay .  it was particularly galling to johnson  apparently  that the loan shark waxed virtuous over the necessity of protecting would   be debtors from themselves .      rubin said dryly     i dare say  mr .  levine  that if a loan shark were as articulate as you are  he could make out as good a case for his profession as you could for yours .      levine said  after a momentary pause     i would not be surprised .  in fact  before you bother to point it out  i may as well say that  given the reputation of lawyers with the public  people hearing the defenses of both professions might vote in favor of loan sharks as the more admirable of the two .  i can   t help that  but i still think that if you   re in trouble you had better try a lawyer before you try a loan shark .      to continue  johnson was not at all impressed by the shark   s rationale for trying to extract blood from a stone  then pulverizing the stone for failure to bleed .  he broke down into a rage  screaming out threats he could not fulfill .  in brief  he threatened to kill the shark .      trumbull said     since you   re telling us johnson   s story  i assume he admitted making the threat .         yes  he did     said levine .     i told him at the start  as i tell all my clients  that i could not efficiently help him unless he told me the full truth  even to confessing to a crime .  even after such a confession  i would still be compelled to defend him  and to fight  at worst  for the least punishment to which he might be entitled and  at best  for acquittal on any of several conceivable grounds .      he believed me  i think  and did not hesitate to tell me of the threat  nor did he attempt to palliate or qualify it .  that impressed me  and i am under the strong impression that he has been telling me the truth .  i am old enough in my profession and have suffered the protestations of enough liars to feel confident of the truth when i hear it .  and  as it happens  there is evidence supporting this part of the story  though johnson did not know that at the time and so did not tell the truth merely because he knew it would be useless to lie .      trumbull said     what was the evidence .      levine said     the hotel rooms are not soundproofed and johnson was shrieking at the top of his voice .  a maid heard just about every word and so did a fellow in an adjoining room who was trying to take a nap and who called down to the front desk to complain .      trumbull said     that just means an argument was going on .  what evidence is there that it was johnson who was shrieking .         oh ample     said levine .     the desk clerk also knows johnson  and johnson had stopped at the desk and asked if the shark were in .  the desk clerk called him and sent johnson up   and he saw johnson come down later   and the news of the death threat arrived at the desk between those two periods of time .      nevertheless  the threat was meaningless .  it served  in fact  merely to bleed off johnson   s rage and to deflate him .  he left almost immediately afterward .  i am quite certain that johnson was incapable of killing .      rubin stirred restlessly .  he said     that   s nonsense .  anyone is capable of killing  given a moment of sufficient rage or terror and a weapon at hand .  i presume that after johnson left  the loan shark was found dead with his skull battered in  with a baseball bat  with blood and hair on it  lying on the bed  and you   re going to tell us that you   re sure johnson didn   t do it .      levine held up his glass for what he indicated with his fingers was to be a touch more brandy  smiled his thanks to henry  and said     i have read some of your murder mysteries  mr .  rubin  and i   ve enjoyed them .  i   m sure that in your mysteries such a situation could occur and you   d find ways of demonstrating the suspect to be innocent .  this  however  is not a rubin mystery .  the loan shark was quite alive when johnson left .      rubin said     according to johnson  of course .         and unimpeachable witnesses .  the man who called down said there was someone being murdered in the next room  and the desk clerk sent up the security man at once  for he feared it was his friend being murdered .  the security man was well armed  and though he is not an intellectual type  he is perfectly competent to serve as a witness .  he knocked and called out his identity  whereupon the door opened and revealed the loan shark  whom the security man knew  quite alive   and alone .  johnson had already left  deflated and de   energized .      the man at the desk  brancusi is his name  saw johnson leave a few seconds after the security man had taken the elevator up .  they apparently passed each other in adjoining elevators .  brancusi called out  but johnson merely lifted his hand and hurried out .  he looked white and ill  brancusi says .  that was about a quarter after three  according to brancusi   and according to johnson  as well .      as for the loan shark  he came down shortly after four and sat in the bar for an hour or more .  the bartender  who knew him  testified to that and can satisfactorily enumerate the drinks he had .  at about a quarter after five he left the bar and  presumably  went upstairs .      avalon said     did he drink enough to have become intoxicated .         not according to the bartender .  he was well within his usual limit and showed no signs of being drunk .         did he talk to anyone in particular .         only to the bartender .  and according to the bartender  he left the bar alone .      gonzalo said     that doesn   t mean anything .  he might have met someone in the lobby .  did anyone see him go into the elevator alone .         not as far as we know     said levine .     brancusi didn   t happen to notice  and no one else has admitted to seeing him  or has come forward to volunteer the information .  for that matter  he may have met someone in the elevator or in the corridor outside his room .  we don   t know  and have no evidence to show he wasn   t alone when he went into his room shortly after a quarter after five .      nevertheless  this two   hour period between a quarter after three and a quarter after five is highly significant .  the security guard who encountered the loan shark immediately after johnson had left at a quarter after three  found the shark composed and rather amused at the fuss .  just a small argument  he said  nothing important .  then  too  the barman insists that the loan shark   s conversation and attitude throughout his time in the bar was normal and unremarkable .  he made no reference to threats or arguments .      halsted said     would you have expected him to .         perhaps not     said levine     but it is still significant .  after all  he knew johnson .  he knew the man to be both physically and emotionally a weakling .  he had no fear of being attacked by him  or any doubt that he could easily handle him if he did attack .      after all  he had agreed to see him without taking the precaution of having a bodyguard present  even though he knew johnson would be desperate .  he was not even temporarily disturbed by johnson   s outburst and shrugged it off to the guard .  during that entire two   hour interval he acted as though he considered my client harmless and i would certainly make that point to the jury .      avalon shook his head .     maybe so  but if your story is going to have any point at all  the loan shark  you will tell us  met with a violent death .  and if so  the man who made the threat is going to be suspected of the murder .  even if the loan shark was certain that johnson was harmless  that means nothing .  the loan shark may simply have made an egregious error .      levine sighed .     the shark did die .  he returned to his room at a quarter after five or a minute or two later and  i suspect  found a burglar in action .  the loan shark had a goodish supply of cash in the room   necessary for his business   and the hotel was not immune to burglaries .  the loan shark grappled with the intruder and was killed before half past five .      trumbull said     and the evidence .         the man in the adjoining room who had been trying to take a nap two hours before had seethed sufficiently to have been unable to fall asleep until about five and then  having finally dropped off  he was roused again by loud noises .  he called down to the desk in a rage  and informed brancusi that this time he had called the police directly .      gonzalo said     did he hear the same voice he had heard before .         i doubt that any voice identification he would try to make would stand up in court     said levine .     however  he didn   t claim to have heard voices .  only the noises of furniture banging  glass breaking  and so on .      brancusi sent up the security guard who  getting no answer to his knock and call this time  used his passkey at just about half past five and found the loan shark strangled  the room in wild disorder  and the window open .  the window opened on a neighboring roof two stories lower .  an experienced cat burglar could have made it down without trouble and might well have been unobserved .      the police arrived soon after  at about twenty to six .      trumbull said     the police  i take it  do not buy the theory that the murder was committed by a burglar .         no .  they could detect no signs on the wall or roof outside the window to indicate the recent passage of a burglar .  instead  having discovered upon inquiry of the earlier incident from the man who had called them  they scorn the possibility of coincidence and feel that johnson made his way to the room a second time  attacked and strangled the loan shark  knocking the furniture about in the process  then opened the window to make it look as though an intruder had done the job  hastened out of the door  missing the security man by moments  and passing him on the elevator again .      trumbull said     don   t you believe that   s possible .         oh anything   s possible     said levine  coolly     but it is not the job of the prosecutor to show it   s possible .  he has to show it   s actually so beyond a reasonable doubt .  the fact that the police saw nothing on the walls or roof is of no significance whatever .  they may not have looked hard enough .  a negative never impresses either judge or jury   and shouldn   t .  and threats at a quarter after three have nothing to do with an act at twenty after five or so unless the man who made the threat at the former time can be firmly placed on the scene at the later time .      gonzalo was balancing his chair on its back legs with his hands gripping the table .     so what   s the problem .         the problem is  mr .  gonzalo     said levine     that johnson was placed on the scene of the crime at about the time of the killing .      gonzalo brought his chair forward with a clatter .     with good evidence .         the best     said levine .     he admits it .  here is what happened  in the two hours after he had left the loan shark  johnson hurriedly scraped up every bit of money he had  borrowed small sums from several friends  made a visit to a pawnshop  and had raised something like a third of what he owed .  he then came back to the hotel hoping for as long an extension as possible through payment of this part sum .  he had little hope of success  but he had to try .      he arrived at the hotel at about a quarter to six  after the murder had been committed  and he noted a police squad car at the curb outside the hotel .  except for noticing its existence  he paid it little attention .  he had only one thing on his mind .      he headed straight for the elevator  which happened to be at the lobby with its door open .  as he stepped out of it at the loan shark   s floor  he saw a policeman at the door of the room he was heading for .  almost instinctively  he ducked back into the elevator and pushed the lobby button .  he was the only man in the elevator and there were no calls to higher floors .  the elevator moved downward  stopping at no floors .  when he reached the lobby  he hastened out  went home  and stayed there till the police came for him .      a curl of cigarette smoke hung above drake   s head .  he said     i suppose they learned of the earlier threat and took him in for questioning .         right     said levine .     but they can   t make johnson testify against himself  so how do they show he was on the spot at the time of the murder .         for one thing  brancusi saw him when he was heading for the elevator .  brancusi called out to head him off and prevent him from running into the police .  johnson didn   t hear him and the elevator doors closed behind him before brancusi could do anything else .  brancusi insists  however  that johnson was back down again in two minutes or so and hastened out .  and he is prepared to swear that johnson left at precisely ten minutes to six .   drake said     is brancusi really sure of that .         absolutely .  his shift was over at six o   clock and he was furious at the fact that the murder had not taken place an hour later  when he would have been off duty .  as it was  he was sure he would be needed for questioning and might be kept for hours .  he was therefore unusually aware of the time .  there was an electric clock on the wall to one side of his desk  a nice large one with clear figures that was new and had been recently installed .  it was accurate to the second and he is absolutely certain it said ten to six .      avalon cleared his throat .     in that case  mr .  levine  brancusi backs up johnson   s story and places your client at the scene not at the time of the murder but afterward .      levine said     here is where the trivialities come in .  brancusi is a bad witness .  he has a small stutter  which makes him sound unsure of himself  he has one drooping eyelid  which makes him look hangdog and suspicious  and he has distinct trouble in looking you in the eye .  the jury will be ready to believe him a liar .      second  brancusi is a friend of johnson   s  has known him from childhood  and is still a drinking buddy of the man .  that gives him a motive for lying  and the prosecution is sure to make the most of that .      finally  brancusi may not want to testify at all .  he served six months in jail for a minor offense quite a number of years ago .  he has lived a reasonably exemplary life since and naturally doesn   t want that earlier incident to be made public .  for one thing  it could cost him his job .      rubin said     could the prosecution bring up the matter .  it   s irrelevant  isn   t it .         quite irrelevant  but if the prosecution takes the attitude that it serves to cast a doubt on the reliability of brancusi as a witness  they might slip it past the judge .      rubin said     in that case  if you put neither johnson nor brancusi on the stand  the prosecution would still be stuck with the task of proving that johnson was at the scene at the right time .  they can   t call johnson themselves  and they won   t call brancusi to give his evidence because they then can   t cross   examine him and bring out that jail term .      levine sighed .     there   s another witness .  the man is an accountant named william sandow .  he had stopped at the hotel lobby to buy a small container of breath fresheners  and while he was at the newsstand  he saw johnson pass him  hurrying out of the hotel .  later in the evening  he read about the murder  and called the police to volunteer the information .  his description of the man he saw was a good one and  eventually  he made a positive identification out of a lineup .      sandow said that what drew his attention to the man who passed him was the look of horror and anguish on his face .  of course  he can   t use terms like that on the witness stand  but the prosecution can get him to make factual statements to the effect that johnson was sweating and trembling  and this would give him the air of an escaping murderer .      rubin said     no  it doesn   t .  lots of things could make a man sweat and tremble  and johnson had good reason to do so short of murder .  besides  sandow just bears out the story of brancusi and johnson .      levine shook his head .     no  he doesn   t .  sandow says he happened to catch a glimpse of the time as johnson passed him and swears it was exactly half past five  which is just after the murder was committed but before the police arrived .  if true  that ruins johnson   s story and makes the assumption that he committed the murder a very tempting one .      rubin said     brancusi backs johnson .  it   s one man   s word against another .  you can   t convict on that .         you can     said levine     if the jury believes one man and not the other .  if brancusi is bound to make a bad impression  sandow is bound to make a good one .  he is open   faced  clean   cut  has a pleasant voice  and exudes efficiency and honesty .  the mere fact that he is an accountant gives him an impression of exactness .  and whereas brancusi is a friend of johnson and therefore suspect  sandow is a complete outsider with no reason to lie .      rubin said     how sure are you of that .  he was very ready to volunteer information and get involved .  does he have some secret grudge against johnson .  or some connection with the loan shark .      levine shrugged his shoulders .     there are such things as public   spirited citizens  even today .  the fact that he came forward will be in his favor with the jury .  naturally  my office has investigated sandow   s background .  we   ve turned up nothing we can use against him   at least so far .      there was a short silence around the table  and then finally rubin said     honest people make mistakes  too .  sandow says he just happened to catch a glimpse of the time .  just how did that happen .  he just happened to glance at his wristwatch .  why .  brancusi had a good reason to watch the clock .  what was sandow   s .         he does not claim to have looked at his watch .  he caught a glimpse of the same wall clock that brancusi looked at .  presumably both brancusi and sandow were looking at the same clock at the same moment .  the same clock couldn   t very well tell half past five to one person and ten to six to another at the same time .  clearly  one person is lying or mistaken  and the jury will believe sandow .      rubin said     brancusi was staring at the clock .  sandow just caught a glimpse .  he may have caught the wrong glimpse .      levine said     i have considered stressing that point  but i am not sure i ought to .  sandow   s statement that he just happened to catch a glimpse sounds honest  somehow .  the mere fact that he doesn   t claim to see more than he saw  that he doesn   t make an undue effort to strengthen his evidence  makes him ring true .  and he   s an accountant .  he says he   s used to figures  that he can   t help noticing and remembering them .  the prosecution will surely have him say that on the stand  and the jury will surely accept that .      on the other hand  mr .  rubin  if i try to balance sandow   s cool certainty by having brancusi become very  very definite and emotional about how certain he is it was ten to six  then he will carry all the less conviction for he will impress the jury as someone who is desperately trying to support a lie .  and if it looks as though he is making a good impression  the prosecution will make a major effort to bring out his previous prison record .      halsted broke in with sudden animation .     say  could sandow see the clock from where he says he was standing at the newsstand .      levine said     a good point .  we checked that out at once and the answer is  yes  he could .  easily .      there was another silence around the table  a rather long one .   trumbull finally said     let   s put it as briefly as we can .  you are convinced that johnson is innocent and that brancusi is telling the truth .  you are also convinced that sandow is either lying or mistaken  but you can   t think of any reason he might be or any way of showing he is .  and the jury is going to believe sandow and convict johnson .      levine said  that   s about it .      rubin said     of course  juries are unpredictable .         yes  indeed     said levine     but if that   s my only hope  it isn   t much of one .  i would like better .      avalon   s fingers were drumming noiselessly on the tablecloth .  he said     i   m a patent lawyer myself  and i have just about no courtroom experience .  still  all you need do is cast a reasonable doubt .  can   t you point out that a man   s liberty rests on a mere glimpse of a clock .         i can  and will try just as hard as i can short of pushing the prosecution into attempting to uncover brancusi   s prison record .  i would like something better than that  too .      from the sideboard  henry   s voice sounded suddenly .     if you   ll excuse me  mr .  levine   i assume that the clock in question  the one to which both mr .  brancusi and mr .  sandow referred  is a digital clock .      levine frowned .     yes  it is .  i didn   t say it was  did i .  how did you know .     his momentary confusion cleared  and he smiled .     well  of course .  no mystery .  i said it was a new clock  and these days digital clocks are becoming so popular that it is reasonable to suppose that any new clock would be digital .         i   m sure that is so     said henry     but that was not the reason for my conclusion .  you said a few moments ago that mr .  sandow was an accountant and that accountants couldn   t help but notice and remember figures .  of course you don   t notice and remember figures on an ordinary dial clock   you remember the position of the hands .  on a dial clock it is just as easy to tell time when the hour numbers are replaced with dots or with nothing at all .         well  then .     said levine .      almost any grown person of reasonable intelligence can tell time at a glance in that way .  accountants have no special advantage .  a digital clock is different .      levine said     since it was a digital clock  then accountants do have a special advantage .  you   re not helping me  henry .      henry said     i think i am .  you have been unconsciously misleading us  mr .  levine  by giving the time in the old   fashioned way appropriate to a dial clock .  you speak of a quarter after three and a quarter to six and so on .  digital clocks specifically show such times to be three   fifteen and five forty   five .  as digital clocks become more and more universal  times will be i spoken of in this way exclusively  i imagine .      levine seemed a little impatient .     how does this change anything  henry .      henry said     your statement was that brancusi was certain that the time at the crucial moment was ten to six  while sandow was certain it was half past five .  if this were so  and if a dial clock were involved  the position of the hands at the two times would be widely different and neither could make a mistake .  a deliberate lie by one or the other would have to be involved .      on the other hand  if it is a digital clock  brancusi claims he read five   fifty and sandow claims he read five   thirty  you see .      levine said     ah  and you think that sandow misread the figure five for a three .  no good  it could be maintained with equal justice that brancusi mistook the three for a five in his annoyance over the fact that the end of his shift was approaching .      henry said     it is not a question of a mistake that anyone could make .  it is a mistake that an accountant particularly might make .  there are fifty cents to half a dollar but thirty minutes to half an hour  and an accountant above all is apt to think of figures in terms of money .  to an accountant five   fifty is most likely to mean five and a half dollars .  a quick glimpse at a digital clock reading five   fifty might trigger the response five and a half in an accountant   s mind  and he will later swear he had seen the time as half past five .      avalon looked astonished .     you really think mr .  sandow could have made that mistake  henry .      but it was levine who answered jubilantly     of course .  it   s the only way of explaining how two people could read the same clock at the same time and honestly come up with two different answers .  besides  there   s the reasonable doubt .  suppose i set up a screen on which i can flash numbers on the pretext that i have to test sandow   s eyesight and memory of numbers  and ask him to detect and identify numbers flashed only briefly on the screen .  if i show him five   fifty with a dollar sign before it  he will be bound to say     five and a half dollars .         gonzalo said     he might say    five   fifty    or something like that .         it he does  i   ll ask him if he means five hundred and fifty dollars or five and a half dollars   after all  does he or does he not see the decimal point .    and he will be sure to say five and a half dollars .  he will then repeat that with five   fifty written in other printing styles and with the dollar sign left out .  finally  when i flash the image of a digital clock reading five   fifty and ask whether that is five and a half or ten to six  he won   t even have to answer .  the jury will get the point .      levine rose to shake henry   s hand .  thank you .  henry .  i said that cases depend on trivialities  but i never dreamed that this one would rest on something as trivial as the difference between a digital clock and a dial clock .         but     said henry     on that piece of trivia depends the freedom of a man who is presumably wrongfully accused of murder  and that is no triviality at all .         what time is it .       afterword  it was almost with disappointment that i noticed that i had completed ten stories toward the twelve i needed for the third book and had managed to compile only one rejection .  it meant that i would have to refrain from submitting the last two stories for magazine publication and just write them for the book itself .   since i had to do it  i did it   and this one was written at the third mystery   fan meeting at mohonk  which i referred to in the afterword to    irrelevance .      you   ll notice that    what time is it .     involves a murder  as is rarely the case with my black widowers tales .  however  it is not a whodunit  or a howdunit  or a whydunit .  it   s just a matter of explaining a discrepancy   which is what the black widowers is all about .   but at least the black widowers got an innocent man off the hook .      .  middle name  roger halsted looked a bit doleful and said     i almost didn   t get here tonight .      geoffrey avalon looked down at him from his straight   backed seventy   four inches and said     automobile accident .         nothing so dramatic     said halsted .     alice was in one of her feminist moods this afternoon and objected rather strenuously to the fact that the black widowers society is a stag organization .         but she   s known that from the start  hasn   t she .     asked avalon .      of course  and it   s graveled her from the start  too     said halsted .     sometimes it   s worse than other times  that   s all .  and today  well  she may have seen something on tv  read something in the newspapers  had a talk with a friend  or whatever .  anyway  she was upset  and the trouble is  i rather sympathize with her .      emmanuel rubin walked over from the other end of the room  where he had been exchanging insults with mario gonzalo  host at this month   s black widowers banquet .   rubin said     are you talking about your wife  roger .         yes  as a matter of fact .         i could tell by the troubled look on your face .  bad form .  black widowers don   t have wives .         yes .     said halsted sharply .     have you told that to jane .         i mean during the banquets  and you know that   s what i mean .         i   ve heard you mention jane at the banquets and  besides  my own discussion is germane to the banquets .  i would hate to have to give them up .         who can make you .     demanded rubin scornfully  his scanty beard bristling .   halsted said     my own conscience  for one thing .  and it   s not worth breaking up a marriage over .         why should it break up a marriage .     said rubin .     even if we grant equality for women   political  economic  and social   why should that prevent me from spending one evening a month with friends of my own choosing who just happen to be male .      avalon said     you know better than that  manny .  they don   t just happen to be male .  they are forbidden by the rules of the club to be anything but male .         and anything but intelligent     said rubin     and anything but compatible .  if any one of us takes a dislike to anyone proposed for membership  however trivial or even nonexistent the cause of that dislike might be  that potential member can be blackballed .  just one of us can do it  regardless of the wishes of the rest  and we don   t have to explain either .         manny     said avalon     you   re not usually so obtuse .  a woman can   t be blackballed  because she can   t even be proposed for membership .  don   t you see the difference .  whichever one of us is host for the evening can bring any guest he wishes  even one who would be instantly blackballed if he were proposed for membership .  but the guest must be male .  no woman can be brought .  don   t you see the difference .         exactly     said halsted .     if it were a black that we ruled out  or a jew  or an irishman  that would be bigotry and not one of us could live with it .  but since it   s only women  we don   t seem to mind .  what moral blindness .         well  then     said rubin     are you two suggesting that we permit women to join the society .         no     said avalon and halsted in quick and emphatic simultaneity .      then what are we arguing about .      halsted said     i   m just pointing out that we ought to recognize the immorality of it .         you mean as long as we know something is immoral  we are free to be immoral .         of course i don   t     said halsted .     i happen to think that hypocrisy aggravates any sin .  nothing is so male chauvinist as to say     i   m not a male chauvinist  but .   .   .     as i   ve heard manny say .      mario gonzalo joined them and said with clear self   satisfaction     i don   t say     i   m not a male chauvinist  but  .   .   .     i am a male chauvinist .  i expect a woman to take care of me .         that   s just an admission you can   t take care of yourself     said rubin     which is something i   ve always suspected  mario .      gonzalo looked over his shoulder hurriedly in the direction of his guest and then said  in a low voice     listen  keep talking feminism during the dinner  off and on .  it   s a stroke of luck you   ve started on your own .         why .     said avalon in a voice that had not been hushed since its invention .     what dire plot are you  .   .   .         shh     said gonzalo .     i want to draw out my guest .  he   s got something eating him he won   t talk about .  that   s why i brought him .  it could be interesting .         do you know what it is .     asked halsted .      only in a general way  .   .   .     said gonzalo .   henry  whose elegant service at the banquets ennobled the occasion  interrupted in his soft way .     if you don   t mind  mr .  gonzalo  dinner is served .      gonzalo placed his guest immediately to his right and said     has everyone met mr .  washburn now .      there was a general murmur of agreement .  lionel washburn was an almost classically handsome individual with a head of thick  dark hair cut neatly  with black   rimmed glasses  white shirt  dark   blue suit  and shiny black shoes .  he looked dressed up without being uncomfortable .  he did not yet seem to have passed his thirtieth birthday .   he said to gonzalo somberly     is there some argument about whether the organization is to be stag  mario .  i heard  .   .   .         no argument     said gonzalo quickly .     it is stag .  i invited you .  i didn   t suggest you bring a girlfriend .         i don   t have one     said washburn  biting off each word .  then  more normally     how long have you been stag .         from the start  but it   s jim   s story .  jim  my guest would like to hear how the society got its start   if you don   t mind  that is .      james drake smiled and held his cigarette to one side so that he could see the other   s face clearly .     i don   t mind  though i   m sure the others are pretty sick of it .  still   any objections .      thomas trumbull  who was cutting into his rack of lamb  said     plenty of objections  but you go ahead and i   ll attend to the inner man .  henry  if you can scare up an extra helping of mint sauce  i would be infinitely appreciative .  and jim  i would suggest you get our personal book of genesis printed up and handed out at the start of each banquet to the guest .  the rest of us can then be spared .  thank you .  henry .      drake said     now that we have tom out of the way  i   ll go on .  about thirty years ago  i married  but then we all make mistakes  don   t we .  i believe i was fascinated at the time  though i don   t remember why .  my friends  however  were not fascinated .      avalon drew in his breath in a long  rumbling sniff .     we remember why .         i   m sure you do     agreed drake good   humoredly .     as a result  i found myself outcast .  my friends fell away and i couldn   t endure her friends or  after a time  her .  it occurred to ralph ottur  then   he lives in california now  i   m sorry to say   to start a club for the sole purpose of seeing me without my wife .  naturally  this would only work if the club were stag .  so there you are .  we called it the black widowers because black widow spiders are quite apt to devour their mates  and we were determined to survive .      washburn said     and does your wife know the nature of the origin of the club .         she   s not my wife     said drake .     anymore  that is .  i divorced her after seven years .         and were you all members at the start .      drake shook his head .     geoff  tom  and i are charter members .  the others joined later .  some members have died or now live too far away to attend .         but the reason for the men   only character of the club is gone .  why do you  .   .   .         because we want to     said gonzalo quickly .     because i like women in their place and i know exactly where that place is and here isn   t it .         that   s a disgusting statement     said halsted  with the slight stutter that came when he grew emotional .   gonzalo said coolly     you   ve got to say that because you   re married and you   re afraid that if you don   t keep in practice  you   ll let something chauvinistic  so   called  slip in front of your wife and then you   ll be in trouble .  i   m not married so i   m a free man .  my girlfriends know where i stand  and if they don   t like it  they can leave .      avalon said     there   s an uncomfortable don juanism about that statement .  don   t you care if they leave .         sometimes     admitted gonzalo     but i   d care a lot more it they stayed and argued with me .  and there are always others .         disgusting     said halsted again .      the truth usually is     said gonzalo .     why don   t all you highly moral feminists tell me why you don   t want women at these meetings and see if you can make the reason nonchauvinist .      there was an uncomfortable silence about the table  and gonzalo said     henry  you   re a black widower  too  and i   m not letting you escape .  would you like to see women at these meetings .      henry   s face crinkled into a pleasant smile .     no  mr .  gonzalo  i would not .         aha     said gonzalo .     now  you   re an honest man  henry  unlike these black hypocriticers you wait on .  tell me why not .      henry said     like you  mr .  gonzalo  i am not married  but i   m afraid i lack your variegated experience with young women .         what   s that got to do with it .      henry said     i was merely explaining the situation in case my theory on the subject should prove to be childishly foolish to other  more experienced men .  it seems to me that most men during their childhood have had their mothers as their chief authority figures .  even when the father is held up as a mysterious and ogreish dispenser of punishments  it is  in fact  the mother whose outcries  yanks  pushes  and slaps perpetually stand in the way of what we want to do .  and we never recover .      rubin said  in a voice of deep  masculine disdain     come  henry  are you trying to say that men are afraid of women .      henry said     i believe many are .  certainly  many feel a sense of relief and freedom when in the company of men only and feel particularly free when women are not allowed to intrude .  this society originated as a haven from women under the guise of being one from a particular woman .  the particular woman is gone but the haven is still needed and still persists .      avalon said     well  that is at least not an example of outright chauvinism .      and totally untrue     said rubin  his eyes flashing behind the thick lenses that covered them .     how many here are afraid of women .      it was washburn who intervened at this point .  with his handsome face contorted into a mask of fury  he brought his fist down with a smash that rattled the dishes and caused henry to pause in his task of pouring the coffee .   washburn said     you don   t expect anyone to admit it  do you .  your waiter is correct  but he doesn   t go far enough .  of course  we   re afraid of women .  why shouldn   t we be .  they   re man   eaters  cannibals  harpies .  they   re bound by no rules  no canons of sportsmanship .  they   re the ruin of men and of all that is decent and human .  i don   t care if i never see another one in my life .      he paused  drew a deep breath  then passed a hand over his forehead  which had dampened with perspiration and said     pardon me  gentlemen  i did not mean to lose my temper .      trumbull said     but why  .   .   .     and stopped at gonzalo   s raised hand .   gonzalo was grinning in triumph .     later  tom .  it   s almost grilling time and i   ll choose you as inquisitor and you can ask your question .      and  indeed  it was not long before gonzalo began the ritualistic tapping of the water glass as the brandy was being distributed .  he said     it   s up to you  tom .      trumbull frowned ferociously under his white and crisply waved hair and said     i will assume  mr .  washburn  that mario has explained to you that the payment  for what we hope you will agree is a fine dinner and at least partly edifying conversation  is a grilling .  to our questions  you will be expected to answer fully and truthfully  even when that may be embarrassing .  i must assure you that nothing said here ever leaves these four walls .      with that preamble  let me say this .  i am not a judge of masculine pulchritude  mr .  washburn  but it seems to me that women would judge you to be handsome .      washburn flushed and said     i would not try to account for women   s tastes .  still it is true that i have found that i can  on occasion  attract women .         that   s a very modest way of putting it     said trumbull .     does the converse hold as well .  do women attract you .      for a moment  washburn looked puzzled .  then he frowned and said     are you asking me if i am gay .      trumbull shrugged and said in a level voice     in these times  it is a permissible question  and it is even permissible to answer in an open affirmative  if that should happen to be the case .  i ask out of no personal interest  i assure you  but merely out of curiosity over your earlier angry remarks about women as a group .      washburn relaxed .     i see your point .  no  i   m interested in women .  far too interested .  and it was not the sex as a whole that i was really berating .  i was striking out at one .  one woman .  and myself .      trumbull hesitated .     the logical thing     he said     would be to question you  mr .  washburn  concerning this woman who so distresses you .  yet i hesitate .  on the one hand  it is a peculiarly private matter  which i do not wish to probe and  on the other  if you don   t mind my saying so  the details are likely to be peculiarly uninteresting .  i suppose every one of us in our time  .   .   .      avalon interrupted .     if you don   t mind  tom  you are displaying an uncommon combination of delicacy and insensitivity .  i am prepared  with your permission  to take over the grilling .         if you think you can do so  geoff  within the bounds of good taste     said trumbull huffily .   avalon lifted his dense eyebrows to maximum and said     i think highly of you  tom  and yet have never considered you an arbiter of good taste .  mr .  washburn  i have no wish to probe wounds unnecessarily  but let me guess .  your outburst came during a discussion of the pros and cons of feminism .  may we take it  then  that your unhappy experience  whatever it was  involved feminism .      washburn nodded and said     it sure as hell did .         good .  now it may be superfluous to ask this  but was whatever it was that happened something that has happened to many others .  putting aside the great pain it may have caused you and the unique unhappiness you may consider you have felt  would you in your calmer moments think that it might be the common lot of male humanity .      washburn seemed lost in thought  and avalon went on as gently as he could .     after all  millions have been jilted  millions have been sold out  millions have been betrayed by their lovers and their friends .         what happened to me     said washburn  between remarkably white and even teeth     has in a way happened to very many  as you suggest .  i recognize that .  to lose the woman one loves is not so rare .  to be laughed at and humiliated     he swallowed     may be the lot of many .  but in one respect  i have been ill used particularly .  in one respect .      avalon nodded .     very good .  i won   t ask you any leading questions .  just tell us about that one respect .      washburn bent his glance down to his brandy snifter and spoke in a hurried tone of voice .     i fell in love .  it wasn   t the first time .  she was   she was not the most beautiful woman i have ever known   nor the pleasantest .  in fact  we did not get along .  her company was always a maddening bumpy ride in a springless cart down a rough road .  but  oh god  i couldn   t help myself .  i still can   t seem to .  don   t ask me to analyze it .  all i can say is that i was caught  tangled  trapped  and i wanted her .  and i couldn   t get her .      she acted as though she hated me .  she acted as though she wanted me to want her  just so she could show the world i couldn   t have her .      she was a feminist .  her nerve endings stuck out six inches beyond her skin on that subject .  she was successful .  she was a magazine illustrator at the top of her field and commanded high fees .  it wasn   t enough  though .  to make it right for her  i had to fail .      and there was no way i could argue effectively with her .  she won every time .  of course  she was an intellectual and i   m not   though i like to think i   m intelligent .   .   .   .      rubin said     intelligence is the diamond and intellectualism only the facets .  i   ve known many a beautifully faceted rhinestone .  what do you do for a living .      washburn said     i   m a stockbroker .         do you do well .  i mean  as well as your feminist .      washburn flushed .     yes .  and i   ve inherited a rather sizable trust fund .  she seemed to resent that .         let me guess     said rubin dryly .     you make more money with less brains because you   re a man .  you get farther with less deserving because you   re a man .  you probably even inherited the trust fund because you were a man .  your sister would have gotten less .         that   s about it     said washburn .     she said the way i dressed  the way i held myself  everything about me was designed to show my masculine wealth and power .  she said i might as well wear a neon sign saying     i can buy women .         trumbull said     did you ever try to defend yourself .         sure     said washburn     and that meant a fight .  i asked her why  if she thought she should be considered as a human being and as an intellectual  without being penalized for her sex  she insisted on emphasizing her sex .  why didn   t she remove her makeup and meet the world with an unpainted face as men did .  why didn   t she wear less revealing clothes  and accentuate her breasts and hips less .  i said she might as well wear a neon sign saying     i sell for a high price .            she must have loved that     muttered rubin .      you bet she didn   t     said washburn grimly .     she said a masculine society forced that on her in self   defense  and she wouldn   t give up the only weapon they granted her .  i said she needed no weapon with me .  i said i would marry her without enticement or allure  straight out of the shower with wet hair and a pimple on her shoulder if she had one .  and she said     to do what .  to cook your dinner and clean your house for you .     and i said     i have a housekeeper for that .     and she said     of course  another woman .         halsted said     what good would it have done you to marry her .  you would have fought like that every day .  it would have been a purgatory .  why not just walk away from that .         why not .     said washburn .     sure  why not .  why not just kick the heroin habit .  why not just stop breathing if the air gets polluted .  how do i know why not .  it   s not the sort of thing you can reason out .  maybe   maybe   if i had the chance  i could win her over .         you wouldn   t have     said rubin flatly .     she   s a ballbuster  and she   d stay one .      halsted said     that   s a stupid phrase  manny .  it   s part of the routine bigotry of the chauvinist .  a man is ambitious  a woman is unscrupulous .  a man is firm  a woman is stubborn .  a man is witty  a woman is bitchy .  a man is competitive  a woman is abrasive .  a man is a hard   driving leader  a woman is a ballbuster .      rubin said     call it what you want .  say she   s a lily of the valley if you want .  i say her ambition and occupation would have been to make our friend here wish he had never been born  and she would have succeeded .      turning to washburn  he said     i assume from your early outburst  your failure with her was complete .  if so  i congratulate you  and if i knew of a way to help you succeed  i would refuse to give it to you .      washburn shook his head .     no fear .  she   s married someone else   a dumb creep   and the last i   ve heard she is cooking and cleaning house .         did she give up her career .     said avalon in astonishment .      no     said washburn     but she does the other  too .  what i   ll never understand is why him .      trumbull said     there   s no accounting for the nature of attraction .  maybe this other fellow makes her laugh .  maybe he dominates her without bothering to argue the point .  maybe she likes the way he smells .  how can you tell .  how do you account for the way she attracts you .  nothing you   ve said makes her attractive to me .         if she liked him better     said washburn  fuming     why not say so  for whatever reason   or for no reason .  why make it look like a straightforward test .  why humiliate me .         test .     said rubin .     what test .         that   s what i referred to when i said earlier that in one way i had been particularly ill used .  she said she would see if i were the kind of man she could live with .  she dared me to give her a one   syllable middle name to represent what every schoolchild knew   and yet didn   t know .  she implied that she was giving the other fellow the same test .  i knew about him and i didn   t worry about him .  my god  he was a stupid advertising copy writer who shambled about in turtleneck sweaters and drank beer .      avalon said     surely  you couldn   t believe a woman would choose one man over another according to whether he could solve a puzzle .  that happens in fairytales perhaps  otherwise  not .      washburn said     i see that now .  she married him  though .  she said he had the answer .  that idiot passed  she said  and i failed .  not getting her was bad enough  but she arranged to make me lose in a battle of wits to someone i despised   or at least she said i had lost .  it wasn   t a test .  it was nonsense .  suppose you chose a middle name with one syllable   john  charles  ray  george   any one of them .  who   s to say the answer is right or wrong  except her .      if she were going to marry him anyway  she might have done that without going out of her way to make me look foolish in my own eyes .      halsted said     what if the question were a legitimate one .  what if he had gotten the correct answer and you hadn   t .  would that make you feel better .         i suppose so     said washburn     but the more i think of it  the more certain i am that it   s a fake .         let   s see now     said halsted thoughtfully .     we need a one   syllable middle name that every schoolboy knows   and yet doesn   t know .         schoolchild     growled washburn .     schoolboy is chauvinistic .      gonzalo said     go ahead  roger .  you teach school .  what does every schoolchild know   and yet not know .         in my class at the junior high school     said halsted  gloomily     every schoolchild knows he ought to know algebra  and what he doesn   t know is algebra .  if algebra were a one   syllable middle name that would be the answer .      drake said     let   s be systematic .  only people have middle names in the usual meaning of the word  so we can start with that .  if we find a person whom every schoolchild knows   and yet doesn   t know  then that person will have a middle name and that middle name will be the answer .         and if you think that     said washburn     where does it get you .  for one thing  how is it possible to know something or someone   and yet not know .  and if it were possible  then it   s quite impossible that this should be true of only one person .  how would you pick out the correct person .  no  that witch was playing games .         actually     said avalon     middle names are  on the whole  uncommon .  nowadays  everyone gets one  but they were much against the rule in the past  it seems to me .  think of some famous people   george washington  abraham lincoln  napoleon bonaparte  william shakespeare   no middle names in the lot .  the greeks had only one name   socrates  plato  demosthenes  creon .  it limits the field somewhat .      halsted said     there   s robert louis stevenson  franklin delano roosevelt  gustavus adolphus vasa .         who   s gustavus adolphus vasa .     asked gonzalo .      a king of sweden in the early     s     said halsted .   gonzalo said     i suppose every swedish schoolchild would know him  but we should stick to the knowledge of american schoolchildren .         i agree     said avalon .   rubin said thoughtfully     the romans had three names as a matter of course .  julius caesar was really gaius julius caesar .  his assassin  cassius  was gaius cassius longinus .  every american schoolchild would know the names julius caesar and cassius from shakespeare   s play julius caesar  which every american schoolchild is put through .  yet he wouldn   t know the names gaius julius caesar and gaius cassius longinus .  he would think julius was a first name and cassius was a last name  but each would be a middle name .  that would be the sort of thing we   re after .      avalon said     many cultures use patronymics as routine middle names .  every russian has one .  peter i of russia  or peter the great  as he   s usually known  was really peter alexeievich romanov .  every schoolchild knows peter the great and yet doesn   t know his middle name  or even that he has one .      rubin said     there are other possibilities .  some middle names are treated as first names even for americans .  president grover cleveland was really stephen grover cleveland .  he dropped his first name and used his middle name  so every schoolchild knows grover cleveland and doesn   t know stephen grover cleveland .  the same is true for thomas woodrow wilson and john calvin coolidge .      then again  some middle names are lost in pen names .  mark twain was really samuel langhorne clemens  and lewis carroll was really charles lutwidge dodgson .  every schoolchild knows mark twain and lewis carroll but probably doesn   t know langhorne and lutwidge .      washburn said impatiently     pardon me  gentlemen  but what good is all this .  how does it help with the problem .  you can rattle off a million middle names  but which one did that female want .      avalon said solemnly     we are merely outlining the dimensions of the problem  mr .  washburn .         and doing it all wrong     said gonzalo .     look  every middle name i   ve heard from julius to lutwidge has more than one syllable .  why not think of a one   syllable middle name and work backward .  if we want to consider american presidents  we can start with the letter    s .     you can   t be more one   syllable than a single letter .  well  it was harry s truman  and the s was just s and stood for nothing .  every schoolchild has heard of harry s truman  but how many of them know s doesn   t stand for anything .      drake said     for that matter  every schoolchild knows jimmy carter  but his name really is james earl carter  jr .  the schoolchildren don   t know about earl  and that   s one   syllable .      washburn said     you still have a million answers  and you don   t have one .      trumbull suddenly roared out angrily     damn it to hell  gentlemen  you   re leaving out the third and crucial clue .  i   m sitting here waiting for one of you to realize this fact  and you just run around in solemn pedantic circles .         what third clue  tom .     asked avalon quietly .      you need a one   syllable middle name  that   s one .  you need that rigmarole about schoolchildren  that   s two .  and you have the fact that the woman said that the puzzle was intended to indicate whether washburn was a man she could live with .  that   s three .  it means that the puzzle must somehow involve male chauvinism  since the woman is an ardent feminist .  the implication is that a male chauvinist  such as she firmly believes washburn to be  would not get the answer .      rubin said     good lord  tom  you   ve made sense .  what next .  don   t tell me you   ve worked out the answer  too .      trumbull shook his head .     not exactly  but i suggest we confine ourselves to women   s names .  a feminist would argue that many women have played important roles in history but that male chauvinism tends to blot them out .  therefore every schoolchild should know them  but doesn   t .      halsted said     no  tom .  that   s not the clue .  it   s not something every schoolchild should know but doesn   t .  it   s something every schoolchild knows and doesn   t .  that   s different .         besides     said rubin     even if we confine ourselves to women  we have no clear route to the answer .  if we stick to historic feminists  for instance  we have susan brownell anthony  carrie chapman catt  helen gurley brown  gloria steinem  betty friedan   who   s got a one   syllable middle name .      drake said     it needn   t be a feminist .     his little eyes seemed to peer thoughtfully into the middle distance .     it might just be a woman who contributed to history   like the one who wrote uncle tom   s cabin and helped cause the civil war  as lincoln said .         harriet beecher stowe     said rubin impatiently     and beecher has two syllables .         yes     said drake     but i merely mentioned it as an example .  what about the woman who wrote    the battle hymn of the republic     julia ward howe .  how many syllables in ward .      avalon said     how is that something every schoolchild knows and yet doesn   t know .      drake said     every schoolchild knows     mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord    and yet doesn   t know the author  because she   s a woman .  at least that   s what a feminist might claim .      there was a confused outcry of objections  and avalon   s deep voice suddenly rose into an overtopping bellow     how about little women  which was written by louisa may alcott .  which would the answer be  ward or may .      washburn suddenly cut in sharply     neither one .      drake said     why not .  how do you know .      washburn said     because she sent me what she said was the answer when she wrote to say she was married .  and it isn   t either ward or may .      rubin said indignantly     you   ve withheld information  sir .         no  i haven   t     said washburn .     i didn   t have that information when i tried to get the answer  and now that i have it  i still don   t see why .  i think she just chose an answer at random as a continuing part of her intention of making me feel like an idiot .      nor will i give you the solution now  since you   ll be able to dream up a reason once you have the name  and that   s not good .  the point is to be able to get a solution and reason it out without knowing the answer in advance   though she did hand me a feminine name .  i   ll give mr .  trumbull that much .      gonzalo said     if we can reason out the name she gave and tell you what it is and why  will you feel better .      washburn said gloomily     i think so .  at least i might imagine it was a fair test and that i might have had her if i were brighter  and she wasn   t just laughing at me .  but can anyone tell me what the middle name is .     he looked about the table and met six thoughtful stares .   gonzalo said     do you have any ideas on the subject  henry .      the waiter  who was removing the brandy glasses  said  quietly     unless the middle name in question is ann  mr .  gonzalo  i   m afraid i am helpless .      washburn let out an incoherent cry  pushed back his chair with a loud scraping noise  and jumped up .      but it is ann     he cried out .     how did you come to decide on that .  was it a guess or do you have a reason .      he had reached out almost as though he were going to seize henry by his shoulders and shake the answers out of him  but controlled himself with obvious difficulty .   henry said     the gentlemen of the black widowers supplied the pieces  sir .  i needed only to put them together .  mr .  rubin said that a middle name might be hidden by a pseudonym  as in the case of mark twain .  mr .  trumbull pointed out that feminism was involved .  it seemed to me quite possible that at times in history someone who was a woman might hide under a male pseudonym  and i pondered over whether there were such a case in connection with something every schoolchild would know .      surely  one book that schoolchildren have notoriously been required to read for decade after decade has been silas marner .  every schoolchild knows it  and the further fact that it was written by george eliot .  it seemed to me  though  that that was a pseudonym .  i checked it in the encyclopedia on the reference shelf  while the discussion raged  and i found that eliot   s real name is mary ann evans .      washburn said  eyes big with wonder     then it was a fair question .  i   m glad of that .  but do you mean that the jerk she married figured it out .      henry said     he may well have .  i think it would be best for you  sir  to believe that he did .         middle name      afterword  this story was written on a train trip to richmond  virginia  where i was slated to keynote a conference  and during my stay in richmond .   the trap door spiders and  therefore  the black widowers too  are indeed stag organizations .  only men can be members  only men can be guests .  what s more  the trap door spiders actually had their beginnings in the way attributed  in this story  to the black widowers .   stag organizations are  of course  outmoded things in these days .  i cannot speak for the other trap door spiders  but my conscience hurts me over the matter .  janet  fortunately  is a very tolerant woman and is rather foolishly besotted with me so that she is willing to allow me to stay with not only one  but four  stag organizations  since she feels i enjoy them .   well  i do enjoy them and i quiet my conscience by agitating from within in favor of open membership for women as well as men   but so far vainly in every case .      .  to the barest  emmanuel rubin said in a scandalized whisper     he offered to pay for the dinner .     he glanced with owlish ferocity at the guest who was attending that month   s black widowers    banquet .      yes  he did     said mario gonzalo casually .      and i suppose you accepted     said rubin .      no  i didn   t  though i don   t see why he shouldn   t if he wants to .  if someone is anxious to pay for the privilege of dining with us  why not let him .         because we would be selling our freedom of choice  you idiot  and that is without price to the rest of us .  do you think i   m willing to eat with anyone who   ll pick up my check .  i choose my companions .  damn it  mario  if he offered to buy us that should in itself instantly disqualify him as a guest .         well  it doesn   t  so why not calm down  manny  and listen .  i   ve told the others already and saved you for last because i knew you   d rant away .  he got in touch with me .   .   .   .         do you know him .         no  but he introduced himself .  he   s matthew parcis  and he   s a lawyer .  he knew of the black widowers .  he knew i was to be the next host and he wanted to see us professionally  all of us .  he asked to join us at our banquet and offered to pay if that would help .  he seemed like an interesting guy  so why not .      rubin said discontentedly     why should professional matters intrude on the banquet .  what does he want to do  serve us with summonses .         no     said gonzalo with an affectation of eye   rolling impatience .     he represents ralph ottur .  we still send ralph invitations  and that   s how this guy  parris  knew i was the next host .  he got in touch with me at ralph   s instructions .  i suppose you remember ralph .      rubin   s eyes flashed behind his thick   lensed glasses .     of course i remember him .  i   m surprised you do .  i didn   t know you had become a member before he left .         memory decays with age  manny .      rubin ignored that .     that was twelve  fifteen years ago when he left us  when the black widowers were just beginning .  that was before we met at the milano   before henry   s time .     he looked in henry   s direction with a smile and said     it doesn   t seem possible we could have had meetings of the black widowers without henry .  but then  in those days we wouldn   t have believed it possible to have dinners without ralph .  it was in       he went to california  wasn   t it .  we were kids then .         i believe     said geoffrey avalon  who had drifted toward them  his neatly bearded face solemn     that you and i  manny  were fortyish even then .  scarcely kids .         oh well     rubin said .     what does ralph want with us  mario .         i don   t know     said gonzalo .     parris wouldn   t say .  have you heard from him lately .         not a word in years .  he doesn   t even send in a refusal card to the invitations .  have you heard from him  geoff .         no     said avalon .     tom trumbull says ralph is teaching navigation at cit but has had no personal communication .         well  then  geoff  what do we do about this lawyer mario has dragged in .         treat him as any other guest .  what else can we do .      henry approached  his smooth and unwrinkled face radiating the efficiency that was characteristic of this best of waiters .  he said     mr .  gonzalo  we are ready to begin dinner if you will be so kind as to call the meeting to order .      the dinner was quieter than usual as matthew parris somehow absorbed the attention of the others .  he seemed oblivious to that  however  his smooth   shaven face shining pinkly  his graying hair slicked smoothly back  his smile wide and unaffected  his speech precise and with a flat midwestern accent .   at no time did he refer to the business at hand  but confined himself to discussing the middle eastern situation .  the trouble  he said  was that both sides were playing for time .  the arabs felt that as oil supplies dwindled  world hunger for energy would bring victory .  israel felt that as oil supplies dwindled  arab influence would dwindle with it .   to which james drake said somberly that as oil supplies dwindled  civilization might break down and the whole matter of victory  quote  unquote  he said  in the middle east or anywhere else would be irrelevant .      ah     said parris     but your fiery ideologue doesn   t care about trivial things such as survival .  he would rather win in hell than lose in heaven .      mario gonzalo  who had put aside his rather blinding pea   green jacket and was eating veal cordon bleu in his striped shirt   sleeves  leaned toward thomas trumbull and whispered     this whole thing may be a practical joke  tom .  i only met ralph two or three times before he left .  he was a peculiar fellow as i recall .      trumbull   s bronzed forehead furrowed under his white thatch of hair .     so are we all  i hope .  ralph ottur founded this club .  we used to eat at his house during the first two or three years .  he was a widower  a gourmet cook  an astronomer  and a word buff .         that   s what i remember .  the word   buff bit .         yes     said trumbull .     he   s written books on acrostics and on novelty verse of all kinds .  conundrums involving word play and puns were a specialty of his .  he   s the one who got roger halsted interested in limericks .      gonzalo laughed .     how did you stand it  tom .      trumbull shrugged .     it wasn   t the sole topic of conversation  and i was younger then .  however  ralph remarried  as you probably remember  went to the west coast  and we never heard from him again .  then jim drake and i found the milano  and the black widowers has been here ever since  better than ever .      henry refilled the coffee cups  and gonzalo played a melodious tattoo on his water glass with his spoon .      jim     he said     as the oldest member and the one who best knew ralph ottur in the old days when even manny claims to have been a kid  would you do the grilling honors .      james drake lit a fresh cigarette and said     mr .  parris  how do you justify your existence .         at the moment     said parris     by attempting to make you somewhat richer than you have been hitherto .  or if not you  dr .  drake  then another one of you .         don   t you know which .         i   m afraid not  gentlemen .  in order to know  i must complete the reading of the will .         will .  what will .     drake took the cigarette from his mouth  placed it in an ashtray  and looked uneasy .   a heavy silence descended on the rest of the table .  henry  who had been serving brandy  desisted .   parris said seriously     i was instructed to say nothing concerning the matter till i was a guest at a black widowers banquet and till i was being grilled .  not till this moment .      drake said     it is this moment .  go on .      parris said     i   m sorry to have to tell you that mr .  ralph ottur died last month .  he had been pretty much of a recluse since his second wife died three years ago and  at his request  no announcement of his death was made .  though he had made a clean break with his life in new york after he left for california  he did not  apparently  forget his old friends of the black widowers .  he asked that i hand out one of these to each of you  provided all six were present  and you all are .      envelopes were passed out to each of the stunned black widowers .  each bore the name of a black widower in careful india ink lettering .   drake muttered     there   s his monogram .     each envelope bore a stylized sketch of what was unmistakably an otter with a fish in its mouth .   trumbull said     did we each get the same .      gonzalo said     read it and we   ll see .      trumbull hesitated  then read in a low monotone        well  don   t sit there like idiots .  there   s no reason to get into a mood .  remember     mood    spelled backward is    doom .     i   ve been with you in spirit every month since i left  even if you haven   t heard from me  and i   m with you again now  ready for our last game .            that   s what mine says     said gonzalo .   there was a murmur of agreement from the rest .      well  then     said parris briskly     i   ll now read the will   not the entire will  you understand  but only that portion that applies to the club .  if you   re ready  .   .   .      there was silence and parris read     it is my further wish and desire to make a bequest to the black widowers  a club i helped found and for the members of which i have always had a profound affection .  therefore  i wish to leave a sum of money  which  after taxes are paid  is to come to ten thousand dollars .  this sum is to go to one of the following gentlemen  all of whom were members of the club at the last meeting i attended and all of whom  i believe  are still alive .  they are  thomas trumbull  james drake  emmanuel rubin  geoffrey avalon  roger halsted  and mario gonzalo .      parris looked up and said     for the record  there are six of you at the table and i believe you are the six whose names i have read off .  are there any discrepancies .      gonzalo said     there is a seventh member .  henry  our waiter  is the best black widower of them all .      halsted said     he wasn   t a member in ralph   s day .  hell  i can   t believe he   s dead .  do you remember that time he asked us to find a common english word that contained the letters    ufa    in that order .  it kept us quiet all that evening .         yes     said drake     and it was you who got it .  that   s why you remember .      rubin said     quiet .     his straggly beard bristled .     i demand silence .  the will hasn   t been read yet .  what does ralph mean that one of us will get the money .  why only one and which one .      parris cleared his throat .     i don   t know .  it is at this point i have been instructed to open a small envelope labeled     one .     here it is .         well  don   t open it just yet     said rubin violently .     mario  you   re the host  but listen to me .  if any bequest were left to the club or to the six of us in equal division  that would be all right .  to leave it to only one of us would  however  create hard feelings .  let   s agree  then  that whoever gets the money sets up a fund for the use of the black widowers as an entity .      gonzalo said     i   m willing .  any arguments .      there was none  and gonzalo said     open the envelope  mr .  parris .      parris opened it  withdrew a three   by   five card  glanced at it  looked surprised  and said     it says     to the barest .            what .     said trumbull indignantly .   parris looked on the other side  shook his head  and said     that   s all it says .  see for yourselves .     the card was passed around .   avalon chuckled and said     don   t you get it .  he said in his note there would be a last game and this is it .         what kind of game .     said gonzalo .   rubin snorted and said     not one of his good ones .  go ahead and explain  geoff .      avalon looked solemn and said     in the greek myths  the sea nymph thetis married the mortal peleus  and to the wedding all the gods and goddesses were invited .  the goddess of discord  eris  was overlooked .  furious  she appeared unbidden and  into the happy throng  tossed a golden apple  then left .  hermes picked it up and noticed a small message attached .  what it said was     to the fairest .     three goddesses at once reached for it   hera  the queen of heaven  athena  the goddess of wisdom  and aphrodite  the goddess of love and beauty .  the quarrel that resulted ended in the trojan war .         exactly     said rubin     and i suggest we not play ralph   s game .  i don   t know what the hell he means by the barest  but if we start arguing about which one of us qualifies for ten thousand dollars we will end with every one of us aggrieved  winner and losers alike  even if we put the money into a fund .  earlier  mr .  parris said that ideologues valued victory above survival  but i don   t .  i don   t want to see the black widowers come to an end over the question of who wins ten thousand dollars .         hear  hear     said gonzalo .     even you say something sensible now and then  manny .  let   s agree that each one of us is in a six   way tie for barest  take the money  and put it into the fund .         excellent     said avalon .     i don   t see that there would be any objection to that .      again  there was a silence  but parris said     i   m afraid my instructions were to allow discussion and then to open another small envelope marked two .         gonzalo looked surprised and said     well  open it .      parris opened the second envelope  removed a folded piece of paper  and unfolded it to find a single   spaced typwritten message .  he glanced over it and chuckled .   he said     here is what it says     i have no doubt that geoff avalon  in his endearingly pedantic way  will have by now explained the connection of the message with the apple of discord at the wedding of thetis and peleus .   .   .   .      avalon  having flushed to his hairline  said stiffly     i have never denied that i have a touch of pedantry about me .  i trust that i have never been offensively so  or if i have  that i may count on my outspoken comrades of the black widowers to tell me so .         don   t get defensive  geoff     said trumbull .     we   re all pedants .  go on  mr .  parris .      parris nodded and said         .   .  of thetis and peleus .  it may also be that someone  possibly manny rubin  will suggest that the game be refused and that the money be shared .  not so .  sorry to insist  but only one person gets the money  and that person will be he who can demonstrate himself to be the barest to the satisfaction of the executor of the will .  failing that  no one of them will get the money .  i dare say geoff can explain the appropriateness of this  if he has not already done so .      avalon cleared his throat and looked harassed .     i don   t think it   s necessary i do so .      rubin said     it   s all right  geoff .  i   ll take over .  everyone knows i   m no pedant .         not bright enough     muttered gonzalo .   rubin  glaring briefly at gonzalo  said     as geoff said  three goddesses claimed that apple .  hermes  who had picked it up  could see at once that this was no place for an innocent god  and he absolutely declined to make a decision .  one by one  the other gods also declined .  after considerable discussion  someone suggested that some poor mortal be stuck with the task .  the one selected was a shepherd boy on the slopes of mount ida near troy .      the three goddesses appeared to him in all their magnificence  and each  fearing she might not win in a fair contest  attempted to bribe the judge .  hera offered him world conquest  athena offered him the crown of wisdom  and aphrodite offered him the most beautiful girl in the world as his wife .      the shepherd boy was young enough to find the third bribe the most attractive  and chose aphrodite .  undoubtedly  she would have won in a fair contest of fairness  but it was a disastrous choice just the same .  the most beautiful girl in the world was helen  queen of sparta  and the shepherd boy some years later carried her off with aphrodite   s help  and that started the trojan war .      the shepherd boy   s name was paris  and he was one of the fifty sons of priam  king of troy .  the decision among the goddesses is a favorite scene among artists and is commonly referred to as    the judgment of paris .     clearly  ralph couldn   t resist playing on words and setting up the judgment of parris      two r   s .      parris smiled and said     i seem to have the worst of it .  instead of choosing among three glorious goddesses  i am faced with deciding among six not particularly attractive men .      rubin said     you   re not faced with any decision at all  actually .  ralph can   t make us play the game .  if the only way we can get the ten thousand dollars is to compete for it  then i suggest we let the whole thing go .  ten thousand dollars is something we can live without   we have lived without it all these years .  what we can   t live without is our mutual friendship .      halsted looked regretful .     well  now  we can use the money .  it could defray part of the costs of the banquets .  what with inflation  i  for one  am finding it difficult to cover the expenses .  since i   m the most nearly bald member of the group  can   t we say i   m obviously the barest and let it go at that .      gonzalo said     we could decide that    barest    means    the most nearly nude .     then i can strip to my underwear  collect  and we   ll set up the fund .         oh god     said rubin .     look  i   d pay you ten thousand dollars  if i had it to spare  not to strip .      drake said dreamily     if we were ecdysiasts  it would all be simple .  a nice six   way tie .      parris said     now  gentlemen  wait .  this is serious .  i disapprove of wills such as this one  but i am the executor and i must treat it seriously .  i don   t know what mr .  ottur means by the    barest     but it is undoubtedly something that is first  not obvious  and second  compelling .  if one of you can demonstrate what is meant by    barest    and then show compellingly that one or another of you is    barest     i will release the money .  otherwise i can   t .  baldness and  for that matter  nudity  do not strike me as clever explanations of the meaning of the phrase .  try again .         no  we won   t     said rubin .     you ought to be ashamed of yourself  roger  for that baldness suggestion .  if you need money that badly  i   ll contribute to the payment when it   s your turn to host .      halsted turned red and he pointed an angry finger at rubin     i don   t need money that badly  and i wouldn   t come to you for help if i were starving .      avalon said     well  the apple of discord is beginning to do its work  obviously .  manny is right .  let   s let it go  while we   re still on speaking terms .      halsted frowned as he passed the palm of his hand over his high forehead  but he kept quiet .   rubin muttered     sorry  rog .  i meant no offense .      halsted waved a briefly forgiving hand .   parris said  with considerably more than a trace of apology     my instructions are that after you have had time for discussion  i am to open the small envelope marked  three .         drake said softly     how many envelopes do you have  mr .  parris .  this can go on all night .         this is the last envelope     said parris .      don   t open it     roared rubin .     there   s nothing he can say that will change our minds .      parris said     i am compelled to open and read this third message by the ethics of my profession .  i can   t compel you to listen  of course  so if any of you wish to leave the room  you may .      no one did  however  not even rubin .   parris opened the third envelope and this time he looked grim as he scanned the message .      i think you had better listen     he said .     the message reads     i think it possible that the group may decide to turn down the bequest rather than play the game .  if they do so  or if they play but do not solve the riddle  i do will and bequeath the money  unconditionally  to the american nazi party .      there was a unanimous wordless rumble from the black widowers .   parris nodded .     that   s what it says .  see for yourselves .         you can   t do that     said halsted .      i am legally compelled to do so     said parris     if you refuse to play the game .  i am just a sluice through which the money passes .  i cannot take independent action .  of course  any or all of you may contest the will  but i don   t see what grounds you can possibly have   what legal grounds  that is .  a man can do as he wishes with his property within certain clearly defined legal limits  and those limits don   t seem to be transgressed here .         then let   s play the game     said halsted .     i say i   m the barest because i   m the baldest .  i don   t say that to win the money  manny  i say it to keep it out of the hands of the nazis .  now if you   ll agree to that  mr .  parris  you can hand over the money  and we   ll put it into the fund  and that   s that .      parris hesitated .     i   d like to .  i would really like to .  the trouble is i can   t .         why not .  do you want the money to go to the nazis .         of course not     said parris  with some indignation     but my only duty here is to respect the will of my client  and he wants one of you to demonstrate that he is the barest in so clever and unmistakable a way that i will be compelled to accept it and to select one of the six of you as the winner .  after that  the money is the property of the winner and he is free to do with it as he wishes   keep it  divide it equally among the six of you  set up a trust fund for whatever legal purpose  or anything else .         are you sure .     said trumbull .     no more clever little notes .         no more     said parris .     the reading is complete .  i must remind you now that it   s a case of the judgment of parris .  you have to convince me of the validity of the solution or i have to give the money to   to   i have no choice .      gonzalo said     according to manny  paris   the original paris   was bribed into giving his judgment .  does that mean  .  .  .      parris said seriously     please don   t finish that remark  mr .  gonzalo .  it will not be funny .      rubin said     then we have no choice .  we have to play the game .  who   s the barest .      halsted says     we can   t answer that until we find out what the old b   well  nil nisi bonum and all that .  what does ralph mean by    barest     if he doesn   t mean baldest .         he may mean    poorest     the person who is barest of money     said gonzalo .     i think i   m in the running for that .         or shortest     said avalon     the one who most nearly barely exists  so to speak .  that   s you  manny .         you may have eight inches on me  geoff     said rubin     but that could be eight inches of solid bone .  how about the one with the smallest wardrobe  which eliminates mario  or else the lowest  q  which puts him right back into the running again .         gentlemen  gentlemen     interposed parris     none of this sounds in the least convincing .  please be serious .         you   re right     said rubin     this is too serious a matter for fooling  but i hate this thing too much to be able to think clearly about it .  i say we get henry into the thing right now .      henry  who had been standing at the sideboard  listening attentively  now shook his head .     i   m sorry  gentlemen  but that would not be fitting .  the deceased did not know of me  did not consider me a member of the club  and i do not qualify to play the game .         you   re a member now     said trumbull gruffly .     you may not qualify to inherit the money  but you qualify to advise us as to who may .  go on and tell us  henry .      henry said     i don   t think i can  mr .  trumbull .  if i am a member of the black widowers  i am the only member who has never met mr .  ottur .  i do not know the cast of his thought .      trumbull said     there   s no mystery there .  you   ve heard us discussing him .  he was a word nut .  come on  henry  if you didn   t know ralph  neither did he know you .  he didn   t know your faculty for seeing the simple things .      henry sighed .     i will do my best  sir .  may i ask some questions .  for instance  am i correct in taking it for granted that the deceased was not a nazi sympathizer .         hell  no     said rubin with a snort .     quite the reverse .  during the     s he was in trouble because some people thought his views were too leftist .         then he doesn   t want the money to be left to the nazis .         of course not .         so he expects you to win .      avalon said     he expects us to do so  but he may overestimate our abilities .      henry said     do you suppose his eagerness to have you win would extend to his giving you a hint .      gonzalo said     what kind of a hint .         i   m not sure  mr .  gonzalo  but let us see .  is mr .  ottur   s name spelled in the usual way .         you mean like the animal .     said trumbull .     o   t   t   e   r .  no .  it   s spelled o   t   t   u   r .  with a    u     henry said     i believe that when the preliminary envelopes were handed out  dr .  drake said something about mr .  ottur   s monogram .      drake said     i meant this sketch on the envelope .         yes .  i had thought that might possibly be so .  has he always used that monogram  dr .  drake .         as long as i   ve known him  and that goes back a long time .      henry said     i can understand the otter  which is a clear reference to mr .  ottur   s name  in a punning sort of way .  may i ask if it is known whether the fish in the otter   s mouth is a trout .      there was no reply at first  but finally avalon said     i don   t know that i gave that any thought .  it could be a trout  i suppose .  why do you ask .         only because trout  t   r   o   u   t  is an anagram of ottur  o   t   t   u   r .  the two words consist of the same letters in different arrangements .  an otter holding a trout is a double reference to his last name by way of a pun and an anagram .  does that fit his character .         absolutely     said rubin .     the otter was obvious to all of us but i never thought of the trout .  he never explained that  as far as i can recall  but then he never explained anything .  he wanted everything worked out .  but what does all this have to do with the problem facing us  henry .         it seemed to me  gentlemen  that the preliminary message was not really a necessary prelude to the will and might well have been omitted .  furthermore  i saw no point in giving each one of you an identical message .  a single message read out would have done as well  as in the case of the three messages in the three envelopes that were part of the will .      looking at it in that fashion     henry went on     it occurs to me that he was really handing out his monogram and making sure that each one of you got a good look at it  and will therefore perhaps think of using it as a clue to the nature of the game .  the monogram is a pun and anagram on mr .  ottur   s last name .  the solution to the problem facing us may ret in just that   puns and anagrams on last names .      the six black widowers looked thoughtful at that  each in his own way  and finally drake stirred .   he said     you know  that sounds like ralph  and if so  let me point out that d   r   a   k   e can be rearranged into r   a   k   e   d  and a piece of ground that has been raked is bare  so say nothing of the fact that it is only one letter removed from n   a   k   e   d  which is certainly barest .      parris said        raked    doesn   t sound compelling to me  and    naked    is completely impermissible .  i don   t think we would be allowed to substitute letters .      rubin said     let me offer a pun  then .  we don   t have to rearrange the letters r   u   b   i   n .  just change it into two words  r   u   b i   n     rub in .     cold cream  which is rubbed into the skin  appears to vanish and leave the skin bare .  how about that .         even more farfetched than    raked        said parris .   gonzalo said     g   o   n   z   a   l   o can be rearranged to a   z   o   l   o   n   g  which is    a so long    in a german accent .  a good   bye  in other words  and when everyone says good   bye  you   re left bare of company .         good god .     said rubin .      i can   t think of anything else     said gonzalo defensively .      if we   re going to misspell     said halsted     my name can be rearranged into s   t   e   a   l   d   h  which is a misspelling of    stealth     and if people steal away  the place is left bare .         worse and worse     said rubin .      i   m worst of all     said trumbull  scowling .     the only vowels in my name are two u   s  and i can   t do anything with that .     parris said impatiently     you are still not serious  gentlemen .  none of this is worth anything at all .  please .  if you want to keep the money from falling into vile hands  you must do better .      avalon  who had had a tight smile on his face for the preceding few minutes  now hunched his magnificent eyebrows down over his eyes and let out a satanic cackle .     but i have it  gentlemen  and i   m delighted to be able to say that henry  our unexcelled waiter  has overlooked the key clue .  no matter  henry .  even homer nods .         far less often than i do  mr .  avalon .  what clue did i overlook  sir .         why  in the preliminary message  there is not only the monogram  as you correctly pointed out  henry  but also a reference to the fact that m   o   o   d  spelled backward  is d   o   o   m .  that statement is rather a non sequitur  and we have a right to wonder why it   s brought in at all .         because that   s the way ralph thinks   or thought     said drake .      undoubtedly  but if you will take the trouble to spell avalon backward  you have n     o l   a   v   a .  no puns  no rearrangements  just do as ralph did in the message .      parris clenched both hands in excitement .     now  that   s the most interesting thing i   ve heard yet .  but why    no lava    .      avalon said     a piece of ground over which lava has not flowed is bare .      parris considered this and shook his head .     we might just as easily consider that ground over which lava has not flowed is rich in vegetation and is not bare .  in that sense  it would be land over which lava has flowed that would be bare .      avalon said     very well  then  we can rearrange the letters slightly and we have o   n l   a   v   a .  by councilor parris   s argument there would be no vegetation on lava  and that anagram represents bareness .         what about the reversed lettering .     said gonzalo .     mood to doom and all that .         well     said avalon     we   ll have to eliminate that .      parris said     i liked    no lava     but it was not convincing .  the reason i liked it  though  was that the backward spelling did seem to be a reasonable solution .     on lava    without the backward spelling has nothing to recommend it .      there was a moment of silence and rubin said     you know  this is getting less funny all the time .  are we going to end up giving the money to the nazis  even with henry   s help .      gonzalo said     well  let   s ask him .  what are we doing wrong  henry .      henry said     i   m not sure  mr .  gonzalo .  it does occur to me  though  that so far we have been punning and anagramming our last names   that is  the potential answers .  ought we to be working the question as well .         i don   t see what you mean  henry     said avalon .      it strikes me  mr .  avalon  that the phrase    to the barest    might just possibly be punned into    to the bearest     that is  b   e   a   r   e   s   t  the black widower most like a bear .      trumbull said     terrible .  it   s a terrible pun and it   s a terrible suggestion .  i don   t see how we can get any one of us to be clearly most like a bear anymore than we can get any one of us most bare .      gonzalo said     i don   t know  tom .  you   ve got a terrible temper .  you   re the most bearish .         not while manny is alive     said trumbull hotly .      i   ve never lost my temper in my life  damn it     shouted rubin  just as hotly .      yes  like now     said halsted .   parris said     gentlemen  this is getting us nowhere either .  unless someone can think of something  we   ll have to give up .      henry said     but we now have our solution  to my way of thinking  mr .  parris .  if we take the challenge to be that of finding the black widower most like a bear  may i point out that if we change the position of but one letter in r   u   b   i   n  we get b   r   u   i   n  the common name for the bear in the medieval animal epics  and still used today .  i believe there is a hockey team known as the    bruins .         parris said energetically     i   ll buy that .  it is a clear solution that fits and is unique .      the black widowers broke into applause  and henry turned pink .   rubin said     since the money is mine  then  i will set up the trust fund with directions that the earned interest be turned over to henry as an honorarium for his services to the club .      there was applause again .   henry said     gentlemen  please don   t .  i will be overpaid .         come  come  henry     said rubin     are you refusing .      henry considered  sighed  and said     i accept  sir  with thanks .      to the barest   afterword  i don   t want the black widowers to be part of the real world .  in the case of the trap door spiders  deaths have occurred  and new members have been elected  but i don   t intend to let that happen to the black widowers .  no one is going to die and no new member is going to be elected .   nor is anyone going to age .  henry was    sixtyish    in the first story  and though nearly a decade has passed he is still    sixtyish     and he is going to stay that no matter how long i live and the stories continue .  avalon will continue to stare down from his seventy   four inches of height  and rubin   s beard will continue to be straggly .   and yet  the exigencies of the plot and the tug of nostalgia lured me on to introduce ralph ottur as the founder of the black widowers and to depict him as having died .  of course  the trap door spiders were founded by science   fiction writer and naval historian fletcher pratt  who died over twenty years ago  and is fondly remembered by all who knew him .     to the barest    appeared in the august      eqmm .  with that  then  i will say farewell to my gentle readers   with my usual promise to keep on recording the proceedings of the black widowers while life and breath do last .
