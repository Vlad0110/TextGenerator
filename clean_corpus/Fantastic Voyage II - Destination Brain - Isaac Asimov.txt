contralto  in his ear .     albert jonas morrison stiffened in his seat .  the room was darkened and the computer screen on the platform was displaying its graphics with an insistence that had been lost on him .     he must have been more than half asleep .  there had definitely been a man on his right when he sat down .  when had that man changed into a woman .  or risen and been replaced .     morrison cleared his throat and said   did you say something  ma am .   he couldn t make her out clearly in the dim room and the flashing light from the computer screen obscured rather than revealed .  he made out dark hair  straight  hugging the skull  covering the ears    no artifice .     she said   i asked if you spoke russian .       yes  i do .  why do you want to know .       because that would make it easier .  my english sometimes fails me .  are you dr .  morrison .  a .  j .  morrison .  i m not certain in this darkness .  forgive me if i have made a mistake .       i am a .  j .  morrison .  do i know you .       no  but i know you .   her hand reached out  touching the sleeve of his jacket lightly .   i need you badly .  are you listening to this talk .  you did not seem to be .      they were both whispering  of course .     morrison looked about involuntarily .  the room was sparsely filled and no one was sitting very close .  his whisper grew lower just the same .   and if i m not .  what then .    he was curious    if only out of boredom .  the talk had put him to sleep .      she said   will you come with me now .  i am natalya boranova .       come with you where  ms .  boranova .       to the coffee shop    so that we may talk .  it is terribly important .      that was the way it began .  it didn t matter  morrison decided afterward  that he had been in that particular room    that he had not been alert    that he had been intrigued enough  flattered enough to be willing to go with a woman who said she needed him .     she would  after all  have found him wherever he had been and would have seized upon him and would have made him listen .  it might not have been quite so easy under other circumstances  but it would all have gone as it did .  he was certain .     there would have been no escape .       .     he was looking at her in normal light now  and she was less young than he had thought .  thirty six .  forty  perhaps .     dark hair .  no gray .  pronounced features .  heavy eyebrows .  strong jaws .  pleasant nose .  sturdy body  but not fat .  almost as tall as he was  even though she was wearing flat heels .  on the whole  a woman who was attractive without being beautiful .  the kind of woman  he decided  one could get used to .     he sighed  for he was facing the mirror and he saw himself there .  sandy hair  thinning .  blue eyes  faded .  thin face  thin body  stringy .  beaky nose  nice smile .  he hoped it was a nice smile .  but no  not a face you would want to get used to .  brenda had gotten entirely unused to it in a little over ten years  and his fortieth birthday would be five days past the fifth anniversary of the day his divorce had been made final and official .     the waitress brought the coffee .  they had been sitting there  not talking but appraising each other .  morrison finally felt he had to say something .      no vodka .   he said in an attempt at lightness .     she smiled and looked somehow even more russian when she did so .   no coca cola .       if that s an american habit  coca cola is at least cheaper .       for good reason .      morrison laughed .   are you this quick in russian .       let us see if i am .  let s talk russian .       we ll sound like a couple of spies .      her last sentence had been in russian .  so had morrison s reply .  the change of language made no difference to him .  he could speak and understand it as easily as english .  that had to be so .  if an american wished to be a scientist and keep up with the literature  he had to be able to handle russian  almost as much as a russian scientist had to be able to handle english .     this woman  natalya boranova  for instance  despite her pretence that she was not at home in english  spoke it readily and with only a faint accent  morrison noticed .     she said   why will we sound like spies .  there are hundreds of thousands of americans speaking english in the soviet union and hundreds of thousands of soviet citizens speaking russian in the united states .  these are not the bad old days .       that s true .  i was joking .  but in that case  why do you want to speak russian .       this is your country and that gives you a psychological advantage  does it not  dr .  morrison .  if we speak my language  it will balance the scales a bit .      morrison sipped at his coffee .   as you wish .       tell me  dr .  morrison .  do you know me .       no .  i have never met you before .       and my name .  natalya boranova .  have you heard of me .       forgive me .  if you were in my field  i would have heard of you .  since i have not  i assume you are not in my field .  should i know you .       it might have helped  but we ll let it go .  i know you  however .  in fact  i know a great deal about you .  when and where you were born .  your schooling .  the fact that you are divorced and that you have two daughters that live with your ex wife .  i know about your university position and the research you do .      morrison shrugged .   none of that would be hard to find out in our computer ridden society .  should i be flattered or annoyed .       why either .       it depends on whether you tell me that i am famous in the soviet union  which would be flattering  or that i have been the target of an investigation  which might be annoying .       i have no intention of being anything but honest with you .  i have investigated you    for reasons that are important to me .      morrison said coldly   what reasons .       to begin with  you are a neurophysicist .      morrison had finished his coffee and had absently signaled for a refill .  boranova s cup was half empty  but she had apparently lost interest in it .      there are other neurophysicists   morrison said .      none like you .       clearly you are trying to flatter me .  that can only be because you don t know anything about me after all .  not the crucial things .       that you are not successful .  that your methods of brain wave analysis are not generally accepted in the field .       but if you know that  then why are you after me .       because we have a neurophysicist in our country who knows your work  and he thinks it is brilliant .  you have rather jumped into the unknown  he says  and you may be wrong    but if you are  you are brilliantly wrong .       brilliantly wrong .  how is that different from wrong .       it is his view that it is impossible to be brilliantly wrong without being not altogether wrong .  even if you are in some ways wrong  much of what you maintain will prove useful    and you may be entirely right .       what is the name of this paragon who has this view of me .  i ll mention him with favor in my next paper .       he is pyotor leonovich shapirov .  do you know him .      morrison sat back in his chair .  he had not expected this .   know him .   he said .   i ve met him .  pete shapiro i called him .  our people here in the united states think he s as crazy as i am .  if it turns out that he s backing me  that s just one more nail in my coffin .     listen  tell pete i appreciate his faith in me  but if he really wants to help me  please ask him not to tell anyone he s on my side .      boranova looked at him disapprovingly .   you are not a very serious man .  is everything a joke to you .       no .  just me .  i m the joke .  i ve got something really great and i can t convince anyone of it .  except pete    i ve now found out    and he doesn t count .  i can t even get my papers published these days .       then come to the soviet union .  we can use you    and your ideas .       no no .  i m not emigrating .       who said emigrate .  if you wish to be an american  be an american .  but you have visited the soviet union in the past and you can visit it once again and stay a while .  then return to your own country .       why .       you have crazy ideas and we have crazy ideas .  perhaps yours can help ours .       what crazy ideas .  i mean  yours .  i know what mine are .       it s not something to discuss until i know if you are perhaps willing to help us .      morrison  still sitting back in his chair  was vaguely aware of the buzz about him  of people drinking  eating  talking    most of them from the conference  he was sure .  he stared at this intense russian woman who admitted to crazy ideas and wondered what kind of      he stiffened and cried out   boranova .  i have heard of you .  of course .  pete shapiro mentioned you .  you re        in his excitement he was speaking english and her hand came down on his  her nails pressing hard against his skin .     he choked it off and she removed her hand  saying   sorry .  i did not mean to hurt you .      he stared at the marks on his hand  one of which  he decided  was going to be slightly bruised .  he said quietly in russian   you re the miniaturizer .        .     boranova looked at him with an easy calm .   perhaps a little walk and a bench by the river .  the weather is beautiful .      morrison held his lightly damaged hand in the other .  there had been a few  he thought  who had looked in his direction when he had cried out in english  but none seemed to show any interest now .  he shook his head .   i think not .  i should be attending the conference .      boranova smiled as though he had agreed that the weather was beautiful .   i don t think so .  i think you ll find a seat by the river more interesting .      for one flashing moment  morrison thought her smile might be intended to be seductive .  surely she wasn t implying       he abandoned the thought almost before he had put it clearly to himself .  that sort of thing was pass    even on holovision   beautiful russian spy uses sinuous body to dazzle naive american .      to begin with  she wasn t beautiful and her body wasn t sinuous .  nor did she look as though anything of that nature could possibly be on her mind and he himself  after all  wasn t that naive    or even interested .     yet he found himself accompanying her across the campus and toward the river .     they walked slowly    sauntered    and she talked cheerfully about her husband nikolai and her son aleksandr  who was going to school and was  for some strange reason  interested in biology  even though his mother was a thermodynamicist .  what s more  aleksandr was a dreadful chess player  much to his father s disappointment  but he showed signs of promise on the violin .     morrison did not listen .  he occupied himself  instead  in trying to recall what he had heard about the soviet interest in miniaturization and what possible connection there might be between that and his own work .     she pointed to a bench .   this one looks reasonably clean .      they sat down .  morrison stared over the river  watching  with eyes that did not really absorb it  the line of cars filing along the highway on their side and the parallel line on the highway on the other side    while sculls  looking like centipedes  plied the river itself .     he remained silent and boranova  staring at him thoughtfully  finally said   you do not find this interesting .       find what interesting .       my suggestion that you come to the soviet union .       no .   he said it curtly .      but why not .  since your american colleagues do not accept your ideas  and since you are depressed over this and are seeking a way out of the dead end at which you have arrived  why not come to us .       given your investigations into my life  i am sure you know that my ideas are not accepted  but how can you possibly be sure that i am all that depressed over it .       any sane man would be depressed .  and one has only to talk to you to be certain .       do you accept my ideas .       i .  i am not in your field .  i know nothing    or very little    about the nervous system .       i suppose you simply accept shapirov s estimate of my ideas .       yes .  and even if i did not    desperate problems may require desperate remedies .  what harm  then  if we try your ideas as a remedy .  it will certainly leave us no worse off .       so you have my ideas .  they have been published .      she gazed at him steadily .   somehow we don t think all your ideas have been published .  that is why we want you .      morrison laughed without humor .   what good can i possibly do you in connection with miniaturization .  i know less about miniaturization than you do about the brain .  far less .       do you know anything at all about miniaturization .       only two things .  that the soviets are known to be investigating it    and that it is impossible .      boranova stared thoughtfully at the river .   impossible .  what if i told you we had accomplished the task .       i would as soon believe you if you told me polar bears fly .       why should i lie to you .       i point out the fact .  i m not concerned about the motivation .       why are you so certain miniaturization is impossible .       if you reduce a man to the dimensions of a fly  then all the mass of a man would be crowded into the volume of a fly .  you d end up with a density of something like     he paused to think     a hundred and fifty thousand times that of platinum .       but what if the mass were reduced in proportion .       then you end up with one atom in the miniaturized man for every three million in the original .  the miniaturized man would not only have the size of a fly but the brainpower of a fly as well .       and if the atoms are reduced  too .       if it is miniaturized atoms you are speaking of  then planck s constant  which is an absolutely fundamental quantity in our universe  forbids it .  miniaturized atoms would be too small to fit into the graininess of the universe .       and if i told you that planck s constant was reduced as well  so that a miniaturized man would be encased in a field in which the graininess of the universe was incredibly finer than it is under normal conditions .       then i wouldn t believe you .       without examining the matter .  you would refuse to believe it as a result of preconceived convictions  as your colleagues refuse to believe you .      and at this  morrison was  for a moment  silent .      not the same   he mumbled at last .      not the same .   again she stared thoughtfully out over the river .   in what way not the same .       my colleagues think i m wrong .  my ideas are not theoretically impossible in their opinion    only wrong .       while miniaturization is impossible .       yes .       then come and see .  if it turns out that miniaturization is impossible  just as you say  then you ll at least have a month in the soviet union as a guest of the soviet government .  all expenses will be paid .  if there s a friend you would like to bring with you  bring her  too .  or him .      morrison shook his head .   no thanks .  i d rather not .  even if miniaturization were possible  it is not my field .  it would not help me or be of interest to me .       how do you know .  what if miniaturization gave you the opportunity to study neurophysics as you have never studied it before    as no one has ever studied it before .  and what if  in doing so  you might be able to help us .  that would be our stake in it .       how can you offer me a new way of studying neurophysics .       but  dr .  morrison  i thought that was what we were talking about .  you cannot really prove your theories because you cannot study single nerve cells in sufficient detail without damaging them .  but what if we make a neuron as large as the kremlin for you    or even larger    so that you can study it a molecule at a time .       you mean you can reverse miniaturization and make a neuron as large as you wish .       no  we can t do that  as yet  but we can make you as small as we wish and that would amount to the same thing  wouldn t it .      morrison rose  staring at her .      no   he said in half a whisper .   are you insane .  do you think i am insane .  good bye .  good bye .      he turned and strode away rapidly .     she called after him .   dr .  morrison .  listen to me .      he made a sweeping gesture of rejection with his right arm and broke into a run across the drive  narrowly dodging the cars .     then he was back into the hotel  puffing  almost dancing with impatience as he waited for the elevator .     madwoman .  he thought .  she wanted to miniaturize him  attempt this impossibility on him .     or attempt the possibility of it on him  which would be infinitely worse .       .     morrison was still shaking when he stood at the door of his hotel room  holding the plastic rectangle of his key  breathing hard  and wondering if she knew his room number .  she could find out  of course  if she were sufficiently determined .  he looked down the length of the corridor each way  half afraid he might see her running toward him  face contorted  hair flying  hands outstretched .     he shook his head .  this was madness .  what could she do to him .  she could not carry him off bodily .  she could not force him to do anything he didn t want to do .  what childish terror was overcoming him .     morrison took a deep breath and thrust his key into the door slit .  he felt the small click as the key seated itself  then he withdrew it and the door swung open .     the man sitting in the wicker armchair at the window smiled at him and said   come in .      morrison stared at him in astonishment  then twisted his head to look at the room number .      no no .  it s your room  all right .  do come in and close the door behind you .      morrison followed orders  staring at the man in silent astonishment .     he was a comfortably plump man  not quite fat  filling the chair from arm to arm .  he wore a thin seersucker jacket and under it was a shirt so white that it seemed to glisten .  he was not yet what one might call bald  but he was clearly on the way and what remained of his brown hair was crisply curly .  he did not wear glasses  but his eyes were small and had a nearsighted look about them  which might be misleading    or which perhaps meant he wore contacts .     he said   you came back running  didn t you .  i watched you     he pointed out the window     sitting on the bench  then get up and come toward the hotel at the double .  i was hoping you would come up to your hotel room .  i didn t want to sit up here all day waiting for you .       you were here in order to watch me from the window .       no  not at all .  that was just an accident .  you just happened to walk out with the lady to that bench .  convenient  but not really foreseen .  it s all right  though .  if i hadn t had the view from the window  there were others watching .      by that time morrison had caught his breath and his mind had steadied itself to the point where he asked the question that should have had pride of place in the conversation .   who are you  anyway .      in response the man  smiling  took a small wallet from his inner jacket pocket and let it flip open .  he said   signature  hologram  fingerprint  voiceprint .      morrison looked from the hologram to the smiling face .  the hologram was smiling  too .  he said   all right  so you re security .  it still doesn t give you the right to break into my private quarters .  i m available .  you could have called me from the lobby or knocked at my door .       strictly speaking  you re right  of course .  but i thought it best to meet you as discreetly as possible .  besides  i presumed on old acquaintance .       what old acquaintance .       two years ago .  don t you remember .  an international conference in miami .  you were presenting a paper and had a hard time of it         i remember the occasion .  i remember the paper .  it s you i don t remember .       that s not surprising  perhaps .  i met you afterward .  i asked you questions  and we actually had a few drinks together .       i don t consider that old acquaintance .     francis rodano .       that s my name  yes .  you even pronounced it correctly .  accent on the second syllable .  broad a .  subliminal memory  obviously .       no  i don t remember you .  the name was on your identification .     i d rather you left .       i would like to talk to you in my official capacity .       apparently everyone wants to talk to me .  what about .       your work .       are you a neurophysicist .       you must know i m not .  slavic languages was my major .  i minored in economics .       then what can we talk about .  i m good at russian  but you re probably better .  and i know nothing about economics .       we can talk about your work .  as we did two years ago .     look  why don t you sit down .  it s your room and i won t really take long .  if you want the chair i m sitting on  i ll be glad to give it to you .      morrison sat down at the side of the bed .   let s get this over with .  what do you want to know about my work .       the same thing i wanted to know two years ago .  is there anything to your notion that there s a specific structure in your brain that s specifically responsible for creative thought .       not quite a structure .  it s not something you can cut out in the ordinary way .  it s a neuronic network .  yes  i think there s something to that .  obviously .  the catch is that no one else thinks so because they can t locate it and have no evidence for it .       have you located it .       no .  i reason backward from results and from my analysis of brain waves and i don t seem to be convincing .  my analyses are not    orthodox .   he added bitterly   orthodoxy in this field has gotten them nowhere  but they won t let me be unorthodox .       i am told that you use mathematical techniques in your electroencephalographic analyses that are not only unorthodox  but are flat wrong .  to be unorthodox is one thing  to be wrong is quite another .       the only reason they say i am wrong is that i cannot prove that i am right .  the only reason i cannot prove that i am right is that i can t study an isolated brain neuron in sufficient detail .       have you tried to study them .  if you work with a living human brain  don t you leave yourself open to severe lawsuits or to criminal trial .       of course .  i m not mad .  i ve worked with animals .  i have to .       you told me all this two years ago .  i take it  then  you have made no startling discoveries in the last two years .       none .  but i m convinced i m right just the same .       your being convinced doesn t matter if you can t convince anyone else .  but now i have to ask you another question .  have you done something in the last two years that has managed to convince the soviets .       the soviets .       yes .  what is this attitude of surprise  dr .  morrison .  haven t you spent an hour or two in conversation with dr .  boranova .  isn t she the one whom you just left in a great hurry .       dr .  boranova .   morrison  in his confusion  could think of nothing better to do than play the parrot .     rodano s face lost none of its pleasantness .   exactly .  we know her well .  we keep half an eye on her whenever she is in the united states .       you make it sound like the bad old days   mumbled morrison .     rodano shrugged .   no  not at all .  there is no danger of nuclear war now .  we are polite to each other  the soviet union and we .  we cooperate in space .  we have a cooperative mining station on the moon and freedom of entry into each other s space settlements .  that makes these the good new days .  but  doctor  some things don t change entirely .  we keep an eye on our polite companions  the soviets  just to make sure they stay virtuous .  why not .  they keep an eye on us .      morrison said   you keep an eye on me  too  it would seem .       but you were with dr .  boranova .  we couldn t help seeing you .       that won t happen again  i assure you .  i have no intention of ever being in her vicinity again if i can help it .  she s a madwoman .       do you mean that literally .       take my word for it .     look  nothing of what she and i talked about is secret as far as i m concerned .  what she said i feel free to repeat .  she s involved in some miniaturization project .       we ve heard of it   said rodano easily .   they have a special town in the urals devoted to miniaturization experiments .       are they getting anywhere as far as you know .       we wonder .       she s tried to tell me they are  that they ve succeeded in producing actual miniaturization .      rodano said nothing .     morrison  who had waited a moment to let him speak  then said   but that s impossible  i tell you .  scientifically impossible .  you must realize that  or  since your field of expertise is slavic languages and economics  take my word for it .        i don t have to  my friend .  there are many others who say it is impossible and yet  nevertheless  we wonder .  the soviets are free to play with miniaturization if they please  but we don t actually want them to have it unless we do also .  after all  we don t know to what uses it might be put .       to none .  to none .   said morrison fiercely .   there s no point in worrying about it .  if our government really doesn t want the soviet union to get too far ahead in technology  it should encourage this miniaturization madness .  let the soviets spend money on it    and time and material    and concentrate every atom of their scientific expertise on it .  everything will be wasted .       and yet   said rodano .   i don t think dr .  boranova is mad or a fool  any more than i think that you are mad or a fool .     do you know what i was thinking as i watched the two of you in so intent a conversation on the park bench .  it seemed to me that she wanted your help .  perhaps she thought that with your theories on neurophysics you could somehow help the soviet push for miniaturization .  their peculiar theories and your peculiar theories might add up to something that is not at all peculiar .  or so i think .      morrison s lips tightened .   i told you i have no secrets to keep  so i m telling you that you re right .  just as you say  she wants me to go to the soviet union and help out in their miniaturization project .  i won t ask how you know that  but i don t think it s just an idle guess and don t try to persuade me it is .      rodano smiled and morrison went on .   in any case  i said no .  i refused absolutely .  i stood up and left at once    and in a hurry .  you saw me hurry .  that s the truth .  i would have reported it if you had given me time to do so .  and i m reporting it now  as a matter of fact  to you .  nor is there any reason for you not to believe me because why  under any circumstances  would i take any part in a project that has absolutely no sense to it .  even if i wanted to work against my country  which i don t  i m enough of a physicist not to try to do so by involving myself in anything as insane as working on a project without hope .  they might as well be working on a perpetual motion machine  or antigravity  or faster than light travel  or     he was perspiring freely .     and rodano said gently   please  dr .  morrison  no one doubts your loyalty .  certainly i don t .  i m not here because i am perturbed at your having had a discussion with the russian woman .  i am here because we had reason to think she might approach you and we feared you would not listen to her .       what .       now understand me  dr .  morrison .  please understand .  we would suggest    in fact  we would very much want    to have you go with dr .  boranova to the soviet union .        .     morrison stared at rodano  face pale  lower lip quivering slightly .  he brushed at his hair with his right hand and said   why do you want me to go to the soviet union .       not i  personally .  the united states government wants it .       why .       for the obvious reason .  if the soviet union is engaged in miniaturization experiments  we would like to know as much about them as possible .       you ve got madame boranova .  she must know a great deal .  grab her and beat it out of her .      rodano sighed and said   i know you re joking .  we can t do that these days .  you know that .  the soviet union would retaliate at once in the most unpleasant ways and world opinion would be with them .  so let s not waste time with jokes like that .       all right .  granted  we can t do anything crude .  i presume we have agents attempting to dig out the details .       the operative word  doctor  is attempting .  we have our agents in the soviet union  to say nothing of sophisticated espionage equipment both earthside and in space  just as they have agents here .  but if they and we are very good at poking around quietly  we re also very good at keeping things secret .  if anything  the soviet union is better at it than we are .  even though these are not what you call the bad old days  the soviet union is still not quite an open society in our sense and they ve had more than a century of practice in keeping things under the rug .       then what do you expect me to do .       you re different .  the usual agent is sent into the soviet union or into some region in which the soviet union is operating under some cover which might possibly be penetrated .  he    or she    must insinuate himself into a place where he is not really welcome and manage to elicit information that is secret .  this isn t easy .  he    or she    usually does not succeed and he    or she    is sometimes caught  which is always unpleasant all around .  in your case  though  they re asking for you  they behave as though they need you .  they will place you in the very midst of their secret installations .  what an opportunity you will have .       but they ve just asked me to go in these last two hours .  how do you know so much about it .       they ve been interested in you for quite a while now .  one of the reasons i made it my business to talk to you two years ago was because they seemed interested in you even at that time and we were wondering why that should be .  so when they made their move  we were ready .      morrison s fingers drummed on the arm of the chair  his nails making a rhythmic clicking noise .   let me get this straight .  i m to agree to go with natalya boranova to the soviet union  presumably to the region where they are supposedly working on miniaturization .  i am to pretend to help them         you needn t pretend   said rodano comfortably .   help them if you can  especially if that means you get to know the process better .       all right  help them .  and then give you what information i have when i return .       exactly .       what if there is no information .  what if the whole thing is one gigantic bluff or if they re only kidding themselves .  what if they re following some lysenko type down into an empty hole .       then tell us that .  we would love to know that    if it s a matter of knowing and not just thinking .  after all  the soviets  we are pretty certain  are under the impression that we are making progress on the matter of antigravity .  maybe we are and maybe we re not .  they don t know for certain and we re not about to let them find out .  since we re not asking any soviet scientist to come and help us  we re not giving them an easy entry .  for that matter  there s some talk the chinese are working on faster than light travel .  oddly enough  those are two items you mentioned as being theoretically impossible .  i haven t heard that anyone s working on perpetual motion  however .       these are ridiculous games the nations are playing   said morrison .   why don t they cooperate in these matters .  we might as well be in the bad old days .       not quite .  but being in the good new days does not mean we re in heaven .  there is still residual suspicion and there are still attempts to take a giant step forward before someone else does .  maybe it s even a good thing .  if we re driven by selfish motives of aggrandizement  as long as that doesn t lead to war  we may make more rapid progress .  to stop trying to steal a march on neighbors and friends might reduce us to indolence and decay .       so if i go and am eventually in a position to assure you  authoritatively  that the soviets are drilling a dry hole or that they are indeed making progress of such and such a nature  then i will be helping not only the united states  but the whole world  to remain vigorous and progressiveeven including the soviet union .      rodano nodded .   that s a good way to look at it .      morrison said   i have to give you people credit .  you re clever con artists .  however  i don t fall for it .  i favor cooperation among nations and i m not going to play these dangerous twentieth century games in the rational twenty first .  i told dr .  boranova i wasn t going and i m telling you i m not going .       do you understand that it is your government that is asking this of you .       i understand that you are asking me and i m refusing you .  but if it happens that you actually represent the government s views in this  then i am prepared to refuse the government as well .        .     morrison sat there  flushed  chin up .  his heart was beating rapidly and he felt heroic .     nothing can make me change my mind  he thought .  what can they do .  throw me in jail .  what for .  they have to have a charge .     he waited for anger from the other .  for a threat .     rodano merely looked at him with an expression of quiet bemusement .      why do you refuse  dr .  morrison .   he asked .   have you no feelings of patriotism .       patriotism  yes .  insanity  no .       why insanity .       do you know what they plan to do with me .       tell me .       they intend to miniaturize me and place me in a human body to investigate the neurophysical state of a brain cell from the inside .       why should they want you to do that .       they imply it s to help me with my research  which they claim will also help them  but i certainly don t intend to submit to such an experiment .      rodano scratched lightly at his fluffy hair  put it into a mild disarray  and quickly flattened it again as though anxious not to show too much pink skin .     he said   you can t possibly be concerned over this .  you tell me that miniaturization is flatly impossible    in which case  they can t miniaturize you whatever their intentions or desires .       they ll perform some sort of experiment on me .  they say they have miniaturization  which means they are either liars or mad  and in either case i won t have them playing games with me    either to do them pleasure  or to do you pleasure  or to do the whole american government pleasure .       they re not mad   said rodano   and whatever their intentions  they know very well we d hold them responsible for the well being of an american citizen invited by them to their country .       thank you .  thank you .  how would you hold them responsible .  send them a stiff note .  hold one of their citizens in reprisal .  besides  who says they ll execute me publicly in red square .  what if they decide they don t want me to return and talk about their work on miniaturization .  they ll have what they want of me    whatever that may be    and they ll decide that the american government need not benefit in their turn from any knowledge i may have gained from them .  so they arrange a small accident .  so sorry .  so sorry .  and they  of course  will pay reparations to my sorrowing family and send back a flag draped coffin .  no  thank you .  i m not the type for a suicide mission .      rodano said   you dramatize .  you ll be a guest .  you will help them if you can and you needn t be ostentatious about learning things .  we re not asking you to be a spy  we will be grateful for anything you may pick up more or less unavoidably .  what s more  we will have people there who will keep an eye on you if they can .  we intend to see to it that you get back safely         if you can   interposed morrison .      if we can   agreed rodano .   we can t promise you miracles .  would you believe us if we did .       do what you will  this is not a job for me .  i m not that courageous .  i m not planning to become a pawn in some crazy chess game  with my life very possibly at stake  just because you    or the government    ask me to .       you frighten yourself unnecessarily .       not so .  fright has its proper role  it keeps one cautious and alive .  there s a trick to staying alive when you re someone like me  it s called cowardice .  it may not be admirable to be a coward if someone has the muscles and mind of an ox  but it s no crime for a weakling to be one .  i am not so great a coward  however  that i can be forced to take on a suicide role  simply because i fear revealing my weakness .  i reveal it gladly .  i am not brave enough for the role .  now  please leave .      rodano sighed  half shrugged  half smiled  and rose slowly to his feet .   that s it  then .  we can t force you to serve your country if you don t wish to .      he moved toward the door  his feet dragging a little  and then  even with his hand reaching for the doorknob  he turned and said   still  it upsets me a little .  i m afraid i was wrong and i hate to be wrong .       wrong .  what did you do .  bet someone five bucks i d jump at the chance to give my life for my country .       no  i thought you would jump at the chance to advance your career .  after all  you re not getting anywhere as things are .  your ideas are not listened to  your papers are no longer published .  your appointment at your university is not likely to be renewed .  tenure .  forget it .  government grants .  never .  not after you have refused our request .  after this year  you will have no income and no status .  and yet you will not go to the soviet union  as i was sure you would as the one way of salvaging your career .  failing that  what will you do .       my problem .       no .  our problem .  the name of the game in this good new world of ours is technological advance  the prestige  the influence  the abilities that come with being able to do what other powers cannot .  the game is between the two chief contestants and their respective allies  we and they  the u . s .  and the s . u .  for all our circumspect friendship  we still compete .  the counters in the game are scientists and engineers and any disgruntled counter might conceivably be used by the other side .  you are a disgruntled counter  dr .  morrison .  do you understand what i m saying .       i understand that you re about to be offensive .       we have your statement that dr .  boranova invited you to visit the soviet union .  did she  really .  may she not have invited you to stay in the united states and work for the soviet union in return for support for your ideas .       i was right .  you are offensive .       it s my job to be so    if i must .  what if i m right after all and you would jump at the chance of advancing your career .  only this is the way you intend to do it    stay here and accept soviet money or backing in return for giving them whatever information you can .       that is wrong .  you have no evidence suggesting that and you cannot prove it .       but i can suspect it and so can others .  we will then make it our business to keep you under constant surveillance .  you will not be able to do science .  your professional life will be over    entirely .     and you can avoid all that  simply by doing as we ask and going to the soviet union .      morrison s lips tightened and he said  out of a dry throat   you re threatening me in a crude attempt at blackmail and i won t capitulate .  i ll take my chances .  my theories on the brain s thinking center are correct and that will someday be recognized    whatever you or anyone does .       you can t live on  someday .        then i ll die .  i may be a physical coward  but i m not a moral one .  good bye .      rodano  with one last look  half commiserating  left .     and morrison  shaking in a spasm of fear and hopelessness  felt the spirit of defiance leak away  leaving nothing behind but despair .       chapter      taken    if asking politely is useless  take .        dezhnev senior      .     then i ll die  thought morrison .     he hadn t even bothered double locking the door after rodano left .  he sat in the chair  lost in thought  face vacant .  the westering sun slanted in through the window and he didn t bother to push the contact that would opacify the glass .  he simply let it slant in .  in fact  he found a distant hypnotic fascination in watching the dust motes dance .     he had fled from the russian woman in fright  but he had stood up to the american agent  stood up with the courage of    of despair .     and desperation    minus the courage    was all he felt now .  what rodano had said was  after all  true .  his appointment would not be renewed for the coming year and none of the feelers he had sent out had twitched .  he was poison at the academic box office and he lacked the kind of experience  or  more important  the kind of contacts  that would get him a job in the private sector  even if the quiet countervailing effort of an offended government were not taken into account .     what would he do .  go to canada .     there was janvier at mcgill university .  he had once expressed an interest in morrison s ideas .  once .  morrison had not tried mcgill  since he hadn t planned to leave the country .  now his plans were of no account .  he might have to .     there was latin america  where a dozen universities might welcome a northerner who could speak spanish or portuguese    at least after a fashion .  morrison s spanish was poor  his portuguese was nil .     what had he to lose .  there were no family ties .  even his daughters were distant now  fading at the edges  somehow  like old photographs .  he had no friends to speak of    at least none that had survived the disasters of his research .     there was his program  of course  specially designed by himself .  it had been built  in the first place  by a small firm according to his specifications .  since then he had modified it endlessly on his own .  perhaps he should patent it  except that no one but he was ever likely to use it .  he would take it with him  of course  wherever he went .  he had it with him now  in his left inner jacket pocket  within which it bulged like an oversize wallet .     morrison could hear the roughness of his own breathing and he realized that he was escaping from the purposeless merry go round of his thoughts by falling asleep over them .  how could he interest others in anything  he thought bitterly  when he bored even himself .     he was aware that the sun no longer struck his window and that a gathering twilight encompassed his room .  so much the better .     he became conscious of a polite buzz .  it was the room telephone  he realized  but he didn t budge .  morrison let his eyes remain closed .  it was probably this man  this rodano  calling to make a final try .  let him ring .     sleep closed in and morrison s head lolled to one side in so uncomfortable a position that he didn t stay asleep long .     it was perhaps fifteen minutes later that he started awake .  the sky was still blue  but the twilight in his room had darkened and he thought  with some guilt  that he had missed all the papers given in the afternoon .  and then  rebelliously  he thought  good .  why should i want to hear them .     rebellion grew .  what was he doing at the convention anyway .  in three days he had not heard one paper that had interested him  nor had he met anyone who could do his sinking career one bit of good .  what would he do the remaining three days except try to avoid the two people he had met whom he desperately did not want to meet again    boranova and rodano .     he was hungry .  he hadn t had a proper lunch and it was almost dinnertime .  the trouble was that he was in no mood to eat alone in the hotel s plush restaurant and in less of a mood to pay its inflated prices .  the thought of waiting in line for a stool at the coffee shop was even less appetizing .     that decided everything .  he d had enough .  he might as well check out and walk to the train station .   it was not a long walk and the cool evening air would  perhaps  help clear the miseries out of his mind .   it would take him little more than five minutes to pack  he d be on his way in ten .     he went about the  task grimly .  at least he would save half the hotel bill and he would get away from a place that  he was convinced  would bring him only misery if he stayed .     he was quite right  of course  but no prescient bell in his mind rang to inform him that he had already stayed too long .       .     after quickly checking out at the desk downstairs  morrison stepped out of the large glass doors of the hotel  glad to be free  but still ill at ease .  he had carefully investigated the lobby to make sure that neither boranova nor rodano was in sight and now he looked up and down the line of taxis and studied the knots of people moving in and out of the hotel .     all clear    it seemed .     all clear  except for an angry government  nothing accomplished  and endless trouble ahead .  mcgill university seemed more attractive every moment    if he could get in .     he swung down the sidewalk in the darkening evening toward the train station  which was just too far away to be in sight .  he would get home  he calculated  well past midnight and he would have no chance at all of sleeping on the train .  he had a book of crossword puzzles that might occupy him    if the light were good enough .  or       morrison wheeled around at the sound of his name .  he did this automatically  though by rights  under the conditions that prevailed  he should have hurried onward .  there was no one here he wanted to speak to .      al .  al morrison .  good heavens .   the voice was high pitched and morrison didn t recognize it .     nor did he recognize the face .  it was round  middle aged  smooth shaven  and decorated with steel framed glasses .  the person it belonged to was welldressed .     morrison at once felt the usual agony of trying to remember a person who clearly remembered him and who behaved as though they were good friends .  his mouth fell open with the effort of riffling through his mind s card catalog .     the other man seemed to be aware of what was troubling morrison and it didn t seem to bother him .  he said   you don t remember me  i see .  no reason you should .  i m charlie norbert .  we met at a gordon research conference    oh  years ago .  you were questioning one of the speakers on brain function and did a good job .  very incisive .  so it s no wonder i remember you  you see .       ah yes   mumbled morrison  trying to remember when he had last been at a gordon research conference .  about seven years ago  wasn t it .   that s very flattering of you .       we had a long talk about it that evening  dr .  morrison .  i remember because i was so impressed by you .  no reason for you to remember  though .  there s nothing impressive about me .  listen  i came across your name on the list of attendees .  your middle name  jonas  brought you right back .  i wanted to talk to you .  i called your room about half an hour ago  but there was no answer .      norbert seemed to be aware of morrison s suitcase for the first time and said in obvious dismay   are you leaving .       actually  i m trying to catch a train .  sorry .       please give me a few minutes .  i ve been reading about your    notions .      morrison stepped back a little .  even expressed interest in his ideas was not enough at the moment .  besides  the other s after shave lotion was strong and invaded his personal space  as did the man himself .  nothing the other said brought back any memory of him .     morrison said   i m sorry  but if you ve been reading about my notions  you re probably the only one .  i hope you don t mind  but         but i do mind .   norbert s face grew serious .   it strikes me the field isn t properly appreciative of you .       that fact struck me a long time ago  mr .  norbert .       call me charlie .  we were on a first name basis long ago .     you don t have to go unappreciated  you know .       there s no compulsion about it .  i just am and that s it .  well     morrison turned as if to leave .      wait  al .  what if i told you i could get you a new job with people who are sympathetic to your way of thinking .      morrison paused again .   i would say you were dreaming .       i m not .  al  listen to me    boy  am i glad i bumped into you    i want to introduce you to someone .  look  we re starting a new company  genetic mentalics .  we ve got lots of money behind us and big plans .  the trick is to improve the human mind by means of genetic engineering .  we ve been improving computers every year  so why not our personal computer as well .   he tapped his forehead earnestly .   where is he .  i left him in the car when i saw you walk out of the hotel .  you know  you haven t changed much in the years since i last saw you .      morrison was untouched by that .   does this new company want me .       of course it wants you .  we want to change the mind  make it more intelligent  more creative .  but what is it we change in order to accomplish that .  you can tell us .       i m afraid i haven t gotten that far .       we don t expect offhand answers .  we simply want you to work toward it .     listen  whatever your salary is now  we ll double it .  you just tell us your present figure and we ll go to the small trouble of multiplying it by two .  fair enough .  and you ll be your own boss .      morrison frowned .   this is the first time i ve ever met santa claus in a business suit .  smooth shaven  too .  what s the gag .       no gag .     where is he .     ah  he moved the car to get it out of the line of traffic .     look  he s my boss  craig levinson .  we re not doing you a favor  al .  you ll be doing us a favor .  come with me .      morrison hesitated only momentarily .  it s always darkest before the dawn .  when you re down  there s no direction but up .  lightning does strike sometimes .     he was suddenly full of old saws .     he let himself be led by the other  hanging back only slightly .     norbert waved and called out   i found him .  this is the fellow i told you about .  al morrison .  he s the one we need .      a grave middle aged face looked out from behind the steering wheel of a late model automobile  whose color was something uncertain in the gathering darkness .  the face smiled  teeth gleaming whitely  and the voice that belonged to it said   great .      the trunk door lifted upward as they approached and charlie norbert took morrison s suitcase .   here  let me unload you .   he swung it into the trunk and closed the door .      wait   said morrison  rather surprised .      don t worry  al .  if you miss this train  there s another .  if you want  we ll hire a limousine to take you home    eventually .  get in .       into the car .       certainly .   the back door had swung open invitingly .      where will we be going .       look   said norbert  his voice dropping half an octave and getting much softer .   let s not waste time .  get in .      morrison felt something hard against his side and twisted in order to see what it was .     he felt it    whatever it was    push against him .  norbert s voice was a whisper now .   let s be very quiet  al .  let s not make a fuss .      morrison got into the car and was suddenly very frightened .  he knew that norbert was holding a gun .       .     morrison pushed himself across the back seat  wondering if he could reach the other door and get out again .  even if norbert had a gun  would he want to use it in a hotel parking lot with a hundred people within thirty meters .  after all  even if the gun were silenced  his sudden collapse would surely draw attention .     the possibility vanished quickly  however  when a third man got into the other door  a large one who grunted as he bent himself into the car and who looked at morrison  if not malevolently  then certainly with an expression that was free of any trace of friendship .     morrison found himself squeezed between a man on either side and was incapable of stirring .  the car moved forward smoothly and picked up speed once it moved onto the highway .     morrison said in a choked voice   what is this all about .  where are we going .  what are you going to do .      norbert s voice  without the falsetto and without the synthetic bonhomie  was grim .   no need to worry  dr .  morrison .  we have no intention of harming you .  we just want you with us .       i was with you back there .    he tried to point  back there   but the man on his right leaned against him and he could not free his right hand to do so .       but we want you to be with us    somewhere else .      morrison tried to sound threatening .   see here  you re kidnapping me .  that s a serious offense .       no  dr .  morrison  let s not call it kidnapping .  let s call it being friendly in a rather forcible way .       whatever you call it  this is illegal .  or are you the police .  if so  identify yourself and tell me what i ve done and what this is all about .       we are not charging you with anything .  i told you .  we just want you with us .  i d advise you to keep quiet  doctor  and remain calm .  it will be better for you .       i can t remain calm if i don t know what s going on .       force yourself   said norbert unsympathetically .     morrison couldn t think of anything further to say that would help matters and  without actually becoming calm  fell silent .     the stars were out now .  the night was as clear as the day had been .  the automobile moved through traffic consisting of a thousand cars  each of which had someone behind the wheel who was going quietly about his or her ordinary business without any awareness that in a nearby car a crime was being committed .     morrison s heart continued working overtime and his lips trembled .  he couldn t help but be nervous .  they said they meant him no harm  but how far could he trust them .  so far  everything that this man on his left had told him had been a lie .     he tried to be calm  but to what organ of his body did he speak in order to achieve calmness .  he closed his eyes and forced himself to breathe deeply and slowly    and to think rationally .  he was a scientist .  he had to think rationally .     these must be rodano s colleagues .  they were taking him to headquarters  where the pressure to force him to undertake the mission would be increased .  however  they couldn t succeed .  he was an american and that meant he could be treated only according to certain established rules  certain legal procedures  and certain customary modes of action .  there could be nothing arbitrary  nothing improvised .     he drew another deep breath .  he merely had to keep saying no and they would be helpless .     there was a small lurch and his eyes flew open .     the car had turned off the highway onto a narrow dirt road .     automatically  he said   where are we going .      there was no answer .     the automobile bumped along for a considerable distance and then turned into a field  obscure and dark .  in the glow of the car s headlights  morrison made out a helicopter  its rotors turning slowly and its motor making only the slightest purr .     it was one of the new kind  its sound waves suppressed  its smooth surface absorbing  rather than reflecting  radar beams .  its popular name was the  hushicopter .      morrison s heart sank .  if they were using a hushicopter  which were extremely expensive and quite rare  then he was being treated as no ordinary prey .  he was being treated as a big fish .     but i m not a big fish  he thought desperately .     the automobile stopped and the headlights went out .  there was still the faint purr and a few dim violet lights  hardly visible  marked the spot where the hushicopter sat .     the large man at morrison s right threw open the car door and  again with a grunt  lowered his head and forced his way out .  his large hand reached in for morrison .     morrison tried to shrink away .   where are you taking me .      the large man seized his upper arm .   come out .  enough talking .      morrison felt himself half lifted  half pulled out of the car .  his shoulder hurt as it might be expected to do  considering that it had been nearly yanked out of its socket .     but he disregarded the pain .  it was the first time he had heard the large man speak .  the words were in english  but the accent was thickly russian .     morrison felt cold .  these were not americans who had him .        .     morrison had entered the hushicopter    though that is not an accurate description of what took place .  to enter implies a voluntary action and he had been much more nearly pushed into the vehicle .     it had pulsed its way through the darkness as he sat between the same two men between whom he had sat in the car .  it was almost as though nothing had changed  although the whisper of the rotors was distinctly more hypnotic than the purr of the automobile engine had been .     after an hour    or possibly less    they came out of the darkness of the air and drifted downward toward the darkness of the ocean .  morrison could tell it was the ocean because he could smell it  was vaguely aware of the fog of droplets in the air  and because he could make out  very dimly  the dark bulk of a ship    dark on dark .     how could the hushicopter make its way out to the ocean and pinpoint a ship .     the right ship  he was sure .  even in his half stupor of despair  morrison s mind could not help searching for solutions .  undoubtedly  the hushicopter pilot had followed a shielded and pseudorandomized radio beam .  the beam seemed random but  given the key  it could be found to have order and its source could be identified .  properly done  the pseudorandomness could not be penetrated even by quite an advanced computer .     nor was the ship more than a temporary stopping place .  he was allowed to use the head  given time for a hurried meal of bread and thick soup  which he found most welcome   and was then ushered    with the unceremonious hustle he had begun to accept as a fact of life    into a medium sized airplane .  it was a ten seater  he counted automatically   but except for the two pilots and  sitting in the rear  the two men who had been on either side of him in the car and in the hushicopter  he was alone in the plane .     morrison looked back at his guards  whom he just made out in the very dim light that filled the plane s interior .  there was enough room in the plane so that they were not forced to hem him in .  nor did they need to do so out of fear that he might break and run for it .  here  he could break out only onto the deck of the ship .  once the plane took off  he could break out only into the open air with nothing beneath him but water of indefinite depth .     he wondered numbly why they were not taking off and then the door opened to admit another passenger .  despite the dimness  he recognized her at once .     he had met her for the first time only twelve hours before  but how could he have progressed from that first moment of meeting to the present moment in only twelve hours .     boranova sat down in the seat next to his and said in a low voice   i am sorry  dr .  morrison .   she was speaking in russian .     and  as though that were the signal  the sound of the airplane s engines deepened and he felt himself pressed against his seat as the plane moved steeply upward .     morrison stared at natalya boranova  trying to collect his thoughts .  dimly  he felt a desire to say something to her in a suave  imperturbable way  but there was no chance of that .     his voice was a creak and even after he cleared his throat  all he could say was  i ve been kidnapped .       that could not be helped  dr .  morrison .  i regret this .  i really do .  i have my duty  you understand .  i had to bring you back by persuasion if i could .  otherwise     she let the last word hang .      but you can t behave in this fashion .  this is not the twentieth century .   he choked a little in his earnest attempt to stifle his sense of indignation to the point where he could speak sensibly .   i am not a recluse .  i am not a derelict .  i will be missed and american intelligence is perfectly aware that we spoke and they know that you wanted me to come to the soviet union .  they will know i have been kidnapped    they may know it already    and your government will find itself in the middle of a kind of international incident it will want no part of .       not so   said boranova earnestly  her dark eyes gazing levelly into his .   not so .  of course your people know what has happened  but they have no objections .  dr .  morrison  the soviet union s intelligence operations are marked both by advanced technology and by over a century of close study of american psychology .  i have no doubt that american intelligence is just as advanced .  it is this equality of expertise  which is shared by several of the other geographical units of the planet  that helps to keep us in cooperation .  each of us is firmly convinced that no one else is far ahead on a road of its own .       i don t know what you re driving at   said morrison .  the planet was arrowing through the night  speeding toward the eastern dawn .      what concerns american intelligence most right now is our attempt at miniaturization .       attempt .   morrison said with a note of sardonic amusement .      successful attempt .     the americans don t know that it is successful .  they don t know if the miniaturization project may not be a mask behind which something altogether different is going on .  they know we re doing something .  i m sure they have a detailed map of the area in the soviet union where the experiments are proceeding    every building  every truck convoy .  they undoubtedly have agents who are doing their best to penetrate the project .      naturally  we re doing our best to counter all this .  we are not indignant .  we know a great deal about the american experiments in antigravity and it would be naive to take the attitude that we can probe and that the americans can t  that we can have our successes  but the american mustn t .      morrison rubbed his eyes .  boranova s quiet  even voice was making him realize that his ordinary bedtime was past and that he was sleepy .  he said   what has this to do with the fact that my country will bitterly resent my kidnapping .       listen to me  dr .  morrison .  understand me .  why should they .  we need you  but they can t be certain why .  they have no reason to suppose there is anything of value in your neurophysical notions .  they must think we are following a false trail and will get nothing out of you  but they can have no objection to getting an american into the miniaturization project .  if this american finds out what it is all about  the information will prove valuable to them .     don t you think they might reason in this fashion  dr .  morrison .       i don t know how they would reason   said morrison carefully .   it is not a matter of interest to me .       but you spoke to a francis rodano after you left me so suddenly .     you see  we know even that .  would you care to tell me that he did not suggest that you play along with us and go to the soviet union in order to find out what you might find out .       you mean he wants me to play the spy .       doesn t he .  didn t he make that suggestion .      again morrison ignored the question .  he said   and since you are convinced i am to be a spy  you will have me executed after i do whatever it is you want me to do .  isn t that what happens to spies .       you ve been viewing too many old fashioned movies  dr .  morrison .  in the first place  we will see to it that you don t find out anything important    anything at all .  in the second place  spies are too valuable a commodity to destroy .  they are useful as trading units for any agents of ours that may be in american hands    or in foreign hands generally .  i believe that the united states takes much the same attitude .      morrison said   to begin with  then  i am not a spy  madame .  i am not going to be a spy .  i know nothing about american intelligence operations .  also  i m not going to do anything for you .       i m not at all sure about that  dr .  morrison .  i think you ll decide to work with us .       what do you have in mind .  will you starve me till i agree .  beat me .  keep me in solitary confinement .  put me in a work camp .      boranova frowned and shook her head slowly in what seemed to be genuine shock .   really  doctor  what are these things you suggest .  are we back in the days when you were loudly proclaiming us to be an evil empire and inventing horror stories about us .  i don t say that we might not be tempted to use strong measures if you intransigeantly refuse .  necessity drives sometimes  you know .     but we won t have to .  i m convinced of that .       what convinces you .   morrison asked wearily .      you re a scientist .  you re a brave man .       i .  brave .  lady  lady  what do you know about me .       that you have a peculiar viewpoint .  that you have upheld it all this time .  that you have watched your career go downhill .  that you have convinced nobody .  and that  despite all this  you cling to your view and do not budge from what you are certain is right .  is not this the act of a brave man .      morrison nodded .   yes .  yes .  it is a kind of bravery .  still  there are a thousand crackpots in the history of science who clung all their lives to some ridiculous view against logic  against evidence  against their own self interest .  i may be just another one of them .       in that case  you might be wrong  but you would still be brave .  do you think bravery is entirely a matter of physical daring .       i know it is not .  there are all kinds of bravery and perhaps   he said bitterly   every one of those kinds of bravery is a mark of insanity or  at any rate  folly .       surely you do not consider yourself a coward .       why not .  in some ways  i flatter myself by saying that i am sane .       but mad in your stubborn views concerning neurophysics .       i would not be surprised .       but surely you think your views are correct .       certainly  dr .  boranova .  that would be part of my madness  would it not .      boranova shook her head .   you are not a serious man .  i ve said that before .  my countryman shapirov thinks you re right    or  if not right  at least a genius .       next best thing  certainly .  part of his madness  too .       shapirov s opinion is very special .       to you  i m sure .     look  lady  i am tired .  i am so groggy  i don t know what i m saying .  i m not sure all this is real .  i hope it isn t .  let me just    just rest a little .      boranova sighed and a look of concern entered her eyes .   yes  of course  my poor friend .  we wish you no harm .  please believe that .      morrison let his head bow down on his chest .  his eyes closed .  dimly  he felt himself pushed gently to one side and a pillow placed under his head .     time passed .  a dreamless time .     when he opened his eyes  he was still on the plane .  there were no lights  but he knew without any doubt whatever that he was still on the plane .     he said   dr .  boranova .      she replied instantly   yes  dr .  morrison .       we re not being pursued .       not at all .  there are several of our own planes flying distant interference  but they have had nothing to do .  come  my friend  we want you and your government wants us to have you .       and you still insist that you have miniaturization .  that it is not madness .  or a hoax .       you will see for yourself .  and you will see what a wonder it is  so that you will want to be part of it .  you will demand to be part of it .       and what will you be doing with it   asked morrison thoughtfully   assuming this is not an elaborate joke you are playing on me .  do you plan to make a weapon of it .  transport an army in a plane like this .  infiltrate each land with an invisible host .  that sort of thing .       how revolting .   she cleared her throat as though she were tempted to spit with disgust .   have we not enough land .  enough people .  enough resources .  have we not our large share of space .  are there not more important things to do with miniaturization .  can it be that you are so twisted and distorted that you do not see what it will mean as a research tool .  imagine the study of living systems that it will make possible  the study of crystal chemistry and solid state systems  the construction of ultraminiaturized computers and devices of all sorts .  think further of what we might learn of physics if we can alter planck s constant to suit ourselves .  what might we not learn of cosmology .      morrison struggled to sit upright .  he was still woozy  but there was an incipient dawn outside the plane windows and he could see boranova very dimly .     he said   is that what you wish to do with it  then .  noble scientific endeavors .       what would your government do with it if you had it .  try to achieve a sudden military superiority and restore the bad old days .       no .  of course not .       so that only you are noble and only we are terribly evil .  do you honestly believe that .     it may be  of course  that if miniaturization becomes sufficiently successful  the soviet union may achieve a lead in the development of a space centered society .  think of transporting miniaturized material from one world to another  of sending a million colonists in a spaceship that would house only two or three human beings of normal size .  space will acquire a soviet coloring  a soviet tinge    not because the soviet people will dominate and be masters  but because soviet thought will have won in the battle of ideas .  and what is wrong with that .      morrison shook his head in the dimness .   then i certainly won t help you .  why should you expect me to .  i won t fasten soviet thought on the universe .  i prefer american thought and tradition .       you think you do and i don t blame you for it .  but we will persuade you .  you will see .       you won t .      boranova said   my dear friend albert    if i may call you that .  i have said that we will be admired for our progress .  do you think you will be immune .     but let us leave such discussions for another time .      she pointed out the plane window at the gray sea beneath  which was just becoming visible .      we are now over the mediterranean   she said   and soon we will be over the black sea and then across the volga to malenkigrad    smalltown  in english  eh .     and the sun will have risen when we land .  that will be symbolic .  a new day .  new light .  i predict you will be eager to help us establish this new day and i would not be surprised if you never wish to leave the soviet union again .       without your forcing me to stay .       we will fly you home freely if you ask us to    once you have helped us .       i won t help you .       you will .       and i demand now that i be returned .       now doesn t count   said boranova cheerfully .     and they flew the last several hundred kilometers to malenkigrad .       chapter      malenkigrad    a pawn is the most important piece on the chessboard    to a pawn .        dezhnev senior    francis rodano was at his office early the next morning  which was monday and the beginning of the week .  that he had worked on sunday was common enough not to surprise him .  that he had slept at all during the night just completed did .     when he arrived  half an hour before the official start of the day  jonathan winthrop was already there .  that did not surprise rodano  either .     winthrop walked into rodano s office within two minutes of the latter s arrival .  he leaned against the wall  the palms of his large hands hugging his elbows  his left leg crossing his right  so that the toe of his left shoe was digging into the carpet .      you look worn out  frank   he said  his eyebrows hunching low over his dark eyes .     rodano looked up at the other s shock of coarse gray hair  which routinely deprived him of any claim of his own to splendor of appearance  and said   i feel worn out  but i was hoping it didn t show .   rodano was very aware of having gone through the morning s rituals thoroughly and carefully and of having dressed with considerable judgment .      it shows  though .  your face is the mirror of your soul .  some agent in the field you d have made .      rodano said   we re not all made for the field .       i know .  and we re not all made for desk work  either .   winthrop rubbed his bulbous nose as though he were anxious to file it down to normal size .   i take it you re worried about your scientist  what s his name .       his name is albert jonas morrison   said rodano wearily .  there was this pretense at the department of not knowing morrison s name  as though everyone was anxious to emphasize that the project wasn t theirs .      okay .  i have no objection to your mentioning his name .  i take it you re worried about him .       yes  i m worried about him  along with a lot of other things .  i wish i could see things more clearly .       who doesn t .   winthrop sat down .   look  there s no use worrying .  you ve handled this from the start  and i ve been willing to let you do so because you re a good man .  i m perfectly satisfied you ve done all you could to make this work because one thing about you is that you understand the russkies .      rodano winced .   don t call them that .  you ve been watching too many twentieth century movies .  they re not all russians  any more than we re all anglo saxons .  they re soviets .  if you want to understand them  try to understand how they think of themselves .       sure .  anything you say .  have you figured out what s so important about your scientist .       nothing  as far as i know .  no one takes him seriously except the soviets .       do you think the soviets know something we don t .       a few things  i m sure  but i haven t any notion of what they see in morrison .  it s not the soviets  either .  it s one soviet scientist    a theoretical physicist named shapirov .  it s possible that he s the guy who worked out the method of miniaturization    if the method has really been worked out at all .  scientists outside the soviet union are ambivalent about shapirov .  he s erratic and  to put it kindly  eccentric .  the soviets are all gung ho on him  however  and he s all gung ho on morrison  though that may just be another sign of his eccentricity .  then the interest in morrison recently graduated from curiosity to desperation .       ah .  and how do you know that  frank .       partly from contacts inside the soviet union .       ashby .       partly .       good agent .       at it too long .  needs to be replaced .       i don t know .  let s not retire a winner .       in any case   said rodano  unwilling to fight the point   there was a sudden multiplication of interest in morrison  on whom i d been keeping tabs for a couple of years .       this shapirov  i suppose  had another brainstorm about morrison and persuaded the russ   soviets they needed him .       perhaps  but the funny thing is that shapirov seems to have dropped out of the news recently .       out of favor .       no sign of that .       could be  frank .  if he s been feeding the soviets a line of garbage about miniaturization and they ve caught on to it  i wouldn t want to be in his shoes .  these may be the good new days  but the soviets have never learned to have a sense of humor about being made to look or feel foolish .       it could be that he s gone underground because the miniaturization project is heating up .  and that could also explain the sudden desperation about morrison .       what does he know about miniaturization .       only that he s sure it s impossible .       it makes no sense  does it .      rodano said carefully   that s why we let him be taken .  there s always the hope it will shake up the pieces and that they may then come together in a new way that will begin to make sense .      winthrop looked at his watch .   he should be there by now .  malenkigrad .  what a name .  no news of any plane crash last night anywhere in the world  so i guess he s there .       yes    and just the wrong person to send  too  except he was the one that the soviets wanted .       why is he wrong .  is he shaky ideologically .       i doubt that he has an ideology .  he s a zero .  all last night i ve been thinking that it s all a mistake .  he lacks guts and he s not very bright  except in an academic sense .  i don t think he can possibly think on his feet    if he ever has to .  he s not going to be smart enough to find out anything .  i suspect he ll be in one long panic from beginning to end and i ve been thinking for hours now that we ll never see him again .  they ll imprison him    or kill him    and i ve sent him there .       that s just middle of the night blues  frank .  no matter how dumb he is  he ll be able to tell us whether he watched a demonstration of miniaturization  for instance  or what it was they did to him .  he doesn t have to be a shrewd observer .  he need only tell us what happened and we will do the necessary thinking .       but  jon  we may never see him again .      winthrop placed his hand on rodano s shoulder .   don t begin by assuming disaster .  i ll see that ashby gets the word .  if something can be done  it will be done and i m sure the russ   soviets will hit a sane moment and let him go if we put on enough quiet pressure when the time comes .  don t make yourself sick over it .  it s a move in a complex game and if it doesn t work  it doesn t work .  there are a thousand other moves on the board .         .     morrison felt haggard .  he had slept through much of monday  hoping it would rid him of the worst of his jet lag .  he had eaten gratefully of the food that had been brought in toward evening  had partaken even more gratefully of a shower .  fresh clothing was given him that fit rather indifferently    but what of that .  and he had spent monday night alternately sleeping and reading .     and brooding .     the more he thought of it  the more convinced he was that natalya boranova was correct in her estimate that he was here only because the united states was satisfied to have him here .  rodano had urged him to go  had vaguely threatened him with further career troubles  how much deeper in trouble could he possibly get .   if he did not go .  why  then  should they object to his having been taken .  they might object on principle or feel there was the danger of setting an undesirable precedent  but apparently their own eagerness to have him go had overruled that .     what  then  would be the point in demanding to be taken to the nearest american consul or in making wild threats of american retaliation .     as a matter of fact  now that the deed had been done with american connivance    surely with american connivance    it would be impossible for the united states to take open action on his behalf or express any indignation whatever .  questions would inevitably arise as to how the soviets had managed to spirit him off and there would be no answer other than american stupidity or american connivance .  and surely the united states would not want to have the world come to either conclusion .     of course  he could see why this had been done .  it was as rodano had explained .  the american government wanted information and he was in an ideal position to get it for them .     ideal .  in what way .  the soviets would not be fools enough to let him get any information they didn t want him to have and if they thought that the information he managed to get  or couldn t avoid getting  was too much  they would not be fools enough to let him go .     the more he thought of that  the more he felt that  dead or alive  he would never see the united states again and that the american intelligence community would shrug its collective shoulders and write it all off as an unavoidable miss    nothing gained but  then again  nothing much lost .     morrison assessed himself    albert jonas morrison  ph . d .   assistant professor of neurophysics  originator of a theory of thought that remained unaccepted and all but ignored  failed husband  failed father  failed scientist  and now failed pawn .  nothing much lost .     in the depth of the night  in a hotel room in a town he didn t even know the location of  in a nation that for over a century had seemed the natural enemy of his own  however much a spirit of reluctant and suspicious cooperation might rule in the last few decades  morrison found himself weeping out of self pity and out of sheer childish helplessness    out of a feeling of utter humiliation that no one should think him worth struggling for or even wasting regret over .     and yet    and here a small spark of pride managed to surface    the soviets had wanted him .  they had gone to considerable trouble to get him .  when persuasion had failed  they had not hesitated to use force .  they couldn t possibly have been certain that the united states would studiously look the other way .  they had risked an international incident  however slightly  to get him .     and they were going to considerable trouble to keep him safe now that they had him .  he was here alone  but the windows  he noted  had bars on them .  the door was not locked  but when  earlier  he had opened it  two uniformed and armed men looked up from where they had been lounging against the opposite wall and asked him if he were in need of anything .  he didn t like being in prison  but it was a measure  of sorts  of his value    at least here .     how long would this last .  even though they might be under the impression that his theory of thought was correct  morrison himself had to admit that it remained a fact that all the evidence he had gathered was circumstantial and terribly indirect    and that no one had been able to confirm his most useful findings .  what would happen if the soviets found that they  too  could not confirm them or if  on closer consideration  they found it all too gaseous  too vaporous  too atmospheric to trouble with .     boranova had said shapirov had thought highly of morrison s suggestions  but shapirov was a notorious wild man who changed his mind daily .     and if shapirov shrugged and turned away  what would the soviets do .  if their american trophy were of no use to them  would they return him contemptuously to the united states  one more humiliation  in a way  or hide their own folly in taking him  by imprisoning him indefinitely    or worse .     in fact  it had been some soviet functionary  some specific person  who must have decided to kidnap him and risk an incident and if the whole thing turned sour  what would that functionary do to save his own neck    undoubtedly at the expense of morrison s .     by dawn on tuesday  when morrison had been in the soviet union for a full day  he had convinced himself that every path into the future  every alternative route that could possibly be taken  would end in disaster for him .  he watched the day break  but his spirits remained in deepest night .        .     there was a brusque knock at his door at   a . m .  he opened it a crack and the soldier on the other side pushed it open farther  as though to indicate who it was who controlled the door .     the soldier said  more loudly than necessary   madame boranova will be here in half an hour to take you to breakfast .  be ready .      while he dressed hurriedly and made use of an electric razor of rather ancient design by american standards  he wondered why on earth he had been faintly astonished at hearing the soldier speak of madame boranova .  the archaic  comrade  had long passed out of use .     it made him feel irritable and foolish  too  since of what value was it to brood over tiny things in the midst of the vast morass in which he found himself .     except that that was what people did  he knew .     boranova was ten minutes late .  she knocked more gently than the soldier had and when she entered said   how do you feel  dr .  morrison .       i feel kidnapped   he said stiffly .      aside from that .  have you had enough sleep .       i may have .  i can t tell .  frankly  madame  i m in no mood to tell .  what do you want of me .       at the moment  nothing but to take you to breakfast .  and please  dr .  morrison  do believe that i am as much under compulsion as you are .  i assure you that i would rather  at this moment  be with my little aleksandr .  i have neglected him sadly in recent months and nikolai is not pleased at my absence  either .  but when he married me  he knew i had a career  as i keep telling him .       as far as i m concerned  you are free to send me back to my own country and spend all your time with aleksandr and nikolai .       ah  if that could be so    but it cannot .  so come  let us go to breakfast .  we could eat here  but you would feel imprisoned .  let us eat in the dining room and you will feel better .       will i .  those two soldiers outside will follow us  won t they .       regulations  dr .  morrison .  this is a high security zone .  they must guard you until someone in charge is convinced that it is safe not to guard you    and it would be difficult to convince them of that .  it is their job not to be convinced .       i ll bet   said morrison  shrugging himself into the jacket they had given him  which was rather tight under the armpits .      they will in no way interfere with us  however .       but if i suddenly break away or even just move in an unauthorized direction  i assume they will shoot me dead .       no  that would be bad for them .  you are valuable alive  not dead .  they would pursue you and  eventually  seize you .     but then  i m sure you understand that you must do nothing that would be uselessly troublesome .      morrison frowned  making little effort to hide his anger .   when do i get my own baggage back .  my own clothes .       in time .  the first order of business is to eat .      the dining room  which they reached by an elevator and a rather long walk along a deserted corridor  was not very large .  it contained a dozen tables  each one seating six  and it was not crowded .     boranova and morrison were alone at their table and no one offered to join them .  the two soldiers were at a table near the door and though they each ate enough for two  they faced morrison and their eyes never left him for more than a second or two .     there was no menu .  food was simply brought to them and morrison found he had no quarrel over the quantity .  there were hard boiled eggs  boiled potatoes  cabbage soup  and caviar  along with thick slices of dark bread .  they were not given out in individual portions  but were placed in the center of the table where each person could help himself .     perhaps  thought morrison  they bring enough food to feed six and  since we two are the only ones here  we should only consume a third .  and after a while  he had to admit that with a full stomach he felt a little mollified .  he said   madame boranova         why not call me natalya  dr .  morrison .  we are very informal here and we will be colleagues for perhaps an extended period of time .  the repeated  madames  will give me a headache .  my friends even call me natasha .  it could come to that .      she smiled  but morrison felt stubbornly indisposed to be ingratiated .  he said   madame  when i feel friendly  i will certainly act friendly  but as a victim and an involuntary presence here  i prefer a certain formality .      boranova sighed .  she bit off a sizable chunk of bread and chewed moodily .  then  swallowing  she said   let it be as you wish  but please spare me the  madames .   let me have my professional title    and i don t mean  academician .   too many syllables .     but i interrupted you .       dr .  boranova   said morrison  more coldly than before .   you haven t told me what it is you want of me .  you mentioned miniaturization  but you know and i know that that is impossible .  i think that you spoke of it merely to mislead    to mislead me and to mislead anyone overhearing us .  let us drop that  then .  surely here we have no need to play games .  tell me why i am really here .  after all  eventually you must  since you apparently expect me to be of some use to you and i can t be that if i am left completely ignorant of what it is that you wish .      boranova shook her head .   you are a hard man to convince  dr .  morrison .  i have been truthful with you from the start .  the project is one of miniaturization .       i cannot believe that .       why  then  are you in the city of malenkigrad .       small city .  littletown .  tinyburg .   said morrison  feeling a pleasure in hearing his own voice sound the phrases in english .   perhaps because it is a small city .       as i have had periodic occasion to say  dr .  morrison  you are not a serious man .  still  you will not be in doubt long .  there are a few people you should meet .  one of them should  in fact  be here by now .   she looked around with an annoyed frown .   so where is he .      morrison said   i notice that no one approaches us .  every once in a while  the people at the other tables look at me  but then they look away if they catch my eye .       they have been warned   said boranova absently .   we will not waste your time with irrelevancies and almost everyone here is an irrelevancy as far as you are concerned .  but some are not .  where is he .   she rose .   dr .  morrison  excuse me .  i must find him .  i will not be gone long .       is it safe to leave me .   said morrison sardonically .      the soldiers will remain  dr .  morrison .  please do not give them cause to react .  intellect is not their forte and they are trained to follow orders without the painful necessity of thinking  so they might easily hurt you .       don t worry .  i ll be careful .      she left  moving hurriedly out the door after exchanging a few words with the soldiers as she passed .     morrison watched her go  then glanced over the dining room morosely .  having found nothing of interest  he bent his eyes upon his clasped hands on the table and then stared at the still sizable portions of unconsumed food before him .      are you all through  comrade .      morrison looked up sharply .  he had decided  comrade  was an archaism  hadn t he .        a woman was standing  looking at him  with one balled fist on her hip in a negligent manner .  she was a reasonably plump woman in a white uniform  slightly stained .  her hair was reddish brown  as were her eyebrows  which arched disdainfully .      who are you .   asked morrison  frowning .      my name .  valeri paleron .  my function .  hardworking serving woman  but soviet citizen and member of the party .  i brought you this food .  didn t you notice me .  am i beneath your notice  perhaps .      morrison cleared his throat .   i m sorry  miss .  i have other things on my mind .     but you had better leave the food .  someone else is supposed to be coming here  i think .       ah .  and the tsarina .  she will be back  too  i suppose .       the tsarina .       you don t think we have tsarinas any longer in the soviet union .  think again  comrade .  this boranova  the granddaughter of peasants and a long line of peasants  considers herself quite a lady  i m sure .   she made a sound with her lips like a long  psh sh sh   redolent with contempt and a touch of herring .     morrison shrugged .   i do not know her very well .       you are an american  aren t you .      morrison said sharply   why do you say that .       because of the way you speak russian .  with that accent  what would you be .  the son of tsar nicholas the tyrant .       what s wrong with the way i speak russian .         it clashes as though you learned it in school .  you can hear an american a kilometer away as soon as he says   a glass of vodka  please .   he is not as bad as an englishman  of course .  him you can hear two kilometers away .       well  then  i m an american .       and you ll be going home someday .       i certainly hope so .      the serving woman nodded her head quietly  pulled out a rag  and wiped the table thoughtfully .   i would like to visit the united states someday .      morrison nodded .   why not .       i need a passport .       of course .       and how does a simple  loyal serving woman get one .       i suppose you must apply for one .       apply .  if i go to a functionary and i say   i  valeri paleron  wish to visit the united states   he will say   why .        and why do you want to go .       to see the country .  the people .  the wealth .  i am curious how they live .     that would not be reason enough .       say something else   said morrison .   say you want to write a book about the united states as a lesson to soviet youth .       do you know how many books        she stiffened and began to wipe the table again  suddenly absorbed in her work .     morrison looked up .  boranova was standing there  her eyes hard and angry .  she uttered a harsh monosyllable that morrison didn t recognize but that he could have sworn was an epithet and not a very polite one  either .     the serving woman flushed dully .  boranova made a small gesture with her hand and the woman turned and left .     morrison noticed that a man stood behind boranova    short  thick necked  with narrowed eyes  large ears  and a broad shouldered  muscular body .  his hair was black  longer than usual for a russian  and it was in wild disarray  as though he clutched at it a great deal .     boranova made no move to introduce him .  she said   was that woman talking to you .       yes   said morrison .      she recognized you to be an american .       she said my accent made it obvious .       and she said she wants to visit the united states .       yes  she did .       what did you say .  did you offer to help her go there .       i advised her to apply for a passport if she wanted to go .       nothing more .       nothing more .      boranova said with discontent   you must pay no attention to her .  she is an ignorant and uncultured woman .     let me introduce to you my friend  arkady vissarionovich dezhnev .  this is dr .  albert jonas morrison  arkady .      dezhnev managed a clumsy bow and said   i have heard of you  dr .  morrison .  academician shapirov has spoken of you often .      morrison said coldly   i am flattered .     but tell me  dr .  boranova  if that serving woman annoys you so much  it should be an easy task to have her replaced or transferred .      dezhnev laughed harshly .   not a chance  comrade american    which i expect is what she called you         not actually .       then she would have sooner or later  had we not interrupted you .  that woman  i suspect  may be an intelligence operator and is one of those who keeps a close eye on us .      but why    .       because with an operation like this  no one can be trusted entirely .  when you americans are engaged in breakthrough science  are you not kept under close observation .       i don t know   said morrison stiffly .   i have never been engaged in any breakthrough science that my government has been in the least interested in .     but what i was going to ask is  why does that woman act as she does if she is an intelligence agent .       to be a provocateur  obviously .  to say outrageous things and to see what she can trip someone else into saying .      morrison nodded .   well  it s your worry  not mine .       as you say   said dezhnev .  he turned to boranova .   natasha  have you told him yet .       please  arkady        now come  natasha .  as my father used to say   if you must pull a tooth  it is mistaken kindness to pull it slowly .   let s tell him .       i have told him we re involved in miniaturization .       is that all .   said dezhnev .  he sat down  pulled his chair next to that of morrison  and leaned toward him .  morrison  with his personal space invaded  automatically withdrew .  dezhnev came closer still and said   comrade american  my friend natasha is a romantic and she is convinced that you will want to help us for love of science .  she feels that we can persuade you to do gladly what must be done .  she is wrong .  you will not be persuaded any more than you were persuaded to come here voluntarily .       arkady  you are being boorish   snapped boranova .      no  natasha  i am being honest    which is sometimes the same thing .  dr .  morrison    or albert  to avoid formality  which i hate     he shuddered dramatically     since you won t be persuaded and since we have no time  you will do what we want by force  as you were brought here by force .      boranova said   arkady  you promised you wouldn t         i do not care .  i have thought since i promised and i have decided that the american must know what he faces .  it will be easier for us    and it will be easier for him  too .      morrison looked from one to another and his throat tightened so that it grew difficult to breathe .  whatever it was they planned for him  he knew he would be given no choice .        .     morrison continued to be silent while dezhnev  unconcerned  proceeded to eat his own breakfast with relish .     the dining room had more or less emptied out and the serving woman  valeri paleron  was carrying off the remains and was wiping down the chairs and tables .     dezhnev caught her eye  beckoned to her  and indicated that the table was to be cleared .     morrison said   so i have no choice .  no choice in what .       hah .  has natasha not even told you that .   replied dezhnev .      she told me on several occasions that i was to be involved in miniaturization problems .  but i know    and you know    that there is no miniaturization problem except that of trying to turn an impossibility into fact    and i certainly can t help you in that .  what i want to know is what you really have for me to do .      dezhnev looked amused .   why do you think miniaturization is impossible .       because it is .       and if i tell you that we have it .       then i say show me .      dezhnev turned to boranova  who drew a deep breath and nodded .     dezhnev rose .  he said   come .  we will take you to the grotto .      morrison bit his lip in vexation .  small frustrations loomed large .   i do not know that russian word you ve used .      boranova said   we have an underground laboratory here .  we call it the grotto .  it is one of our poetic words  not used in ordinary conversation .  the grotto is the site of our miniaturization project .         .     outside an air jet awaited them .  morrison blinked  adjusting his eyes to the sunlight .  he regarded the jet curiously .  it lacked the elaboration of american models and seemed little more than a sled with small seats and with a complex engine in front .  it would be absolutely useless in cold or wet weather and he wondered whether the soviets had an enclosed version for those times .  perhaps this was just a summer runabout .     dezhnev took the controls and boranova directed morrison into the seat behind dezhnev  while she took the one to his right side .  she turned to the guards and said   go back to the hotel and wait for us there .  we will take full responsibility from this point .   she handed them a printed slip of paper on which she scrawled her signature  the date  and  after consulting her wristwatch  the time .     when they arrived at malenkigrad  morrison discovered that it was a small town in fact  as well as in name .  there were rows of houses    each two stories high    with a deadly sameness about them .  the town had clearly been built for those who worked on the project    whatever it was that they masked with the fairy tale of miniaturization    and it had been built without undue expense .  each house had its own vegetable garden and the streets  although paved  had an unfinished look about them .     the little craft  riding on the jets of air pushing against the ground  blew up a small cloud of dust  which was  for the most part  left behind as they progressed smoothly forward .  morrison could see that it was not comfortable for the pedestrians they passed who  one and all  took evasive action as it approached .     morrison felt the discomfort in full when they passed an air jet moving in the other direction and was inundated in the dust .     boranova looked amused .  she coughed and said   do not be concerned .  we will be vacuumed soon .       vacuumed .   asked morrison  coughing also .      yes .  not so much for us  for we can live with a little dust  but the grotto must be reasonably dust free .       so must my lungs .  wouldn t it be better to have these air jets enclosed .       they promise us shipments of more elaborate models and perhaps someday they will arrive .  meanwhile  this is a new town and it is built in the steppes  where the climate is arid .  that has its advantages    and its disadvantages  too .  the settlers grow vegetables  as you saw  and they have some animals  too  but large scale agriculture must wait until the community is larger and there are irrigation facilities .  for now  it doesn t matter .  it is miniaturization that concerns us .      morrison shook his head .   you speak of miniaturization so often and with such a straight face  you might almost trick me into believing it .       believe it .  you will have the demonstration dezhnev arranged .      dezhnev said from his seat at the controls   and i had trouble doing so .  once again i had to speak to the central coordinating committee    may what is left of their gray hairs fall out .  as my father used to say   apes were invented because politicians were needed .   how it is possible to sit two thousand kilometers away and make policy        the air jet glided smoothly forward to the rather sharp ending of the town and to the broad  low rocky massif that suddenly loomed before them .      the grotto   said boranova   is located inside that .  it gives us all the room we want  frees us from the vagaries of weather  and is impenetrable from aerial surveillance  even from spy satellites .       spy satellites are illegal   said morrison indignantly .      it is merely illegal to call them spy satellites   shot back dezhnev .     the air jet banked as it made a turn  then landed in the shadow of a rocky cleft in the body of the massif .      all out   said dezhnev .     he moved forward  the other two following  and a door opened in the hillside .  morrison didn t see how it was done .  it didn t look like a door  rather it seemed an integral part of the rocky wall .  it opened just as the cavern of the forty thieves had with the utterance of the words  open sesame .      dezhnev stepped to one side and gestured for morrison and boranova to move inside .  morrison went out of the brilliant morning sunshine into a rather dimly lit chamber to which his eyes took half a minute to adapt .  it was no thieves  cave but an elaborately detailed structure .     morrison felt as though he had stepped from the earth onto the moon .  he had never been on the moon  of course  but he was familiar  as was virtually everyone on earth  with the appearance of the underground lunar settlements .  this had precisely that other worldly air about it somehow  except  of course  that gravity was earth normal .       chapter      grotto    small can be beautiful  an eagle may at times go hungry  a pet canary  never .        dezhnev senior       .     in a large and well lit washroom  boranova and dezhnev began to remove their outer clothing .  morrison  alarmed at the prospect  hesitated .     boranova smiled .   you may keep your underclothing on  dr .  morrison .  just toss everything else  except your shoes  into that bin .  i presume there is nothing in your pockets .  place your shoes at the base of the bin .  by the time we leave  it will all be cleaned and ready for use .      morrison did as he was told  trying not to observe that boranova had a most opulent figure  concerning which she seemed totally unaware .  amazing  he thought  what clothes will obscure when not designed to reveal .     they were washing now  with lavish application of soap    faces to the ears and arms to the elbows    then brushing savagely at their hair .  again morrison hesitated and boranova  reading his mind  said   the brushes are cleaned after each use  dr .  morrison .  i don t know what you may have read of us  but some of us understand hygiene .      morrison said   all this just to go into the grotto .  do you go through this every time .       every time .  that s why no one goes in just briefly .  and even when staying within  there are frequent ablations .     you may find the next step unpleasant  dr .  morrison .  close your eyes  take a deep breath  and hold it if you can .  it will take about a minute .      morrison followed orders and found himself strongly buffeted by a swirling wind .  he staggered drunkenly and collided with one of the bins .  he held on tightly .  then  as suddenly as it started  it was over .     he opened his eyes .  dezhnev and boranova looked as though they had put on fright wigs .  he felt his own hair and knew he must look the same .  he reached for his brush .      don t bother   said boranova   there s more we ll have to go through .       what was that all about .   said morrison .  he found he had to clear his throat twice before he could speak .      i mentioned that we d have the dust vacuumed away from us  but that s only the first stage of the cleaning process .     through this door  please .   she held it open for him .     morrison emerged into a narrow but well lit corridor  the walls glowing photoluminescently .  he lifted his eyebrows .   very nice .       saves energy   dezhnev said   and that s very important .     or are you referring to the technological advancement .  americans seem to come to the soviet union expecting everything to be kerosene lamps .   he chuckled and added   i admit we haven t caught up with you in every respect .  our brothels are very primitive compared with yours .       you strike back without waiting to be struck   said morrison .   that is a sure sign of an unclear conscience .  if you were anxious to demonstrate advanced technology  i could point out that it would be very simple to pave the avenue going from malenkigrad to the grotto and to use closed air jets .  we would need less of this .      dezhnev s face darkened  but boranova put in sharply   dr .  morrison is quite right  arkady .  i don t like your feeling that it is not possible to be honest without being rude .  if you cannot be both honest and polite  keep your tongue on your own side of your teeth .      dezhnev grinned uneasily .   what have i said .  of course the american doctor is right  but is there anything we can do when decisions are made in moscow by idiots who save small bits of money without counting the consequences .  as my old father used to say   the trouble with economizing is that it can be very expensive .        that s true enough   said boranova .   we could save a great deal of money  dr .  morrison  by spending on a better road and better air jets  but it is not always easy to persuade those who hold the purse strings .  surely you have the same trouble in america .      she was motioning even as she talked and morrison followed her into a small chamber .  as the door closed behind them  dezhnev held out a bracelet to morrison .   let me tie this around your right wrist .  when we hold up our arms  you hold up yours .      morrison felt his weight lighten momentarily as the chamber floor dropped .      an elevator   he said .      clever guess   said dezhnev .  then he clapped a hand to his mouth and said in a muffled tone   but i mustn t be rude .      they stopped smoothly and the elevator door opened .      identification .   came a peremptory voice .     dezhnev and boranova raised their bands  at which morrison did as well .  under the purplish light that suddenly suffused the elevator  the three bracelets glittered in patterns which were not  morrison noted  exactly alike .     they were ushered down another corridor and into a room which was both warm and damp .      we will have to have a final scrubdown  dr .  morrison   said boranova .   we are accustomed to this and stripping is routine for us .  it is easier    and timesaving    to do it as a group .       if you can stand it   said morrison grimly   i can .       it is unimportant   said dezhnev .   none of us are strangers to the sight .      dezhnev scrambled out of his underclothes  stepped over to a portion of the wall where a small red knob was glowing  and placed his right thumb immediately above it .  a narrow panel in the wall slid open and revealed white garments hanging flaccidly to one side .  he placed his underclothes at the bottom .     he seemed utterly unabashed about being nude .  his chest and shoulders were dark with hair and there was a long healed scar on his right buttock .  morrison wondered idly how that might have come about .     boranova did the same as dezhnev had done and said   pick a light that is on  dr .  morrison .  it will open to your thumbprint and then  when you touch it again  it will close .  after that it will open only to your thumbprint  so please remember your locker number and you won t have to press every locker in order to find your own .      morrison did as he was told .     boranova said   if you need to use the bathroom first  you can go there .       i m all right   said morrison .     with that  the room was aswirl with a damp mist of water droplets .      close your eyes   called out boranova  but it was unnecessary for her to say so .  the initial sting of the water forced his eyes closed at once .     there was soap in the water or  at any rate  something that stung his eyes  tasted bitter in his mouth  and irritated his nostrils .      lift your arms   called out dezhnev .   you needn t circle .  it comes from all directions .      morrison lifted his arms .  he knew it came from all directions .  it came from the floor  too  as he could tell by the slightly uncomfortable pressure on his scrotum .      how long does this last .   he gasped .      too long   said dezhnev   but it is necessary .      morrison counted to himself .  at the count of     it seemed to him that the bitterness on his lips ceased .  he squinted his eyes .  yes  the other two were still there .  he continued to count and when he reached      the water stopped and he was bathed in uncomfortably hot and dry air .     he was panting by the time that stopped too and he realized he had been holding his breath .      what was all that for .   he said  looking away uncomfortably at the sight of boranova s large but firm breasts and finding little comfort in dezhnev s hairy chest .      we are dry   said boranova .   let s get dressed .      morrison was eager but was almost immediately disappointed by the nature of the white clothes in the locker .  they consisted of a blouse and pants of light cotton  the pants held by a cord .  there was also a light cap to cover the hair and light sandals .  though the cotton was opaque  it seemed to morrison that little or nothing was truly left to the imagination .     he said   is this all we wear .       yes   said boranova .   we work in a clean  quiet environment at even temperature and  with throwaway clothes  we can t expect much in the way of fashion or expense .  indeed  barring a certain understandable reluctance  we could easily work in the nude .  but enough    come .      and now at last they stepped into what morrison recognized at once as the main body of the grotto .  it stretched away before him    between and beyond ornate pillars to a distance he couldn t make out .     he could recognize none of the equipment .  how could he .  he was entirely a theoretician and when he worked in his own field  he used computerized devices that he had designed and modified himself .  for a moment  he felt a stab of nostalgia for his laboratory at the university  for his books  for the smell of the animal cages  even for the stupid obstinacy of his colleagues .     there were people everywhere in the grotto .  there were a dozen nearby and others farther off and the impression was of the interior of a human ant hill crawling with machinery  with humanity  with purpose .     no one paid any attention to the newcomers or to each other .  they went about their work in silence  their steps muffled by their sandals .     again boranova seemed to read morrison s mind and when she spoke it was in a whisper .   we keep our council here .  none of us knows more than it is good for him    or her    to know .  there must be no leaks of significance .       but surely they must communicate .       when they must  they will    minimally .  it reduces the pleasure of camaraderie  but it is necessary .       this kind of compartmentalization slows progress   said morrison .      it s the price we pay for security   said boranova   so if no one talks to you  it is not a personal matter .  they will have no reason to talk to you .       they ll be curious about a stranger .       i have seen to it that they know you are an outside expert .  that is all they need to know .      morrison frowned .   how can they expect an american to be an outside expert .       they don t know you re an american .       my accent will give me away at once as it did to the serving woman .       but you will not talk to anyone  except for those to whom i will introduce you .       as you wish   said morrison indifferently .     he was still looking around .  since he was here  he might as well learn what he could  even if it should turn out to be trivial .  when    if    he returned to the united states  he would surely be asked for every detail he had observed and he might as well have something to give them .     he said in boranova s ear   this must be an expensive place .  what fraction of the national budget is expended here .       it s expensive   said boranova  admitting nothing further   and the government labors to limit the expense .      dezhnev said sourly   i had to work for an hour this morning to persuade them to allow a small additional experiment for your benefit    may the committee catch the cholera .      morrison said   the cholera no longer exists  even in india .       may it be reinstated for the committee .      boranova said   arkady  if these supposedly humorous expressions of yours get back to the committee  it will do you no good .       i m not afraid of those pigs  natasha .       i am .  what will happen to next year s budget if you infuriate them .      morrison said  with sudden impatience  but speaking even more softly   what concerns me is neither the committee nor the budget  but the simple question of what it is i am doing here .      dezhnev said   you are here to witness a miniaturization and to be given an explanation of why we need your help .  will that satisfy you  comrade am   comrade outside expert .         .     morrison followed the other two to something that looked like a small old fashioned train carriage on very narrow gauge tracks .     boranova placed her thumb on a smooth patch and a door slid open smoothly and without noise .   please get in  dr .  morrison .      morrison held back .   where are we going .       to the miniaturization chamber  of course .       by railroad .  how big is this place .       it is large  doctor  but not so large .  this is a matter of security .  only certain individuals can use this device and only by using it can one penetrate into the core of the grotto .       are your own people so untrustworthy .       we live in a complex world  dr .  morrison .  our people are trustworthy  but we do not wish to subject large numbers to temptations they need not face .  and if someone persuades one of us to go    elsewhere  as we have persuaded you  it is safer if their knowledge is limited  you see .     please get in .      morrison entered the compact vehicle with some difficulty .  dezhnev followed him with equal trouble  saying   another example of senseless cheese paring .  why so small .  because the bureaucrats spend billions of rubles on a project and they feel virtuous if they save a few hundred in odd places at the cost of making hardworking people miserable .      boranova got into the front seat .  morrison could not see how she manipulated the controls or  for that matter  if there were controls to manipulate .  it was probably controlled by a computer .  the carriage began to move suddenly and morrison felt the slight backward jar that resulted .     there was a small window at eye level on either side  but not of clear glass .  morrison could see a small section of the cavern outside in a streaky  wavy  poorly focused manner .  apparently  the windows were not meant for vision  but were merely intended to reduce what might otherwise be an unacceptably tight enclosure to those with claustrophobic tendencies .     it seemed to morrison that the individuals he could make out through the glass paid no attention to the moving carriage .  everyone here  he thought  is well trained .  to show any interest in any procedure with which you have nothing directly to do must apparently be a sign of discourtesy    or worse .     it seemed to morrison that they were approaching the wall of the cavern and the carriage  with another small jerk  slowed .  a section of the wall slid aside and the carriage  with yet another jerk  picked up speed and moved through the opening .     it grew dark almost at once and the dim light in the carriage s ceiling did little more than change night to dusk .     they were in a narrow tunnel into which the carriage fit with apparently little room to spare  except on the left side where morrison  peering past dezhnev  thought he could make out another pair of rails .  there must be at least two such carriages  he thought  with room to pass one another in the tunnel if both were in operation .     the tunnel was as dimly lit as the carriage and it was not straight .  either it had been carved through the hill in such a way as to follow lines of least resistance in order to save money or it was curved deliberately in some dim  atavistic search for making things more secure by making them more complicated .  the darkness inside and outside the carriage might serve the same purpose .      how long will this take    uh     asked morrison .     dezhnev looked at him with  in the dimness  an unreadable expression .   you don t know how to address me  i see .  i do not have an academic title  so why not call me arkady .  everyone does here and why not .  my father always said   what counts is the person  not the name .       morrison nodded .   very well .  how long will this take  arkady .       not long  albert   said dezhnev cheerfully    and morrison  having been lured into first name informality  could not object to the return .     he surprised himself a little by finding he did not wish to object .  dezhnev  even with his father s aphorisms included  seemed to be uncomplicated  at least  and  under the circumstances  morrison welcomed a chance of refraining from the perpetual fencing match to which boranova seemed to subject him .     the carriage could not be moving at a speed faster than a leisurely walk  but there was a small lurch each time it took a curve on the track .  apparently  petty economies included leaving the curves unbanked .     then  with absolutely no warning  light flooded in and the carriage ground to a stop .     morrison blinked as he stepped out .  the room they were now in was not as large as the one they had left and there was virtually nothing in it .  there were only the tracks under the carriage that made a wide arc and then led back toward the section of the wall from which they had emerged .  he could see another small carriage disappearing into the opening and the wall closing behind it .  the carriage in which they had arrived made a slow circuit of the arc and came to rest near the wall .     morrison looked around .  there were many doors and the ceiling was comparatively low .  without definite evidence of the fact  he felt that he was in a three dimensional checkerboard  with numerous small rooms on several levels .     boranova was waiting for him  seeming to observe his curiosity with a touch of disapproval .   are you ready  dr .  morrison .       no  dr .  boranova   said morrison .   since i don t know where i m going or what i m doing  i m not ready .  however  if you will lead the way  i will follow .       that is sufficiently ready .     this way  then .  there is someone else you must meet .      they passed through one of the doors and into another small room .  this one was very well lit and had its walls lined with thick cables .     in the room was a young woman who looked up when they came in  pushing aside something  that seemed  from its appearance  to be some kind of technical report .  she was quite pretty in a pale and vulnerable way .  her flaxen hair was cut short but with enough of a wave in it to keep her from looking too severe .  the scanty cotton uniform she wore  which morrison already knew to be universal within the grotto  showed her to be attractively slim and shapely enough  though without boranova s opulence .  her face was marred or perhaps enhanced  according to taste  by a tiny mole just under the left corner of her mouth .  her cheekbones were high  her hands thin fingered and graceful  and her expression did not appear as though she were much given to smiling .     morrison smiled  however .  for the first time since his kidnapping  it seemed to him that there might be a lighter side to this dismal situation in which he had been unwillingly plunged .      good day   he said .   it s a pleasure meeting you .   he tried to give his russian an educated sound and to get rid of what the serving woman had so easily detected as his american accent .     the young woman made no direct answer but  turning to boranova  said in a voice that was slightly husky   is this the american .       it is   said boranova .   he is dr .  albert jonas morrison  professor of neurophysics .       assistant professor   said morrison deprecatorily .     boranova ignored the correction .   and this  dr .  morrison  is dr .  sophia kaliinin  who is our electromagnetics expert .       she scarcely looks old enough   said morrison gallantly .     the young lady did not seem amused .  she said   i look  perhaps  younger than i am .  i am thirty one years old .      morrison looked abashed and boranova cut in quickly   come  we are ready to begin .  please check the circuits and set matters in motion .     and quickly .      kaliinin hurried out .     dezhnev looked after her with a grin .   i m glad she doesn t seem to like americans .  it cuts out a hundred million potential competitors at least .  now if she also didn t like russians and would come to realize that i am as karelo finnish as she is .       you karelo finnish .   said boranova  forced into a smile .   who would believe that  you madman .       she would    if she were in the proper mood .       this would require an impossible mood .   boranova turned to morrison .   please do not take sophia s behavior personally  dr .  morrison .  many of our citizens pass through an ultrapatriotic phase and feel it to be very soviet to dislike americans .  it is more pose than reality .  frn sure  once we begin to work together as a team  that sophia will let down her barriers .       i understand completely .  things are similar in my country .  as a matter of fact  at the moment  i m not very fond of soviets    and understandably  i think .  but     and he smiled     i could make an exception for dr .  kaliinin very easily .      boranova shook her head .   american like you or russian like arkady  there is a peculiar masculine way of thought that transcends national boundaries and cultural differences .      morrison was unmoved .   not that i will be working with her    or with anyone .  i have grown tired of telling you  dr .  boranova  that i don t accept the existence of miniaturization and that i cannot and will not be of assistance to you in any way .      dezhnev laughed .   you know  one could almost believe albert .  he speaks so seriously .      boranova said   observe  dr .  morrison .  this is katinka .      she tapped a cage which morrison  startled  now observed for the first time .  dr .  kahinin had rather absorbed his attention till now and even after she had left he had been idly keeping his eye on the door through which she had gone  waiting for her reappearance .     he focused on the cage of wire mesh .  katinka was  apparently  a white rabbit of moderate size and placid appearance  who was munching away at greenery with the rapt concentration of her kind .     morrison was aware of the slight scrabbling noise she made and of the rabbit odor  which he must have noted  unconsciously  earlier and ignored .     he said   yes  i see her .  a rabbit .       not just a rabbit  doctor .  she is a most unusual creature .  unique .  she has made history to a far greater extent than has the catalog of war and disaster that usually is thought of by that name .  if we exclude such purely incidental creatures as worms  fleas  and submicroscopic parasites  katinka is the first living creature that has been miniaturized .  in fact  she has been miniaturized on three separate occasions and would have been miniaturized dozens of times more if we had been able to afford it .  she has contributed enormously to our knowledge of the miniaturization of life forms and  as you can see  her experiences have in no way adversely affected her .      morrison said   i do not wish to be insulting  but your bare statement that the rabbit has been miniaturized three times is not really evidence that this has indeed happened .  i do not mean to cast doubt upon your integrity  but  in a case like this  i think you understand that nothing less than witnessing the fact is sufficiently convincing .       certainly .  and it is for that reason  that    at considerable expense    katinka will now be miniaturized a fourth time .          .     sophia kaliinin swirled back in and turned to morrison .   are you wearing a watch or do you have anything metallic on you .   she asked crisply .      i have no possessions on me at all  dr .  kaliinin .  nothing but the clothes i wear  the single pocket of which is empty .  even this identification bracelet that has been put on me seems to be of plastic .       it is merely that there is a strong electromagnetic field and metal would interfere .      morrison said   any physiological effects .       none .  or at least none have yet been detected .      morrison  who was waiting for them to give up their pretense of miniaturization and wondering how long they could carry on the fraud  he was growing more censorious over the matter by the minute   said  with just a touch of malice   might not overexposure lead to birth defects should you ever get pregnant  dr .  kaliinin .      kaliinin flushed .   i have a baby .  she is perfectly normal .       were you exposed during pregnancy .       once .      boranova said   is the inquisition over  dr .  morrison .  may we begin .       you still maintain that you will miniaturize the rabbit .       certainly .       then go ahead .  i m all eyes .       how foolish of them  he thought sardonically .  they would soon be claiming  of course  that something had gone wrong  but where would they go from there .  what was it all about .      boranova said   to begin with  dr .  morrison  would you lift the cage .      morrison made no move to do so .  he looked from one to the other of the three soviets in suspicion and uncertainty .     dezhnev said   go ahead .  it won t hurt  albert .  you won t even get your hands dirty and  after all  hands were meant to become dirty at work .      morrison put his hands on either side of the cage and lifted .  it weighed about ten kilograms  he judged .  he grunted and said   may i put it down now .       of course   said boranova .      gently   said kaliinin .   do not disturb katinka .      morrison lowered it carefully .  the rabbit  which had momentarily stopped feeding when the cage was lifted  sniffed the air curiously and returned tentatively to its unhurried chewing .     boranova nodded and sophia moved to one side of the room where a bank of controls were all but hidden by the cables .  she looked over her shoulder at the cage as though estimating its position  then walked over to move it slightly .  she returned to the controls and closed a switch .     a whining sound made itself heard and the cage began to glitter and shimmer as though something  all but invisible  had interposed itself between it and themselves .  the shimmer extended beneath the cage  separating it from the stone top table on which it had been resting .     boranova said   the cage is now enclosed in the miniaturization field .  only the objects within the field will be miniaturized .      morrison stared and a little worm of uncertainty began to stir within him .  were they going to try some clever illusion on him and make him think he had witnessed miniaturization .  he said   and how exactly did you produce that so called miniaturization field .       that   said boranova   we do not intend to tell you .  i think you understand what classified information is .  go ahead  sophia .      the whine heightened in pitch and intensified somewhat .  morrison found it unpleasant  but the others seemed to endure it stolidly .  in looking at them  he had taken his eyes off the cage .  now when he looked at it again  it seemed to have grown smaller .     he frowned and bent his head so as to line up one side of the cage with the vertical line of a cable on the opposite wall .  he held his head steady  but the side of the cage shrank away from the reference line .  there was no mistake  the cage was distinctly smaller .  he blinked his eyes in frustration .     boranova smiled narrowly .   it is indeed shrinking  dr .  morrison .  surely your eyes tell you so .      the whine continued    the shrinking continued .  the cage was perhaps half its original linear measurement .     morrison said  with obvious lack of conviction   there are such things as optical illusions .      boranova called out .   sophia  stop the process for a moment .      the whine lowered into silence and the glitter of the miniaturization field dimmed and died .  the cage sat on the table as before  a considerably smaller version than it had been .  inside was the rabbit still    a smaller rabbit  but one that was proportioned in every way as the original had been  munching on smaller leaves  with smaller pieces of carrot distributed across the floor of the cage .     boranova said   do you honestly think that this is an optical illusion .      morrison was silent and dezhnev said   come  albert  accept the evidence of your senses .  this experiment consumed considerable energy and if you remain unconvinced  our clever administrators will be annoyed with all of us for wasting money .  what do you say  then .      and morrison  shaking his head in rueful confusion  said   i don t know what to say .      boranova said   would you lift the cage again  dr .  morrison .      again morrison hesitated and boranova said   the miniaturization field has not left it radioactive or anything like that .  the touch of your unminiaturized hand will not affect it  nor will its state of miniaturization affect you .  you see .   and she placed her hand  flatly and gently  on top of the cage .     morrison s hesitation was not proof against that .  gingerly  he placed his hand on either side of the cage and lifted .  he exclaimed in surprise  for it could not be much over a kilogram in mass .  the cage trembled in his grip and the miniaturized rabbit  alarmed  hopped to one corner of the cage and huddled there in agitation .     morrison put the cage down and  as nearly as he could estimate  did so in its original position  but kaliinin walked over and made a small adjustment .     boranova said   what do you think  dr .  morrison .       it weighs considerably less .  is there some way you pulled a switch .       pulled a switch .  you mean replaced the larger object with a smaller while you were watching  the smaller exactly like the larger in everything but size .  dr .  morrison  please .      morrison cleared his throat and didn t press the point .  it lacked plausibility even to himself .     boranova said   please notice  dr .  morrison  that not only has the size been decreased  but the mass in proportion .  the very atoms and molecules of which the cage and its contents are composed have shrunk in size and mass .  fundamentally  planck s constant has decreased  so that nothing inside has changed relative to its own parts .  to the rabbit  itself  its food  and everything within the cage seems perfectly normal .  the outside world has increased in size relative to the rabbit  but  of course  it remains unaware of that .       but the miniaturization field is gone .  why don t the cage and its contents revert to ordinary size .       for two reasons  dr .  morrison .  in the first place  the miniaturized state is metastable .  that is one of the great fundamental discoveries that make miniaturization possible .  at whatever point we stop in the process  it takes very little energy to maintain it in that state .  and secondly  the miniaturization field is not entirely gone .  it is merely minimized and drawn inward so that it still keeps the atmosphere within the cage from diffusing outward and normal molecules outside from diffusing inward .  it also leaves the walls of the cage touchable by unminiaturized hands .     but we are not finished  dr .  morrison .  shall we continue .      morrison  troubled and unable to deny the direct experience  wondered for a moment if he had somehow been drugged into a kind of super suggestibility that would make him experience whatever he was told he was experiencing .  in a choked way  he said   you are telling me a great deal .       yes  we are  but only superficially .  if you repeat this in america  you will probably not be believed and nothing you say will give the slightest hint as to the core of the miniaturization technique .   boranova lifted her hand and kaliinin again threw the switch .     the whine returned and the cage began once again to shrink .  it seemed to be going faster now and boranova  as though reading morrison s mind  said   the further it shrinks  the less mass there is to remove and the more rapidly it shrinks further .      morrison found himself staring  in a state of near shock  at a cage that was a centimeter across and still shrinking .     but boranova raised her hand again and the whine died .      be careful  dr .  morrison .  it weighs only a few hundred milligrams now and it is a fragile object indeed to anyone on our scale .  here .  try this .      she handed him a large magnifying glass .  morrison  without saying a word  took it and held it over the tiny cage .  he might not have managed to make out what the moving object within it was if he had come upon it without prior knowledge  for his mind would not have accepted such an incredibly tiny rabbit .     he had seen it shrink  however  and he stared at it now with a mixture of confusion and fascination .     he looked up at boranova and said   is this really happening .       do you still suspect an optical illusion or hypnotism or    what else .       drugs .       if it were drugs  dr .  morrison  it would be a greater achievement than miniaturization .  look around you .  doesn t everything else look normal .  it would be an unusual drug indeed that would alter your sense perception of a single object in a large room of unchanged miscellany .  come  doctor  what you ve witnessed is real .       make it larger   said morrison breathlessly .     dezhnev laughed and suppressed in a quick choke .   if i laugh  the wind may well blow away katinka  whereupon natasha and sophia will both strike me with everything else in this room .  if you wish it enlarged  you will have to wait .      boranova said   dezhnev is right .  you see  dr .  morrison  you have witnessed a scientific demonstration  not magic .  if it were magic  i could snap my finger and the rabbit would be its normal self again in a normal cage    and then you would know you were witnessing an optical illusion .  however  it takes considerable energy to decrease planck s constant to a tiny fraction of its normal value  even over a relatively small volume of the universe  which is why miniaturization is so expensive a technique .  to enlarge planck s constant once again must result in the production of energy equal to that which had been consumed originally  for the law of conservation of energy holds even in the process of miniaturization .  we cannot deminiaturize then any faster than we can dispose of the heat produced  so that it takes considerable time to do it    much more than it took to miniaturize .      for a while  morrison was silent .  he found the explanation involving conservation of energy more convincing than the demonstration itself .  charlatans would not have been so meticulous about obeying the constraints of physics .     he said   it seems to me  then  that your miniaturization process can scarcely be a practical device .  at most it would only serve as a tool  perhaps  to broaden and expand quantum theory .      boranova said   even that would be enough  but don t judge a technique by its initial phase .  we can hope that we will learn how to circumvent these large energy changes  how to find methods of miniaturization and deminiaturization that will be more efficient .  does all the energy change have to pass from electromagnetic fields into miniaturization and then into heat on deminiaturization .  might not deminiaturization be somehow inveigled into releasing energy as electromagnetic fields again .  that would be easier to handle  perhaps .       have you repealed the second law of thermodynamics .   asked morrison with exaggerated politeness .      not at all .  we don t expect an impossible     percent conversion .  if we can convert    percent of the derniniaturization energy into an electromagnetic field    or even only    percent    that would be an improvement over the present situation .  however  there is hope of a technique even more subtle and far more efficient and that is where you come in .      morrison s eyes widened .   i .  i know nothing about this .  why pick me out for your salvation .  you would have done as well with a child out of kindergarten .       not so .  we know what we are doing .  come  dr .  morrison  you and i shall go to my office while sophia and arkady begin the tedious process of restoring katinka .  i will there show you that you know quite enough to help us make miniaturization efficient and therefore a commercially practical venture .  in fact  you will see quite clearly that you are the only person who can help us .        chapter      coma    life is pleasant death is peaceful .  it is the transition that is troublesome .        dezhnev senior       .      this   said natalya boranova   is my own portion of the grotto .      she sat down in a rather battered armchair that  morrison imagined  she found perfectly comfortable  having molded it to her body over the years .     he sat down in another chair  smaller and more austere  with a satin covered seat that was less comfortable than it looked .  he glanced over the surroundings with a sharp sensation of homesickness .  there were ways in which it reminded him of his own office .  there was the computer outlet and the large screen .   boranova s was far more ornate than his own    the soviet style tended toward the curlicue and morrison felt a momentary curiosity as to the reason and then put that aside as a trivial matter .      there was also the same trend toward disorder in the piles of printouts  the same distinct odor they gave rise to  the same occasional old fashioned book in among the film cassettes .  morrison tried to read the title of one that was too far off and too worn to be made out .   books always had an ancient appearance  even when they were new .   he had the impression it was an english language book  which would not have surprised him .  he himself had several russian classics in his laboratory for an occasional brushup of the language .     boranova said   we are quite private here .  we will not be overheard and we will not be disturbed .  later we can have lunch brought in .       you are kind   said morrison  trying not to sound sardonic .     boranova seemed to take it at face value .   not at all .  and now  dr .  morrison  i can t help having noticed that arkady is on a first name basis with you .  he is  of course  to a certain extent an uncultured individual and is apt to presume .  still  may i ask again if  despite the conditions that brought you here  we might be pleasant and informal with each other .      morrison hesitated .   well  call me albert  then .  but it will be merely a convenience and no sign of friendship .  i am not likely to dismiss my kidnapping .      boranova cleared her throat .   i did try to persuade you to come of your own free will .  if necessity had not driven us so hard  we would have gone no farther than that .       if you are embarrassed by what you have done  then return me to the united states .  send me back now and i will be willing to forget this episode and will make no complaint to my government .      slowly boranova shook her head .   you know that cannot be done .  necessity still drives .  you will see what i mean  shortly .  but meanwhile  albert  let us talk together  without nonsense  as part of the global family of science that rises superior to questions of nationality and other artificial distinctions among human beings .     surely by now you have accepted the reality of miniaturization .       i must accept it .   morrison shook his head  almost regretfully .      and you see our problem .       yes .  it is far too expensive in energy .       imagine  however  if we lower the energy cost drastically .  imagine if we can bring about miniaturization by plugging a wire into a wall socket and consuming no more energy than we would if we were heating a toaster oven .       of course    but apparently it can t be done .  or  at any rate  your people cannot do it .  why all the secrecy  then .  why not publish the findings you have already made and welcome the contributions of the rest of the family of science .  secrecy seems to imply the possibility that the soviet union is planning to use miniaturization as a weapon of some kind  one powerful enough to make it possible for your country to find it feasible to break the mutual understanding that has led to peace and cooperation throughout the world for the last two generations .       that is not so .  the soviet union is not trying to establish a world hegemony .       i hope not .  still  if the soviet union seeks secrecy  it is understandable that other units of the global alliance would begin to wonder if it seeks conquest .       the united states has its secrets  has it not .       i don t know .  the american government does not confide in me .  if it does have secrets    and actually i suppose it does    i disapprove of that  too .  but tell me why there is any necessity for secrets .  what does it matter if you develop miniaturization  or we  or both of us in combination    or the africans  for that matter .  we americans invented the airplane and the telephone  but you have both .  we were the first to reach the moon  but you enjoy your full share of the lunar settlements .  you  on the other hand  were the first to crack the problem of fusion power and the first to build a solar power station in space and we participate fully in both .      boranova said   all that you say is true .  nevertheless  for over a century  the world has taken it for granted that american technology is superior to soviet technology .  that is a constant irritant to us  and if  in something as basic and as thoroughly revolutionary as miniaturization  it is clearly established that the soviet union led the way  then that would be most desirable for us .       and the global family of science that you appeal to .  are you a member of that or are you merely a soviet scientist .       i am both   said boranova with a touch of anger .   if it were my decision  then perhaps i would open our discoveries to the world .  however  i do not make the decision .  my government does and i owe them loyalty .  nor do you americans make it easy for us to do otherwise .  your constant loud american assumption of superiority drives us into a defensive posture .       but won t it spoil soviet pride in their accomplishment to have to call upon an american such as myself to help out .       well  yes  it does sour the milk a bit  but it will at least give the united states a share in the achievement  which we shall acknowledge  albert .  you will be showing yourself a true american patriot and will improve your own reputation if you help us .      morrison smiled bitterly .   a bribe .      boranova shrugged .   if that is how you interpret it  i cannot stop you .  but let us talk in a friendly manner and see what will come of it .       in that case  start by giving me some information .  now that i am forced to believe that miniaturization is possible  can you tell me the basic physics behind it .  i am curious .       you know better than that  albert .  it would be dangerous for you to learn too much .  how would we  then  be able to let you go back to your country .     besides  although i can operate the miniaturization system  even i don t know the basics .  if i did  our government could scarcely risk having me visit the united states .       you mean we might kidnap you as you kidnapped me .  do you think the united states engages in kidnapping .       i am absolutely certain it would when necessity drove sufficiently .       and who are the people who do know the basics of miniaturization .       that also is not something that  in general  it is safe for you to know .  however  i can lift the curtain just a bit in this matter .  pyotor shapirov is one of them .       crazy peter   said morrison  smiling .   somehow i m not surprised .       you shouldn t be .  i am sure you say  crazy  only as one of your jokes  but it was he who first worked out the basic rationale behind miniaturization .  of course   she added thoughtfully   it may very well be that that required a certain insanity    or  at any rate  a certain idiosyncracy of thought .  it is also shapirov who first suggested a method of achieving miniaturization with a minimum expenditure of energy .       how .  the conversion of derniniaturization into an electromagnetic field .      boranova made a face .   i was merely giving you an example .  shapirov s method is far more subtle .       can it be explained .       only roughly .  shapirov points out that the two great aspects of the unified theory of the universe    the quantum aspect and the relativistic aspect    each depends on a constant that sets a limit .  in quantum theory it is planck s constant  which is very tiny but not zero .  in relativity  it is the speed of light  which is very great but not infinite .  planck s constant sets a lower limit to the size of energy transfer and the speed of light sets an upper limit to the speed of information transmission .  shapirov maintains  furthermore  that the two are related .  in other words  if planck s constant is decreased  the speed of light would increase .  if planck s constant were reduced to zero  then the speed of light would be infinite .      morrison said at once   in which case  the universe would be newtonian in its properties .      boranova nodded .   yes .  according to shapirov  then  the reason for the enormous energy consumption of miniaturization is that the two limits are uncoupled  that planck s constant is decreased without the speed of light being increased .  if the two were coupled  then energy would flow from the speed of light limit into the planck s constant limit during miniaturization and in the other direction during deminiaturization  so that the speed of light would go up as miniaturization proceeded and down again during deminiaturization .  the efficiency should be nearly a hundred percent .  very little energy would then be required to miniaturize and re expansion could take place very quickly .      morrison said   does shapirov know how miniaturization and deminiaturization can be carried through with the two limits coupled .       he said he did .       said .  past tense .  does that mean he has changed his mind .       not exactly .       then what has he done .      boranova hesitated .   albert   she said almost pleadingly   do not go too fast .  i want you to think .  you know that miniaturization works .  you know that it is possible  but not practical .  you know that it would be a boon for humanity and i have assured you that it is not meant for destructive or warlike use .  once we know that our national precedence is recognized  which we want for psychological reasons i have presented to you quite frankly  i am sure we will share miniaturization with all divisions of the globe .       really  natalya .  would you and your nation trust the united states if the situation were reversed .       trust .   said boranova and sighed heavily .   it doesn t come naturally to anyone .  it is the weakness of humanity that we constantly read the worst into others .  yet trust must begin somewhere or the fragile mood of cooperation we have enjoyed for so long will shatter and we will be back to the twentieth century with all its horrors .  since the united states feels so strongly that it is the stronger and more advanced nation  should it not be the first to risk the act of trusting .      morrison spread out his arms .   i can t answer that .  i am a private citizen and do not represent my nation .       as a private citizen you can help us  knowing that you will not be harming your own country .       i can t possibly know such a thing  since i only have your word for it and i don t believe you represent your nation any more than i represent mine .  but all this is irrelevant  natalya .  even if i wanted to  how on earth can i help you make miniaturization practical  when i know nothing about the subject .       be patient .  in a while we will have lunch .  dezhnev and kaliinin will be through with the deminiaturization of katinka by then and will join us  together with one other whom you must meet .  then  after lunch  i will take you to see shapirov .       i m not sure about that  natalya .  you told me just a while ago that it would be dangerous for me to meet anyone who really understood miniaturization .  i might learn too much and this might raise problems with my return to the united states .  why  then  should i risk seeing shapirov .      boranova said sadly   shapirov is an exception .  i promise you that you will understand this when you see him    and you will also understand why we must turn to you .       that   said morrison with all the conviction with which he had lately proclaimed the impossibility of miniaturization   i will never understand .         .     lunch was in a well lit room  for strips of the walls  together with the entire ceiling  were electroluminescent .  boranova had pointed it out with obvious pride and morrison had refrained from making invidious comparisons with the united states  where electroluminescence was widespread .     nor did he express his amusement over the fact that despite the electroluminescence there was a small but ornate chandelier centered in the ceiling .  its bulbs contributed nothing to the light  but it undoubtedly made the room seem less antiseptic .     as boranova had predicted  a fifth person had joined them and morrison was introduced to someone named yuri konev .   a neurophysicist like yourself  albert   said boranova .     konev  who was darkly handsome and who seemed to be in his middle thirties  had an air of almost gawky youth about himself .  he shook hands with wary curiosity and said   i am most pleased to meet you   in creditable english  spoken with a distinct american accent .      you have been in the united states  i imagine   said morrison  also in english .      i spent two years doing graduate work at harvard university .  it gave me a splendid opportunity to practice my english .       nevertheless   said boranova in russian   dr .  albert morrison does very well in our language  yuri  and we must give him a chance to practice it here in our country .       of course   said konev in russian .     morrison had  indeed  almost forgotten that he was underground .  there were no windows in the room  but that was common enough in large office buildings even aboveground .     the meal was not an ebullient one .  arkady dezhnev ate with silent concentration and sophia kaliinin seemed abstracted .  she glanced occasionally at morrison  but ignored konev completely .  boranova watched everyone  but said very little .  she seemed content to leave the floor to konev .     konev said   dr .  morrison  i must tell you that i have followed your work carefully .      morrison  who had been eating the thick cabbage soup appreciatively  looked up with a quick smile .  this was the first reference to his work  rather than to their work  since he had arrived in the soviet union .      thank you for your interest  but natalya and arkady call me albert and i will have difficulty in responding to different names .  let us all be on a first name basis for the brief time that remains before i am returned to my own land .       help us   said boranova in a low voice   and it will indeed be a brief time .       no conditions   said morrison in an equally low tone .   i wish to leave .      konev raised his voice  as though to force the conversation back into the track he had chosen .   but i must admit  albert  that i have been unable to duplicate your observations .      morrison s lips tightened .   i have had this complaint from neurophysicists in the united states .       now  why should this be .  academician shapirov is greatly intrigued by your theories and maintains that you are probably correct  at least in part .       ah  but shapirov isn t a neurophysicist  is he .       no  he s not  but he has an extraordinary feel for what is correct .  i have never known him to say   it seems to me that this must be right   in which whatever he is discussing hasn t proved to be right    at least in part .  he says you are probably on the road to establishing an interesting relay station .       a relay station .  i don t know what he means by that .       it s what he said once in my hearing .  some private thought of his own  no doubt .   he cast a penetrating glance at morrison  as though waiting for an explanation of the remark .     morrison simply shrugged it away .   what i have done   he said   is to establish a new kind of analysis of the cephalic waves originating in the brain and to have narrowed the search for a specific network within the brain devoted to creative thought .       there you may be a little overoptimistic  albert .  i have not satisfied myself that this network of yours really exists .       my results mark it out quite clearly .       in dogs and monkeys .  it is uncertain how far we can extrapolate such information to the much more complex structure of the human brain .       i admit i haven t worked with the human brain anatomically  but i have analyzed human brain waves carefully and those results are at least consistent with my creative structure hypothesis .       this is what i haven t been able to duplicate and what american researchers may not have been able to duplicate  either .      again morrison shrugged .   adequate brain wave analysis is  at best  a monumentally difficult thing at the quintenary level and no one else has given the years to the problem that i have .       or possesses the particular computerized equipment .  you have designed your own program for the purpose of brain wave analysis  haven t you .       yes  i have .       and described it in the literature .       certainly .  if i achieved results with an undescribed program  they would be worth nothing .  who could confirm my results  lacking an equivalent computer program .       yet i have heard  at the international neurophysical conference in brussels last year  that you are continually modifying your program and complaining that the lack of confirmation stems from the use of insufficiently complex programming incapable of fourier analysis to the proper degree of sensitivity .       no  yuri  that is false .  entirely false .  i have modified my program from time to time  but i have carefully described each modification in computer technology .  i have tried to publish the data in the american journal of neurophysics  but they haven t accepted my papers these last few years .  if others confine their reading to the ajn and don t keep up with relevant literature elsewhere  that is not my fault .       and yet     konev paused and frowned in what seemed to be uncertain thought .   i don t know if i ought to say this because it may be something else that will antagonize you .       go ahead .  i have  in these last few years  learned to accept all kinds of remarks hostile  sarcastic  and    worst of all    pitying .  i am quite hardened to it .     this is good chicken kiev  by the way .       this is a guest meal   murmured kaliinin  almost under her breath .   too buttery    bad for the figure .       hah   said dezhnev loudly .   bad for the figure .  that is an american remark that makes no sense in russian .  my father always said   the body knows what it needs .  that s why some things taste good .       kaliinin closed her eyes in quite obvious distaste .   a recipe for suicide   she said .     morrison noticed that konev did not look at the young woman during this bit of byplay .  not at all .     he said   you were saying  yuri .  about something that might antagonize me  you thought .      konev said   well  then  is it true  albert  or not true that you actually gave your program to a colleague and that  using it in your computer  he was still unable to duplicate your results .       that s true   said morrison .   at least my colleague  an able enough man  said he could not duplicate my results .       do you suspect he was lying .       no .  not really .  it s just that the observations are so delicate that to attempt them while certain of failure may well lead  it seems to me  to failure .       might one not argue the other way around  albert  and say that your certainty of success leads you to imagine success .       possibly   said morrison .   that has been pointed out to me several times in the past .  but i don t think so .       one more rumor   said konev .   this i truly hate to repeat  but it seems so important .  is it true that you have claimed that in your analysis of brain waves you have occasionally sensed actual thoughts .      morrison shook his head vigorously .   i have never made such a claim in print .  i have said to a colleague  once or twice  that in concentrating on the brain wave analysis there are occasionally times when i seem to find thoughts invading my mind .  i have no way of telling whether the thoughts are entirely mine or whether my own brain waves resonate to those of the subject .       is such a resonance conceivable .       i suppose so .  the brain waves produce tiny fluctuating electromagnetic fields .       ah .  it is this  i suppose  that made academician shapirov make that remark about a relay station .  brain waves are always producing fluctuating electromagnetic fields    with or without analysis .  you don t resonate    if resonance is what it is    to the thoughts of someone in your presence  no matter how intensely he may be thinking .  the resonance takes place only when you are busily studying the brain waves with your programmed computer .  it presumably acts as a relay station  magnifying or intensifying the brain waves of the subject and projecting them into your mind .       i have no evidence for that except for an occasional fugitive impression .  that s not enough .       it might be .  the human brain is far more complex than any other equivalent piece of matter we know of .       what about dolphins .   said dezhnev  his mouth full .      an exploded view   said konev at once .   they re intelligent  but their brains are devoted too entirely to the minutiae of swimming to allow enough room for abstract thought on the human scale .       i have never studied dolphins   said morrison indifferently .      ignore the dolphins   said konev impatiently .   just concentrate on the fact that your computer  properly programmed  may act as a relay station  passing thoughts from the mind of the subject you are studying to your own mind .  if that is so  albert  we need you and no other person in the world .      morrison said  frowning and pushing his chair away from the table   even if i can pick up thoughts by way of my computer    a claim i have never made and which  in fact  i deny    what can that possibly have to do with miniaturization .      boranova rose and looked at her watch .   it is time   she said .   let us go and see shapirov now .      morrison said   what he says will make no difference to me .       you will find   said boranova with a hint of steel in her voice   that he will say nothing    but will be utterly convincing just the same .         .     morrison had kept his temper well so far .  the soviets were  after all  treating him as a guest and if he could overlook the small matter of his being carried off by force  he had little of which to complain .     but what were they getting at .  one by one  boranova had introduced him to others    first dezhnev  then kaliinin  then konev    for reasons he had not penetrated .  over and over  boranova had hinted of his usefulness without actually saying what it might be .  now konev talked of it and was equally uncommunicative .     and now they were to see shapirov .  clearly this had to be a climax of sorts .  from the first mention of him by boranova at the convention two days ago  shapirov had seemed to hover over the whole matter like a thickening fog .  it was he who had worked out the miniaturization process  he who seemed to detect a connection between planck s constant and the speed of light  he who seemed to value morrison s neurophysical theories  and he who made the remark about the computer as relay station that had apparently set off konev s conviction that morrison    and only morrison    could help them .     it remained for morrison  now  to resist any blandishments or arguments that shapirov could present .  if morrison insisted that he would not help them  what would they do when all the blandishments and arguments had failed .     crude threat of force    or torture .     brainwashing .     morrison quailed .  he dared not put his refusal on the basis that he would not .  he would have to persuade them that he could not .  surely that was a reasonable position on which to take his stand .  what could neurophysics    and a dubious  unaccepted bit of neurophysical work at that    have to do with miniaturization .     but why didn t they see that for themselves .  why did they all act as though it were conceivable that a person like himself  who had never as much as thought of miniaturization until some forty eight hours before  could do something for them    them  the only experts in the field    that they could not do for themselves .     it was a rather lengthy walk along corridors and  lost in his own uncomfortable thoughts  morrison did not notice that they were fewer in number than he had thought .     he said to boranova suddenly   where are the others .      she said   they have work to do .  we do not have forever to do what we must  you know .      morrison shook his head .  chatty  they were not .  none of them seemed to scatter information .  always close lipped .  a long standing soviet habit  perhaps    or something that was ground into them through their work on a secret project in which even the scientists dared not step outside the narrow limits of their immediate work .     were they coming to him as a storybook american generalist .  nothing he had ever done  surely  would give anyone that impression .  as a matter of fact  he was himself a narrow specialist  knowing virtually nothing outside of neurophysics .     this was a worsening disease of modern science  he thought .     they had entered another elevator  something he had scarcely bothered to notice  and they were now on another level .  he looked around him and recognized characteristics that seemed to transcend national differences .      are we in a medical wing .   he asked .      a hospital   said boranova .   the grotto is a self contained scientific complex .       and why are we here .  am i     he stopped suddenly  as the horror of the thought smote him .  was he to be drugged or  by some other medical means  made more compliant .     boranova had walked on for a moment  then stopped  looked back  and came toward him  saying snappishly   now what is frightening you .      morrison felt ashamed .  were his facial expressions that transparent .   nothing is frightening me   he grumbled .   i am simply tired of walking aimlessly .       what makes you think we are walking aimlessly .  i said we were going to see pyotor shapirov .  we are walking toward him now .     come  we have only a few steps left .      they turned a corner and boranova beckoned him to a window .     he stepped to her side and looked in .  it was a room and there were a number of people present .  there were four beds  but only one was occupied and it was surrounded by equipment that he did not recognize .  there were tubes and glassware extending toward the bed and morrison counted a dozen functionaries  who might be doctors  nurses  or medical technicians .     boranova said   there is academician shapirov .       which one .   said morrison  his eyes traveling from one of the figures to the other and finding no one who seemed similar in appearance to the scientist he recalled having met once .      in the bed .       in the bed .  he s ill  then .       worse than ill .  he is in a coma .  he has been in a coma for over a month and we strongly suspect it is an irreversible state .       i m terribly sorry to hear that .  i presume that is why you referred to him in the past tense before lunch .       yes  the shapirov we know is in the past tense  unless         unless he recovers .  but you just said the coma is probably irreversible .       that s true .  but neither is he brain dead .  the brain is damaged certainly or he wouldn t be in a coma  but it is not dead and konev  who has followed your work closely  thinks that some of his thinking network is still intact .       ah   said morrison  the light breaking .   i begin to understand .  why didn t you explain this to begin with .  if you had wanted to consult me on such a matter and had explained  i might have been willing to come here with you voluntarily .  yet  on the other hand  if i were to study his cerebral functioning and tell you   yes  yuri konev is right   then what good will that do you .       that will do us no good at all .  you don t yet begin to understand  you see  and i can t explain exactly what it is i want until you understand the problem .  do you quite realize what is buried there in the still living portions of shapirov s brain .       his thoughts  i suppose .       specifically  his thoughts of the interconnection of planck s constant and the speed of light .  his thoughts of a method for making miniaturization and deminiaturization rapid  low energy  and practical .  with those thoughts  we give humanity a technique that will revolutionize science and technology    and society    more than anything since the invention of the transistor .  perhaps more than anything since the discovery of fire .  who can tell .       are you sure you re not being overdramatic .       no  albert .  does it occur to you that if miniaturization can be tied in with a vast acceleration of the speed of light  a spaceship  if sufficiently miniaturized  can be sent to anywhere in the universe at many times the ordinary speed of light .  we won t need faster than light travel .  light will travel fast enough for us .  and we won t need antigravity  for a miniaturized ship will have close to zero mass .       i can t believe all that .       you couldn t believe miniaturization .       i don t mean i can t believe the results of miniaturization .  i mean i can t believe that the solution of the problem is permanently locked in the brain of one man .  others will eventually think of it .  if not now  then next year or next decade .       it s easy to wait when you are not concerned  albert .  the trouble is we re not going to have a next decade or even a next year .  this grotto which you see all about you has cost the soviet union as much as a minor war .  each time we miniaturize anything    even if it s just katinka    we consume enough energy to last a sizable town for a whole day .  already  our government leaders look askance at this expense and many scientists  who do not understand the importance of miniaturization or who are simply selfish  complain that all of soviet science is being starved for the sake of the grotto .  if we do not come up with a device to save on energy    an extreme saving  too    this place will be shut down .       nevertheless  natalya  if you publish what is now known of miniaturization and make it available to the global association for the advancement of science  then innumerable scientists will put their minds to it and quickly enough someone will devise a method for coupling planck s constant and the speed of light .       yes   said boranova   and perhaps the scientist who will obtain the key of low energy miniaturization will be an american or a frenchman or a nigerian or a uruguayan .  it is a soviet scientist who has it now and we don t want to lose the credit .      morrison said   you forget the global fellowship of science .  don t cut it up into segments .       you would speak differently if it were an american who was on the edge of the discovery and you were asked to do something that might possibly give the credit to one of us .  do you remember the history of the american reaction when the soviet union was the first to put an artificial satellite into orbit .       surely we have advanced since then .       yes  we have advanced a kilometer  but we have not advanced ten kilometers .  the world is not yet entirely global in its thinking .  there remains national pride to a considerable extent .       so much the worse for the world .  still  if we are not global and if national pride is something we are expected to retain  then i should have mine .  as an american  why should i be disturbed over a soviet scientist losing credit for the discovery .       i ask you only to understand the importance of this to us .  i ask you to put yourself in our place for a moment and see if you can grasp our desperation to do what we can to find out what it is that shapirov knows .      morrison said   all right  natalya .  i understand .  i don t approve  but i understand .  now    listen carefully  please    now that i understand  what is it you want of me .       we want you   said boranova intensely   to help us find out what shapirov s thoughts    his still living and existing thoughts    are .       how .  there s nothing in my theory that makes that possible .  even granting that thinking networks do exist  and that brain waves can be minutely analyzed  and even granting that i occasionally get a mental image  possibly imaginary  possibly an artifact    there remains no way in which the brain waves can be studied to the extent of interpreting them in terms of actual thoughts .       not even if you could analyze  in detail  the brain waves of a single nerve cell that was part of a thinking network .       i couldn t deal with a single nerve cell in anything approaching the necessary kind of detail .       you forget .  you can be miniaturized and be inside that single nerve cell .      and morrison stared at her in sick horror .  she had mentioned something like this at their first meeting  but he had put it aside as nonsense    horrifying  but nonsense  since miniaturization  he was certain  was impossible .  but miniaturization was not impossible and now the horror was undiluted and paralyzing .        .     morrison did not then  nor could he at any time afterward  clearly recall the events that immediately followed .  it was not a case of everything going black as much as everything having blurred .     his next clear memory was that of lying on a couch in a small office with boranova looking down at him and with the other three    dezhnev  kaliinin  and konev    behind her .  those three came into focus more slowly .     he tried to struggle into a sitting position  but konev moved toward him and placed his hand on morrison s shoulder .   please  albert  rest awhile .  gather your strength .      morrison looked from one to another in confusion .  he had been upset  but he did not clearly remember what he had been upset about .      what happened .  how    how did i get here .   he looked around the room again .  no  he hadn t been here .  he had been looking through a window at a man in a hospital bed .     he said  puzzled   did i faint .       not really   said boranova   but you weren t quite yourself for a while .  you seemed to undergo a shock .      now morrison remembered .  again he tried to lift himself into a sitting position  more strenuously this time .  he struck konev s restraining hand out of the way .  he was sitting up now  with his hands on the couch on either side of him .      i remember now .  you wanted me to be miniaturized .  what happened to me when you said that .       you simply swayed and    crumpled .  i had you placed on a stretcher and brought here .  it didn t seem to anyone that you needed medication  merely a chance to rest and recover .       no medication .   morrison looked vaguely at his arms  as though he expected to see needle marks through the sleeve of his cotton blouse .      none .  i assure you .       i didn t say anything before i collapsed .       not a word .       then let me answer you now .  i m not going to be miniaturized .  is that clear .       it is clear that you say so .      dezhnev sat down on the couch next to morrison .  he had a full bottle in one hand and an empty glass in the other .      you need this   he said and half filled the glass .      what is it .   asked morrison  lifting his arm to ward it off .      vodka   said dezhnev .   it s not medicinal  it s nourishing .       i don t drink .       there is a time for everything  my dear albert .  this is a time for a warming bit of vodka  even for those who do not drink .       i don t drink out of disapproval .  i can t drink .  i have no head for alcohol  that s all .  if i take two swallows of that  i will be drunk within five minutes .  completely drunk .      dezhnev s eyebrows went up .   so .  what other purpose is there in drinking .  come  if you are lucky enough to win your goal in a few inexpensive sips  thank whatever you find thankable .  a very small amount will warm you  stimulate your peripheral circulation  clear your head  concentrate your thoughts .  it will even give you courage .      kaliinin s voice sounded in half a whisper  but was distinctly audible .   do not expect miracles of a little alcohol .      morrison s head twisted sharply and he looked at her .  she did not seem as pretty as he had thought her on their first meeting .  there was a hard and unforgiving look about her .     morrison said   i have never represented myself as a courageous man .  i have never presented myself as anything that would be of help to you .  i have maintained from the beginning that i could not do anything for you .  that i am here at all is the result of compulsion  as you all know .  what do i owe you .  what do i owe any of you .      boranova said   albert  you are shivering .  take a sip of the vodka .  you will not be drunk on a sip and we won t force more on you .      almost as though to show bravery in a small way  morrison  after a moment s hesitation  took the glass from dezhnev s hand and swallowed a bit of the liquor recklessly .  he felt a burning sensation in his throat  which passed .  the taste was rather sweetish than otherwise .  he took a larger sip and handed the glass back .  dezhnev took it and placed it and the bottle on a small table on his side of the couch .     morrison tried to speak  but he coughed instead .  he waited  cleared his throat  and said breathily   actually  that s not so bad .  if you don t mind  arkady        dezhnev reached for the glass  but boranova said   no .  that s enough  albert .   her imperious gesture stopped dezhnev .   we do not want you drunk  albert .  just a little warm so you will listen to us .      morrison could feel the warmth rising within him  as it always had when  on rare occasions of social bonhomie  he had had some sherry or  once  a dry martini .  he decided he could handle any argument she could produce .      all right   he said   say on   and set his lips into a firm and unyielding line .      i don t say  albert  you owe us anything and i m sorry that all this came as such a shock to you .  we are aware that you are not a reckless man of action and we tried to break it to you as gently as possible .  i had hoped  in fact  that you would see what was essential on your own  without any necessity of explanation .       you were wrong   said morrison .   at no time would such a mad thing have occurred to me .       you see our necessity  don t you .       i see your necessity .  i don t see it as mine .      you might feel you owe it to the cause of global science .       global science is an abstraction that i admire  but i am not likely to want to sacrifice my highly concrete body for an abstraction that doesn t seem to exist .  the whole point of your necessity is that it is soviet science that is at stake  not global science .       then consider american science   said boranova   if you help us  that will become an eternal part of the victory .  it will become a joint soviet american victory .       will my part be publicized .   demanded morrison .   or will the thing be announced as purely soviet .      boranova said   you have my word .       you cannot commit the soviet government .       horrible   said kaliinin .   he judges our government by his own .      konev said   wait  natalya .  let me talk to our american friend  man to man .   he sat down by morrison and said   albert  i appeal to your interest in your work .  so far  you have achieved little in the way of results .  you have convinced no one in your country and you don t have any chance of doing so as long as you are left with only the tools you have .  we offer you a better tool  one whose worth you couldn t dream of three days ago and one which you ll never have again if you turn away from it now .  albert  you have the chance to graduate from romantic speculations to convincing evidence .  do this for us and you will become  at a bound  the most famous neurophysicist in the world .      morrison said   you re asking me to risk my life on an untried technique .       that is not unprecedented .  all through history  scientists have risked death to continue their investigations .  they have gone up in balloons and have dipped under the seas in primitive armored spheres to make their measurements and observations .  chemists have risked dealing with poisons and explosives  biologists with pathogens of all types .  physicians have injected themselves with experimental sera and physicists  in attempting to establish a self supporting nuclear reaction  knew well that the explosion that resulted might destroy them or  conceivably  the entire planet .      morrison said   you spin dreams .  you would never let it be known that an american played a role .  not when you confess your desperation at the possibility that soviet science would lose the credit .      konev said   let s be honest with each other  albert .  we couldn t hide your share in this  even if we wished to .  the american government knows we brought you here .  we know they do .  you know they do .  they made no move to stop us because they want you here .  well  they will know    or at least guess    what we wanted you here for and what you did for us  once we announce our success .  and they will see to it that american science  in your person  will get full credit .      morrison sat silently  head bent  for a while .  there was a flushed spot  high on each cheek  as a result of the vodka he had drunk .  without looking  he knew that four pairs of eyes were firmly fixed upon him and he suspected that four breaths were being held .     he looked up and said   let me ask you one question .  how did shapirov come to be in a coma .      there was again a silence and three of the pairs of staring eyes shifted to natalya boranova .     morrison  seeing that  also stared at her .   well .   he said .     boranova said   albert  i will tell you the truth  even if that would tend to defeat our aims .  if we try to lie to you  you will be right not to believe anything we say .  if you see we are truthful  then you can believe us in the future .  albert  academician shapirov is in a coma because he was miniaturized  as we hope you will be .  there was a small accident during deminiaturizing that destroyed part of his brain  apparently permanently .  that can happen  you see  and we are not hiding it from you .  now give us the credit for utter frankness and say you will help us .        chapter      decision    we are always certain that the decision we have just made is wrong .        dezhnev senior       .     now  finally  morrison rose  feeling a trifle unsteady on his feet    whether from the vodka  from the general tension of the day  or from this last revelation he did not know or care .  he stamped his feet a little  as though to firm them  then deliberately walked the length of the small room and back .     he faced boranova and said in a harsh voice   you can miniaturize a rabbit and nothing seems to happen to it .  did it occur to you that the human brain is the most complex bit of matter we know and that  whatever else might survive  the human brain might not .       it did   said boranova stolidly   but all our investigations have shown us that miniaturization does not in the least affect the interrelationships within the object being miniaturized .  in theory  even the human brain would not be affected by miniaturization .       in theory .   said morrison with contempt .   how is it possible that  based on theory alone  you would experiment with shapirov  whose brain you seem to value so highly .  and having failed with him  to your enormous loss  how can you be so mad as to propose experimenting with me to recover that loss .  you ll simply fail with me  too  and i cannot accept that .      dezhnev said   don t speak nonsense .  we are not mad .  nothing we did was lightly undertaken .  the fault was shapirov s .      boranova said   in a way  it was .  shapirov had his eccentric ways .   crazy peter  i believe you call him in english and that is perhaps not so far off .  he was intent on having the miniaturization experience .  he was getting old  he said  and he would not  like moses  reach the promised land without entering it .       he might have been forbidden to do so .       by me .  i would forbid shapirov .  you can t be serious .       not you .  your government .  if the miniaturization process is so precious to the soviet union         shapirov threatened to abandon the project altogether if he did not have his way and that could not be risked .  nor is our government quite so high handed as it once was in its pressures on troublesome scientists .  it must take world opinion into greater account now  as your government must .  it is the price of global cooperation .  whether that is for the better or for the worse  i cannot say .  in any case  shapirov was eventually miniaturized .      morrison muttered   absolutely mad .       no   said boranova   for we did not move without precautions .  despite the fact that every exercise in miniaturization is costly and sends shivers through the central coordinating committee  we insisted on a careful approach .  twice we miniaturized chimpanzees and twice we brought them back and could detect no changes in them    either as a result of minute studies of their behavior or by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain .       a chimpanzee is not a human being   said morrison .      something we were aware of   said boranova gravely .   therefore  we miniaturized a human being next .  a volunteer .  yuri konev  to be precise .      konev said   it had to be me .  it was i who felt most strongly that the human brain would not be affected .  i am the neurophysicist of the project and it was i who made the necessary calculations .  i would not ask another human being to risk his sanity on my calculations and my certainty .  life is one thing    we all lose it sooner or later .  sanity is quite another .       so brave   whispered kaliinin  looking at her fingertips   the deed of a true soviet hero .   her lip trembled  as though on the brink of a sneer .     looking firmly at morrison  konev said   i am a loyal soviet citizen  but i did not do it for nationalist motives .  they would be  in this case  irrelevant .  i did it as a matter of decency and of scientific ethics .  i had confidence in my analysis and of what worth was my confidence if i would not risk myself on it .  and it is a matter of something else  too .  when the history of miniaturization is recorded  i will be listed as the first human being ever to have been subjected to the process .  that will eclipse the deeds of a great grand uncle of mine who was a general fighting the german nazis in the great patriotic war .  and i would be pleased with that  not out of vainglory but out of a belief that the conquests of peace should always be held superior to victories in war .      boranova said   well  putting ideals to one side and passing on to the facts .  yuri was miniaturized twice .  first  he was taken down to about half his height and was restored in perfect order .  then he was miniaturized to the size of a mouse and again was restored in perfect order .      morrison said   and then shapirov .       and then shapirov .  he was by no means easy to control even this far .  he argued vociferously for the chance to be the first person miniaturized .  after konev s first venture into the small  it was all we could do to persuade him to wait for a second and more drastic attempt .  after that we could control him no more .  not only were we forced to miniaturize him  but he swore that he would abandon the project and somehow make his way out of the country to begin a miniaturization project elsewhere if we did not miniaturize him to a greater extent than we had konev .  we had no choice .  if  crazy peter   as you call him  were mad enough to speak of emigrating  that would go beyond what the government would be willing to allow even in these days .  we didn t want him in prison  so we miniaturized him to the size of a cell .       and that passed the limits of safety  did it .       no .  we have every reason to think he was in perfect order  even miniaturized so far .  he was being brought back and then at one point in the deminiaturization there was a misadventure .  deminiaturization took place a trifle too quickly and the temperature rose slightly in shapirov s body .  it had the effect of a high fever    not enough to kill him  but enough to damage his brain permanently .  it might have been reversed if we could have attended to him at once  but deminiaturization had to be completed and that took time .  it was an appalling catastrophe and all that we can hope for is the chance to salvage what we need from what is left of his brain .       there may be another misadventure  as you call it  if i were to be miniaturized .  isn t that so .       yes   said boranova   that is so .  i don t deny it .  there have been failures and misadventures throughout the history of science .  surely you need no reminder that there were deaths of cosmonauts in space both on the american and soviet sides .  that did not prevent our present settlement of the moon    and of space itself    as a new home for humanity .       that may be so  but all advances in space were made by volunteers .  no one was launched into space against his will .  and i am not volunteering .      boranova said   you need not be so frightened of it .  we have done our best to make it as safe as possible and  by the way  you will not go alone .  konev and shapirov did go alone and as bare as the rabbit  for they  like the rabbit  were in a miniaturization field that was encased in air .  you  on the other hand  will be in a ship  a kind of modified submarine .  it  too  has been miniaturized and deminiaturized without harm .  it is a little less expensive to carry through the process with an inanimate object because it can stand a rise in temperature more easily .  in fact  such a rise serves to test for the ruggedness and stability of all its components .       i am not going  natalya  either alone or with the red army .      boranova ignored the remark .   with you on the ship   she said   will be we four .  myself  sophia  yuri  and arkady .  that is why i have introduced each of them to you .  we are all partners in this greatest of all exploring trips .  we will not be crossing an ocean or penetrating the vacuum of space .  we will instead enter a microscopic ocean and penetrate the human brain .  can you be a scientist    a neurophysicist    and resist that .       yes .  i can resist that .  and easily .  i will not go .      boranova said   we have your software  your program .  you always carry it with you and you had it with you when you were brought here .  we will have a computer on board the ship for you  one that is the exact model of the one you use in your laboratory .  it should not be a long trip .  we will all be miniaturized  taking our chances along with you .  you will take your computer readings and record the sensations you receive and then we will all be deminiaturized and your part will be done with .  say that you will join us .  say you will do it .      and morrison  fists clenched  said stubbornly   i will not join you .  i will not do it .      boranova said   i am so sorry  albert  but that is the wrong answer .  we will not accept it .         .     morrison felt his heart racing again .  if this was going to be a straightforward contest of wills  he was not sure he was up to coping with this woman who  despite all her apparent softness  seemed made of alloy steel .  moreover  she had behind her the full apparatus of the soviet union and he himself was alone .     he said desperately   surely you know this whole thing is a trumped up romantic notion .  how do you know there is any connection between planck s constant and the speed of light .  all you have is some statement by shapirov .  isn t that correct .  did he give you any details .  any evidence .  any explanations .  any mathematical analysis .     it was nothing more than a statement    an imaginative speculation    wasn t it .      morrison tried to sound confident .  after all  if shapirov had given them anything substantive  they would not now be trying the desperate trick of rifling his brain for something useful .  he held his breath  waiting for the response .     boranova looked at konev then said  with a shade of reluctance   we will continue our policy of telling the flat and unadorned truth .  we have nothing but some remarks shapirov made  as you ve guessed .  he enjoyed keeping things to himself until he could spring them on us fully dressed  so to speak .  he was more than a little childish in this respect .  perhaps that was an aspect of his eccentricity    or of his genius    or of both .       but how can you tell  under those circumstances  that such an unsupported speculation would have any validity whatever .       when academician pyotor shapirov said   i feel it will be thus and so   that is how it turned out to be .       come on .  always .       almost always .         almost always .  he could have been wrong this time .       i admit that .  he could have been .       or if he had some notion which would really prove of use  it might have been localized in the part of the brain which has been destroyed .       that is conceivable .       or if the notion is useful and is still in the intact portion of the brain  i might not be able to interpret the brain waves properly .       that may well be .       putting it all together  shapirov s suggestion may be wrong and  even if it isn t  it might be out of reach or  even if it isn t  i might not be able to interpret it .  considering that  what are the chances of success .  and can t you see that we will be putting our lives into danger for something we will almost certainly fail to get .       considering the matter objectively   said boranova   it would seem the chances are very small .  however  if we do not hazard our lives  the chances of obtaining anything at all are zero    flat zero .  if we do risk our lives  the chances of success are very small  admittedly  but they are not zero .  under the circumstances  we must take the risk  even though the best we can say for our chances of success are that they are not zero .       for me   said morrison   the risk is too great and the chances of success are too small .      boranova placed one hand on morrison s shoulder and said   surely that is not your final decision .       surely it is .       think about it .  think about the value to the soviet union .  think about the benefits to your own country that will result from your acknowledged participation  to the needs of global science  to your own fame and reputation .  all this is in favor of doing it .  against it are your personal fears .  these are understandable  but all achievement in life requires the overcoming of fear .       thinking about it won t change my mind .       think about it until tomorrow morning  anyway .  that s fifteen hours and it s all we can spare you .  after all  balancing fears against hopes can keep one irresolute for a lifetime and we don t have a lifetime .  poor shapirov might linger on in coma for a decade  but we don t know how long what is left of his brain will retain his ideas and we dare not wait very long at all .       i can not and will not concern myself with your problems .      boranova seemed to hear none of his denials and refusals .  she said in her unfailingly gentle voice   we will not attempt to persuade you further right now .  you may have a leisurely dinner .  you may watch our holovision programs if you wish  view our books  think  sleep .  arkady will accompany you back to the hotel and if you have any more questions  you need only ask him .      morrison nodded .      and  albert  remember  tomorrow morning you must give us your decision .       take it now .  it will not change .       no .  the decision must be that you will join us and help us .  see to it that you come to that decision    for come to it you must    and it will be easier for all of us if you do so gladly and voluntarily .         .     it proved to be a quiet and thoughtful dinner for morrison and not a very filling one    for he found he could only pick at his food .  dezhnev seemed quite unaffected by the other s lack of appetite and reaction .  he ate vigorously and spoke incessantly  drawing on what was apparently a large stock of funny stories    in all of which his father played a key role    and was clearly delighted to try them out on a new audience .     morrison smiled faintly at one or two  more because he recognized from the other s raised voice that a punch line had been advanced than because he heard them with any interest at all .     valeri paleron  the waitress who had served them at breakfast  was still there at dinner .  a long day    but either that was reflected in her wages or it was required by her extracurricular duties .  either way  she glowered at dezhnev each time she approached the table  perhaps  morrison thought distantly  because she disapproved of his stories  which tended to be disrespectful of the soviet regime .     morrison did not particularly enjoy his own thoughts .  now that he was considering the distant possibility of getting away from the grotto    from malenkigrad    from the soviet union    he was beginning to feel a perverse disappointment at what he might be missing .  he found himself daydreaming just a little on the matter of miniaturization  of using it to prove the worth of his theories  of triumphing over the smug fools who had dismissed him out of hand .     he recognized the fact that  of all the arguments presented by boranova  only the personal one had shaken him .  any reference to the greater good of science  or of humanity  or of this nation or that was just idle rhetoric .  his own place in science was something more .  that seethed within him .     when the serving woman passed near the table  he stirred himself to say   how long must you stay on  waitress .      she looked at him without favor .   until you two grand dukes can bring yourselves to stir out of here .       there s no rush   said dezhnev as he emptied his glass .  his speech was already slurred and his face was flushed .   i am so fond of the comrade waitress  i could stay on for as long as the volga flows  that i might gaze on her face .       as long as i don t have to gaze at yours   muttered paleron .     morrison filled dezhnev s glass and said   what do you think of madame boranova .      dezhnev gazed at the glass owlishly and did not offer to lift it immediately .  he said with an attempt at gravity   not a first class scientist  i am told  but an excellent admin ministrator .  keen  makes up her mind quickly  and absolutely incorr corruptible .  a pain in the neck  i should think .  if an administrator is incorr   too infernally honest  it makes life hard in so many little ways .  she is a worshipper of shapirov  too  and she thinks him incorr   no  incompre   no  incontrovertible .  that s it .      morrison was not sure of the russian word .   you mean she thinks he s always right .       exactly .  if he hints that he knows how to make miniaturization cheap  she s sure he can .  yuri konev is sure of it  too .  he s another of the worshippers .  but it s bora   boranova who ll send you into shapirov s brain .  one way or another  she ll send you there .  she has her ways .     as for yuri  that little shaver  he s the real scientist of the group .  very brilliant .   dezhnev nodded solemnly and sipped at his refilled drink gently .      i m interested in yuri konev   said morrison  his eyes following the lifting of the glass   and in the young woman  sophia kaliinin .      dezhnev leered .   a fine young piece .   then sadly  shaking his head   but she has no sense of humor .       she s married  i take it .      dezhnev shook his head more violently than the occasion seemed to require .   no .       she said she had had a baby .       yes  a little girl  but it isn t the signing of the marriage book that makes one pregnant .  it s the game of bed    married or not .       does the puritanical soviet government approve of this .       no  but its approval was never asked  i think .   he burst into laughter .      besides  as a scientist at malenkigrad  she has her special dispen pensations .  the government looks the other way .       it strikes me   said morrison   that sophia is much interested in yuri konev .       you see that  do you .  it takes little shrewdness .  she is so interested that she has made it quite clear that her child was the result of yuri s collaboration in that little game i spoke of .       oh .       but he denies it .  and very vigorously  too .  i think it is rather humorous  in a bitter way  that he remains compelled to work with her .  neither one can be spared from the project and all he can do is pretend she doesn t exist .       i noticed that he never looks at her  but they must have been friendly once .       very friendly    if she is to be believed .  if so  they were very discreet about it .  but what s the difference .  she doesn t need him to support the child .  her salary is a large one and the day care center takes loving care of her daughter when she is at work .  it is just a matter of emotion with her .       what split them up  i wonder .       who knows .  lovers take their disputes so seriously .  i myself have never let myself fall in love    not poetically .  if i like a girl  i play with her .  if i get tired  i move on .  it is my good fortune that the women i engage are as prag pragmatic    isn t that a good word .     as i am and make little fuss .  as my father used to say   a woman who doesn t fuss has no faults .   sometimes  to be truthful  they grow tired before i do  but even then  so what .  a girl who is tired of me is not much good to me and  after all  there are others .       i suppose yuri is much like that  too  isn t he .      dezhnev had emptied his glass again and he held out his hand when morrison made a move to refill it .   enough .  enough .       never enough   said morrison calmly .   you were telling me about yuri .       what is there to tell .  yuri is not a man to fly from woman to woman  but i have heard     he stared blearily at morrison .   you know how one hears    one tells another who tells another and who is to know whether what comes out of the funnel is anything like what went in .  but i have heard that when yuri was in the united states  being educated western style  he met an american girl .  in went la belle americaine  they say  and out went poor little soviet sophia .  perhaps that was it .  perhaps he came back different and perhaps he still dreams of his lost love across the sea .       and is that why sophia is so ill disposed to americans .      dezhnev stared at the glass of vodka and sipped a little of it .   our sophia   he said   has never liked americans .  this is not surprising .   he leaned toward morrison  his breath heavy with food and drink .   americans are not a lovable people    if i may say so without offense .       i m not offended   said morrison evenly  as he watched dezhnev s head sink slowly and come to rest on his bent right arm .  his breathing grew stertorous .     morrison watched him for half a minute or so  then raised his hand to beckon the serving woman .     she came at once  her ample hips swinging .  she stared at the unconscious dezhnev with rather more than half a sneer .   well  do you wish me to get a large pair of tongs and use them to carry our prince here to his bed .       not just yet  miss paleron .  as you know  i m an american .       as everyone knows .  you have but to say three words and the tables and chairs in this room nod to each other and say   an american .       morrison winced .  he had always been proud of the purity of his russian and this was the second time the woman had sneered at it .      nevertheless   he said   i have been brought here by force  against my will .  i believe it was done without the knowledge of the soviet government  which would have disapproved of and prevented the action if they had known .  the people here    dr .  boranova  whom you have referred to as the tsarina    have acted on their own .  the soviet government should be told of this and they will then act speedily to return me to the united states and prevent an international incident that nobody would want .  don t you agree .      the waitress put her fists on her hips and said   and of what matter is it to anyone either here or in the united states as to whether i agree or not .  am i a diplomat .  am i the reincarnated spirit of tsar peter the great drinker .       you can see to it   said morrison  suddenly uncertain   that the government learns of it .  quickly .       what is it you think  american .  that i have but to tell my lover  who is on the presidium  and all will be well for you .  what have i to do with the government .  what s more    and in all seriousness  comrade foreigner    i do not wish you to talk to me in this fashion again .  many a fine  loyal citizen has been hopelessly compromised by foreign blabbermouths .  i will  of course  report this to comrade boranova at once and she will see to it that you do not insult me in this fashion again .      she left in a flounce and with a scowl and morrison stared after her in dismay .  and then his head whirled in surprise and astonishment when he heard dezhnev s voice saying   albert  albert  are you satisfied  my child .      dezhnev s head was raised from his pillowing arm and  though his eyes were a little bloodshot  his voice seemed to have lost its fuzziness .  he said   i wondered why you were so anxious to fill my glass  so i gobbled a little and let myself collapse .  it was all very interesting .       you are not drunk .   said morrison  goggling at the other in wonder .      i have been more sober in my life  certainly   said dezhnev   but i am not unconscious  nor have i been .  you non drinkers have an exaggerated idea of the speed with which all accomplished soviet citizen will fall unconscious with drink    which shows the dangers of being a nondrinker .      morrison still found himself in a state of disbelief over the failure of the waitress to cooperate .   you said she was an intelligence operator .       did i .   dezhnev shrugged .   i think i said i suspected she was  but suspicions are often wrong .  besides  she knows me better than you do  my little albert  and was probably under no illusion that i was drunk .  i ll bet you ten rubles to a kopeck that she knew i was listening with both ears .  what would you have her say in such circumstances .       in that case   said morrison  taking heart   she will have heard what i said and will nevertheless inform your government of the state of affairs .  your government  to avoid an international incident  will then order me set free  probably with an apology  and you people here will have some tall explaining to do .  you had better free me and send me back to the united states of your own accord .      dezhnev laughed .   your waste your time  my clever intriguer .  you have too romantic a notion of our government .  conceivably  they may be willing to let you go someday but  regardless of possible embarrassment  not before you have been miniaturized and         i don t believe anyone in authority knows you kidnapped me .  they cannot approve once they find out .       maybe they don t know and maybe they will grind their teeth when they find out    but what can they do .  the government has invested too much money in the project to let you go before you have had your chance to make it practical  so that it will repay all that has been spent    and more in addition .  well .  doesn t that seem logical to you .       no .  because i won t help you .   morrison felt his heart harden once again .   i will not allow myself to be miniaturized .       that will be up to natasha .  she will be furious with you  you know  and will have no pity .  you realize that you callously attempted to have everyone in the project thrown into the government s bad graces  have some of us retired    or worse .  and this  after we had treated you with perfect consideration and kindness .       you kidnapped me .       even that was done with perfect consideration and kindness .  were you hurt in any way .  mistreated .  yet you have tried to harm us .  natasha will repay you for that .       how .  force .  torture .  drugs .      dezhnev turned his eyes up to the ceiling .   how little you know our natasha .  she doesn t do such things .  i might  but she wouldn t .  she s as much a gentle chicken heart as you are  my wicked albert    in her own way .  but she will force you to go along with us .       well .  how .       i don t know .  i can never quite make out how she does it .  but she manages .  you will see .   his smile developed a wolfish edge .  and when morrison saw that smile  he finally realized there was no escape .        .     the next morning morrison and dezhnev returned to the grotto .  they entered a large windowless ceiling lit office  which morrison had not seen before .  it was clearly not boranova s and it was very impressive  as anything with an ostentatious waste of space is bound to be .     boranova sat behind a bulky desk and on the wall behind her was a portrait of the soviet executive  looking grave .  in the corner to her left was a water cooler and in the one on the right a microfilm cabinet .  on the desk was a small word processor .  that was all .  the room was empty otherwise .     dezhnev said   i have brought him  you see .  the mischievous fellow tried to use the charming paleron to effect an escape by intriguing with the govemment behind our back .       i have received the report   said boranova quietly .   please leave  arkady .  i wish to be alone with professor albert morrison .       is that safe  natasha .       i think so .  albert is not  in my opinion  a man of violence .     will i be safe  albert .      morrison spoke for virtually the first time that day .   let s not play games   he said .   what is it you want  natalya .      boranova gestured with her hand peremptorily and dezhnev left .  when the door closed behind him  she said   why have you done this .  why have you tried to intrigue with someone you thought was an intelligence agent watching us .  have we treated you so badly .       yes   said morrison angrily   you have .  why can t any of you get it through your head that hijacking me to the soviet union is not something i am likely to appreciate .  why do you expect gratitude of me .  because you didn t break my head in the process .  you probably would have    if my head  unbroken  hadn t been valuable to you .       if your head  unbroken  hadn t been valuable to us  we would have left you in peace .  you know that and you know the necessity that drove us .  we have explained it carefully .  if you were simply trying to get away  i would understand  but your method of attempted escape might have destroyed our project and perhaps us as well    if you had succeeded .  you hoped our government would disapprove of our actions and be appalled .  if that were so  what do you think would have happened to us .      morrison s lips tightened and he looked sullen .   i could think of no other way of escaping .  you speak of driving necessities .  my needs drive me  too .       albert  we have tried every reasonable way to persuade you to help us .  there has been no force  no threats of force  no unpleasantness of any kind after you had arrived there .  isn t that true .       i suppose so .       you suppose so .  it is true .  but it has all failed .  you still refuse to help us  i think .       i still refuse and i shall continue to refuse .       then i am forced  very much against my will  to take the next step .      a bit of fear stirred within morrison and he felt his heart skip a beat  but he tried desperately to sound defiant   which is .       you want to get home  to go back to america .  very well  if all our persuasiveness fails  you shall return .       are you serious .       are you surprised .       yes  i m surprised  but i accept .  i take you at your word .  when will i leave .       the very moment we settle upon the story we re going to tell .       where s the problem .  tell the truth .       that would be a little difficult  albert .  it would embarrass my government  which would have to deny having given permission for my action .  i would be in serious trouble .  it would be unreasonable for you to expect me to do that .       what can you say instead .       that you came here at your own request  in order to help us with our projects .      morrison shook his head vehemently .   that would be at least as difficult for me as admitting the kidnapping would be for you .  these may be the good new days  but old habits die hard and the american public would be more than a little suspicious of an american scientist who went to the soviet union to help them with their projects .  old competitions remain and i have my reputation to think of .       yes  there is that difficulty   admitted boranova   but from my point of view  i would rather you had the difficulty than that i did .       but i won t allow it .  do you suppose i will hesitate to tell the truth in full detail .       but  albert   said boranova quietly   do you suppose anyone would believe you .       of course .  the american government knows that you asked me to come to the soviet union and that i refused .  i would have had to be kidnapped to get here .       i m afraid your american government won t want to admit that  albert .  would they want to say that soviet agents had plucked an american out of his comfortable hotel room and carried him off by land  sea  and air without the forces of american law being aware of this .  considering modern american high tech  of which your people are all so proud  that would argue either incompetence or a little inside treason on the part of your intelligence .  i think your government would prefer to have the world believe you went to the soviet union voluntarily .     besides  they wanted you to go to the soviet union voluntarily  didn t they .      morrison was silent .     boranova said   of course they did .  they wanted you to find out as much about miniaturization as possible .  you re going to have to tell them you refused to be miniaturized .  all you ll be able to report will be that you watched a rabbit undergo miniaturization  which they will consider to have been a bit of flim flam on our part .  they will consider that we carefully hoodwinked you and you will have failed them badly .  they will not feel bound to support you .      morrison revolved the matter in his mind .  he said   do you really intend to leave me in the position of being considered a spy and a traitor by my people .  is that what you re going to try to do .       no  indeed  albert .  we will tell all the truth we can .  in fact  we would like to protect you  even though you showed no signs of wanting to protect us .  we would explain that our great scientist pyotr shapirov is in a coma  that he had spoken highly of your neurophysical theories shortly before this tragedy had befallen him .  we therefore called on you and asked you to use your theories and your expertise to see if you could bring him out of his coma .  you can t object to that .  it would hold you up to the world as a great humanitarian .  your government might well support this view .  it would certainly protect them against possible embarrassment    and our government as well .  and it is all almost true .       what about the miniaturization .       that is the one place where we must avoid the truth .  we can t mention that .       but what would keep me from mentioning it .       the fact that no one would believe you .  did you accept the existence of miniaturization until you saw it with your own eyes .  nor would your government want to spread the feeling that the soviet union has attained miniaturization .  they would not want to frighten the american public until such time as they were certain the soviet union had the process and  better yet  that they had the process as well .     but there you are  albert .  we will send you home with an innocuous story that doesn t mention miniaturization  doesn t embarrass either my country or yours  and relieves you of any suspicion of being a traitor .  are you satisfied .      morrison stared at boranova uncertainly and rubbed his thin sandy hair till it stood lip in vague tufts .   but why will you say you are sending me back .  that has to be explained  too .  you can t very well say that shapirov recovered with my help unless he actually recovers so that you can produce him .  nor can you say that he died before i could get to him unless he actually does die soon  as otherwise you would have to explain why he is still in a coma or why  perhaps  he has come back to life .  you can t hide the situation forever .       that is a problem that worries us  albert  and it is clever of you to see it .  after all  we are sending you back within a few days of your arrival    and why .  the only logical reason  i m afraid  is that we have found you to be a charlatan .  we brought you here in high hopes for our poor shapirov  but in no time at all it turned out that your views were incoherent nonsense and  with bitter disappointment  we sent you back .  that will do you no harm  albert .  being a charlatan is not the same as being a spy .       don t play the innocent  natalya .  you can t do that .   he had turned white with anger .      but it makes sense  doesn t it .  your own peers don t take you seriously .  they laugh at your views .  they would agree with us that your neurophysical suggestions are incoherent nonsense .  we d be a little embarrassed for having been so credulous as to take you seriously  but it was really shapirov who thought highly of you and he was  unbeknown to us  on the edge of a stroke and total mental breakdown  so that one could scarcely blame him for his mad admiration of you .      morrison s lips trembled .   but you can t make a clown out of me .  you can t ruin my reputation so .       but what reputation are you talking about  albert .  your wife has left you and some people think it was because having your career founder on your mad ideas was the last straw for her .  we have heard that your appointment is not to be renewed and that you have not managed to find another place .  you are finished as a scientist in any case and this story of ours would merely conflrm what already exists .  perhaps you can find some other way of making a living    outside of science .  you would probably have had to do that anyway  even if we had never touched you .  there s that consolation .       but you re lying and you know you re lying  natalya .  have you no code of ethics .  can a respectable scientist do this to an honorable brother scientist .       you were unmoved by abstractions yesterday  albert  and i am unmoved by them today in consequence .       someday scientists will discover i was right .  how will you look then .       we may all be dead by then .  besides  you know that that is not the way it works .  franz anton mesmer  though he discovered hypnotism  was considered a fraud and a charlatan .  when james braid rediscovered hypnotism  he got the credit and mesmer was still considered a fraud and charlatan .  besides are we truly lying when we call you a charlatan .       of course you are .       let s reason it out .  why do you refuse to venture into an experiment of miniaturization which may enable you to establish your theories and which is likely to increase your knowledge of the brain by whole orders of magnitude .  such refusal can only arise through your own certain knowledge that your theories are wrong  that you are either a fool or a fraud or both  and that you don t want this established beyond a doubt  as it would be if you subjected yourself to miniaturization .       that is not so .       do you expect us to believe that you refuse miniaturization simply because you are frightened .  that you turn down a chance at knowledge  glory  fame  victory  vindication after years of scorn    all because you are scared .  come  we can t think so little of you  albert .  it makes much more sense to believe you are a fraud and so we will have no hesitation in saying you are .       americans won t believe a soviet libel against an american scientist .       oh  albert  of course they will .  when we release you  with our explanation  it will be in all your american newspapers at once .  they will be full of it .  they are the most enterprising in the world and the freest  as you are all so fond of saying  meaning they are a law unto themselves .  they pride themselves on it and never tire of flaunting that in the eyes of our own more sedate press .  this will be such a lovely story for them   american faker fools stupid soviets .   i can see the headlines now .  in fact  albert  you may make a great deal of money on your american lecture circuit .  you know   how i made jerks of the soviets .   then you can tell them all the ridiculous things you persuaded us to believe before we caught on to you and the audiences will laugh themselves into hysterics .      morrison said in a whisper   natalya  why do you do this to me .       i .  i am doing nothing .  you are doing it .  you want to go home and since we ve failed to get you to accept miniaturization  we have no choice but to agree .  once  though  we agree to send you home  then  step by step  everything else must logically follow .       but in that case  i can t go home .  i can t have my life destroyed beyond repair .       but who would care  albert .  your estranged wife .  your children  who no longer know you and can always change their names anyway .  your university  which is firing you .  your colleagues  who laugh at you .  your government  which has abandoned you .  take heart .  no one would care .  an initial raucous laugh across the whole country and then you would be forgotten forever .  you ll die without an obituary notice eventually  except for those papers who might not object to the tastelessness of bringing back that old joke for one more spurt of laughter to follow you to your grave .      morrison shook his head in despair .   i can t go home .       but you must .  unless you are willing to help us  which you re not  you can t stay here .       but i can t go home on your terms .       but what is the alternative .      morrison stared at the woman  who was looking at him with such mild concern .  he whispered   i accept the alternative .      boranova looked at him for a long minute .   i do not wish to be mistaken  albert .  put your agreement into clear language .       it s either consent to be miniaturized or consent to be destroyed .  isn t that it .      boranova thrust out her lips .   that s a harsh way of putting it .  i prefer that you look at it this way .  either you agree to help us by noon or you will be on a plane to the united states by   p . m .  what do you say .  it is now nearly    a . m .  you have over an hour to decide .       what s the use .  an hour won t change anything .  i ll be miniaturized .       we will be miniaturized .  you will not be alone .   boranova reached out and touched a contact on her desk .     dezhnev entered .   well  albert .  you stand there looking so sad  so crumpled  that it strikes me you have decided to help us .      boranova said   you need make no sardonic remarks .  albert will help us and we will be grateful for his help .  his decision was a voluntary one .       i m sure it was   said dezhnev .   how you squeezed it out this time  natasha  i can t say  but i knew you would .     and i must contratulate you  too  albert .  it took her quite a bit longer than i thought it would .      morrison could only stare at the two vacantly .  he felt as though he had swallowed an icicle whole    one that didn t melt but that  instead  reduced the temperature of his abdomen to the freezing point .     certainly  he was shivering .       chapter      ship    no voyage is dangerous to the one who waves good bye from the shore .        dezhnev senior       .     morrison felt numb all through lunch and yet in a way the pressure was off .  there were no determined voices pressing on him  no intensity of explanations and persuasions  no smiles of intent  no heads closing in .     of course  they made it quite clear  in a cool businesslike way  that he would no longer leave the grotto till the deed was done and that from the grotto there was  of course  no escape .     and then every once in a while a thought swirled into his mind .  he had actually agreed to be miniaturized .     they took him to a room of his own in the grotto where he could view book films through a viewer provided for his personal use    even english language book films if he wanted the inner familiarity of home to pass the next few hours .  so he sat there with a book film unreeling through the viewer strapped on his eyes and somehow it left his mind totally untouched .     he had actually agreed to be miniaturized .     he had been told that he could do as he pleased until someone came for him .  he could do as he pleased  that is  provided he did not please to leave .  there were guards everywhere .     the feeling of terror had  morrison was aware  much diminished .  that was the use of numbness and  of course  the more one repeats a sentence in one s mind  the more it loses meaning .  he had actually agreed to be miniaturized  the more it rang in his mind like the tolling of a bell  over and over  the more the horror of it faded .  and left a mere vacuum of non sensation in its place .     he was distantly aware that the door of his room had opened .  someone  he presumed dully  had come for him .  he removed his viewer  lifted his eyes languidly  and  for just a moment  felt a mild spark of interest .     it was sophia kaliinin  looking beautiful even to his bleared senses .  she said in english   a good afternoon to you  gentleman .      he grimaced slightly .  he would rather hear russian than english delivered with quite so distorted an accent .     he said sullenly in russian   please speak in russian  sophia .      his russian might be as distressing to her  for all he knew  as her english was to him  but he didn t care .  he was here by their doing and if his shortcomings troubled them  that was their doing  too .     she shrugged slightly and said in russian   certainly    if that is what pleases you .      then she stared at him for a thoughtful while .  he met that stare easily enough for  at the moment  he did not much care what he did and looking at her was not much different to him than looking at something else would have been    or looking at nothing would have been .  the momentary impression of beauty that had come with her entrance had faded .     she said finally   i understand that you have now agreed to accompany us on our venture .       yes  i have .       that is good of you .  we are all grateful .  in all honesty  i did not think you would do so  since you are an american .  i apologize .      morrison said with a far off touch of regret and anger   the decision to help you was not voluntary .  i was persuaded    by an expert .       by natalya boranova .      morrison nodded .      she is very good at persuading   said kaliinin .   not very kind  usually  but very good .  i  too  required persuasion .       why you .   said morrison .      i had other reasons    ones that were important to me .       indeed .  what were they .       but unimportant to you .      there was a short uncomfortable pause .      come  the task i have been given is to show you the ship   said kaliinin .      the ship .  how long have you been planning this .  have you had time to build a ship .       for the specific purpose of testing shapirov s brain from within .  of course not .  it was meant for other  simpler purposes  but it is the only thing we have that we can use .     come  albert  natalya thinks it will be wise for you to become acquainted with it  see it  feel it .  it is possible that the down to earthness of the technology will reconcile you to the task .      morrison held back .   why must i see it now .  can t i have time to grow accustomed to the whole subject of personal miniaturization .       that is foolish  albert .  if you had more time to sit in your room and brood  you would have more time to feed your uncertainty .  besides  we have no time .  how long do you suppose we can allow shapirov to lie there deteriorating  with his thoughts diminishing with each moment .  the ship embarks on its journey tomorrow morning .       tomorrow morning   muttered morrison  his throat dry .  foolishly  he looked at his watch .      you have few enough hours  but we ll keep track of the time for you so you need not consult your watch .  tomorrow morning the ship enters a human body .  and you will be on the ship .      then  without warning  she slapped his cheek hard .  she said   your eyes were beginning to turn upward .  were you planning to faint .      morrison rubbed his cheek  grimacing with pain .   i wasn t planning anything   he mumbled   but i might have fainted without planning it .  have you no gentler way of breaking the news .       have i really caught you by surprise  when you already know that you have agreed to be miniaturized and it is self evident that we have no time .      she gestured peremptorily   now come with me .      and morrison  still rubbing his cheek and seething with rage and humiliation  followed .        .     it was back to the miniaturization area    back to the busy people  each concerned with their own affairs and paying no attention to one another .  through them all  kaliinin walked with an erect carriage and maintained the aristocratic air that arises automatically when all defer to you .     she was one of the leading lights  morrison could see  his hand still resting lightly on his cheek  which felt inflamed and which he hesitated to expose   and all who crossed or even neared her path nodded their heads in a kind of rudimentary bow and stepped a little backward  as though to make sure not to impede her patch .  no one acknowledged morrison s presence at all .     on  on  through one room after another    and everywhere the feel of pent up energy held in bare check .     kaliinin must have sensed it too  familiar as she must be with it  for she muttered to morrison with a certain pride   there s a solar power station in space  a major part of whose output is reserved for malenkigrad .      and then they were upon it before morrison had a true chance to realize what he was looking at .  it was not a very large room and the object within it was not of impressive bulk .  indeed  morrison s first impression was that it was a piece of artwork .     it was a streamlined object not much larger than an automobile  certainly shorter than a stretch limousine  though taller .  and it was transparent .     automatically  morrison reached out to feel it .     it was not cold to the touch .  it felt smooth and almost moist  but when he removed his hand  his fingertips were perfectly dry .  he tried it again and as he ran his fingertips across the surface  they seemed to stick slightly  but they left no sweaty mark .  on impulse  he breathed upon it .  there was the shadow of condensing moisture on the transparent material  but it disappeared quickly .      it is a plastic material   said kaliinin   but i don t know its composition .  if i knew  it would probably come under the head of classified information anyway  but whatever it is  it is stronger than steel    tougher and more resistant to shock    kilogram for kilogram .       weight for weight  perhaps   said morrison  for the moment his scientific curiosity drowning his uneasiness   but such a thickness of plastic material could not possibly be as strong as the same thickness of steel .  it could not be as strong  volume for volume .       yes  but where are we going .   said kaliinin .   there will be no pressure differential inside and outside the ship  there will be no meteroids or even cosmic dust against which we must protect ourselves .  there will be about us nothing but soft cell structure .  this plastic will be ample protection and it is light .  the two of us could perhaps lift it if we tried .  that is what is important .  as you can well understand  we must be sparing of mass .  every additional kilogram consumes considerable electromagnetic energy in miniaturization and delivers considerable heat in deminiaturization .       will it hold a large enough crew .   said morrison  peering inside .      it will .  it is very compact  but it can hold six and we will only be five .  and it contains a surprising amount of unusual gadgetry .  not as much as we would like  of course .  the original plans    but what can we do .  there are always pressures for economy  even unwarranted ones  in this unjust world .      morrison said with a twinge of strong uneasiness   how much pressure for how much economy .  does everything work .       i assure you it does .   her face had lit up .  now that the settled melancholy had left  temporarily only  morrison felt sure   kaliinin was unmistakably good looking .   everything in it has been tested exhaustively  both singly and all together .  zero risk is impossible of attainment  but we have a reasonably close to zero risk here .  and all with virtually no metal .  what with microchips  fiber optics  and manuilsky junctions  we have all we want in a total of less than five kilograms of devices all together .  that is why the ship can be so small .  after all  voyages into the microcosm are not expected to last for more than some hours  so we don t need sleeping arrangements  cycling equipment  elaborate food and air supplies  anything other than quite simple devices for excretory functions  and so on .       who ll be at the controls .       arkady .       arkady dezhnev .       you seem surprised .       i don t know why i should .  i presume he s qualified .       completely .  he s in engineering design and he s a genius at it .  you can t go by the way he sounds    no  you can go by the way he sounds .  do you suppose any of us could endure his crude humor and affectations if he weren t a genius at something .  he designed the ship    every part of it    and all its equipment .  he invented a dozen completely new ways of lowering mass and introducing compactness .  you have nothing like it in the united states .      morrison said stiffly   i have no way of knowing what the united states may have or may not have in unusual devices .       i am sure they don t .  dezhnev is an unusual person  for all his love of presenting himself as a boor .  he is a descendant of semyon ivanov dezhnev .  you have heard of him  i suppose .      morrison shook his head .      really .   kaliinin s voice turned icy .   he is only the famous explorer who  in the time of peter the great  explored siberia to its easternmost centimeter and said there was a stretch of sea separating siberia and north america decades before vitus bering  a dane in russian employ  discovered the bering strait .     and you don t know dezhnev .  that s so american .  unless a westerner did it  you never heard of it .       don t see insults everywhere  sophia .  i haven t studied exploration .  there are many american explorers that i don t know    and that you don t  either .   he shook his finger at her  again remembering her slap and rubbing his check once more   this is what i mean .  you find things to feed hate on    inconsequential things you should feel ashamed to grub up .       semyon dezhnev was a great explorer    and not inconsequential .       i m willing to admit that .  i am glad to learn of him and i marvel at his achievement .  but my not having heard of him is not a fit occasion for soviet american rivalry .  be ashamed of yourself .      kaliinin s eyes fell  then lifted to his cheek .   had she left a bruise there .  morrison wondered .   she said   i m sorry i struck you  albert .  it need not have been that hard  but i didn t want you to faint .  at that moment  i felt i would have no patience to deal with an unconscious american .  i did let unjustified anger guide me .       i ll grant you meant well  but i  too  wish you had not struck so hard .  still  i will accept your apology .       then let us get into the ship      morrison managed a smile .  somehow he felt a little better dealing with kaliinin than he would have with dezhnev or konev    or even boranova .  a pretty woman  still quite young  does somehow distract a man s mind from his troubles more effectively than most things would .  he said   aren t you afraid i might try to sabotage it .      kaliinin paused .   actually  i m not .  i suspect you have enough respect for a vessel of scientific exploration to avoid doing it any damage whatever .  besides    and i say this seriously  albert    the laws against sabotage are excessively severe in the soviet union and the slightest mistake in handling anything in the ship will set off an alarm that will have guards here in a matter of seconds .  we have strict laws against guards beating up saboteurs  but sometimes they tend to forget themselves in their indignation .  please don t even think of touching anything .      she put a hand on the hull as she spoke and presumably closed a contact  though morrison didn t see how it was done .  a door    a rectangle curved at the edge    opened .   the door s own edge seemed to be double .  would it also act as an air lock .      the opening was compact .  kaliinin  entering first  had to stoop .  she held out a hand to morrison .   careful  albert .      morrison not only stooped  but turned sideways .  once inside the ship  he found that he could not quite stand upright .  when he bumped his head gently  he looked up at the ceiling  startled .     kaliinin said   we ll be doing our work sitting down for the most part  so don t be concerned about the ceiling .       i don t think claustrophobes would like this .       are you claustrophobic .       no .      kaliinin nodded her relief .   that s good .  we have to save space  you know .  what can i tell you .      morrison looked around .  there were six seats  in pairs .  he sat down in the one nearest the door and said   these are not exactly roomy  either .       no   admitted kaliinin .   weight lifters could not be accommodated .      morrison said   obviously  this ship was built long before shapirov went into his coma .       of course .  we ve been planning to have miniaturized personnel invade living tissue for a long time .  that would be necessary if we wished to make truly important biological discoveries .  naturally  we expected that we would work with animals at the start and study the circulatory system in fine detail .  it is for that project that this ship was built .  no one could possibly have guessed that when the time came to carry out the first such microvoyage  the subject would not only be a human body but shapirov himself .      morrison was still studying the interior of the ship .  it seemed bare .  detail was surprisingly difficult to make out in the situation of transparency on transparency and miniaturization of the old type    ordinary  but microscopic    components .     he said   there will be five on the ship  you and i  boranova  konev  and dezhnev .       that s right .       and what will each of us be doing .       arkady will control the ship .  obviously  he knows how to do that .  it s the child of his hands and mind .  he ll be in the left front seat .  to his right will be the other male  who has a complete map of the neurocirculatory pattern of shapirov s brain .  he will be the pilot .  i will sit behind arkady and i will control the electromagnetic pattern of the ship s surface .       an electromagnetic pattern .  what s that for .       my dear albert .  you recognize objects by reflected light  a dog recognizes objects by emitted odor  a molecule recognizes objects by surface electromagnetic pattern .  if we re going to make our way as a miniaturized object among molecules  we must have the proper patterns in order to be treated as friends rather than foes .       that sounds complicated .       it is    but it happens to be my life study .  natalya will sit behind me .  she will be the captain of the expedition .  she will make the decisions .       what kind of decisions .       whatever kind are necessary .  obviously  those can t be predicted in advance .  as for you  you will sit to my right .      morrison rose and managed to shift his position along the narrow aisle on the door side of the seats and move one seat back .  he had been in konev s seat and now he was in what would be his own .  he could feel his heart pounding as he imagined himself in that same seat on the following day  with the miniaturization process in progress .     he said in a muffled voice   there is only one man  then    yuri konev    who was miniaturized and deminiaturized and was unharmed by the process .       yes .       and he mentioned no discomfort in the process  no sickness  no mental disturbance .       nothing of the sort was reported .       would that be because he is a stoic .  would he feel it would be beneath the dignity of a hero of soviet science to complain .       don t be foolish .  we are not heroes of soviet science and the one you speak of certainly isn t .  we are human beings and scientists and  in fact  if there were any discomfort that we felt  we would be compelled to describe it in full detail  since it might be that with modifications of the process we could remove that discomfort and make future miniaturizations less difficult .  hiding any part of the truth would be unscientific  unethical  and dangerous .  don t you see that    since you are a scientist yourself .       yet there may be individual differences .  yuri konev survived untouched .  pyotr shapirov did not    quite .       that had nothing to do with individual differences   said kaliinin impatiently .      we can t really tell  can we .       then judge for yourself  albert .  do you think we would take the ship into miniaturization without a final testing    with and without human beings aboard .  this ship was miniaturized  empty  during the course of this past night    not to a very great extent  but enough to know that all is well .      at once morrison struggled upward to get out of his seat .   in that case  if you don t mind  sophia  i want to get out before it is tested with human beings aboard .       but  albert  it s too late .       what .       look out the ship at the room .  you haven t once looked outside since you got in  which  i suppose  was a good thing .  but look out now .  go ahead .  the walls are transparent and the process is complete for now .  please .  look .      morrison  startled  did so and then  very slowly  his knees bent and he seated himself again .  he asked  and even as he did so  he knew how foolish he must sound    do the ship s walls have a magnifying effect .       no  of course not .  everything outside is as it always is .  the ship and i and you have been miniaturized to about half our linear dimensions .         .     morrison felt dizziness overcome him and he bent his head between his knees and breathed slowly and deeply .  when he lifted his head again  he saw kaliinin watching him thoughtfully .  she was standing in the narrow aisle  leaning slightly against a seat s armrest to allow the ceiling to clear her head .      you might have fainted this time   she said .   it would not have disturbed me .  we are being deminiaturized now and that will be more time consuming than the miniaturization  which took no more than three or four minutes .  it will take an hour or so for us to get back  so you will have ample time to recover .       it was not a decent act to do this without telling me  sophia .       on the contrary   said kaliinin .   it was an act of kindness .  would you have entered the ship as freely and as easily as you did if you had suspected that we would be miniaturized .  would you have inspected the ship as coolly if you had known .  and if you had been anticipating miniaturization  would you not have developed psychogenic symptoms of all sorts .      morrison was silent .     kaliinin said   did you feel anything .  were you even aware that you were being miniaturized .      morrison shook his head .   no .      then  driven by a certain shame  he said   you ve never been miniaturized before any more than i have  have you .       no .  before this day  konev and shapirov have been the only human beings to have undergone miniaturization .       and you weren t at all apprehensive .      she said   i wouldn t say that .  i was uneasy .  we know from our experience with space travel that  as you said earlier  there are individual differences in reaction to unusual environments .  some astronauts suffer episodes of nausea under zero gravity and some do not  for instance .  i couldn t be sure how i would react .     did you feel nausea .       i didn t until i found out we had been miniaturized  but i suppose feeling queasy now doesn t count .     who planned this .       natalya .       of course .  i needn t have asked   he said drily .      there were reasons .  she felt we couldn t have you break down once the voyage began .  we couldn t be expected to deal with hysteria on your part once we began miniaturizing .       i suppose i deserve that lack of confidence   said morrison  his eyes looking away in embarrassment from those of kaliinin .   and i imagine she assigned you to come with me for the precise purpose of distracting my attention while all this was going on .       no .  that was my idea .  she wanted to come with you herself  but with her  by now  i thought you might be anticipating trickery .       whereas with you  i might be at my ease .       at least  as you say  distracted .  i am still young enough to distract men .   then  with a touch of bitterness   most men .      morrison looked up  eyes narrowing .   you said i might be anticipating trickery .       i mean  with natalya .       why not with you .  all i see now is that everything outside seems enlarged .  how can i be sure that that is not an illusion  something designed to make me think i have been miniaturized and that it is harmless    merely so that i step quietly into the ship tomorrow .       that s ridiculous  albert  but let s consider something .  you and i have lost half our linear dimension in every direction .  the strength of our muscles varies inversely with their cross sections .  they are now half their normal width and half their normal thickness  so that they have half times half or one fourth the cross section and  therefore  the strength they would normally have .  do you see what i mean .  do you understand .       yes  of course   said morrison  annoyed .   that is elementary .       but our bodies as a whole are half as tall  half as wide  and half as thick  so that the total volume    and mass and weight as well    is half times half times half or one eighth what it was originally .     if we are miniaturized  that is .       yes .  this is the square cube law .  it s been understood since galileo s time .       i know  but you haven t been thinking about it .  if i were to try to lift you now  i would be lifting one eighth your normal weight and i would be doing so with my muscles at one quarter their normal strength .  my muscles compared to your weight would be twice as strong as they would appear to be if we were not miniaturized .      and with that  kaliinin thrust her hands under his armpits and  with a grunt  lifted .  up he moved from his seat .     she held him so while she gasped twice and then she lowered him .   it s not easy   she said  panting a bit   but i could do it .  and since you may be telling yourself   ah yes  but this is sophia  probably a soviet weight lifter   then do it to me .      kaliinin seated herself in the seat before him and held out her arms to either side and said   come  stand up and lift me .      morrison rose to his feet and into the aisle .  he moved forward  turned  and faced her .  the slight bending enforced on him by the low ceiling made it an uncomfortable position .  for a moment  he hesitated .     kaliinin said   come  seize me under the arms .  i use deodorant .  and you needn t be concerned about possibly touching my breasts .  they have been touched before this .  come    i m lighter than you are and you re stronger than i am .  since i have lifted you  you should have no trouble at all lifting me .      nor did he .  he couldn t lift with his full strength because of his slight  uncomfortable stoop  but he automatically applied the force he judged  through years of experience  would be suitable for an object her size .  she floated upward  however  almost as though she were weightless .  despite the fact that he had been somewhat prepared for the possibility  he almost dropped her .      do you consider that an illusion .   kaliinin asked .   or are we miniaturized .       we are miniaturized   said morrison .   but how did you do it .  i never saw you make a move that looked as though you might be using miniaturization controls .       i didn t .  it s all done from outside .  the ship is equipped with miniaturization devices of its own  but i wouldn t dare use them .  that would be part of natalya s job .       and now the deminiaturization is being controlled from outside  too  isn t it .       that s right .       and if the deminiaturization gets slightly out of hand  our brains will be damanged as shapirov s was    or worse .       that s not really likely   said kaliinin  stretching her legs out into the aisle   and it doesn t help to think about it .  why not just relax and close your eyes .      morrison persisted .   but damage is possible .       of course it s possible .  almost anything is possible .  a three meter wide meteroite may strike two minutes from now  penetrate the mountain shell above us  flash into this room  and destroy the ship and us and perhaps the entire project in a few flaming seconds .     but it s not likely .      morrison cradled his head in his arms and wondered whether    if the ship started warming    he could feel the heat before his brain proteins denatured .        .     well over half an hour had passed before morrison felt convinced that the objects he could see outside the ship were shrinking and were receding perceptibly toward their normal size .     morrison said   i am thinking of a paradox .       what s that .   said kaliinin  yawning .  she had obviously taken her own advice about the advisability of relaxing .      the objects outside the ship seemed to grow larger as we shrink .  ought not the wavelengths of light outside the ship also grow larger  becoming longer in wavelength  as we shrink .  should we not see everything outside turn reddish  since there can scarcely be enough ultraviolet outside to expand and replace the shorter wave visible light .      kaliinin said   if you could see the light waves outside  that would indeed be how they would appear to you .  but you don t .  you see the light waves only after they ve entered the ship and impinged upon your retina .  and as they enter the ship  they come under the influence of the miniaturization field and automatically shrink in wavelength  so that you see those wavelengths inside the ship exactly as you would see them outside .       if they shrink in wavelength  they must gain energy .       yes  if planck s constant were the same size inside the miniaturization field as it is outside .  but planck s constant decreases inside the miniaturization field    that is the essence of miniaturization .  the wavelengths  in shrinking  maintain their relationship to the shrunken planck s constant and do not gain energy .  an analogous case is that of the atoms .  they also shrink and yet the interrelationships among atoms and among the subatomic particles that make them up remain the same to us inside the ship as they would seem to us outside the ship .       but gravity changes .  it becomes weaker in here .       the strong interaction and the electroweak interaction come under the umbrella of the quantum theory .  they depend on planck s constant .  as for gravitation .   kaliinin shrugged .   despite two centuries of effort  gravitation has never been quantized .  frankly  i think the gravitational change with miniaturization is evidence enough that gravitation cannot be quantized  that it is fundamentally nonquantum in nature .       i can t believe that   said morrison .   two centuries of failure can merely mean we haven t managed to get deep enough into the problem yet .  superstring theory nearly gave us our unified field at last .    it relieved him to discuss the matter .  surely he couldn t do so if his brain were heating in the least .       nearly doesn t count   said kaliinin .   still  shapirov agreed with you  i think .  it was his notion that once we tied planck s constant to the speed of light  we would not only have the practical effect of miniaturizing and deminiaturizing in an essentially energy free manner  but that we would have the theoretical effect of being able to work out the connection between quantum theory and relativity and finally have a good unified field theory .  and probably a simpler one than we could have imagined possible  he would say .       maybe   said morrison .  he didn t know enough to comment beyond that .      shapirov would say   said kaliinin  warming to the task   that at ultraminiaturization  the gravitational effect would be close enough to zero to be utterly ignored and that the speed of light would be so great that it might be considered infinite .  with mass virtually zero  inertia would be virtually zero and any object  like this ship  for instance  could be accelerated with virtually zero energy input to any speed .  we would have  practically speaking  antigravity and faster than light travel .  chemical drive  he said  gave us the solar system  ion drive would give us the nearer stars  but relativistic miniaturization would give us the whole universe at a bound .       it s a beautiful vision   said morrison  ravished .      then you know what we re looking for now  don t you .      morrison nodded .   all that    if we can read shapirov s mind .  and if he really had something there and wasn t merely dreaming .       isn t the chance worth the risk .       i am on the point of believing so   said morrison in a low voice .   you are terribly convincing .  why couldn t natalya have used arguments of that sort  rather than those she did use .       natalya is    natalya .  she is a highly practical person  not a dreamer .  she gets things done .      morrison studied kaliinin as she sat  now in the seat to his left  looking straight ahead with an abstracted look that gave her profile the appearance of an impractical dreamer  at that    but perhaps not one who  like shapirov  dreamed of conquering the universe .  with her  it was something closer to home perhaps .     he said   your unhappiness is not my business  sophia  as you ve said    but i have been told about yuri .      her eyes flashed .   arkady .  i know it was he .  he is a    a     she shook her head .   with all his education and all his genius  he remains a peasant .  i always think of him as a bearded serf with a vodka bottle .       i think he s concerned about you in his own way  even if he doesn t express himself poetically .  everyone must be concerned .      kaliinin stared at morrison fiercely  as if holding her words back .     he prodded her gently  saying   why don t you tell me about it .  i think it will help and i am a logical choice  being the outsider of the party    i assure you i am trustworthy .      kaliinin looked at him again  this time almost gratefully .      yuri .   she spat .   everyone may be concerned  except yuri .  he has no feelings .       he must have been in love with you at one time .       must he .  i don t believe it .  he has a    a        she looked up and spread her hands  which were shaking  as though groping for a word and having to settle for something inferior     vision .       we re not always masters of our own emotions and affections  sophia .  if he has found another woman and dreams of her         there s no other woman   said kaliinin  frowning .   none .  he uses that as an excuse to hide behind .  he loved me  if at all  only absently  because i was convenient at hand  because i satisfied a vague physical need  and because i was also involved in the project  so that he didn t have to lose much time dallying with me .  as long as he had this project firmly in hand  he didn t mind having me    quietly  unobtrusively    at odd moments .       a man s work         need not fill every moment of time .  i told you he has a vision .  he plans to be the new newton  the new einstein .  he wants to make discoveries so fundamental  so great  that he will leave nothing for the future .  he will take shapirov s speculations and turn them into hard science .  yuri konev will become the whole of the natural law and everyone else will be commentary .       might that not be considered an admirable ambition .       not when it makes him sacrifice everything and everyone else  when it makes him deny his own child .  i .  what do i matter .  i can be neglected  denied .  i am an adult .  i can take care of myself .  but a baby .  a child .  to deny her a father .  to refuse her .  to reject her .  she would distract him from his work  she would make demands on him  she would consume a few moments of time here and there    so he insists he is not the father .       a genetic analysis         no .  would i drag him to court and force a legal decision upon him .  consider what his denial implies .  the child is not a virgin birth .  someone must be the father .  he implies    no  he states    that i am promiscuous .  he has not hesitated to give it as his opinion that i do not know the father of my child since i am lost among the numerous possibilities .  shall i labor to make a man as low as he is the legally proved father of my child against his will .  no  let him come to me and admit he is the father and apologize for what he has done    and i may allow him a glance  now and then  at the child .       yet i have a feeling you still love him .       if i do  that is my curse   said kaliinin bitterly .   it shall not be my child s .       is that why you have had to be persuaded to undertake this miniaturization .       and work with him .  yes  that is why .  but they tell me i cannot be replaced  that what we may do for science lies far above and beyond any conceivable personal feeling    any anger  any hate .  besides         besides .       besides  if i abandon the project  i lose my status as a soviet scientist .  i lose many privileges and perquisites  which do not matter  and so does my daughter    which matters a great deal .       did yuri have to be persuaded  too  to work with you .       he .  of course not .  the project is all he knows and sees .  he does not look at me .  he does not see me .  and if he dies in the course of this attempt     she held out her hand in appeal to him .   please understand that i do not for a moment believe that this will happen .  it is just a stupidly romantic notion that i torture myself with for the love of pain  i suppose .  if he should die  he would not even be aware that i would die with him .      morrison felt himself tremble .   don t talk like that   he said .   and what would happen to your daughter in that case .  did natalya tell you that .       she did not have to .  i know that without her .  my daughter would be reared by the state  as the child of a soviet martyr to science .  she might be better off so .   sophia paused and looked around .   but it s beginning to look quite normal out there .  we should be out of the ship soon .      morrison shrugged .      you will have to spend much of the rest of the day being medically and psychologically examined  albert .  so will i .  it will be very boring  but it has to be done .  how do you feel .       i d feel better   said morrison in a burst of honesty   if you hadn t talked about dying .     listen .  tomorrow  when we make the trip into shapirov s body  how far will we be miniaturized .       that will be natalya s decision .  to cellular dimensions at the very least  obviously .  perhaps to molecular dimensions .       has anyone ever done that .       not to my knowledge .       rabbits .  inanimate objects .      kaliinin shook her head and said again   not to my knowledge .       how  then  does anyone know that miniaturization to such an extent is possible .  or that  if it is  any of us can surivive .       the theory says it is and that we can .  so far  every bit of experimentation has fit in with the theory .       yes  but there are always boundaries .  wouldn t it be better if ultraminiaturization were tested on a simple bar of plastic  then on a rabbit  then on a         yes  of course .  but persuading the central coordinating committee to allow the energy expenditure would be an enormous task and such experiments would have to be dribbled out over months and years .  we have no time .  we must get into shapirov immediately .       but we re going to be doing something unprecedented  crossing into an untested region  with only the maybes of theory to         exactly  exactly .  come  the light is flashing and we must emerge and accompany the waiting physicians .      but for morrison the marginal euphoria of a safe deminiaturization was seeping away .  what he had experienced today was in no way indicative of what he must face the next day .     the terror was returning .       chapter      preliminairies    the greatest difficulty comes at the start .  it s called  getting ready .         dezhnev senior       .     later that evening  after a long    and tedious    medical exam  he joined the four soviet researchers for dinner .  the last supper  morrison thought grimly .     sitting down  he burst out   no one told me the results of my examination .   he turned to kaliinin .   did they examine you  sophia .       yes  indeed  albert .       did they tell you the results .       i m afraid not .  since it is not we who pay them  i suppose they don t feel they owe us anything .       it doesn t matter   said dezhnev jovially .   my old father used to say   bad news has the wings of an eagle  good news the legs of a sloth .   if they said nothing  it was because they had nothing bad to report .       even the bad news   said boranova   would have been reported to me    and only to me .  i am the one who must decide who will accompany us .       what did they tell you about me .   asked morrison .      that there is nothing important wrong with you .  you will be coming with us and in twelve hours the adventure will begin .       is there anything unimportant wrong with me  then  natalya .       nothing worth mentioning  except that you display  according to one doctor  a  typical american bad temper .        huh .   said morrison .   one of our american freedoms is that of being bad tempered when doctors show a typical soviet lack of concern for their patients .      nevertheless  his apprehension over the state of his mind ebbed and  as it did so  inevitably the apprehension over his impending miniaturization rose higher .     he lapsed into silence  eating slowly and without much of an appetite .        .     yuri konev was the first to rise from the dinner table .  for a moment he remained standing  leaning forward over the table  a slight frown on his intense  youthful face .      natalya   he said   i must take albert to my office .  it is necessary that we discuss tomorrow s task and prepare for it .      boranova said   you will remember  please  that we must all have a good night s sleep .  i don t wish you to forget the passage of time .  do you want arkady to go with you .       i don t need him   said konev haughtily .      nevertheless   said boranova   there will be two guards at your office door and you will call out if you need them .      konev turned from her impatiently and said   i won t need them  natalya  i m sure .  come with me  albert .      morrison  who had been watching them both from under lowered eyebrows  rose and said   is this going to be a long trip .  i m tired of being shuttled from point to point in the grotto .      morrison knew well he was being ungracious  but it didn t seem to bother konev  who responded just as ungraciously   i should think a professor would be used to plunging back and forth across a university campus .      morrison followed konev out the door and together they tramped along the corridor in silence .  morrison was aware that at a certain point two guards fell in behind them .  he heard additional footsteps keeping time with his own .  he looked back  but konev did not .     morrison said impatiently   much longer  yuri .       that is a foolish question  albert .  i have no intention of walking you past our destination .  when we get there  we will be there .  if we are still walking  it is because we are not there yet .       i should think  with all this walking  you might arrange golf carts or something of the sort for the corridors .       anything to allow the muscles to atrophy  albert .  come  you are not so old that you cannot walk or so young that you must be carried .      morrison thought  if i were that poor woman with his child  i would shoot off fireworks to celebrate his denial of fatherhood .     they reached konev s office at last .  at least morrison assumed it was his office when konev barked the word  open  and the door slid smoothly open in response to his voiceprint .  konev strode through first .      what if someone imitates your voice .   asked morrison curiously .   you don t have a very distinctive voice  you know .      konev said   it also scans my face .  it will not respond to either separately .       and if you have a cold .       one time when i had a bad one  i could not get into my office for three days and i finally had to have the door opened mechanically .  if my face were bruised or scarred by accident  i might also have trouble .  still  that is the price of security .       but are the people here so    inquisitive    that they would invade your privacy .       people are people and it is not wise to overtempt even the best of them .  i have things here unique to myself and they may be viewed only when i decide to allow it .  this  for instance .   his slim hand  very well cared for and manicured  morrison noticed    he might neglect other things for his work  but not himself  rested on an extraordinarily large and thick volume  which  in turn  rested on a stand that had been clearly designed for it .      what is that .   asked morrison .      that   said konev   is academician shapirov    or at least the essence of him .   he opened the book and flipped the pages .  page after page  all of them  perhaps  were filled with symbols arranged in diagrammatic fashion .     konev said   i have it on microfilm  of course  but there are certain conveniences to having it in a printed volume .   he patted the pages almost lovingly .      i still don t understand   said morrison .      this is the basic structure of shapirov s brain  translated into a symbolism of my own devising .  fed into the appropriate software  it can reconstitute a three dimensional map of the brain in intimate detail on a computer screen .       astonishing   said morrison   if you are serious .       i am serious   said konev .   i have spent my entire career on this task  translating brain structure into symbols and symbols into brain structure .  i have invented and advanced this science of cerebrography .       and you used shapirov as your subject .       by incredible good fortune  i did .  or perhaps it was not good fortune  but merely inevitable .  we all have our small vanities and it seemed to shapirov that his brain was worth preserving in detail .  once i began working on this field under his direction    for there was the feeling that we might someday want to explore animal brains at least    he insisted on having his own brain analyzed cerebrographically .      morrison said with a sudden excitement   can you get his theories out of the recorded cerebral structure of his brain .       of course not .  these symbols record a cerebral scanning that was carried through three years ago .  that was before he had evolved his recent notions and  in any case  what i have preserved here is  unfortunately  only the physical structure and not the thoughts .  still  the cerebrograph will be invaluable to us in tomorrow s voyage .       i should think so    but i have never heard of this .       i m not surprised .  i have published papers on this  but only in the grotto s own publication    and these remain highly classified .  no one outside the grotto  not even here in the soviet union  knows of them .       that is bad policy .  you will be overtaken by someone else who will publish and who will be granted priority .      konev shook his head .   at the first sign that significant advances in this direction are being made elsewhere  enough of my early work will be published to establish priority .  i have cerebrographs of canine brains that i can publish  for instance .  but never mind that .  the point is that we have a map of shapirov s brain to guide us  which is a matter of incredible good fortune .  it was made without the knowledge that we might need it someday to guide us through that very cerebral jungle .      konev turned to a computer and  with practiced flips of his wrist  inserted five large discs .      each one of these   he said   can hold all the information in the central moscow library without crowding .  it is all devoted to shapirov s brain .       are you trying to tell me   said morrison indignantly   that you could transfer all that information  all of shapirov s brain  into that book you have here .       well  no   said konev  glancing at the book .   in comparison with the total code  that book is only a small pamphlet .  however  it does hold the basic skeleton  so to speak  of shapirov s neuronic structure and i was able to use it as a guide by which to direct a computer program that mapped it out in greater detail .  it took months for the best and most advanced computer we have to do the job .      and even so  albert  all we have reaches merely to the cellular level .  if we were to map the brain down to the molecular level and try to record all the permutations and combinations    all the conceivable thoughts that might arise from a particular human brain like shapirov s  all the creativity  actual and potential    i suppose it would take a computer the size of the universe working for a much longer time than the universe has existed .  what i have  however  may be enough for our task .      morrison  entranced  asked   can you show me how it works  yuri .      konev studied the computer    which was turned on  as one could tell by the soft whisper of its cooling mechanism    then pushed the necessary keys .  on the screen there appeared the side view of a human brain .     konev said   this can be viewed at any cross section .   he pressed a key and the brain began to peel as though it were being continually sliced by an ultrathin microtome some thousands of slices per second .   at this rate   he said   it would take an hour and fifteen minutes to complete the task  but i could stop it at any chosen point .  i could also cut off thicker slices or cut off one thick calculated slice to bring me at once to any wanted cross section .      as he spoke  he demonstrated .   or i could orient it in another direction or rotate it along any axis .  or i can magnify it to any extent down to the cellular level  either slowly or  as you see  quickly .   as he said this  the material of the brain spread outward in all directions from a central point    dizzyingly    so that morrison was forced to blink his eyes and then look away .     konev said   this is now at the cellular level .  those small objects are individual neurons and if i expanded the image still further  you would see the axons and dendrites .  if one wishes  we could follow a single axon through the cell into a dendrite and across a synapse to another neuron and so on  traveling  by computer  through a brain three dimensionally .  nor is the matter of three demensions just a manner of speaking .  the computer is outfitted for holographic imaging and it can present a three dimensional appearance quite literally .      morrison said challengingly   then why do you need miniaturization .  why do you need to send ships into the brain .      konev briefly allowed a look of contempt to cross his face .   that is a foolish question  albert  and i suppose it is inspired only by your fear of miniaturization .  you are groping for any excuse to eliminate it .  what you see here on the screen is a three dimensional mapping of the brain  but only three dimensional .  it has caught it at what is  essentially  an instant of time .  in effect  we see unchanging material    dead material .  what we want to be able to detect is the living activity of the neurons  the changing activity with time .  we want a four dimensional view of the electric potentials that rise and fall  the microcurrents that travel along the cells and cell fibers  and we want to interpret them into thoughts .  that s your task  albert .  arkady dezhnev will manipulate the ship along the routes i have chosen and you will give us the thoughts .       on what basis have you chosen the routes .       on the basis of your own papers  albert .  i have chosen the regions you had decided must represent the neuronic network for creative thought and  using this book  with its coded representation of shapirov s brain as my initial guide  i calculated centers where more or less direct pathways could be found to several portions of the network .  i then located them more accurately on the computer and it is to one or more of those centers that we will penetrate tomorrow .      morrison shook his head .   i m afraid i can t guarantee that we will be able to determine actual thoughts  even if we find the centers in which thinking takes place .  it s as though we might reach a place where we can hear people s voices  but if we don t know the language  we are still left in ignorance of what they are saying .       we can t know that in advance .  the varying electric potentials in sbapirov s mind must resemble those in ours and we may simply be aware of his thoughts without knowing how we are aware .  in any case  we can t tell unless we go in and try .       in that case  you will have to be ready for possible disappointment .       never   said konev with the utmost seriousness .   i intend to be the person to whom the human brain will finally yield its secrets .  i will solve  completely  the ultimate physiological mystery of humanity  perhaps of the universe    if we are the most advanced thinking devices that exist anywhere .  so we will work together  you and i  tomorrow .  i want you to be ready for it  to help guide me by studying carefully the brain waves we encounter .  i want you to interpret shapirov s thoughts and  most particularly  his thoughts on combining quantum theory and relativity so that trips such as ours tomorrow can become routine and we can begin the study of the brain in all earnestness .      he stopped and stared at morrison intently  then said   well .       well  what .       does none of this impress you .       of course it impresses me  but  .  .  .  i have a question .  today when i watched the rabbit being miniaturized  there was a pronounced whine during the process    and a rumble when it was deminiaturized .  there was nothing of the sort when i was subjected to it    or i would have known what was happening .      konev raised a finger   ah .  the noise is apparent when you are in real space  but not when you are in miniaturized space .  i was the first to realize that was so when i was miniaturized and i reported it .  we still don t know why the miniaturization field seems to stop sound waves when it doesn t stop light waves  but then we expect to learn new aspects of the process as we go on .       as long as we don t discover fatal aspects   muttered morrison .   are you afraid of nothing  yuri .       i m afraid of not being able to complete my work .  that would be true if i died tomorrow or if i refused to undergo miniaturization .  being stopped by death  however  is only a small possibility  but if i refuse to undergo miniaturization  then i am stopped certainly .  that is why i much prefer to risk the former than take the latter way out .       does it bother you that sophia will be undergoing miniaturization with you .      konev frowned .   what .       if you don t remember her first name  it may help if i refer to her as kaliinin .       she is part of the group and will be on the ship .  yes .       and you don t mind .       why should i .       after all  she feels you have betrayed her .      konev frowned darkly and a dull flush rose to his face .   has her madness gone so far as to force her to confide her incoherencies to strangers .  if she weren t needed on this project         i m sorry .  she didn t sound incoherent to me .      morrison didn t know why he was pushing the matter .  perhaps he felt diminished at fearing a task the other so ardently welcomed and he therefore wished to dirninish in turn .   were you never her    friend .       friend .   konev s face mirrored his contempt .   what is friendship .  when i joined the project  i found her here  she had joined a month earlier .  we worked together  we were new and untried together .  of course  there was what one might call friendship  a physical need for intimacy .  what of it .  we were young and unsure of ourselves .  it was a passing phase .       but it left something behind .  a child .       that was not my doing .   and his mouth closed with a snap .      she says         i have no doubt she would like to saddle me with the responsibility  but it won t work .       have you considered genetic analysis .       no .  the child is adequately cared for  i imagine  and even if genetic analysis seemed to indicate i might be the parent  i would refuse all efforts to tie me to the child emotionally  so what would the woman have to gain .       are you so coldhearted .       coldhearted .  what do you imagine i have done    corrupted a young  innocent virgin .  she took the initiative in everything .  in the sad story that i suppose she told you  did she happen to mention that she d been pregnant before  that she had had an abortion some years before i met her .  i don t know who the father was then or who it is now .  perhaps neither does she    either time .       you are being unkind to her .       i am not .  she is being unkind to herself .  i have a mistress .  i have a love .  it is this project .  it is the human brain in the abstract  its study  its analysis  and all that that might lead to .  the woman was  at best  a distraction    at worst  a destruction .  this little talk we are having    that i did not ask for    that she goaded you into undertaking  no doubt         she did not   intedected morrison .      goads are not necessarily noticed .  this discussion may cost me a night s sleep and make me that much less sharp tomorrow when i will need all my sharpness .  is that your intention .       no  of course not   morrison said quietly .      then it is surely hers .  you have no idea in how many different ways she has attempted interference and how often she has succeeded .  i don t look at her  i don t speak to her  yet she will not leave me alone .  her imaginary wrongs seem as fresh in her mind as they were when i first broke away .  yes  i do mind her being on the ship with me and i have said so to boranova  but she says that both of us are needed .  are you satisfied .       i m sorry .  i didn t mean to upset you so .       what did you mean .  simply to have a quiet conversation .   say  what about all those betrayals and dirty tricks you have committed .   just a friendly talk .      morrison remained silent  bowing his head slightly against the other s rage .  three out of five on the ship    himself and the two ex lovers    would be laboring under a sense of unbearable wrong .  he wondered if  on careful questioning  dezhnev and boranova would prove similarly disabled .     konev said harshly   you had better go .  i brought you here to bury your fear of the project by providing you with a blaze of enthusiasm .  obviously  i have failed .  you are more interested in prurient gossip .  go  the guards outside this door will take you to the quarters assigned you .  you will need to sleep .      morrison sighed .  sleep .        .     yet on this  his third night in the soviet union  morrison slept .     dezhnev had been waiting outside konev s room with the guards  his broad face grinning and his large ears all but flapping with merriment .  after the shadowed intensity of konev s personality  morrison found himself welcoming dezhnev s chatter on all subjects but the morrow s miniaturization .     dezhnev urged a drink on him .   it is not vodka  not alcohol   he had said   it is milk and a little sugar and flavoring .  i stole it from the commissary where it is used  i think  for animals  because all those officials find human beings more easily replaceable than the animals .  it is the curse of overpopulation .  as my father used to say   to get a human being takes a moment of pleasure  but to get a horse costs money .   but drink .  it will settle the stomach .  i promise you .      the drink was in a can which morrison punctured .  he poured it into a cup that dezhnev proffered and it tasted fairly good .  he thanked dezhnev almost cheerily .     when they got to morrison s room  dezhnev said   now the important thing for you to do is to sleep .  sleep well .  let me show you where everything is .   and as he did so  he rather resembled a large and slightly unkempt mother hen .  with a hearty  good night .  be sure to get plenty of sleep   dezhnev left the room .     and morrison slept .  almost as soon as he worked himself into his favorite position    stomach down  left leg bent  knee outward    he began to feel sleepy .  of course  he had little sleep the last two nights  but he suddenly guessed that there had been a mild sedative in the cup into which he had poured the drink .  then came the thought that perhaps konev should take such a sedative .  then    nothing .     when he woke  he could not even remember having had any dreams .     nor did he wake of his own accord .  dezhnev was shaking him  as cheerful as he had been the evening before  as wide awake  and even as spruced up as it was possible for that animated haystack to be .     he said   awake  comrade american  for it is time .  you must shave and wash .  there are fresh towels  combs  deodorants  tissues  and soap in the bathroom .  i know because i have delivered them myself .  also a new electric razor .  and on top of that  new cotton clothes for you to wear with a reinforcement in the crotch so you will not feel so exposed .  they actually have them  the rotten bureaucrats  if you know how to ask    with a fist .   and he raised his fist while twisting his face into a look of ferocity .     morrison stirred and sat up on the bed .  it took him a moment to place himself and to weather the shock of realization that it was thursday morning and that miniaturization was just ahead .     half an hour or so later  when morrison stepped out of the bathroom again    satisfactorily bathed  dried  deodorized  shaved  combed  and reaching for his two piece cotton uniform and his slippers    dezhnev said   satisfactory elimination  my lad .  no constipation .       quite satisfactory   said morrison .      good .  i don t ask out of idle curiosity  of course .  i am not fascinated by excrement .  it is just that the ship is not ideally suited for such things .  better we all go in empty .  i didn t trust to nature  myself .  i took a bit of a laxative .       how long will we stay miniaturized .   asked morrison .      perhaps not long .  an hour if we are very lucky  perhaps twelve if we re not .       but  look   said morrison .   i can count on a well behaved colon  but i can t go for twelve hours without urinating .       who can .   asked dezhnev jovially .   each seat in the ship is equipped for the eventuality .  there is a recess  a removable cover .  a built in toilet  so to speak .  i designed it myself .  but it will be a struggle and  if you re sensitive  embarrassing .  someday  though  when the energy free miniaturization process is a fact  we can build ocean liners for miniaturization and live in them like tsars of old .       well  let s hope the expedition is not unnecessarily extended .    he found it odd that  for a moment  his apprehension shifted from fears of death or mental disability to the details of how to manipulate the toilet lid and how to proceed as unobtrusively as possible .     it occurred to him that there must have been many grossnesses and indelicacies  involved in the great exploratory trips of the past  items that had gone undetailed and  therefore  unnoted .      he was in his cotton clothes and had stepped into his slippers when dezhnev  dressed in slightly larger versions of the same  also with refinement in the crotch   said   let us now go to breakfast .  we will have good food  high calories  and low bulk  for there will be no eating on board the ship .  there ll be water  of course  and fruit juices  but no real beverages of any kind .  the sweet natasha made a terrible face when i suggested we might need a drop of vodka now and then .  there were a lot of uncalled for comments about sots and drunkards .  albert  albert  how i am persecuted    and unjustly  too .      breakfast was indeed plentiful  but not exactly filling .  there was gelatin and custard  thick slabs of white bread with butter and marmalade  fruit juices  and several varieties of pills to be sluiced down .     the talk over the breakfast table was moderately animated and  for the most part  dealt with the local chess tournament .  there was no mention of the ship or of miniaturization .   was it bad luck to mention the project .      morrison did not object to the direction of comment .  he even made a few comments about his own adventures as a chess player of marked lack of renown .     and then  all too soon  the table was being cleared and it was time .     they left for the ship .        .     they walked in single file  with space between themselves .  dezhnev was first  then kaliinin  then boranova  then morrison  and finally konev .     almost at once  morrison understood the purpose .  they were on view and they were being individualized .  along the edges of the corridor were men and women    employees of the project  obviously    watching eagerly .     they  at least  must know what was going on  even if the rest of the soviet union  let alone the world  did not .     drezhnev  in front  waved eagerly to the right and left  rather in the fashion of a kindly and popular monarch  and the crowds responded appropriately  shouting  waving  and calling out his name .     each name was called at various times  for obviously each prospective crew member was known to all .  the two women were restrained in their acknowledgement and konev  as morrison could see when he looked behind him  was  not unexpectedly  moving along  eyes forward and unresponsive .     and then morrison was surprised when he distinctly heard the cry  in english   hurrah  the american .      he looked in the direction of the outcry and automatically waved  at which  just as automatically  there was a loud and enthusiastic shout and the words were picked up until  hurrah  the american .   drowned out all else .     morrison found himself unable to maintain his earlier sullen resignation .  he had never been the object of mob jubilation and he took to it immediately and without trouble  waving and grinning madly .  he caught boranova s gravely amused expression and saw dezhnev pointing his finger at him in an ostentatious that s the american gesture  but allowed neither action to disturb him .     and then they passed out of the line of observers and into the large room in which shapirov was resting in his mental cocoon of coma .  the ship was also in the room .     morrison looked around with astonishment .  he said   there s a camera crew out there .      kaliinin was now standing next to him .   how beautiful her breasts are  morrison thought .  they were veiled but not hidden by the thin cotton and he could see why konev had referred to her as a distraction .   she said   oh yes  we ll be on television .  every significant experiment is carefully recorded and there are reporters at each occasion so that it might be described .  there was even a camera present when you and i were miniaturized yesterday  but we kept it out of sight since you weren t to know you were to undergo the process .       but if this is a secret project         it will not always be secret .  someday  when we have reached full success  the details of our progress will be revealed to our people and to the world .     sooner  if it seems some other nation is making progress on its own in the same direction .      morrison shook his head .   it isn t good  this primary concern with priority .  progress would be much faster if additional brains and resources were put on the job .      kaliinin said   would you willingly give up priority in your own field of research .      morrison was silent .  it was the obvious retort .     kaliinin  noting this  said with a shake of her head   i thought so .  it is easy to be generous with someone else s money .      boranova  meanwhile  was talking to someone whom morrison judged to be a reporter  one who was listening eagerly .  morrison transferred his attention and found himself listening eagerly  too .     boranova was saying   this is the american scientist  albert jonas morrison  who is a professor of neurophysics  which is  of course  academician konev s field .  he is here serving as both an american observer and as an assistant to academician konev .       and there will be five who will be on the ship .       yes .  and there will never be so remarkable a five again    or so remarkable an event    if miniaturization lasts a million years .  academician konev is the very first human being ever to have undergone miniaturization .  dr .  sophia kaliinin is the first woman and professor albert morrison is the first american ever to have undergone miniaturization .  kaliinin and morrison represent the first multiple miniaturization and were the first to be miniaturized in the ship .  and as for today s voyage  this will represent the first miniaturization of five human beings at once and it will be the first occasion on which a miniaturized ship and its crew will be inserted into a living human being .  the human being into whom we will be inserted is  of course  academician pyotr shapirov  who was the second human being to be miniaturized and the first to be a casualty of the process .      dezhnev  who was suddenly at morrison s side  whispered hoarsely into his ear   there you are  albert .  you are now an indelible footnote in history .  you might have imagined until now that you were a failure  but not so .  no one can take from you the fact that you were the first american ever to be miniaturized .  even if your countrymen work out the miniaturization process on their own and miniaturize an american  that american can be no better than second .      morrison had not thought of that .  he was tasting this newfound and permanent personal statistic  if the soviets would someday release natalya s statement  undistorted and unrewritten  and he found it savory .     yet he was not satisfied .   it is not what i want to be remembered for .       do a good job on this journey we are to take and you will end up being known for much more   said dezhnev .   besides  as my old father used to say   it is good to be at the head of the table  even if only one other sits with you and there is but a bowl of cabbage soup to share .       dezhnev stepped away and now kaliinin was again at morrison s side .  she tugged at his sleeve and said   albert .       yes  sophia .       you were with him after dinner last night  weren t you .       he showed me a map of shapirov s brain .  marvelous .       did he say anything about me .      morrison hesitated .   why should he have .       because you are a curious man  trying to escape your own private devils .  you would have asked .      morrison winced at her characterization of him .  he said   he defended himself .       how .       he mentioned an earlier pregnancy    and    and abortion .  it was not something i would believe  sophia  unless you admitted it .      kaliinin s eyes became bright with gathering tears .   did he   did he describe the circumstances .       no  sophia .  nor did i ask .       he might have told you .  i was forced when i was seventeen .  it had undesirable consequences and my parents took legal measures .       i understand .  perhaps yuri chooses not to believe this .       he may choose to think that i asked for it  but it is all on the record and the rapist is still in prison .  soviet law is hard on offenders of this type  but only if the situation can be thoroughly proven .  i recognize the fact that women can falsely accuse men of rape  but this was not one of those situations and yuri knows it .  how cowardly of him to state the fact without the extenuation .      morrison said   nevertheless  now is not the time to be concerned about this  although i understand how deeply it must affect you .  we will have a complicated job to do inside the ship and it will need all our concentration and skill .  i assure you  though  that i am on your side and not on his .      kaliinin nodded and said   i thank you for your kindness and sympathy  but don t be afraid of me .  i will do my job .      at this point  boranova called out   we are now to enter the ship in the order in which i call your names  dezhnev    konev    kaliinin    morrison    and myself .      boranova moved immediately into position behind him and murmured   how do you feel  albert .       terrible   said morrison .   did you expect any other answer .       no   said boranova .   but  nevertheless  i expect you to do your work as though you didn t feel lousy .  do you understand .       i will try   said morrison through stiff lips and  following kaliinin  he entered the ship a second time .        .     one by one  they had to adjust themselves into their seats in the arrangement that kaliinin had described the day before .  dezhnev was front left at the controls  konev front right  kaliinin mid left  morrison mid right  and boranova rear left .     morrison blinked his eyes and blew his nose into a tissue he found in one of his pockets .  what if he needed more tissues than had been supplied him .   a silly thing to worry about  but it was a more comfortable worry than some he might have .   his forehead felt damp .  was that because of the closeness .  would five people breathing    hyperventilating  perhaps    into a skimpy volume raise the humidity to maximum .  or would there be sufficient ventilation .     he thought suddenly of the first astronauts of a century before    even more constricted  more helpless    but going into a space that was somewhat known and understood  not into a microcosm that was utterly virgin territory .     yet  as morrison sat down  he felt the edge of terror dulled .  he had  after all  been in the ship before .  he had even been miniaturized and deminiaturized and was none the worse for it .  it didn t hurt .     he looked around to see how the others were taking it .  kaliinin  to his left  looked coldly blank .  a rather icy loveliness .  it might have been impressive that she was showing no fear  no anxiety  but  as she had said of him  she was probably sitting there fighting her private devils .     dezhnev was looking back  perhaps trying to weigh reactions as morrison was  and very likely for different reasons .  morrison was trying to bolster what little inner courage he could find by borrowing from that of others  whereas dezhnev  morrison thought  was weighing responses in order to measure the possible success of the mission .     konev faced directly forward and morrison could see only the back of his neck .  boranova was just seating herself and was straightening her flimsy cotton costume .     dezhnev said   friends .  fellow travelers .  before we can leave  we must each inspect our equipment .  once we start  telling me something doesn t work is not going to strike me as an uproarious joke .  as my father used to say   the truly wise trapeze artist does not inspect his nails in mid jump .   it will be my job to make sure that the ship s controls are in order  as i am particularly certain they are  since i designed them myself and supervised the construction .        as for you  yuri  my friend  your cereb whatever you call it    or your brain map  as anyone with sense would call it    has been transferred point for point into the software of your computer behind the plate before you .  please make sure that you know how to operate the plate and then see if the brain map is functional in all respects .      sophia  my little dove  i don t know what it is you do except that you make electricity  therefore make sure you can make it in the style you will find suitable .  natalya   his voice lifted slightly   are you all right back there .      boranova said   i am perfectly all right .  please check albert .  he needs your help most .       of course   said dezhnev .   i have left him for last  so that he can get my full attention .  albert  do you know how to operate the panel before you .       of course not   morrison snapped .   how should i know .       in two seconds  you will know .  this contact is to open and that contact is to close .  albert  open .     ah  you see  it slides open noiselessly .  now close .  perfect .  now you know .     and have you seen what is inside the recess .       a computer   said morrison .      perfect again  but do me a favor and see if it is a computer equivalent to yours .  your programmed software is in the recess to the side .  please check it out  make sure it fits the computer  and make sure it works as it is supposed to work .  i will rely on you to tell me if it is working properly .  please .  if you have any doubts  any suspicion  the tiniest hint that something is not just so  we will delay until it is fixed to your entire satisfaction .      boranova said   please  arkady  no dramatics .  there is no time .      dezhnev ignored her .   but if you tell me that something is wrong that really isn t wrong  my good albert  yuri will find out  i assure you  and neither he  nor i  nor anyone will be pleased .  so if it occurs to you that inventing a trouble may delay the trip or even cancel it  let it unoccur to you at once .      morrison could feel his face flushing and he hoped that it would be interpreted as the result of a generous anger over the thought that he might be dishonest in this fashion and not as guilt over a foiled plot .     actually  as he hovered over his computer  he thought again of what his design and repeated redesign of his program had done .  now and then  these most recent designs of his had brought him    feelings .  it was not something he could identify  but it felt as though his own thought centers were being directly stimulated by the brain waves he was analyzing .  he had not reported these  but he had occasionally talked about it and the word had gotten out .  shapirov had called his program a relay station because of that    if yuri was to be believed .  well  then  how could he now check if that were working well  when at best he had had the sensation only a few times and at unpredictable occasions .     or might it all be simply the will to believe  the same will that had led percival lowell to see canals on mars .     he realized that it hadn t actually even occurred to him to try to stymie the voyage by saying his program wasn t working .  dearly as he longed to avoid the risk  he could not do so at the cost of vilifying his program .     and then there was suddenly cause for a bit of fresh panic within morrison s heart .  what if the program had been damaged somehow in transit .  how could he persuade them that there was truly something wrong and that he was not simply pretending .     but it all worked beautifully  at least as far as he could tell without it being in actual contact with a skull behind which an active brain existed .     dezhnev said  as he watched morrison s hands working   we have placed new batteries in it .  american batteries .       everything is working properly   said morrison   as far as i can see .       good .  is everyone satisfied with the equipment .  then lift your pretty rears from your seats and check the sliding panels there .  do they work .  believe me  you would all be very unhappy if they didn t .      morrison watched kaliinin open and close the panel  covered with a thin layer of upholstery  that she was sitting on .  his own worked similarly when he imitated her motions .     dezhnev said   it will take solid wastes  too  within reason  but let us hope we will have no occasion to check that out .  in case the worst comes to the worst  there is a small roll of tissue just under the edge of your seat  where you can reach it easily .  as we miniaturize  everything loses mass  so excretions would float .  there will  however  be a downward current of air to prevent that .  don t let the draft startle you .  there is a liter of water in a tiny refrigerator under the side of your seat .  it is only for drinking .  if you get dirty or sweaty or smelly  just make up your mind to stay that way .  no washing until we get out .  and no eating .  if we lose a few ounces  so much the better .      boranova said dryly   if you lost seven kilograms  arkady  so much the better .  and we would consume less energy in the miniaturization .       the thought has occurred to me at times  natasha   replied dezhnev coolly .   i will now test the controls of the ship and if all responds properly  as i m sure it will  we will be ready to begin .      there was what seemed to morrison to be a tense wait in utter silence  except for a soft whistle between the teeth on the part of dezhnev  as he bent over his controls .     then dezhnev sat up  wiped his forehead with his sleeve  and said   all is well .  comrade ladies  comrade gentleman  and comrade american  the fantastic voyage we face is about to begin .   he fixed an auditor in his left ear  raised a tiny microphone before his mouth  and said   all is operational within .  is all operational outside .     very well  then  wish us good fortune  comrades all .      nothing seemed to happen and morrison cast a quick look at kaliinin .  she was still immobile  but she seemed to be aware of morrison s head turning toward her  for she said   yes  we are miniaturizing .      the blood roared in morrison s ears .  this was the first time he was consciously miniaturizing .       chapter      artery    if the current flow is taking you where you want to go  don t argue .        dezhnev senior       .     morrison s eyes remained  for the most part  focused on the recess before him  on the computer  and on the software he had inserted .  the software    the one material object of the long ago .     long ago .  it was less than a hundred hours ago that he was half dozing his way through a dull talk on his last day at the conference and wondering whether there was any way to save his position at the university .  and now a hundred subjective years had passed in those hundred objective hours and he could no longer clearly visualize the university at all or the life of sad frustration he had been leading there toward the end .     he would have given a great deal to have broken out of the dull cycle of useless striving a hundred hours ago .  he would give a great deal more    a great deal more    to break back into it now  to wake up and to find the last hundred hours  or years  had never taken place .     he glanced through the transparent wall of the ship  there at his right elbow  his eyes half closed as though he were really reluctant to see anything .  he was reluctant .  he did not want to see anything larger than it should be .  it would interfere with his wild hope that the miniaturization process had broken down or that the whole thing had    somehow    been an illusion .     but a man walked into his view    tall  over two meters tall .  but then  perhaps he was actually that tall .     others appeared .  they couldn t all be that tall .     he shrank down into his seat and looked no more .  it was enough .  he knew that the miniaturization process was going its inexorable way .     the silence inside the ship was oppressive  unbearable .  morrison felt he had to hear a voice  even if only his own .     kaliinin  at his left side  was the one to whom he could speak most easily and she might be the best of a difficult choice  perhaps .  since morrison did not want dezhnev s misplaced jocularity  or boranova s one dimensional concentration  or konev s dark intensity  he turned to kaliinin s frozen sorrow .     he said   how will we get into shapirov s body  sophia .      it took a while  it seemed  for kaliinin to hear him .  when she did  her lips moved pallidly and she said in a whisper   injection .      then  as though with a supreme effort  she apparently decided that she must be companionable  so she turned to him and said   when we are small enough  we will be placed into a hypodermic needle and injected into academician shapirov s left carotid artery .       we ll be shaken up like dice   said morrison  appalled .      not at all .  it will be complex  but the problems have been thought through .       how do you know .  this has never been done before .  never in a ship .  never in a hypodermic needle  never into a human body .       true   said kaliinin   but problems like this    much simpler ones  of course    have been planned for a long time and we have had extended seminars over the last few days on this mission .  you don t think that arkady s announcements before miniaturization began    the ones about toilet tissue and so on    were new to us  do you .  we have heard it all before  over and over .  it was for your benefit  actually  since you have attended no seminars  and for arkady s  too  since he loves his moment in the sun .       tell me  then  what will happen .       i will explain events as they occur .  for now we do nothing until we are in the centimeter range .  it will take another twenty minutes  but not everything will be so slow .  the smaller we get  the faster we can miniaturize  in proportion .     have you felt any bad effects yet .      morrison mentally subtracted the rapid beating of his heart and the panting of his lungs and said   none .   then  feeling that to be an unduly optimistic remark  he added   at least so far .       well  then .   said kaliinin and closed her eyes as though to indicate that she was tired of talking .     morrison thought that might not be such a bad idea and closed his as well .     he might have actually fallen asleep or he might simply have gone into a protective state of semi unconsciousness  withdrawing from reality  for it seemed that no time had passed when he was brought to by a slight jar .     he opened his eyes wide and found himself a centimeter or so above the seat .  he had the odd sensation of drifting with each vagrant puff of wind .     boranova had moved over to the seat behind him and placed her hands on his shoulders .  she pushed down gently and said   albert  put on your seat belt .  sophia  show him how .  i m sorry  albert    we should have gone over all of this    everything    before we started  but we had little time and you were nervous enough as it was .  we did not wish to reduce you to utter helplessness by flooding you with information .      to his own surprise  morrison had not been feeling helpless .  he had rather enjoyed the sensation of sitting on air .     kaliinin touched a spot on her seat edge between her knees and a belt around her waist flipped away .  it had not been there  morrison was sure  when he had closed his eyes and now it was again no longer there  for it disappeared  with a snap  into a recess in the seat to her left .  she twisted toward morrison and said   this  here to your left  is your belt ejector .   morrison couldn t help noticing that  now unbound  she lifted up from her seat slightly as she moved toward him .     she pressed the ejector    a somewhat darker circle in a light background    and a flexible network of clear plastic shot out with a faint hiss  wrapped itself about him  and buried its triple tip into the seat at his other side .  he found himself held  elastically  in a kind of lacework .      if you want to free yourself  there is the belt release there  just between your knees .   kaliinin leaned farther toward him to indicate the place and morrison found the pressure of her body against his to be pleasurable .     she did not seem to be aware of it and  having completed her task  she pulled herself back into her chair and re belted herself .     morrison glanced quicky around  squeezing upward and forward as far as the belt would let him  and peered  with difficulty  over konev s shoulder .  all five were belted .     he said   we ve miniaturized to the point where we have very little weight  is that it .       you only weigh about twenty five milligrams now   said boranova   so that you might as well consider yourself weightless .  then  too  the ship is being lifted .      morrison looked at kaliinin accusingly and kaliinin shrugged slightly and said   i told you i d describe things as they happened  but you seemed to be asleep and i thought it wiser to let you stay that way .  the jar of the clamp woke you and lifted you out of the seat .       the clamp .   he looked to one side .  he had been conscious of a shadow on both sides  but walls were supposed to be opaque and he had dismissed the sensation .  now he suddenly remembered that the ship s walls were transparent and realized that the light on either side was blocked .     kaliinin nodded .   a clamp is gripping us and helping to keep us steady so that we are not shaken up unnecessarily .  it looks enormous  but it is a very small and delicately padded clamp .  and we are being put into a small tank of saline solution .  we are also being held steady by an airstream being sucked upward into a blunt nozzle .  that pushes us against the nozzle so that  with the clamps  we are held three ways .      morrison looked out again .  objects outside the ship that might have been visible through portions of the wall not blocked by the clamp or by the overhead nozzle were  nevertheless  not visible .  morrison could see occasional shifting of light and shadow and realized that whatever existed out there was too large to make out clearly with his tiny eyes .  if the photons that approached the ship were not themselves miniaturized as they entered the field  they would behave as though they were long radio waves and he would have seen nothing at all .     he felt the ship suddenly jar again as the clamps withdrew  although he couldn t actually see them withdraw .  one moment they were there and the next they weren t .  the movement    on his scale    was too rapid to see .     then he felt himself rising slightly against the belt that bound him in and he interpreted that as a downward movement of the ship .  there followed a slow bobbing sensation .     dezhnev pointed to a dark horizontal line that moved slowly up and down against the wall of the ship and said with satisfaction   that s the surface of the water .  i thought the motions would be worse .  apparently  there are engineers in this place who are almost as good as i am .      boranova said   actually  engineering has little to do with it .  we re being held in place by surface tension .  that will only work while we re at the surface of a fluid .  it will not affect us once we re in shapirov s body .       but this ripple effect  natasha .  this up and down movement .  is that affecting it at all .      boranova was studying her instruments and  in particular  a small screen on which a horizontal line seemed to be playing out forever  without budging from the center .  morrison  twisting and lifting until his back ached  could just make it out .     boranova said   it s as steady as your hand when you are sober  arkady .       no better than that  eh .   dezhnev s laugh boomed out .      he sounds relieved  thought morrison uneasily and wondered what the  it  was that dezhnev had felt might be affected .       what happens now .   asked morrison .     konev spoke for the first time  as far as morrison could remember  since miniaturization had begun .   must everything be explained to you .      morrison answered with spirit .   yes .  you have had everything explained to you .  why should i not have it explained as well .      boranova said quietly   albert is perfectly correct  yuri .  please hold your temper and be reasonable .  you will need his help soon enough and i hope he will not be so discourteous as to snap at you .      konev s shoulders twitched  but he said nothing in reply .     boranova said   the cylinder of a hypodermic syringe will pick us up  albert .  it will be under remote control .      and  as though that cylinder were waiting to hear her say so  a shadow encased them from behind  swallowing them almost at once .  only in front was there a circle of light visible for a moment and then that disappeared  too .     boranova said calmly   the needle has been clamped on .  now we will have to wait a while .      the interior of the ship  which had become quite dark  was suddenly suffused with a white light  rather softer and more restful than before  and boranova said   from now on there will be no more light from the outside until our journey is over .  we will have to rely on our own internal illumination  albert .      puzzled  morrison looked around for the source of the light .  it seemed to be in the transparent walls themselves .     kaliinin  interpreting his glance  said   electroluminescence .       but what is the source of power .       we have three microfusion engines .   she looked at him proudly .   of a type that s the best in the world .   then she repeated   in the world .      morrison let it go .  he had the impulse to talk of the american microfusion engines on the latest space vessels  but what would be the point .  someday the world would be freed of its nationalist fervors  but that day had not yet arrived .  still  as long as those fervors did not express themselves in violence or threat of violence  matters were bearable .     dezhnev  leaning back in his seat with his arms behind his neck and apparently addressing the gently illuminated wall before him  said   someday what we will do is expand a hypodermic syringe  place that around a full sized ship  and miniaturize the whole thing .  then we won t have this small scale maneuvering .      morrison said   oh  can you do the other thing  too .  what do you call it .  maximization .  gigantization .       we don t call it anything   said konev crisply   because it can t be done .       maybe someday  though .       no   said konev .   never .  it is physically impossible .  it takes a lot of energy to miniaturize  but more than an infinite amount to maximize .       even if you hooked it up to relativity .       even so .      dezhnev made an inelegant sound with his lips .   that for your physically impossible .  someday you will see .      konev relapsed into indignant silence .     morrison said   what is it we are waiting for .      boranova said   the last minute preparation of shapirov and then the moving up of the needle and its insertion into the carotid .      as she spoke  the ship was jarred forward .      is that it .   asked morrison .      not yet .  they were merely removing the air bubbles .  don t worry  albert .  we ll know .       how .       why  they ll tell us .  arkady is in contact with them .  it s not difficult .  radio wave photons miniaturize as they cross the boundary from there to here and deminiaturize as they cross in the other direction .  there s very little energy involved    even less than in the case of light .      dezhnev said   it s time to move up to the base of the needle .       then go ahead   said boranova .   we might as well test the motive power under miniaturization .      there was a gathering rumble that reached a low peak and then settled down into a buzzing murmur .  morrison twisted his head in order to look as nearly backward as he could against his restraining belt .     water was churning behind them as though paddle wheels were turning .  in the absence of any real reference point outside  it was impossible to judge how quickly they were moving  but progress seemed slow to morrison .      are we moving much .   he asked .      no  but we don t need to   said boranova .   there s no use wasting energy trying to move faster .  after all  we re pushing against normal sized molecules  which means high viscosity on our scale .       but with microfusion motors         we have many energy needs for matters other than propulsion .       i m just wondering how long it will take us to get to key points in the brain .       believe me   said boranova grimly   i m wondering  too  but we will have an arterial current taking us as close as possible .      dezhnev cried out   we re there .  see .      right ahead  in the forward light beam of the ship  a round circle could be seen .  morrison had no trouble translating that into the base of the needle .     on the other end of that needle  they would find pyotr shapirov s bloodstream and then they would actually be within a human body .        .     morrison said   we re too large to go through the needle  natalya .      he felt a peculiar amalgam of emotions at the thought .  uppermost was a feeling of hope that perhaps the whole experiment had failed .  this might be as small as they could get and it wasn t small enough .  they would have to deminiaturize and it would all be over .     under that thought  well hidden  was a little sigh of disappointment .  having come so far  might it not be as well to get into the body and experience the interior of a nerve cell .  ordinarily  being no darer of dangers  no scaler of heights  morrison would have turned away in horror at the thought    he did turn away in horror    but having miniaturized  having reached this point  having survived the fright so far  was it possible that he might want to go farther .     but above these contradictory urges came a bit of realism .  surely these people were not such fools as to deal with a ship that could not be reduced to a size that would pass through the needle it was supposed to pass through .  no conceivable stupidity in these very intelligent people could reach that pitch .     and boranova  as though she were resonating with that thought  said  almost indifferently   yes  we are too large now  but we will not stay too large .  that is my job here .       yours .   said morrison blankly .      of course .  we have been reduced to this point by our central miniaturization device .  now the fine adjustments will be made by me .      kaliinin murmured   that is one of the things we must save our microfusion motors for as much as possible .      morrison looked from one to another .   do we have enough energy on board ship for further miniaturization .  surely the impression i got was that a vast quantity of energy was needed for         albert   said boranova   if gravitation were quantized  then it would take the same enormous amount of energy to reduce a mass by half  regardless of the original value of that mass .  to reduce the mass of a mouse by half would take the same energy as was required to reduce the mass of an elephant by half .  but the gravitational interaction is not quantized and  therefore  neither is mass loss .  that means that the energy required for mass loss decreases with that loss    not entirely in proportion  but to an extent .  we have so little mass now that it takes much less energy to miniaturize further .      morrison said   but since you ve never miniaturized anything as large as this ship through so many orders of magnitude  you are depending on the extrapolation of data obtained for a much different size range .       they re not speaking to an infant  he thought indignantly .  i am their equal .       yes   said boranova .   we are taking the chance that the extrapolation will hold  that something new and unexpected will not surprise us .  still  we live in a universe that faces us with uncertainties now and then .  that can t be helped .       but we all face death if something goes wrong .       didn t you know that .   said boranova calmly .   have you been uneasy about this fantastic voyage of ours simply for the pleasure of being uneasy .  but we are not alone in this .  if things go wrong and the stored energy of miniaturization is released  it will not only destroy us  but it may damage the grotto to some extent .  i m sure that many an unminiaturized person out there is holding his or her breath and wondering if he or she will survive an explosion .  you see  albert  even those who are not undergoing the risks of miniaturization are not altogether safe .      dezhnev turned and grinned widely .  morrison noted that one of his upper molars was capped and did not match the rather yellowish tint of his other teeth .     dezhnev said   concentrate on the thought  my friend  that if something goes wrong  you will never know .  my father used to say   since we all must die  what better can we ask for than a quick and sudden death .       morrison said   julius caesar said the same thing .      dezhnev said   yes  but we won t even have time to say   et tu  brute .        there will be no death   said konev sharply   and it is foolish to speak of it .  the equations are correct .       ah   said dezhnev .   there was a time of superstition when people relied on the protection of god .  thank equations we now have equations to rely on .       not funny   said konev .      i didn t mean to be funny  yuri .     natasha  they re ready out there for us to proceed .      boranova said   then there will be no further need to speculate .  here we go .      morrison gripped his seat tightly  preparing himself  but he felt nothing happen .  up front  though  the round circle he had made out expanded and grew dimmer and dimmer as it moved very slowly backward until it could no longer be made out .      are we moving .   he asked automatically .  it was the kind of question one was unable to refrain from asking  even though the answer was obvious .      yes   said kaliinin   and we are expending no energy in doing so .  we are not battling the water molecules .  we are being carried along by the water flow in the needle as the cylinder presses in slowly .      morrison was counting to himself .  it kept his mind more efficiently occupied than studying the second hand of his watch would have done .     when he reached a hundred  he said   how long will it take .       how long will what take .   asked kaliinin .      when do we reach the bloodstream .      dezhnev said   a few minutes .  they are going very slowly  just in case there is some kind of microturbulence .  as my father once said   it is slower  but better  to creep along the downward path than to leap over the cliff .       morrison grunted  then said   are we still miniaturizing .      boranova answered from behind him .   no .  we are down in the cellular range and that is far enough for our needs now .      morrison was surprised to find that he was trembling .  after all  so much was happening and so many new things existed to think about that he had somehow lacked the room to remain in terror .  he was not terrified  at least not to an acute stage    yet for some reason he continued to tremble .     he attempted to will himself to relax .  he tried to let himself droop  but that required more than an effort of will .  it needed gravitational pull and there was none to speak of .  he closed his eyes and slowed his breathing .  he even tried humming  under his breath  the choral singing from beethoven s ninth symphony .     finally he felt himself forced into comment on the matter .   i m sorry   he said .   i seem to be shaking .      dezhnev snickered .   aha .  i wondered who would be the first to mention it .      boranova said   it s not you  albert .  we are all shaking slightly .  it s the ship .      morrison was at once elevated into fright .   is something wrong with it .       no .  it s just a matter of size .  it s small enough to feel the effect of brownian motion .  you know what that is  don t you .      it was a purely rhetorical question .  boranova would surely expect a high school student of physics to know what brownian motion was  let alone morrison  and yet morrison found himself explaining it in his own mind    not in words  but as a flash of concept .     every object suspended in a liquid is bombarded on all sides by the atoms or molecules of the liquid .  these particles strike randomly and therefore unevenly  but the unevenness is so small compared to the total that it is unnoticeable and has no measurable effect .  as an object grows smaller  however  the unevenness becomes greater among the smaller and smaller number of particles striking the object in a given time .  the ship was small enough now to respond to the slight excesses of coillisions    first in one direction  then in another    randomly .  it moved slightly in consequence  a random trembling .     morrison said   yes  i should have thought of that .  it will get worse if we continue to become smaller .       actually  it won t   said boranova .   there will be other counteracting effects .       i don t know of any   said morrison  frowning .      nevertheless  there will be such effects .       leave it to the equations   said dezhnev in an affectedly pious tone .   the equations know .      morrison said   i think this could make us seasick .       it certainly would   said boranova   but there is a chemical treatment for that .  we have been dosed with the same chemical that cosmonauts use against space sickness .       not i   said morrison indignantly .   not only haven t i been treated  i haven t even been forewarned .       we told you as little as possible of the discomforts and dangers out of concern for your comfort  albert .  as for treatment  you consumed your dose with your breakfast .     how do you feel .      morrison  who had begun to feel a bit squeamish with all this talk about sickness  decided that he felt fine .  astonishing  he thought  the tyranny exerted over the body by the mind .     he said in a low voice   tolerable .       good   said boranova   because we are now in academician shapirov s bloodstream .         .     morrison stared through the transparent wall of the ship .     blood .     his first impulse was to expect redness .  what else .     he peered out  squinting his eyes slightly  but could see nothing  even in the gleaming light of the ship .  he might as well have been in a rowboat  drifting down the calm surface of a pond on a dark and cloudy night .     morrison s thoughts suddenly veered .  in the absolute sense  the light within the ship had the wavelength of gamma rays    and very hard gamma rays at that .  yet the wavelengths were the result of miniaturizing ordinary visible light and to the equally miniaturized retinas and optic lobes of the people within the ship they were still light rays and had the property of light rays .     outside  just beyond the hull of the ship  where the miniaturization field ended  the miniaturized photons enlarged to ordinary light wave photons and those that were reflected back to the ship were miniaturized again when the field boundary was crossed .  the others might be accustomed to this paradox ridden situation  but to morrison the attempt to grasp the effect of a miniaturized bubble within a sea of normality was dizzying .  was the boundary visible  marking off the miniaturized from the normal .  was there a discontinuity somewhere .     following his line of thought  he whispered to kaliinin  who was bent over her instrument   sophia  when our light leaves the miniaturization field and expands  it must give off heat energy  and when it s reflected back into the ship it must absorb energy in order to be miniaturized and the energy must come from us .  am i right .       perfectly  albert   said kaliinin without looking up .   our use of light results in a small but steady loss of energy  but our motors can supply that .  it is not a significant drain .       and are we really in the bloodstream .       never fear .  we are .  natalya will probably dim the internal lights in a while and you ll see the outside more clearly then .      almost as though that were a signal  boranova said   there .  now we can relax for a few moments .   the lights dimmed .     at once  objects outside the ship came dimly into view .  he could not make them out clearly yet  but they were immersed in something heterogeneous  something with objects floating in it  as would be true of blood .     morrison stirred uneasily  straining at the constraint of his seat belt .  he said   but if we are in the bloodstream  which is at a temperature of thirty seven degrees celsius  we ll         our temperature is conditioned .  we ll be quite comfortable   said kaliinin .   really  albert  we ve thought of these things .       perhaps you have   said morrison  slightly offended   but i haven t been privy to those thoughts  have i .  how can you condition the temperature when you don t have a cold sink .       we don t have one here  but there s outer space  isn t there .  the microfusion motors give off a thin drizzle of subatomic particles which  under miniaturized conditions  have a mass of very nearly zero .  they therefore travel at virtually the speed of light  penetrating matter as easily as neutrinos do and carrying off energy with them .  in less than a second they are in outer space  so that the effect is of transferring heat from within the ship into outer space and we keep cool .  do you see .       i see   muttered morrison .  it was ingenious    but perhaps obvious  after all  to those used to thinking in terms of miniaturization .     morrison noticed that the controls of the ship  immediately under dezhnev s hands  were luminous  as were the instruments before kaliinin .  he struggled to raise himself in his seat and managed to see a corner of the computer screen in front of konev .  it contained what morrison thought might be a map of the circulatory system of the neck .  for a moment  before his body ceased its fight against the webbing of the belt and he sank down into his seat again  he saw a small red dot on the screen  which  he deduced  was a device to mark the position of the ship in the left internal carotid artery .     he was panting a little from his effort and had to wait a few moments to regain control of his breath .  the recess in which his own computer rested was illuminated and he shielded that bit of light from his face by raising his left hand .  then he looked out .     far in the distance  morrison could see something that looked like a wall  a barrier of some sort .  it receded  then approached  then receded again  over and over  rhythmically .  automatically  he looked at his watch for a few seconds .  it was clearly the pulsation of the arterial wall .     he said to kaliinin in a low voice   obviously the passage of time is not affected by miniaturization .  at least the pulsation of the heart is    just what it ought to be  even though i view it with miniaturized eyes and time it with a miniaturized watch .      it was konev who answered .   time isn t quantized apparently  or at least it isn t affected oy the miniaturization field  which may be the same thing .  that s convenient .  if we had to take a shifting time flow into account  things might become unbearably complicated .      morrison silently agreed and turned his thoughts in other directions .     if they were inside an artery  and if the ship were merely being swept forward by the current  the forward movement would have to be in spurts  one spurt for each contraction of the distant heart  the very distant heart    on the scale of their present size  .  and if that were so  he ought to feel those spurts of motion .     he closed his eyes and tried to hold as still as possible  to move not at all except for the trembling of the brownian motion    which  after all  he could in no way control .     ah  he could feel it .  a slight but distinct push backward as the spurt started  a slight push forward as it came to an end .     but why was the spurt not more energetic .  why was he not yanked backward and forward in a sickening fashion .     and then he thought of the mass he no longer possessed .  with his remaining mass so tiny  his inertia was similarly tiny .  the viscosity of the normal fluid of the bloodstream exerted an enormous cushioning effect  so that the spurts were all but lost in the brownian motion .     and  ever so slightly  morrison felt himself relax .  he felt something inside himself untighten a bit .  the miniaturized environment was unexpectedly benign .     he looked through the ship s transparent hull again  his eyes focusing on the volume between himself and the arterial wall .  he could see bubbles  faintly outlined .  no  not bubbles  but things of substance    many of them .  some turned slowly and changed apparent shape as they did so  so they were not spheres .  they were disks  he now realized .     the truth burst in on him and shamed him .  why was he so slow in identifying them  since he knew he was in a bloodstream .     but then he knew the answer to that  too .  he could not really conceive of himself as being in a bloodstream  it was too easy to suppose he was in a submarine making its way through an ocean .  he would naturally expect to see the familiar sights of an ocean and would be foolishly puzzled at anything he saw that did not fit his assumption .     he would see the red corpuscles of the blood    the erythrocytes    and fail to recognize them .     of course  they weren t red but faintly yellowish .  each one absorbed some shortwave light to produce that color .  get them in bulk  though  millions and billions of them  and they would absorb enough such light to appear red    in arterial blood  anyway  and they were in an artery now .  once the cells withdrew the oxygen carried by the red corpuscles  the individual corpuscle would seem faintly bluish  and  in bulk  blue purple .     he watched the erythrocytes with interest and saw them quite clearly now that he had recognized them for what they were .     they were biconcave discs  the centers depressed on each side .  to morrison  they were enormous  considering that  under normal conditions  they were microscopic  perhaps seven and a half micrometers in diameter and a little over two micrometers thick .  now here they were  swollen objects the size of his hand .     there were many of them in sight and they had a tendency to pile together in roulettes .  these weren t static  however .  some corpuscles would peel off the roulettes and others would add on and there were always some single corpuscles in view .  those that were in sight tended to stay in sight  they weren t moving relative to the ship .      i take it   said morrison   that we re simply going with the flow .       that s right   said kaliinin .   it saves energy .      but  at that  the red corpuscles weren t entirely stationary relative to the ship .  morrison noticed one corpuscle drifting slowly toward the ship  carried perhaps by a bit of microturbulence or by a random push of brownian motion .  the corpuscle flattened slightly and momentarily against the plastic of the ship and then rebounded .     morrison turned to kaliinin .   did you see that  sophia .       the red corpuscle nudging us .  yes .       why didn t it miniaturize .  surely it entered the field .       not quite  albert .  it bounced off the field  which extends a small distance beyond any miniaturized object  such as our ship  in every direction .  there s a certain repulsion between normal matter and miniaturized matter  and the greater the extent of miniaturization  the stronger the repulsion .  that s why very tiny objects such as miniaturized atoms or subatomic particles go through matter without interacting with it .  it s also that which keeps the miniaturized state metastable .       how do you mean .       any miniaturized object is always surrounded by normal matter  unless it is in deep space .  if nothing served to keep normal matter out of the field  such matter would forever be miniaturizing and  in the process  absorbing energy from the miniaturized object .  the drain would be significant and the miniaturized object would quickly deminiaturize .  in fact  it would be impossible to induce miniaturization in the first place  since the energy crammed into the miniaturizing object would leak away at once .  what we would then be trying to do  in effect  would be to miniaturize the entire universe .     of course  the repulsion isn t extremely strong at our size .  if a red corpuscle collided with sufficient force  the colliding surface might undergo some miniaturization .      morrison turned back to the view and  almost at once  something that was obviously a shredded red corpuscle drifted into view .      ah   said morrison   is that an example of one that approached us too forcefully .      kaliinin bent toward morrison to get a better view in the direction he was pointing .  she shook her head .   i don t think so  albert .  red corpuscles have a limited life of about a hundred and twenty days .  the poor things wear out and break down .  in the volume of blood we can see  several dozen would break down every minute  so that torn and damaged red corpuscles would be a common sight .     and that is a good thing  too  for it means that if we were to use our power and rush through the bloodstream  breaking up a few red corpuscles  or even a few million  it would make no difference to shapirov .  we couldn t possibly break down red corpuscles at a rate even approaching that of natural breakdown .      morrison said   what about platelets .       why do you ask .       that must be a platelet i see there .   he pointed .   it s lentil shaped and only half the size of the red corpuscles .      a pause and then kaliinin nodded .   ah yes  i see it now .  that s a platelet .  there should be one of them to every twenty red corpuscles .      that was about right  morrison thought .  if he were on a carousel  reaching out for rings as he passed  and reach red corpuscle were an ordinary iron ring  the occasional platelet would represent the coveted brass ring .     morrison said   my point  sophia  is that platelets are more fragile than red corpuscles and when they break they start the clotting process .  if we break a few  we ll start a clot forming in the artery .  shapirov will then have another stroke and surely die .      boranova  who had been listening to the exchange between morrison and kaliinin  interposed at this point .   in the first place   she said   platelets are not as fragile as all that .  they can strike us lightly and rebound without harm .  the danger of another stroke lies at the arterial wall .  the platelets are moving much faster relative to the inner wall of the carotid artery than they are relative to us .  and the inner wall of the artery may be layered with cholesterol and lipid plaques of all kinds .  that surface is therefore much rougher and uneven than the smooth plastic hull of our ship .  it s at the arterial wall that the clots might form    not here .  and even that isn t too enormous a danger .  a single platelet    or even a few hundred of them    might be broken and still be insufficient to start the clotting process in a way that doesn t damp out .  massive quantities of platelets must break to turn the trick .      morrison watched a platelet that vanished  now and then  behind the numerous red corpuscles .  he wanted to see if it would make contact with the ship and  if it did  what would happen .  the platelet  however  did not oblige but remained at a distance .     it then occurred to morrison that the platelet appeared to be as large as his hand .  how could that be if they were half the diameter of the red corpuscles and the red corpuscles were themselves as large as his hand .  his eyes sought out a red call and  sure enough  it seemed considerably larger than his hand .     he said  troubled   the objects out there are getting larger .       we re still miniaturizing  obviously   called out konev  apparently annoyed at morrison s seeming inability to draw the proper conclusion from an observed fact .     boranova said   that s right  albert .  the coronary is narrowing as we progress and we want to keep pace with it .       we don t want to get stuck in the pipe   said dezhnev genially   by being too fat .   then  as another thought struck him  he added   you know  natasha  i ve never been this thin in my life .      boranova said  unmoved   you are as fat as ever  arkady  on the scale of planck s constant .      morrison was in no mood for airy banter .   but how far do we miniaturize  natalya .       down to molecular size  albert .      and all of morrison s apprehensions surged up again .        .     morrison felt foolish at his failure to realize at once that they were still miniaturizing and  at the same time  bitterly resentful at konev for making it plain he recognized that folly .  the trouble was that all these others had been living and thinking miniaturization for years and he himself  a newcomer to the concept  was still trying to cram it into his reluctant brain .  couldn t they sympathize with his difficulties .     he studied the red corpuscles moodily .  they were distinctly larger .  they were wider across than his chest and their boundaries were becoming less sharp .  their surfaces quivered  as though they were canvas bags full of syrup .     he said in a low voice to kaliinin   molecular size .      kaliinin looked quickly at him  then turned away and said   yes .      morrison said   i don t know why that should bother me  considering the small size to which we have already miniaturized  but there s something rather frightening about being as small as a molecule .  how small a molecule  do you suppose .      kaliinin shrugged .   i don t know .  that s up to natalya .  a virus molecule  perhaps .       but this sort of thing has never been tried .      kaliinin shook her head .   we re charting unknown territory .      there was a pause and then morrison said uneasily   aren t you afraid .      she looked at him furiously  but continued to whisper .   of course i m afraid .  what do you think i am .  it isn t sensible not to be afraid when you have rational reason for it .  i was afraid when i was violated .  i was afraid when i was pregnant and deserted .  i ve spent half my life being afraid .  everyone does .  that s why people drink as much as they do  to wipe out the fear that grips them .   she was virtually hissing through clenched teeth .   do you want me to be sorry for you because you re afraid .       no   muttered morrison  taken aback .      there s nothing remarkable about being afraid   she went on   as long as you don t act afraid    as long as you don t let yourself be twisted into doing nothing because of fear  into having hysterics because of fear  into failing     she interrupted herself in a bitter  whispered self accusation .   i ve had hysterics in my time .   her glance flickered in the direction of konev  whose back was straight  stiff  and motionless .      but now   she went on   i intend to do my part  even if i am half dead with fear .  no one will tell from my actions that i m afraid .  and that had better be your case  too  mr .  american .      morrison swallowed hard and he said   yes  of course   but it sounded very unconvincing  even to him .     his eyes flicked backward  then forward .  there was no use whispering in those close quarters .  there was no whisper so low it would not be overheard .     boranova  behind kaliinin  was obviously busy with her miniaturization mechanism  but there was a tiny smile on her face .  approval .  contempt .  morrison couldn t tell .     as for dezhnev  he turned his head and called out   natasha  it is continuing to narrow .  should you hasten the miniaturization .       i ll do what is needed  arkady .      dezhnev s eye caught morrison s and he winked  with a grin .   don t believe little sophia   he said  pretending to whisper .   she is not afraid .  never afraid .  she just doesn t want you to be alone with your uneasiness .  she has a very soft heart  our sophia  as soft as her         keep quiet  arkady   said sophia .   surely your father must have told you that it is not wise to beat the empty teapot you call your head with the rusty spoon you call your tongue .       ah   said dezhnev  rolling his eyes   that was harsh .  what my father did say was that no knife could be honed as sharp as a woman s tongue .     but  albert  seriously  reaching molecular size is nothing .  wait until we have learned to attach relativity to quantum theory and then  with a tiny puff of energy  we will reduce ourselves to subatomic size .  then you will see .       what will i see .   said morrison .      you would see instant acceleration .  we would simply take off     he removed his hands from the controls momentarily in order to make a whizzing gesture with them  accompanied by a shrill whistle .     boranova said calmly   hands on the controls  arkady .       of course  my dear natasha   said dezhnev   a moment of excusable drama  no more .   then to morrison   instantly we would go at nearly the speed of light  the much faster speed of light under such conditions .  in ten minutes we could be across the galaxy  in three hours at the andromeda  in two years at the nearest quasar .  and if that s not fast enough  we can get smaller still .  we have faster than light travel  we have antigravity  we have everything .  the soviet union will lead the way to it all .      morrison said   and how would you guide the flight  arkady .       what .       how would you guide it .   said morrison seriously .   as soon as the ship swoops down to the proper sizelessness and masslessness  it will  in effect  radiate outward at hundreds of light years per second .  that means that if there were trillions of ships  they would shoot out in every direction with spherical symmetry    like sunlight .  but since there would only be one ship  it would move outward in one particular direction  but in an absolutely unpredictable one .       that s a problem for the clever theoreticians    like yuri .      konev had not indicated any interest in the conversation up to that point  but now he snorted loudly .     morrison said   i m not sure that it s wise to develop the traveling and carelessly assume the steering .  wouldn t your father say   a wise man does not build the roof of a house first .        he might   said arkady   but what he once did say was this   if you find a gold key without a lock  don t throw it away .  the gold is also sufficient .       boranova stirred in her seat behind morrison and said   enough with the saws and sayings  my friends .     where are we  yuri .  are we making progress .      konev said   in my opinion we are  but i would like the american to support my judgment  or correct it .       how can i do either .   snapped morrison .   i m strapped in .       then unstrap   said konev .   if you float a bit  at least you can t float very far .      for a moment  morrison fumbled at his seat belt  having forgotten the location of the appropriate contact .  kaliinin s hand moved quickly and he was free .      thank you  sophia   he said .      you will learn   she replied indifferently .      lift yourself so that you can see over my shoulder   said konev .     morrison did so and  inevitably  pushed too hard against the back of the seat ahead .  as a result of his insignificant inertia  he moved upward explosively and struck his head against the roof of the ship .  had this happened at the same speed under unminiaturized conditions  he might well have suffered the blinding pain of a concussion  but the very lack of mass and inertia that had sent him shooting upward had bounced him back almost once with no sensation of pain and virtually none of pressure .  he was as easy to stop as he had been to start .     konev clicked his tongue .   gently .  just lift your hand upward edgewise  turn it slowly  then push it down flatwise  slowly .  do you get it .      morrison said   i understand .      he followed konev s suggestion and moved up slowly .  he caught at konev s shoulder and stopped himself .     konev said   now  look here at the cerebrograph .  do you see where we are at this moment .      morrison found himself looking at an enormously complex network  with a distinct three dimensional effect .  it consisted of sinuous rills branching outward in such a way as to form an exceedingly intricate tree .  in one of the larger branches there was a small red dot  moving slowly and progressively .     morrison said   can you give me a broader view so that i can place this section .      konev  with another click of his tongue  one that might have signified impatience  expanded the view .   does this help .       yes  we re on the edge of the brain .   he could recognize the individual convolutions and fissures .   where do you plan to go .      the picture magnified somewhat .  konev said   we ll curve off here into the interior of the neuronic layer    the gray matter .  and where i d like to head for  by this route     he named the areas in russian rapidly and morrison struggled to translate them in his mind into english     is this area here which  if i have read your papers correctly  is a crucial node of the neuronic network .       no two brains are exactly alike   said morrison .   i can pin down nothing with certainty  all the more so if the particular brain in question is one i have never studied .  still  i would say the area you re heading for looks hopeful .       good  as far as that goes .  and if we get to my destination  will you be able to tell more accurately whether we are at a crossroads where several branches of the network meet or  if not  in what direction and how far such a crossroads might be .       i can try   said morrison cautiously   but please remember that i have made no guarantees as to my abilities in this connection .  i have not offered you any promises .  i have not volunteered         we know that  albert   said boranova .   we ask only that you do what you can .       in any case   said konev   that s where we re going as a first approximation and we ll get there before long  even though the current is slowing .  we are  after all  almost down to capillary size .     strap yourself in  albert .  i ll let you know if i need you .      morrison managed to operate the seat belt without any help  proving that even small triumphs can be sweet .     almost to capillary size  he thought  and looked out through the walls of the ship .     the vessel wall was still at a comfortable distance  but it had changed in appearance .  earlier  the steadily pulsating walls had been rather featureless .  now  however  morrison could make out no pulsing and the walls were beginning to look faintly tiled .  the tiling  morrison realized  consisted of the cells that made up the thinning walls .     he could not actually get a clear look at the tiling  either  for the red corpuscles were in the way .  they were now soft bags nearly the size of the ship .  occasionally  one ballooned past the ship at close quarters and was pushed elastically inward at the point of contact  without undergoing any visible harm .     one time a small smear was left behind .  perhaps the contact had been just a little too forceful and a line of miniaturized molecules had been formed against the hull  morrison thought .  the smear lifted off quickly  however  and dissolved in the surrounding fluid .     the platelets were another story  since by their very nature they were much more fragile than the red corpuscles .     one made a head on collision with the ship .  or perhaps it had been slowed by a collision with a red corpuscle so that the ship had overtaken it .  the prow of the ship penetrated deeply and the skin of the platelet punctured .  its contents oozed out slowly  mixing with the plasma and then forming into two or three long strings that tangled with each other .  they clung to a portion of the ship s hull for quite a time  trailing behind .     morrison waited to see any evidence of a clot forming .  none did .     minutes later morrison saw  up ahead  a milky fog that seemed to fill the blood vessel from wall to wall  pulsating and undulating .  inside it were dark granules that moved steadily from one side to the other .  to morrison  it looked like a malignant monster and he couldn t help but cry aloud in a moment of terror .       chapter       capillary    if you want to know whether water is boiling  don t test it by hand .        dezhnev senior       .     dezhnev turned his head  startled  and said   it s a white cell  albert  a leucocyte .  it is nothing to be bothered about .      morrison swallowed and felt distinctly annoyed .   i know it s a white cell .  it just caught me by surprise .  it s bigger than i thought it would be .       it s nothing   said dezhnev .   a piece of pumpernickel  really  and no bigger than it should be .  we re just smaller .  and even if it were as big as moscow  so what .  it s just floating along in the bloodstream as we are .       as a matter of fact   said kaliinin gently   it doesn t even know we re here    i mean  that we re anything special .  it thinks we re a red corpuscle .      konev seemed to be addressing the air in front of him in an abstracted sort of way  saying   white cells do not think .      a flash of resentment crossed kaliinin s face  flushing it slightly  but her voice remained even .   by saying  think   albert  i am merely using a figure of speech .  what i mean is that the white cell s behavior toward us is that which it would display toward a red corpuscle .      morrison cast another look toward the large billowing cell up ahead and decided that  harmless or not  he found its appearance distasteful .  he looked with much appreciation at the contrast made by kaliinin s pretty high cheekboned face  and wondered why she had never had that little mole under the left corner of her lip removed .  then he wondered if it didn t add just the right trifle of piquancy to a face that might otherwise be considered too pretty to possess character .     that moment of beside the point speculation effectively removed the uneasiness that the white cell s appearance had introduced and morrison returned  in his mind  to kaliinin s statement .      does it act as though we re a red corpuscle because we re the right size for it .       that may help   said kaliinin   but it s not the real reason .  you judge a red corpuscle to be a red corpuscle because you see it .  the white cell judges a red corpuscle to be one because it senses the characteristic pattern of the electromagnetic pattern on its surface .  white cells are trained    that is just another figure of speech    let us say  adapted    to ignore that .       but this ship doesn t have the electromagnetic pattern of a red corpuscle  .  .  .  ah  but i guess you ve taken care of that .      kaliinin smiled in gentle self satisfaction .   yes  i have .  it is my speciality .      dezhnev said   that is it  albert .  our little sophia knows  completely in her head     he tapped his right temple     the exact electromagnetic pattern of every cell  every bacterium  every virus  every protein molecule  every         not quite   said kaliinin   but those i forget  my computer can supply .  and i have a device here that can use the energy of the microfusion motors to place positive and negative electric charges on the ship in whatever pattern i choose .  the ship has the charge pattern of a red corpuscle on itself as best as i can duplicate it  and that is close enough to cause the white cell to react    or  rather  not to react    accordingly .       when did you do that  sophia .   asked morrison with interest .      when we were reduced to the size that would make us a potential object of interest for a white cell or for the immune apparatus generally .  we don t want antibodies swarming over us  either .      a thought occurred to morrison .   since we re talking about being reduced in size  why hasn t the brownian motion gotten worse .  i should think it would batter us more as we got smaller .      boranova put in from behind   so it would if we were unminiaturized objects of this size .  since we are miniaturized  there are theoretical reasons that prevent brownian motion from getting very bad .  it s nothing to worry about .      morrison thought about it  then shrugged .  they weren t going to tell him anything they thought might make him too knowledgeable in the matter of miniaturization and what did that matter .  the brownian motion had not grown worse .  in fact  it had grown less troublesome  or was he just getting used to it .   and he had no objection to that .  that made it  as boranova said  nothing to worry about .     his attention shifted back toward kabinin .   how long have you been training in this field  sophia .       since my graduate days .  even without shapirov s coma  we all knew the time would come when a trip through a bloodstream would become necessary .  we ve been planning something like this for a long time and we knew that this skill of mine would be needed .       you might have planned an automated crewless ship .       someday  perhaps   said boranova   we will  but not yet .  we cannot  even now  make the automation equivalent to the versatility and ingenuity of a human brain .       that s true   said kaliinin .   an automated pattern maker would place us in the red corpuscle pattern as a way of following the path of least resistance  and it would do little more than that .  after all  it would be a useless expense and perhaps an impractical exercise altogether to try to instil in an automated pattern maker the ability to change appropriately in response to all sorts of improbable conditions .  when i am present  however  i have the capacity to do almost anything .  i can change the pattern to meet an unlikely emergency  to test the value of something earlier unthought of  or simply to suit a whim .     for instance  i could change the ship s pattern to that of an e coli bacterium and the white cell would attack at once .       i m sure of that   said morrison   but don t do it  please .       no fear   said kaliinin .   i won t .      but boranova s voice sounded in sudden    and uncharacteristic    excitement .   on the contrary  sophia  do that .       but  natalya         i mean it  sophia .  do it .  we haven t tested your instrument under field conditions  you know .  let s try it .      konev muttered   that s a waste of time  natalya .  let us first get to where we re going .      boranova said   it won t do us any good to get there    if we can t enter a cell .  here is an immediate opportunity at hand to see if sophia can control the behavior of a cell .       i agree   said dezhnev boisterously .   this has been a remarkably uneventful trip so far .       that s the best kind  i should think   said morrison .     but dezhnev held up a disapproving hand .   my old father used to say   to want peace and quiet above all else is to hope for death .        go ahead  sophia   boranova said firmly .   we waste time .      kaliinin hesitated a bare moment    the time required  perhaps  to remember that boranova was captain of the ship    then her hand flickered over the controls of her device and the configurations upon the television screen altered markedly .   morrison admired  in an apprehensive sort of way  the speed with which she did it .      morrison lifted his eyes to the white cell ahead  and for a moment he saw no change .  and then it seemed as though a fit of trembling overtook the monster and dezhnev whispered   aha  it recognizes the presence of its prey .      at the extreme forward end of the white cell  its substance seemed to bulge toward and all around them in an uneven circle .  at the same time  the substance in the center retreated as though it were being sucked in .  morrison envisioned a monster s jaws preparing for a meal .     konev said   it works  natalya .  that creature ahead is preparing to envelop and engulf us .      boranova said   so it is .  very well  sophia  restore us to the red cell mode .      again kaliinin s fingers flickered and the configurations on the screen returned  as nearly as morrison s memory could judge  to what they had earlier been .     this time  however  the white cell remained unaffected .  its outer rim was shooting past the ship  which was now heading into the deep central concavity .        .     morrison was appalled .  the entire ship was encased by something that looked precisely like fog    a gritty granular fog  within which a multilobed object  faintly denser than the rest  writhed its way around them .  morrison knew that this must be the nucleus of the white cell .     konev snapped out angrily   apparently  once the white cell gears itself for engulfment  the rest is automatic and nothing will stop it .     what now  natalya .      boranova replied quietly   i admit i hadn t expected this .  the fault is mine .       what s the difference .   said dezhnev  frowning .   it s no matter .  what can this blob do to us .  it cannot crush us .  it is not a boa constrictor .      konev said   it can try to digest us .  we re in a food vacuole right now and digestive enzymes are pouring in around us .       let them pour   said dezhnev .   i wish them the joy of the attempt .  the ship s wall is not digestible to anything a white cell has .  after a while  it will reject us as indigestible residue .       how will it know .   asked kaliinin .      how will it know what .   snapped dezhnev .      how will it know we are indigestible residue .  it was spurred into activity by our bacterial charge pattern .       which you removed .       yes  but as someone remarked  the white cell  once stimulated  apparently has to go through its whole cycle of activity .  it is not a thinking device  it is entirely automatic .   kaliinin was frowning now and looking around at the others .   it seems to me that the white cell will continue trying to digest us until it is given the appropriate stimulus that will put its engulfment mechanism into reverse and allow it to eject us .      boranova said   but we now have the charge pattern of a red corpuscle again .  don t you think that would stimulate rejection .  it doesn t eat red cells .       i think it s too late for that   said kaliinin a little diffidently  as though nervous about standing up to boranova .   the red corpuscle pattern keeps it unengulfed  but once it is engulfed by some means  it would seem that the pattern alone is insufficient to spark ejection .  after all  here we are  we are not being ejected .      her eyes    all five pairs of eyes  in fact    uneasily surveyed the wall of the ship .  they were trapped in the cloudy cell .      i think   kaliinin went on   that there s a charge pattern to the kind of indigestible residue left by the bacteria the white cell is designed to engulf and that that alone would be a trigger for ejection .       in that case   said dezhnev   give it the pattern it wants  sophia  my little chicken .       gladly   said kaliinin   if you will tell me what it is because i don t know .  i can t just try patterns at random .  the number of possible patterns is astronomical .       as a matter of fact   said konev   can we be sure the white cell ejects anything at all .  perhaps indigestible residue becomes part of its granular material and remains within it until it is removed and dismantled in the spleen .      boranova said sharply  perhaps weighed down with the knowledge that she was responsible for their present situation  thought morrison    there is no point in babbling .  is there a constructive suggestion .      dezhnev said   i can turn on the microfusion motors and bore a way out of the white cell .       no   said boranova sharply .   do you know the direction which we are heading at this moment .  inside this food vacuole we may be slowly turning or the vacuole itself may be drifting through the cell s substance .  if you smash your way outward  you may damage the wall of the blood vessel and the brain itself .      konev said   for that matter  white cells can wiggle out of a capillary  working their way between the cells that make up the capillary wall .  since the path we have taken has led us into an arteriole branch that has narrowed to just about capillary size  we can t even be sure that we re still in the bloodstream .       yes  we can   said morrison suddenly .   the white cell can pinch itself small  but it can t pinch us small .  if it squeezes out of the vessel  it would be forced to leave us behind .     and that would be a good thing  except that it hasn t done it .       there you are   said dezhnev .   i should have thought of it sooner .  natasha  make us bigger and crack the white cell open .  give it indigestion like it has never had .      again a sharp negative from boranova .   and crack the blood vessel open  too .  the blood vessel is fairly small now  not much wider than the white cell .      kaliinin said   if arkady will get in touch with the grotto  someone there might have an idea .      there was silence for a moment and then boranova said in a half strangled way   not just yet .  we have done something foolish    well  i have    and you know as well as i do that it would be better for all of us if we didn t need help .       we can t wait forever   said konev restlessly .   the fact is that i don t know where we are by now .  i can t rely on the white cell drifting with the bloodstream or with maintaining any given speed  for that matter .  once we are lost  it may take considerable time to locate ourselves and we may need help from the grotto to do it  too .  in that case  how do we explain being lost .      morrison said   how about the air conditioning .      there was a pause and boranova said   what do you mean  albert .       well  we re sending miniaturized subatomic particles out of the ship and into interplanetary space .  they carry heat away from the ship  i was told  so that we remain cool even in the all pervasive warmth of the body we re in .  that coolness must be something the white cell is not designed to tolerate .  if we turn up the air conditioning and become colder still  there may come a time when the white cell will be uncomfortable enough to eject us .      boranova mulled this over and said evenly   i think    possibly    that might work .      dezhnev said   don t bother thinking .  i ve turned up the air conditioning to maximum .  let s see if anything happens besides all of us getting frostbite .      morrison watched the fog outside .  he was well aware that he was as tense as the others .  he was not in agony over an unfortunate decision    an ill advised experiment .  nor was he biting his nails over the fate of shapirov and yet    tapping his own emotions  it occurred to him that having come thus far  having been miniaturized and finding himself in a small cerebral arteriole  he suddenly had an urge to check out his theories .  had he come this far in order to turn back and spend the rest of his life  holding up an imaginary thumb and forefinger nearly in contact and saying in the depth of his mind   missed it by that much  .     very well  then .  he had passed from desperately not wanting to attempt the project to a definite reluctance to abort it .     dezhnev s voice broke in on his thoughts .   i don t think this little animal likes what s happening .      morrison was conscious of a biting chill  and shivered as he became aware that the thin cotton uniform he wore was a totally inadequate shield against this sudden onset of winter .     and perhaps the white cell  thought  this  too  for the fog thinned and a rift appeared in it .  then  in another moment or two  the surroundings were clear and the white cell was a ball of fog to their rear  drifting away    or perhaps crawling away    amoebalike  from an unpleasant experience .     boranova said  sounding a little dumbfounded    well  it s gone .      dezhnev waved both hands high in the air .   a toast    if we had a small swallow of vodka with us    to our american hero .  it was an excellent suggestion .      kaliinin nodded at morrison and smiled .   it was a good idea .       as good as mine was bad   said boranova   but at least we know that your technique can do what it should  sophia    as long as we know enough .  and as for you  arkady  ease the air conditioning intensity before we all catch pneumonia .     so you see  albert  we have already done well to take you with us .       perhaps   said konev tightly   but in the meanwhile  i think the white cell took us on an excursion .  we are not where we were and i do not know exactly where we are .         .     boranova s lips tightened and she asked with some difficulty   how can you not know where we are .  we were inside the white cell only a few minutes .  it couldn t have moved us into the liver  could it .      konev seemed at least equally upset .   no  we re not in the liver  madame .    he came down heavily on the honorific  giving it the french pronunciation .    but i suspect the white cell  dragging us with it  has turned into a branching capillary so that we are now out of the mainstream of the arteriole    which was not yet quite a capillary    that we were carefully following .       which capillary did it turn into .   asked boranova .      that is what i don t know .  there are a dozen capillaries it might have turned into and i don t know which one it was .       doesn t your red marker     began morrison .      my red marker   said konev at once   works by dead reckoning .  if i know where we are and the speed at which we re progressing  it will move along with us  turning when i tell it to turn .       you mean   said morrison incredulously   it only marks your position insofar as you know your position    no more than that .       it is not a magical marker  no   said konev freezingly .   it acts to mark our place and keep track of it  lest we lose it in the confusion of the three dimensional complexity of the bloodstream and the neuronic networks  but we have to guide it .  at this stage  it s not complex enough to guide itself .  in an emergency  we can be located from outside  but that s a time consuming process .      it seemed to be time for someone to ask a classically foolish question and that someone turned out to be dezhnev .  he said   why should the white cell have turned off into a capillary .      konev turned red .  speaking so rapidly that morrison could hardly make out the russian  he said   and how should i know that .  am i privy to the thought processes of a white cell .       that s enough   said morrison sharply .   we re not here to fight with each other .    he noted the quick look that boranova had shot toward him and he chose to interpret it as representing gratitude .       actually   he went on   the solution is simple .  we re in a capillary .  very well .  the current is at a creeping pace in capillaries  so where is the difficulty in making use of the famous microfusion engines .  if you put them into reverse  we will just back out of this capillary and eventually    not a very long eventually  either    we will be back at the junction point and in the arteriole again .  then we continue onward until we get to the proper turnoff and into the proper capillary .  we ll have lost a little time and spent a little power  that s all .      morrison s statement was greeted with solemn stares .  even konev  who generally spoke    when he did    with his face steadfastly forward  turned now  his angry frown concentrated on morrison .     morrison said uneasily   why are you all looking at me like that .  it s a perfectly natural course of procedure .  if you had been driving a car and accidentally turned into a narrow alley and found it the wrong one  wouldn t you back out .      boranova was shaking her head .   albert  i m sorry .  we have no reverse .       what .   morrison stared at her blankly .      we have no reverse .  we have only a forward drive .  nothing more .      morrison said   how is it possible to    no reverse gear at all .       none .      morrison looked around at the other four faces and then burst out   of all the stupid  incompetent  maddening situations .  it s only in the sov       he stopped .     boranova said   finish the thought .  you were going to say that it s only in the soviet union that such a situation would be allowed to arise .      morrison swallowed  then said grumpily   i was going to say that  yes .  it might be an ill tempered statement  but i m angry    and the statement may be true  at that .       and do you think we re not angry  albert .   said boranova with her glance level upon him .   do you know how long we ve been working on a ship like this .  years .  many years .  since miniaturization first seemed to become a practical possibility  we have been thinking of entering a bloodstream someday and exploring the working mammalian body    if not the human body    from within .      but the more we planned and the more we designed  the more expensive the project grew  and the more stubborn the budgeteers in moscow became in response .  i can t blame them  they had to balance the expense of this project against other expenses in areas that were far less problematical than miniaturization was .  so  as a result  the ship grew simpler and simpler in concept  as we cut out first this  then that  then the other thing .  do you remember when you americans were building your first shuttles .  what you planned and what you got .      in any case  we ended up with an unpowered craft  fit for observation only .  we planned to enter the bloodstream and let the current carry us where it would .  when we had all the information we could get  we would slowly deminiaturize .  this would kill the animal which we had been studying    it would only be an animal  of course  but even so some of us agonized over that .  that was all this ship was planned for .  nothing more .  we had no way of knowing that we would suddenly be faced with a situation in which we had to invade a human body  in which we had to get to a specific spot in the brain  in which we would have to emerge without killing the body .  in which we had to    and all we had was this ship  which was not meant for the job at all .      the anger and contempt on morrison s face had vanished into a frown of concern .   what did you do .       we worked as fast as we could .  we improved the microfusion motors and a few other things  frightened that at any moment shapirov would die  and equally frightened    or more so    that our hurry would cause us to make some fatal mistake .  well  i don t think we made any fatal mistakes  but still the microfusion motors we ended up with were to be used for acceleration only when absolutely necessary    they had originally been designed only for lighting  air conditioning  and other low energy uses .  of course  we lacked the time to do a complete job  so    no reverse gear .       didn t anyone point out that there might just be a chance you would want to go into reverse .       that would mean more money and there was none to be had .  after all  we had to compete with space  which was a going concern  with the realistic needs of agriculture  commerce  industry  crime control  and half a hundred other departments of government all clutching at the national purse .  of course we never had enough .      dezhnev sighed and said   and so here we are .  as my good father used to say   only simpletons go to fortune tellers .  who else would be in such a hurry to hear bad news .        your father is telling me nothing i don t know  arkady .  at least with that remark .  i m afraid to ask  but can we simply turn the ship .   morrison asked .     dezhnev said   you are wise to be afraid .  in the first place  the capillary is too narrow .  the ship has no room to turn .      morrison shook his head impatiently .   you don t have to do it in the ship s present size .  shrink it a bit .  miniaturize it .  you re going to have to miniaturize anyway before getting inside a cell .  do it now and turn it .      dezhnev said mildly   and in the second place  we can t turn it any more than we can go backward .  we have a forward gear and that is all .       unbelievable   whispered morrison to himself .  then aloud   how could you consent to begin this project with so inadequate a ship .      konev said   we had no choice and we were not counting on playing games with white cells .      boranova  her face expressionless  her voice toneless  said   if the project fails  i will take full responsibility .      kaliinin looked up and said   natalya  assigning blame will not help us .  right now  we have no choice .  we must go ahead .  let us move on  miniaturize if we have to  and find some likely cell to enter .       any cell .   said konev in a stifled fury  and addressing no one .   any cell .  what good will that do .       we might find something useful anywhere we go  natalya   said kaliinin .     when konev made no response  boranova said   is there any objection to that  yuri .       objection .  of course there s objection .   he did not turn  but his very back seemed stiff with anger .   we have ten billion neurons in the brain and someone is suggesting that we wander among them blindly and choose one at random .  it would be an easier task to drive along earth s roads in an automobile and randomly choose some human being on the wayside in the hope that he might be a long lost relative .  much easier .  the number of human beings on earth is a little more than half the number of neurons in the brain .       that is a false analogy   said kaliinin  carefully turning her face toward boranova .   we are not engaged in a blind search .  we are looking for pyotr shapirov s thoughts .  once we detect them  we need only move in the direction in which the thoughts strengthen .       if you can   said morrison  shaking his head .   if your single forward gear happens to be carrying you in the direction in which the thoughts weaken  what do you do then .       exactly   said konev .   i had plotted out a course that would have taken us directly to an important junction in the particular neuronic network that is related to abstract thought    according to albert s researches .  the bloodstream would have carried us there and whatever tortuous path it took  the ship would have followed .  and now     he lifted both his arms and shook them at the unresponsive universe .      nevertheless   said boranova  her voice strained   i don t see that we have any choice but to do what sophia suggests .  if that fails  we must find a way out of the body and perhaps try again another day .       wait  natalya   said morrison .   there just may be another way to remedy the situation .  is it at all possible for one of us to get outside the ship and into the bloodstream .         .     morrison did not expect an affirmative answer .  the ship  which had seemed to him earlier to be a marvelous example of high technology  had now shrunk in his imagination to a stripped down scow of which nothing at all could be expected .     it seemed to him best  from any practical standpoint  to do as kaliinin had suggested    to try any brain cell they could reach .  but if that failed  it would mean getting out of the body and trying again  as boranova had just said  and morrison did not feel he would be physically capable of going through this again .  he would try any wild scheme to prevent that .      is it possible to get out of this ship  natalya .   he asked again as she looked at him  dazed .   the others were no more responsive .       look  don t you understand .  suppose you want to collect samples .  do you have a dredge  a scoop  a net .  or can someone get outside and go scuba diving .      boranova finally seemed to overcome her surprise at the question .  her heavy eyebrows lifted into an attitude of wonder .   you know  we do .  one diving suit for reconnoitering  the plans say .  it should be under the back row seats .  under here  in fact .      she unclasped herself and went into a slow float  then managed to pull herself into a horizontal position  her light cotton clothing billowing .      it s here  albert   she said .   i presume it has been checked    i mean  against gross errors .  there would be no leaks  no obvious flaws .  i don t know that it s been field tested .       how could it be .   said morrison .   i take it this is the first time the ship    or anything    has been in a bloodstream .       i imagine it must have been checked in warm water adjusted to the proper viscosity .  i blame myself for not checking on this  but of course there was no thought at any time of anyone leaving the ship .  i had even forgotten the suit existed .       do you at least know if the suit has an air supply .       indeed it does   said boranova with sonie asperity .   and it has a power supply that makes it possible for it to have a light of its own .  you mustn t think of us as utter incompetents  albert .    though   she said with a rueful shrug   i suppose we    or  at least  i    have given you some reason to think so .       does the suit have flippers .       yes  on both hands and feet .  it is meant for maneuvering in fluid .       in that case   said morrison   there is perhaps a way out .       what are you thinking of  albert .   asked kaliinin .     morrison said   suppose we miniaturize a bit further so that the ship can turn easily without scraping the capillary walls .  someone then gets into the suit  moves outside the ship    assuming you have an air lock of some sort    and  propelling himself by means of the flippers  turns the ship .  once the ship is turned  the person gets back into the ship  which is now facing in the correct direction .  the motor is started and we push our way back against the feeble capillary current to the joining with the arteriole and thus back to our original path .      boranova said thoughtfully   a desperate remedy  but our condition  too  is desperate .  have you ever done any scuba diving  albert .       some   said morrison .   that s why i thought of this .       and none of us have    which is why we didn t think of it .  in that case  albert  unclasp yourself and let us get this suit on you .       on me .   morrison sputtered .      of course .  it is your idea and you re the one with experience .       not in the bloodstream .       no one has experience in the bloodstream  but the rest of us don t even have it in water .       no   said morrison savagely .   this thing is your baby    you four .  i ve done the thinking that got you out of the white cell and i ve just done the thinking that could get you out of your present fix .  that s my share .  you do the doing .  one of you .       albert   said boranova .   we re all in this together .  in here  we are neither soviets nor americans  we are human beings trying to survive and to accomplish a great task .  who does what depends on who can do what best  and nothing more .      morrison caught kaliinin s eye .  she was smiling very slightly and morrison thought he could read admiration in that smile .     groaning softly at the folly of being influenced in so childish a manner by a hunger for admiration  morrison knew he would agree to this madness of his own suggestion .        .     boranova had the suit out .  like the ship itself  it was transparent  and  except in the head portion  it lay wrinkled and flat .  to morrison  it looked unpleasantly like a life sized caricature of a human being drawn in outline by a child .     he reached out to touch it and said   what is it made of .  plastic wrap .      boranova said   no  albert .  it is thin  but it is not weak and it is exceedingly tough and inert .  no foreign material will cling to it and it should be perfectly leakproof .       should be .   echoed morrison sardonically .     dezhnev interrupted .   it is leakproof .  i seem to recall it was tested some time ago .       you seem to recall it .       i blame myself for not having checked it personally in going over the ship  but i  too  forgot its existence .  there was no thought        morrison bitterly exclaimed   i m sure your father must have told you once that self blame is a cheap penalty for incompetence  arkady .      dezhnev replied  raspingly   i am not incompetent  albert .      boranova cut in   we will have our fights when this is all over .  albert  there is nothing to worry about .  even if there were a microscopic leak  the water molecules in the plasma outside are far larger in comparison to the suit than they would be under normal conditions .  a leak in a normal suit might let in normal water molecules  but that same leak in a miniaturized suit would not allow those same water molecules  now giants in comparison  to enter .       that makes sense   muttered morrison  looking for solace .      of course   said boranova .   we can insert a standard oxygen cylinder right here    small size  but you won t be out there for long    an absorption canister for carbon dioxide here  and a battery for the light .  so  you see  you will be equipped .       just the same   said konev  turning to look at morrison dispassionately   you had better do it as quickly as possible .  it s warm out there    thirty seven degrees celsius    and i don t think the suit has a cooling mechanism .       no cooling mechanism .   morrison looked at boranova questioningly .     boranova shrugged .   it is not easy to cool an object in an isothermal medium .  this entire body  which is as large as a mountain to us  is all at a constant temperature of thirty seven .  the ship itself can be cooled by means of the microfusion engines .  we can t build an equivalent device into the suit  but then  as we keep saying  you won t be out for very long .     still  you had better take off the suit you re wearing now  albert .      morrison demurred .   it s not heavy  just a thin layer of cotton .       if you perspire with it on   said boranova   you will be sitting in wet clothes when you return to the ship .  we have no spare clothing we can ofrer you .       well  if you insist   morrison said .  then he removed his sandals and tried to strip his one piecer off his legs  something which proved surprisingly difficult in his nearly weightless state .     boranova  noting his discomfort  said   arkady  please help albert into the suit .      dezhnev worked his way  with difficulty  over the back of his seat to where morrison floated  in a cramped posture  against the hull of the ship .     dezhnev helped morrison into the legs of the suit one at a time  though the two  working together  were scarcely less clumsy than morrison alone had been .   everything about us  morrison thought  is designed to work in the presence of gravity .      dezhnev maintained a running commentary as they struggled .   the material of this suit   he said   is precisely that of the ship itself .  entirely secret  of course  though  for all i know  you have a similar material in the united states    also secret  i am sure .   he paused on a small note of inquiry .      i wouldn t know   muttered morrison .  his bare leg worked its way into a sheath of thin plastic .  it didn t stick to his leg  but moved smoothly along  yet it somehow gave the impression of being cold and wet without  in reality  being either .  he had never encountered a surface quite like that of the plastic suit and he didn t know how to intepret the sensation .     dezhnev said   when the seams close  they become virtually a single piece of material .       how do they open again .       the electrostatics can be neutralized once you re back in the ship .  for now  most of the exterior of the suit has a mild negative charge  balanced by a positive one on the inner surface .  any portion of the suit will cling to any positively charged area on the ship s surface  but not so strongly that you can t pull loose .      morrison said   what about the rear end of the ship where the engines are .       you need not be concerned about them .  they are working at minimum power for our cooling and illumination and any particles emerging from them will pass through you without noticing your presence at all .  the oxygen cylinders and waste absorption work automatically .  you will produce no bubbles .  you need only breathe normally .       one must be grateful for some technological blessings .      dezhnev frowned and said darkly   it is well known that soviet spacesuits are the best in the world and the japanese are second .       but this is not a spacesuit .       it is modeled on one in many ways .   dezhnev made as though to pull the headpiece down .      wait   said morrison .   what about a radio .      dezhnev paused .   why would you need a radio .       to communicate .       you will be able to see us  and we will be able to see you .  everything is transparent .  you can signal to us .      morrison drew a deep breath .   in other words  no radio .      boranova said   i am sorry  albert .  it is really only a very simple suit for small tasks .      morrison said sourly   still  if you do a thing  it s worth doing well .       not to bureaucrats   said dezhnev .   to them  if you do a thing  it s worth doing cheaply .      there was one advantage of irritation and annoyance  thought morrison  it did tend to wipe out fear .  he said   how do you plan to get me out of the ship .      dezhnev said   right where you re standing  the hull is double .      morrison turned sharply to look and  of course  went floundering .  he could not seem to remember for three seconds running that he was essentially weightless .  dezhnev helped him control his body at some cost to himself  we must look like a pair of clowns  morrison thought .      morrison found himself staring  at last  at the indicated portion of the hull .  now that his attention was drawn to it  it did seem faintly less transparent than the other portions  but that might well have been his imagination .     dezhnev said   hold still  albert .  my father used to say   it is only when a child has learned to hold still that it can be considered a creature of sense .        your father was not considering zero gravity conditions .       the air lock   said dezhnev  ignoring morrison s comment   is modeled on the type we have in our lunar surface enclosures .  the inner layer of the lock will peel back  then move around you and seal .  most of the air between the layers will be sucked out    we can t afford to waste air    which will give you a strange feeling  no doubt .  then the outer layer will peel open and you will be outside .  simple .     now  let me close your helmet .       wait .  how do i get back .       the same way .  in reverse .      now morrison was closed in completely and a definite claustrophobic sensation helped unsettle him  as the coldness of fear began to wipe out the saving sensation of anger .     dezhnev was pushing him against the hull and konev  having managed to turn about in his seat  was helping .  the two women remained calmly in their seats and were staring intently .     morrison did not for a moment feel that they were staring at his body  he wished they were  in fact .  that would be relatively benign .  he was absolutely certain they were watching to see if the air lock would work  if his suit would work  if he himself would remain alive for more than a few minutes once he was outside the ship .     he wanted to cry out and call off everything  but the impulse to do so remained only an impulse .     he felt a slippery motion behind him and then the whipping of a transparent sheet before him .  it was like the seat belt clasping itself around his waist and chest  but here the sheet enclosed him entirely  head to toe  side to side .     it clung to him more and more tightly  as the air between was pumped out .  the material of his suit seemed to strain outward as the air inside it pushed against the developing vacuum outside .     and then the outer layer of the hull behind him whipped away and he felt a soft thrust that sent him tumbling outward and into the blood plasma within the capillary .     he was out of the ship and on his own .       chapter       destination    going there may be most of the fun    but only if you get there in the end .        dezhnev senior       .     immediately  morrison felt the enveloping warmth and gasped .  as konev had said    the temperature was    degrees celsius .  it was the heat of a sweltering summer day and there was no escape .  no shade  no breeze .     he looked around  getting his bearings .  clearly  boranova had miniaturized the ship further while he had clumsily clambered into the suit .  the tiled wall of the capillary was farther away .  he could see only a bit of it  for between himself and the wall was a huge cloudy object .  a red corpuscle  of course .  then a platelet went slipping between the red corpuscle and the wall  but very slowly .     all of them    red corpuscle  platelet  himself  the ship    were moving along with the small creeping current within the capillary  if one judged by the slow drifting motion of the tilings in the wall .     morrison wondered why he felt the brownian motion as little as he did .  there was indeed the sensation of movement and the other objects in sight appeared to tremble .  even the tile marks of the capillary walls seemed to shift somehow  in a rather peculiar manner .     but there was no time to be keenly analytical .  he had to get things done and get back within the ship .     he was a meter or so from the ship .   a meter .  purely subjective .  how many micrometers    how many millionths of a meter was he separated from the ship in real measurements .  he didn t pause to try to work out an answer to the question .   he twiddled his flippers to get back to the ship .  the plasma was distinctly more viscous than seawater    unpleasantly so .     the heat continued  of course .  it would never stop while the body he was in remained alive .  morrison s forehead was getting moist .     come  he had to get started .     his hand reached out to the place where he had left the ship  but it touched nothing .  it was almost as though it were pushing into a  soft rubbery cushion of air  although his eyes told him there was nothing between that portion of the hull of the ship and his suited hand except  at best  a film of fluid .     a moment of thought and he saw what was happening .  the outer skin of his suit carried a negative electric charge .  so did that portion of the hull he was touching .  it was repelling him .     there were other portions of the hull  however .  morrison slid his hands along until he was aware of touching the plastic .  that was not in itself enough  however  for his hands moved along the area as though it were infinitely slippery .     and then  almost with a click  his left hand froze .  it had passed a region of positive charge and remained in place .  he tried to pull free first by a gentle backward push and then more frantically .  he might as well have been riveted to the spot .  he felt farther along with his right hand .  anchor that and he might be able to pull his left hand free .     click .  anchored now by his right hand  he pulled at his left .  nothing happened .  he clung to the hull  crucified there .     drops of perspiration rolled down his forehead and collected in his armpits .     he shouted uselessly  wiggling his legs in an ecstasy of effort .     they were looking at him  but how could he gesture to his trapped hands .  the red corpuscle that had been companion to the ship since he had emerged from it drifted closer and nudged him against the hull .  his chest  however  did not cling .  luckily  it was not up against a positively charged region .     kaliinin was looking toward him .  her lips were moving  but he could not lip read    not russian  at any rate .  she did something with her computer and his left arm pulled free .  presumably  she had weakened the intensity of the charge .     he nodded his head in what he hoped would be interpreted as a gesture of thanks .  now it would only be necessary to work his way back  positively charged area by positively charged area  until he reached the rear of the ship .     he began the motion and found himself more or less pinned  but not so much this time by the harsh pull of the electromagnetic interaction as by the soft  pillowy push of the red corpuscle .      get back .   shouted morrison  but the red corpuscle knew nothing of shouts .  its role was purely passive .     morrison thrust at it with his hands and used his leg flippers to push harder .  the elastic surface film of the red cell gave and bellied inward  but resisted more strongly  the more it gave until  finally  morrison was pushing uselessly and  as he tired  was forced back against the ship .     he paused to catch his breath  which was difficult  hot and sweat drenched as he was .  he wondered whether he would be disabled first by dehydration or by the fever which would surely come over him if he could not get rid of the heat his own body was producing    and all the more so because of the effort he was making to free himself of the red corpuscle .     he lifted his arm again and brought it down  the plastic flipper held edgewise .  it sliced through the pellicle of the corpuscle  puncturing it like a balloon .  the surface tension of the film pulled the opening wider and wider .  matter exuded    a thin cloud of granules    and the red corpuscle began to shrink .     morrison felt as though he had killed an inoffensive living creature and experienced a pang of guilt    then decided that there were trillions of others in the circulatory system and that a red corpuscle only had     days of functioning anyhow .     now he could pull back toward the rear .     no fog collected on the inner surface of his suit .  why should it .  the surface was as warm as he was and nothing would cling to the plastic anyway .  what would have been fog was probably collecting as little pools of sweat in this corner and that of the suit  rolling around as he did .     he was back at the rear now  back where the ship s streamlining failed because the jets of each of the three microfusion engines broke the smooth lines .  here he was as far from the center of gravity of the ship as possible .   with luck  the other four would move as close to the front of the ship as they could .     he wished he had thought to make that explicit before getting into the suit .   what he had to do was to find positively charged areas that would hold his hands back and then    push .     he was feeling a little dizzy .  physical .  psychological .  the effect was the same  either way .     he took another deep breath and blinked his eyes as perspiration leaked into them  there was no way he could brush it away and again he felt a spasm of fury against the fools who had designed a suit only microscopically better than none at all  .     he found the handholds against the hull and paddled his feet .  would this work .  the mass he was trying to turn was only micrograms in quantity  but he had at his disposal    what .  microergs .  he knew that the square cube law gave him a tremendous advantage  but how much efficiency could he put into his push .     but the ship moved .  he could tell that by the motions of the tiling on the capillary wall .  he could now reach that wall with his feet  so the ship must be lying across the capillary .  he had turned it    degrees .     when his feet touched the capillary wall  he pushed with perhaps injudicious savagery .  if he were to punch a hole in the wall  the results might be incalculably bad  but he was aware he had little time left and he could not think beyond that .  fortunately  his feet rebounded as though they had sunk into spongy rubber and the ship turned a bit faster .     then stuck .     morrison looked up blearily  squinting and willing himself to see .   he was almost past the ability to breathe in the squalid damp heat of the suit s interior .   it was another red corpuscle .  surely it was another red corpuscle .  they were as closely spaced in capillaries as    as cars on a busy city street .     this time he did not wait .  the flipper on his right hand came down at once  carving open a vast swath  and this time he did not spend a microsecond of worry over the murder of an innocent object .  his legs worked again and the ship moved .     he hoped it was shifting in the same direction as before .  what if he had managed to twist himself upside down in his mad attack on the red corpuscle and he was simply pushing the ship back into the wrong direction .  he was almost beyond caring .     the ship was now parallel to the long axis of the capillary .  gasping  he tried to study the tiles .  if they were moving forward toward the prow of the ship  then the ship was moving backward with the current and it was facing the junction of the arteriole .     he decided it was .  no  he didn t care .  right way  wrong way  he had to get back into the ship .     he was not ready to sell his life for success .     where .  where .     his hands were sliding along the walls of the ship .  sticking here .  sticking there .     vaguely he saw the dim figures on the other side of the wall .  motioning .  he tried to follow the gestures .       they were fading out .     up .  signaling up .  how could he clamber up .  he had no strength .     his last truly sane thought  for a while  was that he needed no strength .  up meant no more than down for a weightless  massless body .     he wriggled upward  forgetting why  and a fog of darkness came down upon him .        .     the first thing morrison sensed was cold .     a wave of cold .  then a touch of cold .     then light .     he was staring at a face .  for an interval of time  he did not grasp the fact that it was a face .  it was just a pattern of light and shade at first .  then a face .  then the face of sophia kaliinin .     she said softly   do you know me .      slowly  creakily  morrison nodded .      say my name .       sophia   he croaked .      and to your left .      his eyes turned  and difficulty focusing  then he turned his head .   natalya   he said .      how do you feel .       headache .   his voice sounded small and far away .      it will go away .      morrison closed his eyes and surrendered to the peace of nonstruggle .  just to do nothing was the highest good .  to feel nothing .     then he felt a cool stroke over his groin and his eyes opened again .  he discovered that the suit had been removed and he was naked .     he felt arms holding him down and heard a voice say   don t worry .  we can t give you a shower .  there s no water for that .  but we can use a damp towel .  you need to be cooled    and cleaned .        .  .  .  undignified   he managed  struggling over the syllables .      foolish .  we ll dry you now .  a little deodorant .  then back into your one piece .   morrison tried to relax .  it was only when he felt cotton against his body that he spoke again .  he asked   did i turn the ship properly .       yes   said kaliinin  nodding her head vigorously   and fought off two red corpuscles most savagely .  you were heroic .      morrison said hoarsely   help me up .   he pushed down with his elbows against his seat and  of course  drifted into the air .     he was brought down .      i forgot   he muttered .   well  strap me in .  let me sit and recover .      he fought down the dizzy feeling  then said   that plastic suit is worthless .  a suit for use in the bloodstream of a warm blooded animal must be cooled .       we know   said dezhnev from his seat at the controls .   the next one will be .       the next one   spat morrison bitterly .      at least   said dezhnev   you did what was necessary and the suit made that possible .       at a cost   said morrison  who then slipped into english in order to express his feelings more accurately .      i understood that   said konev .   i lived in the united states  you know .  if it will make you feel better  i ll teach you how to say every one of those words in russian .       thanks   said morrison   but they taste better in english .   he licked his dry lips with a dry tongue and said   water would taste still better .  i m thirsty .       of course   said kaliinin .  she held a bottle to his lips .   suck at it gently .  it won t pour when it has no mass to speak of .     slowly  slowly .  don t waterlog yourself .      morrison drew his head away from the bottle .   do we have enough water .       you must replace what you lost .  we ll have enough .      morrison drank more  then sighed .   that s much better .     there was something i thought of when i was out in the capillary .  just a flash .  i wasn t sufficiently myself to understand my own thought .   he bent his head and  covered his eyes with his hands .   i m not sufficiently myself to remember it now .  let me think .      there was silence in the ship .     and then morrison said with a sigh and a rather massive clearing of his throat .   yes  i remember it .      boranova sighed also .   good  then you have your memory .       of course i have   said morrison pettishly .   what did you think .      konev said coldly   that a loss of memory might be an early sign of brain damage .      morrison s teeth clicked as his mouth snapped shut .  then he said  feeling a chill in the pit of his stomach .   is that what you thought .       it was possible   said konev .   as in shapirov s case .       never mind   said kaliinin insinuatingly .   it didn t happen .  what was your thought  albert .  you still remember .   it was half confident statement  half hopeful question .      yes  i do remember .  we re pushing upstream now  aren t we .  so to speak .       yes   said dezhnev .   i m using the motors    expending energy .       when you reach the arteriole  you ll still be heading upstream and you can t turn .  you ll be heading back the way you came .  the ship will have to be turned again from outside .  it can t be me .  do you understand .  it can t be me .      kaliinin put her arm around his shoulder .   shh .  it s all right .  it won t be you .      it won t be anyone  albert  my friend   said dezhnev jovially .   look ahead .  we re coming to the arteriole now .      morrison looked up and felt a twinge of pain .  he must have grimaced  for kaliinin put a cool hand on his forehead and said   how is your headache .       getting better   said morrison  shaking her hand off rather querulously .  he was peering forward and relieved to find that his vision seemed normal .  the cylindrical tunnel up ahead was widening somewhat and beyond an elliptical lip he could see a distant wall in which the tiling was much less pronounced .     morrison said   the capillary comes off the arteriole like the branch of a tree at an oblique angle .  we go through that opening up ahead and we ll be pointed three quarters of the way upstream    and once we nudge the far wall  we ll bounce off and be moving fully upstream .      dezhnev chuckled .   my old father used to say   half an imagination is worse than none at all .   watch  little albert .  see  i will wait until we are almost at the opening and i will throttle down the motor so that we make our way up the current very slowly .  now our ship sticks its snout out of the capillary    a little more    a little more    and now the main stream of arteriole blood catches us and pushes against the nose and turns us    and i push out a little more    and it turns us a bit more    and i come out the whole way    and behold i ve been turned  i am heading downstream once more  and i cut the motors .      he grinned triumphantly .   wasn t that well done .       well done   said boranova   but impossible without what albert had done first .       true enough   said dezhnev  waving his hand .   i give him full credit and the order of lenin    if he will take it .      morrison felt infinite relief .  he would not have to go out again .  he said   thank you  arkady .   then  rather bashfully  he added   you know  sophia  i m still thirsty .      at once she handed him the bottle  but he hesitated .   are you sure i m not drinking more than my share  sophia .       of course you are  albert   said kaliinin   but more than your share is your share .  come  water is easily recycled .  besides  we have a small additional supply .  you did not fit into the air lock neatly .  an elbow stuck well out and we had to crack the inner layer and pull it in    which meant the entry of some plasma .  not much  thanks to its viscosity .  it s been miniaturized of course and is being recycled now .       once miniaturized  it can t amount to more than a droplet .       that s all it does amount to   said kaliinin  smiling   but even a droplet is an extra supply and since you brought it in  you deserve an extra supply .  logic is logic .      morrison laughed and sucked up additional water greedily  squeezing it out of the flexible container astronaut style .  he was beginning to feel comparatively normal    more than that .  he was feeling the kind of dreamy contentment that comes from being freed from the intolerable .     he tried to concentrate  to gain some sense of reality  he was still in the ship .  he was still the size of a bacterium  more or less .  he was still in the bloodstream of a man in a coma .  his chance of living another few hours was still problematical .     and yet  even as he told himself all this  he nevertheless couldn t flog himself out of the feeling that the mere absence of unbearable heat  the mere being with others  the mere existence of a woman s care was  in itself  a touch of heaven .     he said   i thank not only arkady but all of you for pulling me in and caring for me .       don t bother   said konev indifferently .   we need you and your computer program .  if we had left you out there  the project would be a failure  even if we found the right cell .       that may be so  yuri   said boranova  clearly indignant   but at the time we were bringing albert in  i did not think of that  but only of saving his life .  i cannot believe that even you were cold blooded enough to feel no anxiety for a human being who was risking his life to help us  except insofar as we needed him .       obviously   muttered konev   plain reason is not wanted .      plain reason was certainly what morrison wanted .  since the mention of brain damage  he had been testing himself  thinking  trying to come to conclusions .  he said   arkady  when the microfusion engines are working  you are converting miniaturized hydrogen into miniaturized helium  and some of the helium escapes along with miniaturized water vapor or other materials designed to produce thrust .       yes   said arkady warily .   and if that is so  what follows .       and the miniaturized particles    atoms and less    simply escape through shapirov and through the grotto and through the earth and end in outer space  as you told me .       again    what follows .       surely   said morrison   they do not stay miniaturized .  we are not initiating a process  are we  in which the universe will gradually be filled with miniaturized particles as humanity proceeds to make use of miniaturization more and more .       if we did  what harm .  all human activity for billions of years could not add a significant quantity of miniaturized particles to the universe .  but it is not so .  miniaturization is a metastable condition  which means that there is always a chance that a miniaturized particle will snap out  spontaneously  to true stability  that is  to the unminiaturized state .    out of the corner of his eye  morrison saw boranova raise a warning hand  but dezhnev was always hard to stop when in oral flood .       naturally   he went on   there is no predicting when a particular miniaturized particle will snap out of it  but it is a good wager that almost all will be beyond the moon when it happens .  as for the few    there are always a few    who snap out of miniaturization almost at once  shapirov s body can absorb them        he then seemed to see boranova s gesture  which had grown peremptory  and he said   but i m boring you .  as my old father said on his deathbed   my proverbs may have bored you  but now you can look forward to hearing them no more  so that you will mourn me less and  therefore  suffer less .   the old man would have been surprised    and disappointed  perhaps    to know how much we children mourned him  even so    but i think i won t risk it with my companions in this ship         exactly   snapped konev   so please stop  especially since we are now approaching the capillary that we should be entering .  albert  lean over and study the cerebrograph .  do you agree .      kaliinin  carefully addressing boranova  said   albert is in no condition to be badgered with cerebrographs .       let me try   said morrison  struggling with his seat belt .      no   said boranova with authority .   yuri can make this decision his own responsibility .       then i so make it   said konev  looking sullen .   arkady  can you get near the wall on our right and catch the current that turns into the capillary .      arkady said   i ve been racing the red corpuscles and i have caught one that is drifting toward the right wall .  it will push us    or the small eddy that is pushing it will also push us .     ah  you see  it is taking place  just as it did in the previous cases where we had to branch off .  each time i managed to use the natural current correctly .   a broad grin creased his happy face as he said   applause  everybody .  say   well done  arkady .       morrison obligingly said   well done  arkady   and into the capillary the ship went .        .     morrison had recovered sufficiently to be tired of invalidism .  outside the transparent hull of the ship  the wall of the capillary was strongly tiled and seemed fairly close on all sides .  it looked very much like the other capillary  the one in which he had turned the ship around .     he said   i want to see the cerebrograph .      he flung open his seat belt  the first really decisive movement he had made since returning to the ship  and stared rebelliously at the perturbed kaliinin as he did so .     he pushed himself gently upward into a float  holding himself in position to look over konev s shoulders by repeated corrections    first up  then down .  he said   how do you know you are in the right one  yuri .      konev looked up and said   counting and dead reckoning .  see here .  if we cut down the scale of the cerebrograph  this is the arteriole we ve been following off the carotid .  we took this branch and that one  and then it s a matter of counting the capillaries as they branch off on the right .      we had our run in with the white cell right here and in the time the white cell had at its disposal  this capillary was the only one it could reasonably have reached .  once we were turned around and got back to the arteriole  we followed its narrowing structure and matched what we saw against the cerebrograpb .  the pattern of branch points outside matched almost exactly the pattern described by the cerebrograph and that alone assures me we were following the right path .  now we have gone into this capillary .      morrison s left hand slipped off the smooth texture of the back of konev s seat and his attempt to make up for that twisted him into a comic handstand on the outspread fingers of his right hand .  he labored to right himself even as he thought  savagely  that another improvement that must be introduced in later versions of the ship would be handholds on the seats and in other strategic areas .     he said  panting   and where will this capillary take us .      konev said   directly to one of the centers which you believe to be a crossroad for the processes of abstract thought .     let s cut down the scale of the cerebrograph again .  right here .      morrison nodded .   please remember that i ve located them in human beings only indirectly  judging from my findings in animal brains .  still  if i m correct  that should be the superior external skeptic node .      konev said   according to you  there should be eight such nodes  four on each side .  this one  however  is the largest and most intricate on the left side and therefore stands the best chance of giving us the data we need .  am i right .       i think so   said morrison cautiously   but please remember that my reasoning has not been accepted by the scientific community .       and do you begin to doubt it now  too  albert .       caution is a reasonable scientific attitude  yuri .  my concept of the skeptic node makes sense in the light of my observations  but i have never been able to test the matter directly    that s all    and i do not wish it said later that i misled you .      dezhnev snickered .   skeptic node .  no wonder your countrymen are skeptical of the whole notion  albert .  my father used to say   people are ready enough to laugh at you .  don t make funny faces in order to encourage them .      why didn t you call it  thought node  in simple russian .  it would have sounded much better .       or  thought node  in simple english   said morrison patiently .   but science is international and one uses greek or latin when possible .  the greek word for  thought  is  skeptis .   it has given us  skeptical  both in english and in russian to indicate a habitual doubting attitude .  that s because the very act of doubt implies thought .  surely you all know that the most efficient way of accepting the foolish dogmas foisted on us by social orthodoxy is to refrain from thinking .      there was an uncomfortable silence at that  whereupon morrison  having left it there for just long enough  out of a faint malice    he owed them that much  said   as human beings in all nations know .      the atmosphere lightened perceptibly at once and dezhnev said   in that case  we will see how skeptical we need be of the skeptic node  when we reach it .       i hope   said konev with a scowl   that you don t think this is something to joke about  you clown .  that node is where we can hope to detect pyotr shapirov s thoughts .  without that  this venture will come to nothing .      dezhnev said   to each his own job .  i will take you there  with my expert handling of the ship .  once there  you will get the thoughts    or albert will  if you cannot .  and if you do as well with the thoughts as i do with the ship  you will have nothing to be unhappy about .  my father used to say         your father is better off where he is   said konev .   don t dig him up again .       yuri   said boranova sharply   that was an unbearably rude remark to make .  you must apologize .       that s all right   said dezhnev .   my father used to say   the time for offense is when a man  once he has cooled down  repeats an insult he has offered in his rage .   i am not sure that i can always follow that advice  but in honor of my father  i will pass over yuri s stupid remark this time .   he bent over his controls  his face grim .     morrison had listened to the altercation  just konev being nasty    obviously because he was under a great strain  with only half an ear .  his mind slipped back to something else  to dezhnev s carefree chatter and boranova s warning hand .     he lowered himself into his seat  clasping himself in for stability  and turned his head toward boranova .   natalya .  a question .       yes  albert .       those miniaturized particles released into the normal  unminiaturized universe         yes  albert .       eventually  they deminiaturize .      boranova hesitated .   as arkady told you  they do .       when .      she shrugged .   unpredictably .  like the radioactive breakdown of a single atom .       how do you know .       because it s so .       i mean  what experiments have been conducted .  nothing has ever been miniaturized to the extent that we are now miniaturized  so surely you can t know what happens to such miniaturized particles by direct observation .      boranova said   we ve observed events at miniaturizations we have reached and in that way determined what seem to be the laws of behavior of miniaturized objects .  we extrapolate         extrapolations aren t always trustworthy when they go well outside the realm of direct study .       granted .       you compared spontaneous deminiaturization to radioactive breakdown .  is there a half life of deminiaturization .  even if you can t tell when a particular miniaturized particle will deminiaturize  can you tell when half of a particular large quantity of them will .       we have half life figures and we think they are expressions of first order kinetics  as radioactive half lives are .      morrison said   can you generalize from one type of particle to another .      boranova pursed her lips and  for a moment  seemed lost in thought .  then she said   it would seem that the half life of a miniaturized object varies inversely with the intensity of miniaturization and also with the normal mass of the object .       so that as we are miniaturized to smaller and smaller sizes  the less time we are likely to remain miniaturized  and the smaller we are to begin with  the less time we are likely to remain miniaturized .       that s right   replied boranova stiffly .     morrison looked at her gravely .   i admire your integrity  natalya .  you re not anxious to tell me things .  you don t volunteer information .  still  you draw the line at misinforming me .      boranova said   i am a human being and i tell lies on occasion out of necessity or out of defects in my emotions or personality .  but i am also a scientist and i would not twist scientific fact for any but the most compelling reasons .       then what it amounts to is this .  even this ship  although it is much more massive than a helium nucleus  has a half life .       a very long one   put in boranova quickly .      but the fact that we are so intensely miniaturized has curtailed this very long half life .       still leaving it long .       and what about the individual components of the ship .  the molecules of water that we drink  the molecules of air we breathe  the individual atoms that make up our body .  they could have    must have    very short         no .   said boranova forcefully  seeming to find relief in being able to deny something .   the miniaturization field overlaps where it deals with particles sufficiently close together  and that are at rest  or nearly at rest  relative to each other .  an extended body    such as the ship and everything it contains    is treated as a large but single particle and has a half life of deminiaturization to match .  there miniaturization differs from radioactivity .       ah   said morrison   but when i was out of the ship and out of contact with it  could it be that i was then a separate particle with a much smaller mass than the ship and its contents and that i had a miniaturization half life much smaller than we have now .       i m not sure   said boranova   whether the distance between yourself and the ship was great enough to make you a separate body .  possibly it did  for the time you were not in contact .       and i then had a shorter half life    much shorter .       possibly    but then you were out of contact only a matter of minutes .       well  then  what is the half life of this ship at the present level of miniaturization .       we can t really speak of the half life of a single object .       yes  because half lives are statistical .  for any particle  deminiaturization can come  spontaneously  at any time  even after a very short time and even though the half life of a large number of similar particles would be quite long .       for spontaneous deminiaturization to come after a very short time when the statistical half life is long is extremely improbable .       but not impossible  is it .       no   said boranova .   it is not impossible .       so we can suddenly deminiaturize in five minutes  or even in one minute  or even as i take my next breath .       in theory .       did you all know .   his eyes darted around the ship .   of course you all knew .  why was i not told .      boranova said   we are volunteers  albert  working for science and for our nation .  we know all the dangers and accept them .  you have been forced into this and you don t have the motives that drive us .  it seemed possible that if you knew all the dangers  you would have refused to enter the ship voluntarily under any persuasion or that  being brought on board ship by force  you would be altogether useless to us out of sheer     she paused .      out of sheer fright  you were going to say   said morrison .   surely i have a right to be afraid .  there is reason for fear .      kaliinin interrupted  her voice a little shrill .   it is time to stop harping on albert s fear  natalya .  it is he who left the ship in an inadequate suit .  it is he who turned the ship around at the risk of his life .  where was his fear then .  if he felt it  he bottled it inside and didn t let it prevent him from doing what had to be done .      dezhnev said   and yet it was you who did not hesitate to say  in the past  that americans were all cowardly .       then i was wrong .  i was speaking unfairly and i ask albert s pardon .      it was at this point that morrison caught konev s eye .  the man was twisting around in his seat and glowering at him .  morrison did not pretend to be a master at reading facial expressions  but felt that he could  at a glance  tell what was ailing konev .  the man was jealous    furiously and quite impressively jealous .        .     the ship continued its slow way along the capillary toward the destination konev had marked out  the skeptic node .  it was not depending on the current now  which was slow indeed .  the engines were going  as morrison could tell  in two different ways .  first  it steadied the ship to have it move along actively  rather than drift passively  and it further deadened the already surprisingly small effect of brownian motion .  second  the ship was overtaking one red corpuscle after another .     in most cases these were nudged to one side and the red corpuscles then rolled backward between the ship and the wall .  occasionally  a red corpuscle would be met too near dead center and it would then be pushed forward for a while until it burst .  the debris would flow backward  leaving the ship s hull unmarked .  with at least five million corpuscles in every cubic millimeter of blood  it didn t matter how many were disrupted and morrison had become hardened to the carnage .     morrison deliberately thought of the red cells  rather than of the chance of spontaneous deminiaturization .  he knew there was no appreciable chance of exploding outward in the next few moments and  even if it happened  it would simply mean blackout .  death by fried brain would take place so quickly that there would be no conceivable way of sensing it .     not long before  he had been heating much more slowly in the bloodstream itself .  he had felt himself dying .  after that  instantaneous death had no terrors .     but he preferred to think of other things just the same .     konev s look .  what was seething within him and tearing him apart .  he had abandoned sophia with the utmost cruelty .  did he really think the child was not his .  people needed no reason to come to an emotional conclusion and the suspicion of being wrong just bolted the conclusion defensively and immovably in place .  pathological .  think of leontes in the winter s tale .  shakespeare always got these things right .  konev would push her away and hate her for the wrong he had done her .  he would push her into another man s arms and hate her for being pushed    and be jealous in addition .     and she .  did she know of the jealousy and play upon it .  would she deliberately turn to morrison  an american  to tear konev into strips .  tenderly patting the american with the wet towel .  defending him at every step .  with konev  of course  a witness to everything .     morrison s lips tightened .  he didn t like to be a tennis ball  batted from one to another in order to produce maximum pain .     it was none of his business  after all  and he shouldn t take sides .  but how was he going to not take sides .  sophia kaliinin was an attractive woman who reacted with silent sorrow .  yuri konev was a frowning nasty man who reacted with a compressed boiling of anger .  he could neither help liking sophia nor help disliking yuri .     he then noted boranova staring at him gravely and wondered if she were misinterpreting his thoughtfulness and silence .  did she feel he was brooding about the possibility of death by miniaturization    which he was manfully trying not to do .     it seemed so  when boranova suddenly said   albert  none of us are reckless .  i have a husband .  i have a son .  i want to go back to them alive and i intend to get us all back alive .  i want you to understand that .       i m sure your intentions are good   said morrison   but what can you do against a possibility of deminiaturization that is spontaneous  unpredictable  unstoppable .       spontaneous and unpredictable  i agree  but who said unstoppable .       can you stop it  then .       i can try .  we each have our jobs here .  arkady maneuvers the ship .  yuri directs it to the destination .  sophia gives the ship its electric pattern .  you will study the brain waves .  as for me  i sit back here and make decisions    my major decision up to now was a mistake  i admit that    and i watch the heat flow .       the heat flow .       yes .  before the deminiaturization takes place  there is a small evolution of heat  characteristic in pattern .  it is that emission that is destabilizing  it is what tips the delicate balance and  after a small delay  starts the process of deminiaturization .  when that happens  if i am fast enough  i can intensify the miniaturization field in such a way as to reabsorb the heat and reestablish the metastability .      morrison said dubiously   and has that ever been done    actually been done under field conditions    or is it simply theory .       it has been done    under much smaller intensities of miniaturization  of course .  still  i have trained at this and my reflexes are sharpened .  i hope not to be caught short .       was it spontaneous deminiaturization that put shapirov into a coma  natalya .      boranova hesitated .   we don t really know whether it was an unfortunate encounter with the laws of nature or human error    or both .  it may have been a slightly greater wobble from the metastable point of equilibrium than usual and nothing more than that .  it is not something i can analyze in detail with you  for you don t have the needed background in the physics and mathematics of miniaturization  nor would i be permitted to give you that    background .       i understand .  classified material .       of course .      dezhnev broke in   natasha  we have reached the skeptic node    or so yuri says .       then come to a halt   ordered boranova .        .     coming to a halt took a while .     morrison noted  with some mild surprise  that dezhnev did not seem concerned in the process .  he was checking his instruments but was making no effort to control the motion of the ship .     it was kaliinin who was deeply involved now .  morrison looked to his left  studying her as she bent over her instrument  her hair failing forward but not long enough to get in her way  her eyes intent  her slim fingers caressing the keys of her computer .  the graphic patterns on the screen she was watching made no sense to morrison  of course .      arkady   she said   move forward just a little .      the feeble current in the capillaries barely stirred the ship .  dezhnev supplied a small burst of power .   morrison felt his almost massless body move slightly backward  since there wasn t sufficient inertia to give it a real jerk .   the nearest red corpuscles between the ship and the farther wall of the capillary drifted backward .      stop  stop   said kaliinin .   enough .       i can t stop   said dezhnev .   i can only cut the motors and that i ve done .       it s all right   said kaliinin .   i have it now   then added the all but inevitable saving afterthought of  i think .   then   yes  i do have it .      morrison felt himself sway forward very slightly .  then he noted the nearby red corpuscles  together with an occasional platelet  drift forward and pass by lazily .     in addition  he became aware of a total cessation of the brownian motion  that faint tremble he had grown so used to that he was able to ignore it    until it stopped .  now its absence was noticeable and it produced the same sensation within morrison as the sudden cessation of a continuous low hum would have .  he stirred uneasily .  it was as though his heart had stopped  even though intellectually he knew it had not .     he asked   what s happened to the brownian motion  sophia .      she replied   we re affixed to the wall of the capillary  albert .      morrison nodded .  if the ship was one piece with the capillary wall  so to speak  the bombarding water molecules that produced the brownian motion would lose their effect .  their impacts would work toward moving an entire section of comparatively inert wall  instead of a tiny ship the size of a blood platelet .  naturally  the trembling would cease .      how did you manage to affix the ship  sophia .   he asked .      the usual electrical forces .  the capillary wall is partly protein  partly phospholipid in character .  there are positively and negatively charged groups here and there .  i had to detect a pattern sufficiently compact  and then produce a complementary pattern on the ship  negative where the wall is positive and vice versa .  the trouble is that the ship is moving with the current  so that i have to detect it a little ahead and produce the complementary pattern before we pass it .  i missed three such occasions and then we hit a region where there were no suitable patterns at all  so i had to get arkady to move us ahead a bit into a better region .     but i made it .       if the ship had a reverse gear   said morrison   there would have been no problem  would there .       true   said kaliinin   and the next ship will have one .  but for now  we have only what we have .       quite so   put in dezhnev .   as my father used to say   on tomorrow s feast  we can starve today .        on the other hand   said kaliinin   if we had a motor that could do all we would want it to do  we would have a strong impulse to use it lavishly and that might not be so good for poor shapirov .  and it would be expensive besides .  as it is  we used an electric field which is more sparing of energy than a motor would be and the price is only a little more work for me    and what of that .      morrison was quite certain she wasn t talking for his benefit .  he said   are you always so philosophical .      for a moment  her eyes widened and her nostrils tightened  but only for a moment .  then she relaxed and said with a small smile   no  who could be .  but i try .      boranova interjected  impatiently   enough chat  sophia .     arkady  you are clearly in touch with the grotto .  what s the delay .      arkady held up a large hand  half twisting in his seat to present its palm toward boranova .   patience  my captain .  they want us to stay exactly where we are for two reasons .  first  i m sending out a carrier wave in three directions .  they are locating each and using them to locate us in order to see if the location they determine jibes with what yuri says it is by dead reckoning .       how long will that take .       who can say .  a few minutes  at any rate .  but then my carrier waves are not very intense and the location must be precise  so they may have to repeat the measurement several times and take a mean and calculate limits of error .  after all  they have to be correct  for as my father used to say   almost right is no better than wrong .        yes yes  arkady  but that depends on the nature of the problem .  what is the second reason we are waiting .       they re going through some observations on pyotr shapirov .  his heartbeat has become slightly irregular .      konev looked up  his mouth failing open slightly and his thin cheeks looking gaunt under his high cheekbones .   what .  do they say it s anything we re doing .       no   said dezhnev .   do not become a tragedian .  they say nothing of the sort .  and what can we be doing to shapirov that is of any importance .  we are merely a red corpuscle among red corpuscles in his bloodstream  one among trillions .       well  then  what s wrong .       do i know .   said dezhnev  clearly irritated .   do they tell me .  am i a physician .  i just maneuver this vessel and they pay me no mind except as a pair of hands on the controls .      kaliinin said with a touch of sadness   academician shapirov clings but weakly to life in any case .  it is a wonder that he has remained in stable condition so long .      boranova nodded .   you are right  sophia .      konev said savagely   but he must continue to remain so .  he can t let go now .  not now .  we haven t made our measurements yet .       we will make them   said boranova .   an irregular heartbeat is not the end of the world  even for a man in a coma .      konev pounded the arm of his seat with a clenched fist .   i will not lose a moment .  albert  let s begin .      morrison was startled .  he said   what can be done here in the bloodstream .       a neural effect may be felt immediately outside the nerve cell .       surely not .  why would the neurons have axons and dendrites to channel the impulse if it was going to spread and weaken into space beyond .  locomotives move along rails  telephone messages along wires  neural impulses         don t argue the case  albert .  let s not accept failure by some fine process of reasoning .  let s test the matter .  see if you can detect brain waves and if you can analyze them in the proper fashion .      morrison said   i ll try  but don t order me around in that bullying tone .       i m sorry   said konev  not sounding sorry at all .   i want to watch what you do .   he unclasped himself  turned in his seat  holding on tightly  muttering   we must have more room the next time .       an ocean liner  certainly   said dezhnev .   next time .       what we have to do first   said morrison   is to discover whether we can detect anything at all .  the trouble is  we are surrounded by electromagnetic fields .  the muscles are rich in them and each molecule  almost  is the origin point of a         take all that as known   said konev .      i am only filling in the time while i carry my device through some necessary steps .  the neural field is characteristic in several ways and by adjusting the computer to eliminate fields without those characteristics  i leave only what the neurons produce .  we blank out all microfields like so and we deflect the muscle fields in this manner         in what manner .   demanded konev .      i describe it in my papers .       but i didn t see what you did .      wordlessly  morrison repeated the maneuver slowly .      oh   said konev .      and by now we should be detecting only neural waves if any are present here to detect    and there aren t .      konev s right fist clenched .   are you sure .       the screen shows a horizontal line .  nothing else .       it s quivering .       noise .  possibly from the ship s own electric field  which is complex and not entirely like any of the natural fields of the body .  i ve never had to adjust a computer to filter out an artificial field .       well  then  we have to move on .     arkady  tell them we can wait no longer .       i can t do that  yuri  unless natasha tells me to .  she s the captain .  or had you forgotten .       thank you  arkady   said boranova coldly .   you  at least  have not .  we ll forgive konev his lapse and put it down to overzealousness in pursuit of his work .  my orders are not to move until the grotto gives us the word .  if this mission fails because of anything that goes wrong with shapirov  there must be no opportunity for anyone to say it was because we did not follow orders .       what if some disaster happens because we did follow orders .  that can happen  too  you know .   konev s voice rose to near hysteria .     boranova replied   the fault will then lie with those who gave the orders .       i can find no satisfaction in apportioning blame  whether to myself or to anyone else .  it is results that count   said konev .      i agree   said boranova   if we are dealing with finespun theory .  but if you expect to continue working on this project past the time of a possible catastrophe  you will find that the manner of allotting blame is all important .       well  then   said konev  stuttering slightly in his passion .   urge them to let us move as soon as possible and then we ll    we ll         yes .   said boranova .      and then we ll enter the cell .  we must .        chapter       intercellular    in life  unlike chess  the game continues after checkmate .        dezhnev senior       .     a heavy silence fell upon the five shipmates .  konev s silence was the least quiet .  he was quivering with unrest and his hands would not keep still .     morrison felt a dim sympathy .  to have reached the destination  to have done just as planned  through difficulties  to imagine one s self at the point of snatching success  and to have to fear that it will be moved away from the eagerly grasping fingers even now    he knew the feeling .  no longer quite as sharply perhaps  as once  now that he was ground down and dulled by frustration  but he remembered the early occasions .  experiments that raised hope  but were somehow never quite conclusive .  colleagues who smiled and nodded  but were never convinced .     he leaned forward and said   look  yuri  just watch the red corpuscles .  they re creeping ahead  one after the other  steadily    and that means the heart is beating and is doing so fairly normally .  as long as the red corpuscles move steadily ahead  we re safe .      dezhnev said   there s the blood temperature  too .  i ve got it monitored at all times and it will have to start dropping slowly  but with determination  if shapirov lets go .  actually  the temperature is at the upper edge of normal .      konev grunted  as though scorning consolation and pushing it to one side  but it seemed to morrison that he was noticeably quieter after that .     morrison sank back in his seat and let his eyes close .  he wondered if he was experiencing hunger and decided that he was not .  he also wondered if there was a distinct sensation of bladder pressure .  there wasn t but that did not relieve him much .  one could always postpone eating for a considerable length of time  but the necessity of urination did not lend itself to quite the same flexibility of choice .     he was suddenly aware that kaliinin had addressed him but he had not been listening .   pardon me .  what did you say .   he asked  turning toward her .     kalfinin looked surprised .  she said softly   i ask your pardon .  i interrupted your thoughts .       they were worth interrupting  sophia .  i ask your pardon for being inattentive .       in that case  i asked what it is you do in your analysis of brain waves .  i mean  what is it you do that is different from what others do .  why was it necessary for us     she paused  clearly uncertain as to how to proceed .     morrison finished her thought without difficulty .   why was it necessary for me to be abstracted forcibly from my country .       have i made you angry .       no .  i presume you did not advise the action .       of course not .  i knew nothing of it .  in fact  that is why i am asking you my question .  i know nothing about your field except that there are electroneural waves  that electroencephalography has become an intricate study  and an important one .       then if you ask me what is special about my own views  i m afraid i can t tell you .       is it secret  then .  i thought it might be .       no  it is not secret   said morrison  frowning .   there are no secrets in science  or there should be none    except that there are struggles for priority so that scientists are sometimes cautious about what they say  and i am guilty of that  too  sometimes .  in this case  though  i mean it literally .  i can t tell you because you lack the basis for understanding .      kaliinin considered  her lips compressed as though in aid to thought .   could you explain a bit of it .       i can try  if you re willing to hear simple assertions .  i can t very well describe the entire field .     what we call brain waves are a conglomeration of all sorts of neuronic activity    sense perceptions of various kinds  stimuli of various muscles and glands  arousal mechanisms  coordinations  and so on .  lost among all these are those waves that control  or result from  constructive and creative thought .  isolating those skeptic waves  as i call them  from all the rest is an enormous problem .  the body does it without any difficulty  but we poor scientists are  for the most part  at a total loss .       i m having no difficulty understanding this   said kaliinin  smiling and looking pleased .   she is remarkably pretty  thought morrison  when she manages to get rid of her air of melancholy .       i haven t gotten to the hard part yet   he said .      please do  then .       about twenty years ago  it was demonstrated that there was what seemed a random component in the waves that no one had ever picked up because the instruments that had been used until then did not pick up what we now call  the twinkle .   it s a very rapid oscillation of irregular amplitude and intensity .  that s not a discovery i made  you understand .      kaliinin smiled again .   i imagine that twenty years ago you would have been too young to make the discovery .       i was an undergraduate then  making the discovery that young women were not entirely unapproachable  which is by no means an unimportant thing to find out .  in fact  each person may have to rediscover it now and then  i think .     but never mind that .      a number of people speculated that the twinkle might represent thought processes in the mind  but no one managed to isolate it properly .  it would come and go  be detectable at times and not at others  and the general feeling was that it was artifactitious  a matter of working with instruments that were too delicate for the thing they were measuring so that one picked up what was  essentially  noise .      i thought not .  in time i developed a computer program that made it possible for me to isolate the twinkle and to demonstrate it was always present in the human brain .  for that i got some credit  though few people were able to duplicate my work .  i used animals for types of experimentation that were too dangerous to perform on human beings and used the results to further sharpen my program of analysis .  but the sharper i made the analysis and the more significant i thought the results  the less others were able to duplicate them and the more they insisted that i was misled by my animal experimentation .      but even isolating the twinkle was a long way from demonstrating that it was a representation of abstract thought .  i have amplified it  intensified it  modified my program over and over  and have convinced myself that i am studying thought  the skeptic waves themselves .  still  no one can duplicate the crucial points of my work .  i have  on several occasions  allowed someone to use my program and my computer    the sort of thing i m using now    and they invariably fail .      kaliinin was listening gravely .  she said   can you imagine why no one can duplicate your work .       the easiest explanation is that there is something wrong with me  that i am a crank    if not a madman .  i believe that some of my colleagues suspect that to be the answer .       do you think you re a madman .       no  i don t  sophia  but even i waver sometimes .  you see  after you isolate the skeptic waves and amplify them  it is conceivable that the human brain itself might become a receiving instrument .  the waves may transfer the thoughts from the thinker you are studying directly to you .  the brain would certainly be an extraordinarily delicate receiver  but it would also be an extraordinarily individual one .  if i improved my program so that i could sense the thoughts better  that would mean i improved it to suit my own individual brain .  other brains might not be affected and  in fact  might be less affected  the closer i adjusted it to mine .  it would be like a painting .  the closer a painting is made to look like me  the less it looks like anyone else .  the more i can make my program produce sensible self consistent results  the less anyone else can .       have you actually sensed thought .       i m not sure .  there are times i have thought i did  but i m never quite convinced it s not my imagination .  certainly no one else    with my program or any other    has sensed anything .  i have used the twinkle to track down the skeptic nodes in the brains of chimpanzees and from that reasoned out where they would be in human brains  but that is not accepted either .  it is considered the overenthusiasm of a scientist oversold on his own unlikely theory .  and even using leads into the skeptic nodes    on animals  of course    i couldn t be sure .       with animals it would be difficult .  have you published these    sensations of yours .       i haven t dared   said morrison  shaking his head .   no one would accept such subjective findings .  i ve mentioned it in passing to several people    foolish of me    and the news spread and merely convinced my colleagues all the more firmly that i am  shall we say  unstable .  it was only last sunday that natalya told me that shapirov took me seriously  but he is considered  at least in my country  to be unstable  too .       he is not   said kaliinin firmly   or was not .       it would be nice to think he wasn t  obviously .      konev  from in front of morrison  said suddenly  without turning around   it was your sensations of thought that impressed shapirov .  i know .  he discussed it with me .  he said on a number of occasions that your program was a relay station and he would like to try it himself .  if you were inside a neuron  a key neuron of the skeptic node  things would be different .  you would sense thoughts unmistakably .  shapirov thought so and i think so .  shapirov thought it possible you might even have sensed thoughts unmistakably as it was  but were not ready to let the world know .  is that so .      how they harped on secrecy  all of them  thought morrison .  then he caught the look on kaliinin s face .  her mouth was partly open  her eyebrows drawn together  her finger hovering near her lips .  it was as though she wanted to ask him to be quiet with a kind of agonizing intensity  without quite daring to do so openly .     but then he was distracted by dezhnev s voice  joyfully loud .   enough babble  my children .  the grotto has located us and we are  to their enormous astonishment  exactly where we say we are .      konev threw up both hands and his voice sounded almost boyish .   exactly where i say we are .      dezhnev said   let us have communal responsibility .  where we say we are .       no   said boranova .   i ordered konev to make the decision on his own responsibility .  the credit is therefore his .      konev was not mollified .  he said   you would not have so quickly demanded communal responsibility  arkady vissarionovich     he used the patronymic in a style long out of fashion in the soviet union  as though to emphasize the fact that dezhnev was the son of a peasant  among whom  only  the style remained in fashion     had we proved to be in the wrong capillary .      dezhnev s smile became an uncomfortable one and his somewhat yellow upper incisors caught at his lower lip .     boranova said in her masterful contralto  cutting off any retort dezhnev might have made   and shapirov .  what of him .       that   said dezhnev   has passed .  an injection of some sort steadied the heartbeat .      konev said   well  then  are we ready to go .       yes   said boranova .      in that case    out of the bloodstream at last .         .     boranova and kaliinin were bent over their instruments .  morrison watched them for a few moments  but  of course  knew nothing of what was going on .  he turned to dezhnev  who sat in a relaxed position  unlike konev  whose body was tense  almost ridged with muscle   and said   what will be done  arkady .  we can t very well just blast our way out of a blood vessel in the brain .       we ll sneak out once we re small enough .  we re miniaturizing again .  look around you .      startled  morrison did .  he realized that every time the outside world seemed to stabilize  he quickly learned to take it for granted and to pay no attention to it .     the current had picked up speed .  or  rather  it hadn t  but the ship had shrunk in size once more and objects moving by took correspondingly less time to pass  so that the mind  insisting on considering the ship s size unchanged  interpreted what was seen as a faster current .     a red cell passed by  moving as it had  or seeming to move as it had  in the carotid artery  but despite its speed  it billowed past for a long time  like a quivering whale passing a rowboat .  it had grown faint indeed .  it was almost transparent now and its edge was fuzzy with brownian motion .  there was a grayish dimness about it  so that it looked like an angry thundercloud spreading its way over the heavens .  it had lost most of its oxygen by this time  of course  giving it up to the avid brain cells which  without motion or visible signs of life  consumed one quarter of all the oxygen carried by the blood to the various organs of the body .  for all that the brain seemed to simply sit there  sense perception  response  and thought  all of it coordinated with a complexity that no human computer could come within an astronomical distance of duplication    might never duplicate    did not come cheap .     to make up for the spreading of the red cells  the platelets  and the comparatively rare white cells that had grown into monsters that were now too large to grasp  the blood plasma was becoming far less featurelessly liquid .     it had started to turn grainy and now the grains were slowly expanding as they shot past with gradually increasing speed .  morrison knew he was looking at protein molecules and  after a while  it seemed to him that through their whirling and flexing he could make out the helical arrangements of their atoms in fuzzy manner .  some had a miniature forest of lipid molecules partially encasing them .     he was becoming aware also of movement  not the tremble of brownian motion but a lurching that was becoming more pronounced .     he turned his head to look out the other side at the capillary wall to which they were attached .     the tiling was gone    or at least one tile  or cell  as he might as well think of it now  had expanded to the point where it was the only one to be seen .  slipping off behind was the bulge of the nucleus of the cell  large and thick and growing larger and thicker .     the ship lurched as part of it slid away from the wall and then lurched again as it slid back .      what s happening .   said morrison  looking at kaliinin  who shook her head impatiently .  she was totally absorbed in her work .     dezhnev said   sophia is trying to neutralize the ship s electric charge here and there so that it lets go before the tension damages the wall .  and she has to find new areas of attachment to keep from losing the wall altogether .  it s not easy  having to miniaturize and  at the same time  staying attached to the wall .      morrison said  alarmed   how far will we miniaturize .      his words were overborne by kaliinin s shrill command .   arkady  move it forward .  gently .  just put forward pressure on the ship .       yes  sophia    but tell me when to stop .   to morrison  he added   my father used to say   between not enough and too much is a hair s breadth .        more  more   said kaliinin .   all right .  now we ll try .   the ship seemed to stick and strain and then it suddenly slid forward and morrison felt himself thrust gently back against his seat .      good   said kaliinin .   just a little less now .      the cell came to an end .  beyond it was another cell .  thin cells  as cells went  a mere film of cells  fitted together to make a tiny tube  with the ship and its crew of five clinging to the inner surface by minute attractions of electric charge .     the space between the adjoining cells seemed ropy  with cables stretching from inside one cell to the other .  they were not all intact and there were stumps visible like the remains of a felled forest .  it seemed to morrison that there were narrow gaps in that felled forest  but he couldn t see clearly from the angle at which he viewed them .     he said again   how far will we miniaturize  arkady .       eventually to the size of a small organic molecule .       but what would the chances be of spontaneous deminiaturization at that size .       appreciable   said dezhnev .   much more than it was when we were the size of a red corpuscle or even of a blood platelet .       still not enough to worry about   said boranova .   i assure you .       exactly   said dezhnev and raised his hand slightly with the first two fingers crossed so that morrison could just see it and boranova  farther back  could not .  that american gesture had become universal and morrison  knowing exactly what it meant  felt himself growing cold inside .     dezhnev was looking straight ahead  but he might have sensed morrison s grimace or heard his soft grunt .  he said   don t worry about it  young albert .  it is always wise to have but one worry at a time and right now let us worry about squeezing out of the blood vessel .     sophia  my loved one .       yes  arkady   she said .      weaken the field in the rear of the ship and when i move grope for one ahead .       i will do so  arkady .  didn t your father once say   there is no point in trying to teach a thief to steal  .       yes  he did .  steal  then  little thief  steal .      morrison wondered whether dezhnev and kaliinin were deliberately being lighthearted in the face of the possibility of sudden death as a way of cheering him up .  or were they showing contempt for his cowardice .  he chose the former .  surely when an action might equally well be interpreted as friendly or hostile  one might as well choose the friendly .  perhaps dezhnev s father would have agreed .  with that thought  he felt cheered .     the ship s rear seemed to be hanging loosely and to remain several centimeters  several picometers in real measure .   from the wall of the capillary .  morrison studied it closely and could see the serried ranks of protein and lipid molecules that made up that wall .     he thought  what are we doing ignoring this .  here is our opportunity to study tissues with greater precision than the best scanning electron microscope can    and to study them while alive  to see not only position but living change and motion .  we have passed through the bloodstream and narrowed in on a capillary wall without looking at anything in any real scientific sense .  we are only passing through  with no more interest than we would show if we were in a subway  barreling through an underground tunnel .     all to study oscillations that might be produced by thought  .  .  .  and might not .     the ship was inching along  an old word  thought morrison suddenly  antedating the metric system  but he d never heard anyone say  centimetering along   as though it were somehow feeling its way .  perhaps  between dezhnev s motors and kaliinin s flickering electric fields  that was precisely what it was doing .      we re approaching the junction  little sophia   said dezhnev in a curiously tight voice .   make sure your hold is firm in front  while i move forward another meter or so .       i suspect from the appearance and electrical behavior   said kaliinin   that we have a clump of arginines toward the junction .  that represents a strong region of positive charge and i can handle that as smoothly as sour cream .      but boranova said sternly   no overconfidence  sophia .  keep a firm watch .  if you miss and the ship tears loose  there will be much to do over .       yes  natalya   said sophia   but with all respect  the warning is not really needed .      dezhnev said   sophia  do exactly what i say .  keep only the prow of the ship attached to the wall  but strongly .  release everything else .       done   said sophia faintly .     morrison found himself holding his breath .  the rear of the ship had spun away from the wall  but it held in front .  the bloodstream caught the detached rear end and pushed the ship into a position at right angles to the current  while the capillary wall  where the ship still held  moved outward like a pimple .     morrison said tightly   watch out .  we ll pull a section out of the wall .       quiet  all .   thundered dezhnev .  then  in an ordinary voice   sophia  i shall increase the engine push slowly .  get yourself in position to break all remaining attraction .  the ship is to be entirely neutral    but not until i say so .      sophia cast a quick look toward boranova  who said in her quiet way   do exactly as you re told  sophia .  for this  arkady s word is absolute .      morrison imagined he felt the ship straining forward .  the section of the capillary wall to which it was attached stretched farther and farther .     sophia said urgently   arkady  either the field will snap or the wall will .       another moment  dear one  another moment .     now .      the wall snapped back and the ship bounded forward in a great leap that rocked morrison gently backward .  the forward end of the ship buried itself in the cement stuff between the two cells of the capillary wall .        .     for the first time  morrison was aware of the laboring of the microfusion engines .  there was a subliminal throbbing as the ship worked its way through the joint with what seemed increasing difficulty .  there was nothing to see up ahead .  the thickness of the capillary wall  very thin though it was in normal terms  was far thicker than the length of the ship .     the ship was now totally immersed in the joint and dezhnev  beads of sweat on his forehead  turned his head and spoke to boranova .   we re using up energy faster than we should .      boranova said   then stop the ship and let s consider .      deshnev said   if i do that  there is a chance that the natural elasticity of this material will pop us out of the joint and back into the bloodstream .       slow the engines down  then .  choose a level that will be enough to keep us in place .      the throbbing came to an end .     dezhnev said   the joint is exerting considerable pressure on the ship .       enough to crush us  arkady .       not now .  but who can say for the future if the pressure continues .      morrison burst out .   this is ridiculous .  didn t someone say we re the size of a small organic molecule .       we re the size of a glucose molecule   said boranova   which is made up of twenty four atoms altogether .       thank you   said morrison freezingly   but i know how many atoms there are in a glucose molecule .  as it happens  small molecules drift through the capillary walls constantly by diffusion .  diffusion .  that s the way the body works .  why aren t we diffusing through .      boranova said   diffusion is a statistical proposition .  there are twenty four billion trillion glucose molecules in the bloodstream at any given time .  they move around randomly and some manage to hit in such places and in such ways as to move through a joint  or to move into the membrane of a capillary wall cell  into the cell  and out the other side .  a very small percentage succeed at any given second  but that is enough to ensure proper tissue functioning .  however  by chance  a particular glucose molecule may remain in the bloodstream for a month without diffusing .  can we wait a month for a chance to do its work .       that s no argument  natalya   said morrison impatiently .   why don t we simply do deliberately what a real glucose molecule would do by chance .  especially now  when we re part way through the joint .  why are we stuck in position .      konev said   i m on albert s side .  diffusion probably isn t a passive leakage .  there s some sort of interaction between the diffusing object and the barrier through which the diffusion takes place    except that no one knows what the interaction might be exactly .  especially here  where we face the blood brain barrier .       we re here at the barrier   said dezhnev .   you re the brain expert .  can you look around and tell us how this diffusion works .       no  i can t .  but glucose is one molecule that gets through the blood brain barrier easily .  it must because it is the brain s sole fuel for energy .  the trouble is that while the ship is as small as a glucose molecule  it isn t a glucose molecule .       are you getting at something  yuri   said boranova   or is this a lecture .       i m getting at something .  we had the ship become uncharged in order to lunge into the joint  but why leave it uncharged now .  can it be given the charge pattern of a glucose molecule .  if so  it will be a glucose molecule as far as shapirov s body is concerned .  i suggest you order it done  natalya .      kaliinin did not wait for the order .  she said   it is done  natalya .       they each addressed boranova  morrison noted .  each still maintained the fiction of the other s nonexistence .      dezhnev said   and the joint s pressure decreases at once .  it recognizes a friend  so it bows politely and steps aside .  my father s mother  long may i keep her memory  would have cried out   black magic   and at once would have hidden beneath the bed .       arkady   said boranova   increase the power of the engines and pass through before the joint notices that underneath the glucose pattern is something that is not glucose .       yes  natalya   said dezhnev .     morrison said   this one is yours  yuri .  your suggestion was just right .  in hindsight i see that i should have thought of that  too  but the fact is  i didn t .      konev said gruffly  as though finding praise something he couldn t handle   it was nothing .  since the brain lives on glucose  we got down to glucose size .  eventually  we would have had to have a glucose pattern  and as soon as you asked the question why we weren t diffusing when we should have been  i realized we needed the pattern already .      dezhnev said   members of the expedition  we are through the joint .  we are out of the bloodstream .  we are in the brain .         .     in the brain  thought morrison  but not in a brain cell .  so far they had only passed from the intercellular space between the cells of the capillary wall  into the intercellular spaces of the brain where the support structures existed that maintained the form and interrelationships of the nerve cells  or neurons .  remove them and the cells would squash into amorphous masses  pulled together by gravity and unable to maintain any sensible function .     it was a jungle  made up of thick viny threads of collagen .   this was the nearly universal animal connective protein that fulfilled the function of cellulose in plants  less cheaply  since it was protein rather than carbohydrate  but far more flexibly .   through the eye of ultraminiaturization  those collagen threads  totally invisible without an electron microscope  looked like tree trunks  leaning this way and that in a world in which gravity was of little importance .     there were finer and still finer threads .  morrison knew that some of them might be elastin and that the collagen itself might come in subtly different varieties .  if he could see the whole in a wider view  from a less miniaturized standpoint  he would have been able to detect order and structure .  at this level  however  it was chaotic .  one couldn t even see far in any direction  the overlapping fibers blocked vision .     morrison became aware that the ship was moving very slowly .  the four others were each staring around in wonder .  either they had not expected this  morrison hadn t  for he had been too interested in the electrical properties of the brain to think much concerning its microanatomy  or  if they had  they had nevertheless failed to visualize it .     morrison said   how do you expect to find your way to a neuron .  does anybody know .      dezhnev was the first to answer   the ship can only move straight ahead  so we move straight ahead until we get to a cell .       how do we move straight ahead through this jungle .  if we can t steer the ship  how do we move around obstacles .      dezhnev rubbed his chin thoughtfully .   we don t move around  we push around .  the ship will move past one of those objects and there will be more friction on the contact side than on the other  so our path bends  like a comet rounding the sun .   he smiled .   cosmonauts do that when they use gravity to skim around a satellite or planet .  we ll do it to skim around those things .      konev said morosely   those things are collagen fibers .      morrison said   some of them are pretty thick .  you won t always pass by .  you ll hit one head on and stay there and if you can only move forward  what will you do .  this ship was designed only for the bloodstream .  we re helpless out of it with nothing to carry us along .      boranova interposed .   arkady  you have three microfusion engines and the jets  i know  are arranged at the rear at the apices of an equilateral triangle .  can you fire only one of them .       no .  one contact controls all three .       yes  arkady  that is how it is now .  but you designed the ship and you know the details of its controls .  is there anything you can do to modify them so that you can fire them one at a time .      dezhnev took a deep breath .   everyone told me over and over again that i must cut corners  that i must save the budget  that i must do nothing to irritate the bureaucrats .       aside from that  arkady  is there anything you can do .       let me think .  it means jury rigging .  it means finding something to make switches out of  and extra wire  and who knows if it will work or how long it will work if it does  and if we won t end up worse than we are .  i see what you mean  though .  if i can fire only one of the engines  it will set up an unbalanced thrust .       you ll be able to steer then  depending on which you fire .       i ll try  natalya .      morrison said angrily   why didn t you think of this when we were in the wrong capillary .  it might have saved me the small trouble of nearly dying trying to turn the ship by hand .      dezhnev said   if you hadn t so promptly suggested turning the ship by hand  we might have thought of it    but it wouldn t have been a good idea .       why not .       we were in the current of the bloodstream .  the ship is carefully streamlined to take advantage of it and its surface is designed to allow water to flow past it without turbulence  which makes it all the harder to turn out of the current .  it would have taken much longer than turning by hand    and very much more energy .  the narrow confines of the capillary must be remembered  too .  here  there is no current and because we ve been so miniaturized there is a great deal of room .       enough   said boranova .   get to work  arkady .      dezhnev did so  rummaging through a tool chest  removing a cover plate and studying the control details within  maintaining through it all a kind of incoherent muttering .     konev  his hands clasped behind his neck  said  without turning   albert  tell us about those sensations you receive .       sensations .       you were telling us about them just before we got the news from the grotto that we were located in the correct capillary .  i m talking about the sensations you experienced when you were trying to analyze the thought waves .       ah   said morrison and caught kaliinin s eye .     very slightly  she shook her head .  very tentatively  a warning finger crossed her lips .     morrison said   nothing to tell .  i had vague sensations i couldn t describe in any objective way .  it could well have been my imagination .  certainly those whom i tried to tell about it were convinced it was .       and you never published anything about them .       never .  i merely mentioned it in passing at conventions and that was bad enough .  if shapirov and you heard of it  it was through word of mouth only .  if i had published  that would have come as near to scientific suicide as i would ever want to be .       too bad .      morrison looked briefly toward kaliinin .  she had nodded very slightly  but said nothing .  clearly  she couldn t say anything without being overheard by the entire ship .     morrison looked around carelessly .  dezhnev was lost in his work  clucking to himself .  konev stared straight ahead  lost in whatever tortuous thoughts he happened to have .  boranova  behind kaliinin  was studying the screen of her computer carefully and was making notes .  morrison did not try to read them    he could read english upside down  but he hadn t come to that pitch of ease with russian .     only kaliinin  to his left  was looking at him .     morrison pressed his lips together and then shifted his computer into a word processing mode .  it did not have a cyrillic adjunct  but he spelled out the russian words in phonetic roman lettering .  what is wrong .     she hesitated  probably not very much at home in roman .     then her own fingers flashed and the neat cyrillic on her screen read  don t trust him .  say nothing .  it was erased at once .     morrison wrote  why .     kaliinin said  not evil  but priority  credit .  will do anything  anything  anything .     the words were gone and she looked away firmly .     morrison considered her thoughtfully .  was it only the vengefulness of a woman betrayed .     it didn t matter  in any case  for he had no intention of talking about anything that he hadn t already given away  either in a paper or by word of mouth .  he himself was not evil  but where priority and credit were concerned  he might not do anything  anything  anything  but he would do a great deal .     still  there was nothing to be done at that moment .  or one thing  perhaps  which was completely aside from the point  but which was beginning  just beginning  to occupy his mind to the exclusion of other things .     he turned to boranova  who was still staring at her instrument and tapping her fingers softly against the arm of her seat in thoughtful concentration .      natalya .       yes  albert .   she did not look up .      i hate to introduce a note of ugly realism  but     his voice lowered to near soundlessness     i m thinking of urinating .      she looked up at him  a corner of her lips twitching very slightly  but avoiding the smile .  she did not lower her voice .   why think of it  albert .  do it .      morrison felt like a little boy raising his hand for permission to leave the room    unreasonably so  he knew .   i don t like to be the first .      boranova frowned  almost as though she were the teacher in the case .   that is quite silly and  in any case  you are not .  i have already taken care of such a need in myself .   then  with a faint shrug   tension tends to increase urgency  i have frequently found .      morrison had frequently found that  too .  he whispered   it s all very well for you .  you re there in the back seat alone .   and he nodded slightly in the direction of sophia .      so .   boranova shook her head .   surely you don t wish me to improvise a curtain for you .  shall i place my hand over her eyes .    kaliinin looked in their direction in surprise .    she will ignore you  i m sure  out of decency and out of a feeling that in short order she will wish you to ignore her .      morrison was keenly embarrassed  for kaliinin was now looking at him with obvious understanding .  she said   come  albert  i held you naked in my lap .  what room need one make for modesty now .      morrison smiled weakly and made a little thank you gesture .     he tried to remember how to manage the waste lid on his seat  but once he remembered  he found that it slid open with a small but definite click .   those irritating soviets .  backward always in small ways .  it might easily have been designed to open noiselessly .      he also managed to loosen the electrostatic seam along his crotch and then found himself worrying whether he would manage to close it unobtrusively afterward .     morrison felt the current of air at the moment the waste lid opened and it felt uncomfortably cold against his bare skin .  he sighed with a tremendous relief when he was done  then he managed to close the seal along the crotch and sat there  panting .  he realized that he must have been holding his breath .      here   said boranova brusquely .  he stared  for a moment  at what she was holding  then recognized it as a small sealed towel .  he tore open the seal  found the towel within moistened and scented and rubbed his hands with it .   the soviets were learning small elegances  obviously    or decadences  depending on whether finickiness or impatience won the battle for domination within you .      and then dezhnev s throaty voice sounded loudly  very loudly  in morrison s ear after all the whispering he had been engaged in .   that s done now .       what s done .   asked morrison angrily  automatically assuming the reference was to his bodily functions .      the individual firing of the motors   said dezhnev  making a there you are gesture with both hands in the directions of the ship s controls .   i can fire any one  or two  or all three  if i wish .  absolutely certain    i think .       which is it  arkady .   said boranova waspishly .   is it quite certain or is it a matter of opinion .       both   said dezhnev .   it is my opinion that i am absolutely certain .  the trouble is that my opinion isn t always right .  my father used to say         i think we ought to try it out   said konev  cutting off dezhnev s father  perhaps in the full realization he was doing so .      of course   said dezhnev .   that goes without saying  but as my father used to say     he raised his voice as though determined not to be again subverted     the sure thing about anything that goes without saying is that someone is bound to say it .     and you might as well know        he paused momentarily and boranova said   what might we as well know .       several things  natasha   said dezhnev .   in the first place  steering will take a lot of energy .  i ve done my best  but the ship is not designed for this .  for another    well  i can t communicate with the grotto now .       can t communicate .   said kaliinin  her voice rising to a near squeak in what was either surprise or indignation .     boranova s voice marked her as definitely indignant .   what do you mean  we can t communicate .       come  natasha  i can t wire up the motors separately without wires  can i .  the best engineer in the world can t make wires out of nothing and can t manufacture silicon chips out of nothing  either .  something had to be dismantled and the one thing i could dismantle without disabling the ship was communications .  i told them that out in the grotto and there was a lot of shrieking and complaining  but how could they stop me .  so now we can steer  i think    and we can t communicate  i know .         .     there was silence as the ship began to move .  the surroundings were utterly different now .  in the bloodstream  there had been a heaving medley of objects    some crawling ahead of the ship  some slowly drifting behind  depending on eddies and streamlining  morrison supposed .  there was the feeling of movement  if only because the markings on the walls    fatty plaques in the arteries  tiling in the capillaries  slipped steadily backward .     here  in intercellular space  however  there was stasis .  no motion .  no feeling of life .  the tangle of collagen fibers seemed a forest primeval  built up of trunks only  without leaves  without color  without sound  without motion .     once the ship pushed forward through the viscous intercellular fluid  however  everything began to move backward .  the ship slipped toward and through a v shaped meeting of fibers and  as they passed through  morrison had the plain impression of a loose spiral making its way upward along each collagen fiber  the spiral being more marked on the thinner of the two .     up ahead was a thicker fiber still  a monarch of the collagen jungle .      you ll have to turn  arkady   said konev .   now s the time to test it .       all right  but i ll have to lean over .  i don t have the controls neatly at my fingertips .  there s a limit to improvization .   he leaned forward  groping at a level about that of his calves .   i do not relish the thought of having to do this constantly .  it is hard on a man of portly habit .       you mean a man who is fat   said konev ill naturedly .   you have let yourself go flabby  arkady .  you should lose weight .      dezhnev straightened up .   very well .  i will stop right now  go home  and begin to lose weight .  is this a time  yuri  to lecture me .       it is not a time for you to get emotional either  arkady   said boranova .   steer .      dezhnev bent over  suppressing a grunt .  slowly  the ship turned rightward in a gentle arc  or  to judge more literally by appearance  the thick collagen fiber drifted leftward as it approached    as did everything else .      you will hit it   said konev .   turn more sharply .       it won t turn more sharply   said dezhnev .   each motor is only so far off center and i can t change that .       well  then  we will hit it   said konev  an edge of anxiety in his voice .      then let us hit   said boranova angrily .   yuri  do not go into panic over inconsequentials .  the ship is tough plastic  that fiber is undoubtedly rubbery .      and as she spoke  the prow of the ship began to pass the collagen fiber  with little room to spare .  watching through the port side of the ship  it was clear that the broadening beam of the ship would make contact .  when the fiber was nearly level with kalimin s seat  it happened .  there was no scraping sound  only a very soft hiss could be detected .  not only was the fiber rubbery  as boranova had said  so that it compressed slightly under the force of the collision  then rebounded  pushing the ship a trifle away    but the slimy intercellular fluid served as a cushion and a friction reducer .     the ship continued to move and turned leftward in the direction of the fiber .     dezhnev said   i shut off the motor as soon as i saw we were about to make contact .  this leftward turn we re going through now is a friction turn .       yes   said konev   but what if you had wanted to turn in the other direction .       then i would have used the motor .  or  considerably earlier in our progress  i would have made a turn toward a graze with the fiber to the right .  that fiber would have turned us rightward .  the main thing  in any case  is to use the motors as little as possible and the fibers as much as possible .  in the first place  we don t want to consume our supply of energy too rapidly .  in the second place  the rapid output of energy increases the chances of spontaneous deminiaturization .       what .   cried morrison .  he turned to boranova .   is that true .       it s not an important effect   said boranova   but it s true .  the chances go up a bit .  i should say that conservation is the more important of the two reasons for saving energy .      but morrison could not repress his anger .   don t you see how ridiculous    no  criminal    this whole situation is .  we re in a ship that simply isn t up to the task and everything we do makes it worse .      boranova shook her head .   albert  please .  you know we have no choice .       besides   said dezhnev  grinning   if we manage to do the job in this unsuitable ship  think how much more remarkable that will make us .  we will be heroes .  authentic heroes .  we will surely get the order of lenin    each one of us .  it will be a foregone conclusion .  and if we fail  it is comforting to think that we will be able to explain it as the ship s fault .       yes .  soviet heroes  win or lose  all of you   said morrison .   and what will i be .      boranova said   remember  albert  you will not be neglected if we succeed .  the order of lenin has been given to foreigners on a number of occasions  including many americans .  even if you should not want the honor for some reason  the success of your theories will be established and you may receive a nobel prize before any of us do .       we re in no position to count our chickens   said morrison .   i shall refrain from composing my nobel acceptance speech for just a while  thank you .       actually   said kaliinin   i wonder if we re in a position to reach a neuron .       what s the difficulty .   asked dezhnev .   we can move and steer and we re outside the capillary and in the brain .  just out there is a neuron  any number of them  billions of them .       just out where .   kaliinin asked .   i don t see any neurons .  just collagen fibers .      dezhnev said   how much of this intercellular fluid do you think there is .       a microscopic thickness   said kaliinin   if we were normal in size .  however  we re the size of a glucose molecule and  relative to ourselves  there may be a kilometer s distance or more to the nearest neuron .       well  then   said dezhnev   we ll move our ship a kilometer .  it may take a little time but it can be done .       yes  if we could move in a straight line  but we re in the middle of a dense jungle .  we have to turn and twist around this fiber and that and  in the end  we may travel fifty kilometers by our own measurement and find ourselves back at our starting point .  we re just going to be blundering through a maze and we won t reach a neuron except by sheerest accident .       yuri has a map   said dezhnev  sounding a little nonplussed .   yuri s cerebro whatever       konev  frowning  shook his head .   my cerebrograph shows me the circulatory network of the brain and the cell pattern  but i can t expand it to the point where it will indicate our position in the intercellular fluid between cells  we don t know that sort of fine detail and we can t get out of cerebrography any more than we can put into it .      morrison looked through the wall of the ship .  in all directions  the collagen fibers could be made out  overlapping and blocking them in .  in no direction could the eye see through them very far and in no direction was there any sign of anything but fiber upon fiber .     no nerve cells .  no neurons .       chapter       cell    the wall that says  welcome  stranger  has never been built .        dezhnev senior       .     boranova s nostrils flared slightly and her dark eyebrows hunched together  but her voice remained calm .      arkady   she said   you will travel forward in as straight a line as possible .  curve to a minimum extent and  if you can  curve left and right alternately .  and  since we re in a three dimensional situation  up and down alternately .       it would get confusing  natasha   said dezhnev .      of course it will  but perhaps it won t get completely confusing .  we may not be able to travel ruler straight  but maybe we won t go in circles  spirals  or helixes either .  and sooner or later we should reach a cell .       perhaps   said dezhnev   if you deminiaturize the ship a little bit         no   said boranova .      wait  natasha .  think about it .  if we deminiaturize a bit  then there will be less space to travel .  we grow larger  the space between blood vessel and neuron grows smaller .   he made eloquent gestures with his hands .   you understand .       i understand .  but the larger we get  arkady  the more difficult it will be to pass between the fibers .  the neurons of the brain are well protected .  the brain is the only organ to be completely encased in bone and the neurons themselves  which are the most irregular in the body  are well packed with intercellular material .  look for yourself .  it s only if we re down to the size of a glucose molecule that we can make our way through and around the collagen without  perhaps  doing drastic damage to the brain .      at this point  konev committed the unusual act of turning in his seat  looking upward as he turned to his left so that his glance passed over kaliinin before meeting boranova s eyes .  he said   i don t think we have to travel onward completely blind    completely at random .       how otherwise  yuri .   asked boranova .      surely the neurons give themselves away .  each has nerve impulses running its length periodically and at very short intervals .  that might be detected .      morrison frowned .   the neurons are insulated .       the axons are    not the cell bodies .       but it is the axons where the nerve impulse is strongest .       no  it is the synapses where the nerve impulse may be strongest and they are not insulated  either .  the synpases ought to be sparking all the time and you ought to be able to detect it .      morrison said   we couldn t in the capillary .       we were on the wrong side of the capillary wall at the time .     look  albert  why are you arguing the matter .  i m asking you to try to detect brain waves .  that s why you re here  isn t it .       i was kidnapped   said morrison violently .   that s why i m here .      boranova leaned forward .   albert  whatever the reason  you re here and yuri s suggestion is a reasonable one .     and  yuri  must you always be confrontational .      morrison found himself shaking with anger and for a moment he wasn t sure why .  konev s suggestion was indeed reasonable .     then it occurred to him that he was being asked to put his theories to the test under conditions which would allow him no escape .  he was on the very border of a brain cell that was magnified with respect to himself to mountainous proportions .  he might be asked next to make his test inside  actually inside  such a cell .  and if he did    and if he failed    under what blanket of argument and excuse could he hide from the fact that his work was wrong and had always been wrong .     he was angry  surely  at being thrust into this uncomfortable corner by circumstance and not at konev particularly .     he was aware of boranova waiting for him to say something and of konev maintaining his incandescent stare .     morrison said   if i detect signals  i will detect them from all sides .  except for the capillary we have just left  we re surrounded by uncounted numbers of neurons .       but some are closer than others   said konev   and one or two would be closest of all .  can t you detect the direction from which the signals will be the strongest .  we can home in on that signal .       my receiving device isn t equipped to determine directional signals .       ah .  then americans  too  make use of devices that are equipped for specific purposes and do not prepare for emergency needs .  it is not merely the ignorant soviets who         yuri .   said boranova sternly .     konev swallowed .   i suppose you ll tell me i m confrontational again .  in that case  natalya  you tell him to think of a way of devising something that will tell him the direction from which the strongest signals are coming .       please  albert  make the attempt   said boranova .   if you fail  we shall just have to blunder our way through this collagen jungle and hope we come upon something before too long .       we re blundering onward even as we speak   put in dezhnev almost cheerfully   but i still see nothing .      still angry  morrison activated his computer and put it into the brain wave reception mode .  the screen flickered  but it was only noise    though the noise was more prominent than it had been within the capillary .     until now  he had always used leads that involved micropositioning inside a nerve .  where was he to put the leads now .  he had no nerve to put them into    or  rather  he was already inside the brain  which made the whole matter of positioning anomalous .  perhaps  though  if he let the leads  made as stiff as possible  rise in the air and spread apart like a pair of antennae  they might play the part .  at their present size  the spread would be tiny and could scarcely be useful but       he doubled and redoubled the leads and they stood up in long loops  looking very much like the insect antennae that had first given them their names .  he then focused and sharpened reception as well as he could and the flickering on the screen suddenly broke into deep narrow waves    but only for a moment .  involuntarily  he let out a cry .      what happened .   said boranova  startled .      i received something .  just a flash .  but it s gone .       try again .      morrison looked up .   listen .  all of you .  quiet .  working this thing is difficult and i manage best when i can concentrate entirely .  understood .  no noise .  nothing .       what was it you received .   said konev softly .      what .       like a flash .  you received something like a flash .  may we know what it was .       no .  i don t know what i received .  i want to listen again .   he looked behind him to the left .   natalya  i m in no position to give orders  but you are .  i am not to be disturbed by anyone  particularly by yuri .       we will all be quiet   said boranova .   proceed  albert .     yuri  not one word .      morrison looked sharply to his left  for there had been a soft touch on his hand .  kaliinin was looking at him keenly and there was a small smile on her face .  she mouthed words in an exaggerated fashion and he managed to catch the russian   pay no attention to him .  show him .  show him .      her eyes seemed to glitter .  morrison could not help but smile warmly in response .  she might be motivated entirely by a desire for vengeance against the man who had abandoned her  but he enjoyed the look of assurance and faith that was present in her eyes .      how long ago had it been since a woman had looked at him with pride and with trust in his abilities .  how many years ago had it been since brenda had lost hers .      a spasm of self pity shook him and he had to wait for a moment .     back to the device .  he tried to shut out the world  shut out his condition  think only of his computer  only of the tiny fluctuations in the electromagnetic field produced by the interchange of sodium and potassium ions across the neuronic membrane .     the screen flashed again  steadied  and resolved into a pattern of low peaks and valleys .  carefully  barely daring to touch the keys  morrison threw in an expansion directive .  the peaks and valleys spread out  the edges sliding off the screen .  on the single peak and valley left remaining  there was a fuzzy smaller wiggle .     it s recording the waves  he thought  afraid to say so  afraid even to think it with any intensity  lest the slightest physical or mental effect suffice to blank it out .     the minor wiggle    the skeptic waves  as he called them    went out of focus and back in  never quite sharpening .     morrison wasn t surprised .  he might be detecting the fields of a number of cells that didn t quite duplicate each other .  there was also the insulating effect of the plastic wall of the ship .  there was the eternal shaking of brownian motion .  there might even be the interfering charge of atom groupings outside the miniaturization field .     the wonder was that he had gotten waves at all .     slowly he made hand contact with the antennae    slid his fingers up and down  first one hand  then the other  then both in unison  then both in opposite directions .  then he bent the antennae gently  this way and that .  there were sharpening and fuzzing of the skeptic waves  but he didn t know  for certain  exactly what he was doing that resulted in the sharpening .     and then  at a certain point  the tiny waves sharpened acutely .  a little to one direction and another they fuzzed  but in one particular direction they were sharp .  he tried to keep his hands from trembling .      arkady   he said .      yes  my american magician   said dezhnev .      curve left and a little upward .  i don t want to talk too much .       i ll have to curve around the fibers .       curve slowly .  too fast and i ll lose the focus .      morrison fought to keep his eyes from flickering leftward toward kaliinin .  just one look at her face and one inevitable thought of her prettiness would be distraction enough to fuzz out the screen .  even the thought of distraction was itself distracting enough for the thought wave to flicker .     dezhnev was curving the ship in the gentle arc that was all that the offset motors would manage and slowly morrison shifted the antennae to suit .  occasionally he muttered a brief whispered direction   up and right    down    a little left .      finally he gasped   straight ahead .      it should get easier  he thought  as they got closer  but he couldn t relax until a neuron was actually in sight .  and  through the obscuring collagen thicket  that was not likely to be until they were nearly on top of it .     concentrating on only one subject was as tiring as clenching a muscle and leaving it clenched .  he had to introduce just a bit of quick variation .  he had to think of something else  but something neutral  something that would  for a while  leave his mind unclenched .  so he thought of his broken family because he had thought of them so often that the image had faded and lost effect somehow .  it was a photograph that was growing bent and gray and he could snap out of it quickly and return to the single minded contemplation of the skeptic waves .     then    without warning and overwhelmingly    another thought invaded his mind .  it was a sharp mental picture of sophia kaliinin  looking younger  prettier  and happier than she had ever seemed to him in the short time he had known her .  and with that picture came a tumbling of love and frustration and jealousy that left him weak .     he had not been consciously aware of any of these feelings  but who knew what unconscious thoughts and emotions might be hidden there in his own brain cells .  kaliinin .  did he feel that way about her .  so quickly .  or was it the abnormal tensions of this fantastic voyage into the brain that had brought about fantastic responses .     it was only then that he noticed that the screen had fuzzed out completely .  he was about to shout a warning to dezhnev to stop the motors while he concentrated and tried to recapture the waves when dezhnev s voice boomed out .      there it is  albert .  you guided us to the cell like a bloodhound .  congratulations .       also   said boranova  gazing at konev s lowering countenance   congratulations to yuri for coming up with the idea and persuading albert to make the effort .      konev s face relaxed and dezhnev said   but now  how do we get inide .         .     morrison stared at the vista ahead with interest .  what he saw was a vast ridged wall stretching up and down  right and left  as far as the ship s light made it possible to see .  the ridges were themselves broken up into domes so that  on closer inspection  the wall seemed to be a checkerboard with each square bulging outward .  there were ragged extensions jutting outward between the bulges  like thick  short  and branching ropes that gave the wall an appearance of being tattered .     morrison  with some effort  allowed for his own miniaturization and grasped the fact that the bulges were the ends of molecules  of phospholipids  he assumed  that made up the cell membrane .  he realized with some dismay just what it meant for the ship to be the size of a glucose molecule .  the cell was an enormous object  by present ship measure  it must be many kilometers across .     konev had been staring at the cell membrane also  but emerged from his thoughtful contemplation sooner than morrison did .      i m not sure   said konev   that this is a brain cell    or  at least  a neuron .       what else can it be .   said dezhnev .   we re in the brain and that s a cell .      konev made no visible attempt to smother the disgust in his expression as he said   there is more than one kind of brain cell .  the neuron is the important cell  the chief agent of the mind .  there are ten billion of them in the human brain .  there are also some ten times as many glial cells of several kinds  which serve supporting and subsidiary functions .  they are considerably smaller than the neurons .  on the basis of chance  then  it is ten to one that this is a glia .  the thought waves are in the neurons .        boranova said   we can t be guided simply by chance  yuri .  can you tell in some definitive way whether this is glia or a neuron without involving statistics .       not just by looking at it  no .  from this size  all i see is a small section of a cell membrane and in such a case one cell looks like another .  we ll have to become larger and get a more panoramic view .  i presume we can become larger now  natalya .  after all  we re through what you called the collagen jungle .       we can deminiaturize  if necessary   said boranova   but increasing size is more tedious and risky than decreasing it .  an increase means the generation of heat and must be done slowly .  is there any alternative .      konev said tartly   we might try albert s instrument again .  albert  can you tell us if the skeptic waves you can detect are coming from straight ahead or from a slightly different direction .      morrison hesitated .  before his instrument had fuzzed out at a time just before the cell had been sighted  there had been the kaliinin vision and he didn t want it back .  it was too embarrassing  too upsetting .  surely  if his mind hid and suppressed emotions  it was because they were better hidden and suppressed .     he said uncertainly   i m not sure         try it   said konev and all four soviets were now looking at morrison earnestly .     with an inward shrug  morrison put his computer into action .  after some consideration  he said   i get the waves  yuri  but not as strongly as i did on the way here .       do they get stronger in another direction .       slightly  from a more upward direction  but i must warn you again that the directional abilities of my device are very primitive .       yes  like this ship you complain about .     here is what it seems to me has happened  natalya .  coming here  we were able to detect a neuron directly above the top of a glia that lay before it .  when he saw the glia  arkady naturally steered for it and its bulk now masks the neuron and we get the thought waves more dimly .       in that case   said boranova   we must go over the glia to the neuron .       and in that case   said konev   i say again that we must deminiaturize .  at our present glucose size  the distance we must pass in moving over the glia may well prove to be a hundred or a hundred and fifty kilometers .  if we increase in length ten times  say to the size and mass of a small protein molecule  we would reduce the apparent distance to merely ten or fifteen kilometers .      kaliinin said in an abstracted voice  as though what she had to say bore no relationship to what had just been said   we will have to be our present size to get into the neuron  natalya .      and  after a short pause  as though disengaging himself from the possibility of directly answering the remark  konev said   of course .  once we reach the neuron  we readjust our size to whatever seems best .      boranova sighed and seemed lost in her own thought .     konev said with unaccustomed gentleness   natalya  we ll have to change size eventually .  we can t stay glucose size forever .       i hate to deminiaturize oftener than i must   said boranova .      but we must in this case  natalya .  we cannot spend hours cruising along a cell membrane .  and deminiaturizing tenfold at this stage involved a very low absolute energy change .      morrison said   is it that starting the deminiaturizing process might initiate an uncontrolled and explosive continuation .      boranova said   there s nothing wrong with your intuition  albert .  without knowing anything about miniaturization theory  you manage to grasp the point .  once started  it is safest to allow the deminiaturization to continue .  stopping it involves a certain risk .       so does remaining at glucose size for hours longer than we need   said konev .      true   said boranova  nodding her head .     dezhnev said   shall we put it to a vote and come to a people s democratic decision .      at this  boranova s head snapped up and her dark eyes seemed to flash .  her heavy jaws set firmly and she said   no  arkady .  it is my responsibility to make the decision and i will increase the size of the ship .   then  abandoning the air of majesty  she said   of course you can wish me well .      dezhnev said   and why not .  it would be the same as wishing all of ourselves well .      boranova bent over her controls and morrison grew quickly tired of trying to watch .  he couldn t actually see what she was doing  wouldn t understand that she was doing if he did see it  and there was the mundane fact that his neck was beginning to ache with the effort to keep it turned .  he looked forward and found konev peering at him over his shoulder .      about the skeptic wave detection   said konev .      what about the skeptic wave detection .   said morrison .      when we were making our way to this cell through the collagen jungle         yes yes  what about it .       did you get any    images .      morrison remembered that tearing vision of sophia kaliinin .  nothing like it existed in his mind now .  even when he thought of it as it had then been  it now roused no response .  whatever it was in his mind  it seemed to have been reached only under the intense stimulation of concentrated skeptic waves  and whatever it was  he was not going to describe it to konev    or to anyone else  for that matter .     he temporized   why should i have sensed any images .       because you did on occasion when you analyzed skeptic waves at normal size intensities .       you re assuming that analysis during miniaturization would produce greater intensities or possess greater image producing powers .       it s a reasonable assumption .  but did you or didn t you .  the question doesn t involve theorizing .  i m asking about an observation .  did you get any images .      and morrison sighed inwardly and said   no .      konev continued his sidewise peering  under which morrison felt himself grow a little restless and rather more than a little irate   then said softly   i did .       you did .   morrison s eyes widened in honest surprise .  then  more cautiously   what did you sense .       not much  but i thought you might have gotten it more clearly .  you were actually holding and manipulating your detector and it is probably more adapted to your brain than mine .       just what was it you got .  can you can describe it at all .       a kind of flicker that moved into and out of awareness .  it seemed to me that i saw three human figures  one larger than the others .       and what did you make of that .       well  shapirov had a daughter whom he adored and she had two children whom he also adored .  i imagine that in his coma he may have been thinking of them  or remembering them  or being under the delusion that he was seeing them .  who knows what goes on in a coma .       do you know his daughter and his grandchildren .  did you recognize them .       i was seeing them  as it were  through translucent glass in the twilight .  it was all i could do to sense three figures .   he sounded disappointed .   i had hoped you would see it more clearly .      morrison  thinking hard  said   i neither saw  nor sensed  anything like that .      konev said   of course  things should be sharper once we are inside a neuron .  it is not images we must sense  in any case .  we want to hear words .       i ve never heard words   said morrison  shaking his head .      of course not   said konev   since you worked with animals who don t use words .       true   said morrison .   just the same  i once managed to run some tests on a human being  though i never reported it .  i sensed no words then or images either .      konev shrugged it off .     morrison said   you know  under the circumstances  it might be natural for shapirov s mind to be full of family    if we accept your interpretation of what you thought you sensed .  what would the chances be that he would be thinking of some esoteric extension of miniaturization mathematics .       he was a physicist .  even his family came second to that .  if we can sense words out of those skeptic waves  they ll be words dealing with physics .       you think that  do you .       i am positive .      the two fell quiet and for a few minutes there was no sound in the ship .  then boranova said   i ve deminiaturized the ship to protein size and i have brought the process to a halt .      a moment passed and then dezhnev  with an unaccustomed tightness to his throaty voice  said   are things all right  natasha .      boranova said   the mere fact that you can ask the question  arkady  is an answer in the positive .  deminiaturization has stopped without incident .      she smiled  but there was a definite trace of perspiration glistening at her hairline .        .     the surface of the glial cell still stretched out as far as the eye could see into the dimness beyond the reach of the ship s light  but it had changed in character .  the domes and ridges had faded out into a fine texture .  the ropes that had extended from between the domes had become threads nearly impossible to see as the ship sped along the surface .     morrison s attention was  for the most part  on his computer  as he watched to see that the skeptic waves did not decline in intensity  but  periodically  he could not help but drift away from that and gaze at the panorama outside .     occasionally  there would emerge from the surface of the cell the typical dendritic processes of a nerve cell    even one that was merely a subsidiary glial cell .  they branched and sub branched like a tree in winter  growing out of the cell membrane .     even at the new and larger size of the ship  the dendrites were large when they emerged from the cell .  they were like tree trunks  which  however  narrowed rapidly and were clearly flexible .  lacking the rigidity of the cartilage fibers  they swayed in the eddies set up by the ship s progress through the extracellular fluid .  they swayed  indeed  at the ship s approach and dezhnev rarely had to do anything to avoid them .  they would bend out of line and the ship would pass them safely .     collagen fibers were fewer in the immediate neighborhood of the cell and  thanks to the larger size of the ship  were much thinner and more fragile .  on one occasion  dezhnev either did not see one looming directly ahead of the ship or did not care that it was .  the ship brushed past it in a way that brought it just outside morrison s seat .  he flinched at the grating collision  but the ship was in no way damaged .  it was the collagen fiber that bent  then snapped and dangled free .  morrison s head turned and his eyes followed the broken fiber for the second or so that it remained in view before floating away .     boranova must have seen it  too  and watched morrison s reaction  for she said   there s no reason for concern .  there are trillions of those fibers scattered through the brain  so that one more or less doesn t matter .  besides  they heal    even in a brain as badly damaged as poor shapirov s .       i suppose so   said morrison   yet i can t help but think we are crashing without any right through an infinitely delicate mechanism not meant for technological invasion .       i appreciate your feeling   said boranova   but hardly anything in the world seems to have been brought into being by geological and biological processes with any apparent pre vision of human interference .  humanity does a great deal of wrong to earth and to life  some of it wittingly .     incidentally  i m thirsty .  are you .       definitely   said morrison .      you ll find a cup in the little recess under your right armrest .  pass it back .      she distributed water to all five  saying matter of factly   there s no shortage of water  so if you want seconds  say so .      dezhnev looked at his cup distastefully  while keeping one hand on the controls .  he sniffed at it and said   my father used to say   there is no drink like pure water  provided one realizes that it is alcohol that is the purifying agent .        yes  arkady   said boranova .   i am quite sure your father purified his water frequently  but here on the ship  with your hands on the controls  you will have your water unpurified .       we must all go through privations now and then   said dezhnev  who then downed his water and made a face .     it might have been the taste of the water that caused kaliinin to fumble between her legs .  it took a moment for morrison to realize that it was her turn to urinate and he turned his head toward the window and waited to see if another collagen fiber might go flying .     boranova said   i suppose  strictly speaking  it s lunchtime  but we can do without .  still         still what .   asked dezhnev .   a good plate of piping hot borscht with sour cream .      boranova said   what i have smuggled in against regulations are bits of chocolate    high calorie  zero fiber .      kaliinin  who had disposed of her small damp paper towel and was shaking her hands to dry them  said   it will rot our teeth .       not immediately   said boranova   and you can rinse your mouth with a little water to reduce the sugar residue .  who wants one .      four hands went up  kaliinin s not the last .  morrison welcomed his gladly .  he was fond of chocolate in any case and sucked at it to make it last longer .  the taste reminded him poignantly of his boyhood in the outskirts of muncie .     the chocolate was gone when konev said to morrison in a low voice   have you sensed anything while we ve been skimming past the glial cell .       no   said morrison .   he hadn t .    have you .       i thought i did .  the phrase  green fields  crossed my mind .      morrison could not prevent himself from saying  hmm  and for a while remained lost in thought .      well .   said konev .     morrison shrugged .   phrases go through one s mind all the time .  you hear something out of the corner of your ear  so to speak  and sometime later it penetrates your consciousness  or some stream of consciousness thoughts invade your mind and one phrase surfaces  or you can have an auditory hallucination of some sort .       it crossed my mind when i was looking at your instrument and concentrating .       you wanted to be aware of something  i suppose  and something promptly obliged by flitting through your mind in response .  you get the same effect in dreams .       no .  this was real .       how can you tell  yuri .     i didn t sense any such thing .  did anyone else sense it  do you suppose .       they wouldn t .  no one else was concentrating on your machine .  perhaps no one else in the ship had a brain sufficiently like yours to sense on your wavelength  so to speak .       you re just guessing .  besides  what does the phrase mean .       green fields .  shapirov had a house out in the country .  he would remember the green fields .       he might have merely supplied the image .  you would supply the words .      konev frowned  paused a moment  then said in a clearly hostile manner   why are you so opposed to the possibility of getting a message .      morrison allowed himself to be equally hostile .   because i ve been burned by reporting such sense perceptions .  i ve been ridiculed long enough and i have become cautious .  an image of a woman and two children doesn t tell us anything .  neither does a phrase like  green fields .   if you report it  how can you possibly tell it from a self generated image or phrase .  now listen  yuri  a hint  to be useful  must  however vaguely and indirectly  tie in with the quantum relativity relationship .  that we can report .  anything less than that is not compelling  it won t force belief .  it will only succeed in hurting us .  i speak from experience .      konev said   what  then  if you succeed in hearing something vital  something that bears on our project .  will you perhaps keep it to yourself .       why should i .  if i sense something in physics relating to miniaturization  i would lack the background to understand it and keeping it to myself would get me nowhere .  if some useful result is shared between us  this computer remains my machine and it is activated by my theory .  i am the one who will get the major share of the credit .  i won t keep it to myself  yuri .  both my self interest and my honor as a scientist will keep me from doing that .     and what about you .       of course i ll share whatever i sense .  i have been doing so just now .       i don t mean  green fields .   that is nonsense .  suppose you sense something very significant and i don t .  might it not occur to you that the knowledge would be a state secret  as miniaturization itself is .  would you then tell me that knowledge and risk the wrath of your central coordinating committee .      they had been speaking in whispers  heads together  but boranova s ears picked up the key word .   politics  gentlemen .   she asked frostily .     konev said   we re discussing the possible uses of albert s instrument  natalya .  if i learn something of importance from shapirov s skeptic waves and albert does not  he thinks i will keep it from him under the excuse that it is a state secret .      boranova said   it well may be .      konev said mildly   we need albert s cooperation .  it is his machine and his program and i am sure he knows how to work it at less than perfect efficiency .  if he is not completely assured of our honesty and goodwill  he may arrange to have us sense nothing .  i am willing to share anything that i sense if he will do the same .       the committee may disapprove  as albert himself pointed out   said boranova .      let it .  i don t concern myself with it   said konev .      i ll prove i love you  yuri   interposed dezhnev with a chuckle .   i won t quote you .      kaliinin said   natalya  i agree that we should be honest with albert  since we must ask him to be honest with us .  using his own device with which he has experience  he is far more likely to come up with something useful than we are .  a policy of quid pro quo is likely to be far more to our advantage than to his .     isn t that so  albert .      morrison nodded .   i ve been thinking precisely that and would have mentioned it if it looked as though you were going to tell me that it was against government policy to be honest with me .      boranova said   well  let us await events .   the tension died down .     morrison remained busy with his own thoughts  watching his machine only in abstraction .     and then dezhnev said   there s another cell just ahead    a kilometer or two .  it looks as though it might be larger than the one we ve been passing .  is that a neuron  yuri .      konev  who seemed to have been in a brown study of his own  snapped to attention .   albert  what does your machine say .  is that a neuron .      morrison was already handling his device .   it must be   he said .   i ve never seen the skeptic waves this sharp .       good .   said dezhnev .   now what .         .     kaliinin looked thoughtfully at the cell surface below .  she said   natalya  we ll have to miniaturize to glucose size again .  arkady  get us in among the dendrites so that we can get down to the surface of the cell body .      morrison watched the surface also .  the dendrites were much more elaborate than those on the glia .  the nearest one branched and branched again until it looked like a fuzzy frond vanishing beyond the reach of ship s light .  others  farther away  were fuzzier and smaller .     morrison suspected that the fuzziness was at least partly the result of brownian motion .  surely there couldn t be much of that  however .  probably each final strand of the branchings    each twig    met a similar twig or some neighboring neuron to form that intimate near touch called a synapse .  the wavering of the twig would not be strong enough to break the contact or the brain couldn t do its work .     dezhnev had the ship approach the surface of the cell body  slowly slithering past the nearest dendrite  he was learning to handle the unbalance of the individual engines with a certain finesse  morrison thought     and  as he did so  it seemed to morrison that the surface of the neuron was changing character .     of course  it had to  for the ship was miniaturizing again .  the ridges in the cell surface were becoming more prominent and were dividing into domes .  between the phospholipid domes the hairs were becoming ropier .  receptors  thought morrison .  each one of them was designed to link on to a particular molecule that would be useful to the neuron and certainly glucose would he the most useful of those .     the downward change was considerably more rapid than the upward change .  absorbing energy was simple  while the energy release of deminiaturization was dangerous .  morrison understood that well by now .     kaliinin said  frowning in concern   i don t know which receptors are for glucose  but a great many of them must be .  skim across them slowly  arkady    very slowly .  if we re caught  i don t want to tear loose    or to tear them loose  either .       no problem  little sophie   said dezhnev .   if i shut off the motors  the ship stops at once .  it can t push through the giant atoms that surround us at all easily .  too viscous .  so i just give it a touch of energy  enough to shoulder our way past the molecules of water  and we ll tiptoe across the receptors .        through the tulips    said morrison  looking at konev .      what .   said konev  looking both annoyed and puzzled .      it s a phrase that went through my head .  there s an old show tune called  tip toe through the tulips with me   in english  the words are         what nonsense are you speaking .   snapped konev .      i m trying to point out that whenever someone says  tiptoe  to me  i automatically hear the phrase  through the tulips  in my mind .  if i happen to be concentrating on my computer when someone says  tiptoe   i will still hear the phrase in my mind and it will not mean that i am getting it from the skeptic waves on the computer .  do you take my meaning .       you re talking emptily   said konev .   leave me alone .      but he looked shaken  morrison thought .  he had taken the meaning .     they were now moving parallel to the surface of the neuron .  the receptors were moving gently and morrison realized that he couldn t tell which were empty and which had attached themselves to some of the molecules moving through the extracellular fluid with them .     he tried to concentrate on those molecules .  there seemed to be glitterings in the fluid which might have been the light of the ship s beacon reflected from molecules  but none of it showed up well .  even the surface of the cell membrane wasn t actually clear if you looked at it directly .  it was more the surrealistic impression of a surface than an actual one    too few photons were being reflected and too few were reaching them on their small scale .     still  by the glitter  he could make out a kind of grittiness in the fluid they were passing through  water molecules  surely  and among them  now and then  something wormy twisting  turning  closing up  then opening again .  the immediate neighborhood of the ship was  of course  within the miniaturization field  so that atoms and molecules of the standard size world were constantly shrinking as they entered    and expanding again as they left .  the number of atoms doing so must be enormous but the energy change that resulted  even totaled over that number  were small enough so that it did not drain the ship perceptibly  or bring about spontaneous deminiaturization  or do any damage .     or  at least  it seemed to do no damage .     morrison tried not to think about it .     boranova said   i don t mean to question your ability  sophia  but please check and make sure the ship has the electrical pattern of glucose .       i assure you it does   said kaliinin .     and as though to give notice that that was indeed so  the ship seemed to twist in mid fluid  judging by the sudden shift in view through the walls .     under ordinary conditions  such a twist would have thrown every person on the ship hard against the wall or the seat arm .  mass and inertia  however  were at virtually zero and there was only a faint swaying  hardly distinguishable from that which they associated with brownian motion .     kaliinin said   we ve attached ourselves to a glucose receptor .       good   said dezhnev .   i ve turned off the motor .  now what do we do .       nothing   said kaliinin .   we let the cell do its work and we wait .      the receptor did not actually make contact with the ship .  this was good  for had it come any closer it would have entered the miniaturization field and its tip would have collapsed .  as it was  there was a close meeting of electrical fields only  negative to positive and positive to negative .  the attractions were not the full attractions but the lesser ones that resembled hydrogen bonds .  it was enough to hold  but weak enough to allow the ship to pull away somewhat  as though it were connected to the receptor by rubber bands rather than by grappling hooks .     the receptor stretched the length of the ship and was irregular in outline  as though it were embracing a pattern of bulges along the plastic hull .  the hull was smooth and featureless to the eye  of course  but morrison was quite certain that there was an electric field that bulged in just the locations where the hydroxyl groups would be in the glucopyranose structure  the bulges taking on just the shapes they would in the natural molecule .     morrison looked out again .  the receptor virtually blanked out vision on the side of the ship along which it lay .  if he looked beyond the receptor  however  he could see a farther stretch of the neuron s surface  seemingly without end  for it vanished beyond the reach of the ship s light .     the neuronic surface seemed to be heaving slightly and he could see greater detail .  among the regular domes of the rank and file of phospholipid molecules  he caught occasional glimpses of an irregular mass  which he guessed to be a protein molecule that ran through the thickness of the cell membrane .  it was to these molecules that the receptors were attached  which did not surprise morrison .  he knew that the receptors must be peptides    chains of amino acids .  they were part of the thread of a protein backbone  sticking outward  each different receptor made up of different amino acids in a specific order so designed as to possess an electric field pattern matching  in opposing attractions and physical shape  that of the molecule it was designed to pick up .     then  even as he watched  it seemed to him that the receptors were moving toward him .  he could see them now in greater numbers and could also see that those numbers were still increasing .  the receptors and the protein molecules to which they were attached seemed to be swimming through the phospholipid molecules  with a film of cholesterol molecules underneath  morrison knew   which opened before and closed behind .      something s happening   said morrison as he felt the ship s own motion through the tiny drag of inertia that remained to them at their thoroughly negligible mass .        .     kone said   the surface is gathering us in .      dezhnev nodded .   it looks like its doing this .   he held up his thick and callused hand  cupping it .      exactly   said konev .   it will invaginate  make a deeper and deeper cup  narrowing the neck and finally closing it  and we will be inside the cell .   he seemed quite calm about it .     so was morrison .  they wanted to be inside the cell and this was the way it was done .     the receptors continued coming together  alongside each one of them some molecule    some real molecule    and in among them the feigning molecule of the ship .  the cell s surface  like dezhnev s cupped hand  closed upon them entirely and drew them in .      now what .   said dezhnev .      we re in a vesicle inside the cell   said kaliinin .   it will grow more acid and the receptor will then detach itself from us .  it and all the receptors will then return to the cell membrane .       and we .   persisted dezhnev .      since we are recognized by our electric field as a glucose molecule   said kaliinin   the cell will try to metabolize us    break us up into smaller fragments and extract energy from us .      even as she spoke  the peptide receptor fell away  uncoiling .      is that a good idea  having it metabolize us .   asked dezhnev .      it won t   said morrison .   we ll be attached to an appropriate enzyme molecule which will find that we don t react as expected .  we won t take on a phosphate group  so it will be helpless and will probably release us .  we re not really a glucose molecule .       but if the enzyme molecule releases us  won t another enzyme molecule of the same type attach itself to us and try again    and so on indefinitely .       now that you mention it   said morrison  rubbing his chin and absently noticing the bristles grown since his morning shave   it may be that the first molecules won t let us go  i suppose  if we won t do the expected .       a fine situation   said dezhnev indignantly  slipping into his local dialect of russian  as he always seemed to do when excited  and which morrison always had a bit of difficulty in following .   the best we can expect is that an enzyme molecule either holds us forever all by himself or holds us forever in a relay race as we pass from one enzyme to another indefinitely .     my father used to say   to be saved from the jaws of a wolf by a hungry bear is no great cause for gratitude .        please notice   said kaliinin   that no enzyme molecule has attached itself to us .       why is that .   asked morrison  who had  indeed  noticed that .      because of a slight change in electric charge pattern .  we had to mimic a glucose molecule to get into the cell  but once in  we don t have to be one anymore .  in fact  we must mimic something else .      boranova leaned forward .   won t any molecule we mimic be liable to metabolic change  sophia .       actually  no  natalya   said kaliinin .   glucose    or any other simple sugar in the body    belongs to a certain molecular configuration  so that we call it d glucose .  i ve simply altered the pattern to its mirror image .  we have become l glucose and there isn t an enzyme that will touch us now  any more than any of us are likely to put a right shoe on a left foot .     now we can move about freely .      the vesicle which had formed on their introduction to the cellular interior had broken up and morrison gave up as hopeless any attempt to follow what was going on .  fragments around him were enveloped by much larger enzyme molecules that seemed to embrace them and then relax .  presumably  an altered victim of the enzymatic squeeze was set free to be embraced again by another enzyme .     it was all happening at once and  morrison knew  this was only the anaerobic portion of the process  in which no molecular oxygen was used .   it would end by breaking up the glucose molecule  with its six carbon atoms  into two three carbon fragments .     a little energy would be produced in this fashion and the fragments would be shunted to the mitochondria for the completion of the process with the use of oxygen  a process in which the universal energy transfer molecule  adenosine triphosphate  or atp  for short  would be invested in order to get things started and  in the end  be produced once more in quantities substantially greater than the investment .     morrison felt the urge to drop everything and to find a way into a mitochondrion  the small energy factory of the cell .  after all  the fine details of mitochondrial processes had still not been worked out    but then he pulled away almost angrily at the thought .  the skeptic waves came first .  he shouted that to himself  as though trying to force a realization of priorities onto an overly curious brain that was threatening to diffuse its interests .     apparently  the same thought occurred to konev  for he said   we re finally inside the neuron  albert .  let s not be tourists .  what do you find in the way of skeptic waves now .        chapter       axon    those who say  a penny for your thoughts  are usually being overgenerous .        dezhnev senior       .     morrison bristled at konev s order .   it had definitely been that .      he indicated his resentment by refusing to respond at all for a while .  he continued to stare out into the interior of the neuron and could distinguish nothing he recognized .  he could see fibers  convoluted plates  hulks of uncertain size and of no clear shape .  what s more  he had a strong feeling that there was a skeletal presence in the cell that held the larger objects    the organelles    in place  but that the ship was slipping past it all too quickly  as though it were in a river racing downstream .  the feeling of motion was far stronger here than in the bloodstream  for though there were small objects  debris .   that moved along with them  there were larger objects that apparently remained in place and that they passed rapidly .     finally morrison said   look  yuri  we re moving so quickly that the motion is likely to distort the skeptic waves badly .      konev snarled   are you mad .  we re not moving quickly at all .  we re just drifting with the intracellular stream that serves to make certain that the small molecules are all made available to the organelle structure of the cell .  the movement is very slow on the normal scale  it seems fast only on our miniaturized scale .  do i have to teach you cellular physiology .      morrison bit his lips .  of course .  he had again forgotten how miniaturization distorted his perception .  and again konev was completely right .      it might be better  though   said morrison  fighting for self respect   if we changed back to d glucose and allowed an enzyme to snatch us up .  the combined size would slow us down and make it easier to pick up the waves .       we don t have to slow down .  the nerve impulse travels at a minimum of two meters per second in real velocity and in apparent velocity at our size that s about seventy times the real speed of light .  as compared with that  our speed  however great it seems  is trivial .  even if we are moving at the apparent speed of a rocket ship  to the nerve impulse we seem virtually motionless .      morrison lifted his arm in surrender and felt furious with konev .  there was such a thing as being too right .  he cast a quick sidewise glance at kaliinin  with the uncomfortable feeling that she would be showing her contempt .  she met his glance soberly and with no trace of a sneer .  in fact  her shoulders lifted slightly as though to say  morrison imagined    what do you expect of a savage .      boranova  morrison glanced over his left shoulder  seemed oblivious to the exchange .  she was busy with her instrument and morrison wondered what she could be so intent on  considering that the ship s engines were off and they were merely drifting with the current .     as for dezhnev    with the engines off    he was the one crew member who  in truth  had nothing to do at the moment  except to keep half an eye at the material up ahead in case of an unexpected emergency  .     he said   come  albert  study the skeptic waves and give us some answers .  then we can leave this place .  it s extremely exciting being inside a cell for those who like it  but already i am quite certain i have seen enough .  my father used to say   the most exciting part of any trip is reaching home again .       boranova said   arkady         yes  natasha .       save a few words for tomorrow .   morrison noticed the trace of a smile on her lips .      certainly  natasha .  i suspect an attempt at sarcasm  but i shall do as you say .   and though he snapped his mouth shut with an exaggerated click of his teeth  he began to hum very quietly to himself  a tune in the minor mode .     morrison felt a little astonished .  they had been in the ship now for a little less than five hours    but it felt the equivalent number of days  perhaps years .  yet  unlike arkady and despite his earlier feelings of terror  he was not ready to leave shapirov s body .  he felt a strong urge to explore the cell and his thoughts rested on the possibility .     kaliinin must have been thinking along similar lines  for she said in a soft  introspective tone   what a shame to be the first people inside the most complex of all living cells and to do nothing at all about investigating it properly .       that is exactly     began morrison  then thought better of it and let the words dangle .     konev swung his arm as though he were driving off hordes of insects .   i can t understand this .  we are in the cell and we came here for a specific purpose .  albert  focus on the skeptic waves .       i am doing so   said morrison sharply .   in fact  i have done so .     look .      konev twisted his head  then unclasped himself  so that he could turn around and peer over the back of his seat .  he stared at morrison s small screen and said   the waves seem sharper .       they are sharper .  they re more intense and they show finer oscillations than i ve ever seen .  come to think of it  i wonder how fine they can get .  sooner or later  an oscillation  if fine enough  will represent the wobbling of a single electron    and then we have to take into account the uncertainty principle .       you forget .  we re miniaturized and planck s constant is nine orders of magnitude smaller for us than it is under standard conditions .       you forget   protested morrison  eager to catch the other in a misstep this time   that the waves are reduced by that much before they reach us .  those waves are exactly where they should be relative to the uncertainty principle  therefore .      konev hesitated a bare moment .   it doesn t matter .  we re looking at something now and there s no perceptible uncertainty blurring .  what does it mean .       it supports my theory   said morrison .   this is exactly what i ought to see inside a cell if my interpretation of skeptic wave activity is correct         that s not what i mean .  we began with the assumption that your theory was correct .  now it s no longer an assumption  it s a demonstrated fact  and i congratulate you .  but what does it mean .  what do those skeptic waves show shapirov to be thinking .      morrison shook his head .   i have no data    zero data    on the correlation of such waves and specific thoughts .  it would take years to gather such a correlation  if it could be done at all .       but perhaps the skeptic waves  when this clear and intense  produce an inductive effect on your brain .  are you getting any of your famous images .      morrison thought for a moment  then shook his head   none .      from behind him came a quiet voice   i m getting something  albert .      morrison turned .   you  natalya .       yes  it s odd    but i am .      konev demanded   what are you getting  natalya .      boranova hesitated  concentrating .   curiosity .  well  it s not exactly an image of anything .  just an impression .  i feel curiosity .       and so you might   said morrison .   it needs no impression from outside to produce such a feeling under these circumstances .       no no .  i know what my own thoughts and impressions are like .  this is imposed from outside .      morrison said   do you feel it right now .       yes .  it comes and goes a little  but i feel it right now .       all right .  what about now .      boranova looked surprised .   it stopped suddenly .     did you turn off your machine .       i turned it down .  now  you tell me when you feel the sensation and when you don t .   he turned to look at kaliinin  intending to tell her to say or do nothing that would indicate when he turned the machine down or up  but she was staring out at the cell  obviously lost in the marvel of watching the interior of a neuron .  he wondered if  at the moment  she heard    or cared    what was going on .     he turned away and said   natalya  close your eyes and concentrate .  just say  on  when you get the sensation and  off  when you don t .      for several minutes  she complied with his suggestion .     morrison said to konev   does the machine make a noise when it is turned down or up .  is there anything you can hear or sense .      konev shook his head .   i m not aware of anything .       then there s no mistake .  she s getting the sensation only when the machine is on .      dezhnev  who  unlike kaliinin  had followed everything  said .   but why .   his eyes narrowed .   the brain waves are there whether your machine detects them or not .  she should get the feeling of curiosity all the time .       no no   said morrison .   my device filters out all the components but the actual skeptic waves .  without the machine  she just gets a confused mass of sensations  responses  correlations  and miscellany of all kinds .  with the machine  she gets only the skeptic waves  which further demonstrates the usefulness of my theory .       i don t get anything at all   said dezhnev  frowning .   doesn t that destroy your theory .      morrison shrugged .   brains are complicated mechanisms .  natalya gets it .  you don t .  for that matter  neither do i .  maybe this particular skeptic wave component fits something in natalya s brain  not in ours .  i m not going to be able to explain everything at once .     do you get anything  konev .       no   he answered  as discontented as dezhnev had been .   yet i obtained impressions when we were outside the neuron .      morrison shook his head and said nothing .     konev burst out   can t you get anything but just a vague feeling of curiosity  natalya .      boranova   no  yuri  i can t .  not at this moment .  but you remember pyotr shapirov .  he was curious about everything .       i remember  but that doesn t help .  albert  in what direction are we moving .      albert said   downstream .  it s the only direction in which we can move .       no no .   then  in sudden anger   is that a joke .  are you trying to be funny .      morrison said   not at all .  you asked in what direction we were going .  what other answer could i have given you .  surely the compass directions have no meaning here .      konev said   all right .  sorry .  the stream goes this way here .  on the other side of the cell  it goes the other way .  it s a circulation .  but the nerve impulse goes one way only  from the dendrites to the axon .  are we on the side of the cell that s taking us in the same direction as the nerve impulse or in the other direction .       does it matter .   said morrison .      i think it does .  can your device tell you in which direction the impulse is traveling .       yes  certainly .  there should be a slight shift in the shape of the waves  depending on whether they are meeting the device head on or from the rear .       and .       and we re moving in the direction of the impulse .       good .  a stroke of luck .  we re heading for the axon  then .       so it would seem .      boranova said   and if we are heading for the axon .      konev said   natalya  think .  the skeptic waves travel along the surface of the cell .  the cell here is wide and relatively large .  the skeptic waves spread out over a large surface and are weakened in intensity .  as the cell approaches the axon  it narrows .  the axon itself is long  a very long tube compared to the cell    and very narrow .  the waves must concentrate enormously as they race along that tube and they must grow more intense .  what s more  the axon is insulated by a thick myelin sheath  so that the wave energy will not be lost to the outside  but will be kept tightly within the axon .      boranova said   you think  then  that we can receive more effectively in the axon .       much more effectively .  if you can detect curiosity now  it should be overwhelming in the axon .  and you might be able to detect what shapirov is curious about .       it may turn out to be totally unimportant   said morrison thoughtfully .   what if he s curious about why he should be lying there and not moving .       no   said konev sharply   that would not interest him .  i knew shapirov well .  you didn t .      morrison nodded .   that s true enough .       all his waking time was consumed with the miniaturization process   said konev .   all his dreams  too  i suspect .  and toward the end  in the last few weeks before the    the accident took place  he was working  thinking  dreaming of the connection between quantum and relativity  thinking of how to make miniaturization and deminiaturization energy free and stable .       surely   said morrison   if that were the case  he must have given some hints as to some of the details of his thinking .       no  he was a child in some ways .  we knew what he was thinking of  but not whether he was making progress or in what direction .  what he loved to do was to present it to us whole  complete .     remember  natalya  how he loved to do that .  he did that with miniaturization itself .  when he finally wrote his paper    it was a young book        morrison said casually   where was it published .      konev sneered .   you know it wasn t published .  it had a limited circulation to those who had to know .  it s nowhere where you re likely ever to see it .      boranova said   yuri  don t be needlessly insulting .  albert is a fellow crew member and a guest .  he is not to be treated as a spy .      konev said   if you say so  natalya .  nevertheless  if shapirov is curious  so intensely curious that natalya gets that message  it can be only about the quantum relativity connection .  if we can get some details about that  any details at all  we ll have a starting point and can continue .       and you think we ll get those details in the axon .       yes  i m sure of it .   konev clenched both fists as though preparing to get a stranglehold on the facts .     morrison looked away .  he was not sure of it .  increasingly  it was beginning to look to him as though matters were moving in another direction altogether and that that was just as well      he tried not to show it  but he was as excited as konev was .        .     dim objects to either side loomed up ahead  drifted to one side  left or right  and fell behind .  ribosomes .  golgi apparatus .  fibrils of one sort or another .  morrison could not tell .  from the vantage point of small molecule size  nothing  not even the sharpest  most familiar intracellular object  would look familiar  let alone recognizable .     they were racing through a strange land of indefiniteness and morrison could not  no matter how he tried  picture his surroundings as those with which he was familiar from electron micrography .     he wondered if  somewhere beyond where the light of the ship s beam extended  there would be the endless volume of the cell s nucleus .  imagine being within submicroscopic distance of it and yet never seeing it .     he concentrated on the immediate surroundings .  it seemed to him  once again  that he ought to make out the water molecules that made up    percent of all the molecules in the cell  that huge percentage being the direct consequence of the fact that they were just about the smallest molecules there .     he could not be sure .  focus his eyes though he did and as tightly as he could  what he saw was only a faint glitter    a photon  perhaps  bouncing off such a molecule and flashing back toward his eye .  at best  he would only see one or two from any given water molecule .     he was suddenly aware of kaliinin s head  bending toward his .  her hair brushed his face and he noticed  as he had once or twice before  the fresh scent of her shampoo .     she said   this is terrible  albert .      her breath was a little strong and morrison flinched before he could stop himself .     she noticed  for her fingers came up sharply  covering her mouth  and she mumbled   i m sorry .      morrison shook his head slightly   my own breath isn t exactly a bed of roses .     tension  nothing much to eat .  a drink of water might help  natalya .      one drink set off everybody  of course  in a chain reaction .     kaliinin fingered a small white pellet .   peppermint drop .      morrison held out his hand and smiled .   is it permitted .      kaliinin s eye flickered back toward boranova and she gave a who cares shrug .  having passed the drop to morrison  sophia popped another in her mouth .     then she said again   this is terrible  albert .       what is  sophia .       how can we pass through this cell without examining it in detail .       we have a specific mission .       yes  but no one may be back within a brain cell for many years .  perhaps  never .  when  in the future  someone will read that this ship and this crew merely raced through  looking neither to right or left  what barbarians they will think we must have been .      she was whispering very softly and their heads were bent close together .  morrison found himself rather enjoying it .     had he grown so calloused to the threat of the situation    the constant skirting along the edge of the abyss of spontaneous deminiaturization  the possibility of split second death at any moment    that he could take joy from the trivial fact that his lips were so close to the pretty face of a woman .     well  why quarrel with that .  let the nearness anesthetize him  so that he might for a moment forget .     morrison remembered the sharp image he had had so brief a time before of a happy  smiling  beautiful girl .  he had not recognized the thought as his own  so unexpectedly had it come out of nowhere  and it didn t return  even now  but he remembered it distinctly and the memory squeezed at his heart with a warm feeling .     he had the momentary impulse to kiss her lightly  just a touch upon the cheekbone with his lips    and fought it down .  if she decided to take it amiss  he would feel like an incredible fool .     morrison said gently   the people of the future will know we have a mission .  they will understand .       i wonder   sophia said  then paused and sent a quick and almost fearful look in the direction of konev  who as always sat stiff and detached at ally sign of speech or even motion from kaliinin .     she turned to her computer  switched it to the word processor mode  and tapped out in rapid russian  yuri is a fanatic who sacrifices everything to his mania .  there is no chance of reading thoughts  but he persuades everyone .  she blanked it  then tapped out  we are his victims and blanked it at once .     for  we   read  i   thought morrison sadly .  he looked at his own instrument hesitantly .  it seemed to him that the thought waves  which he had dimmed to low  were growing more intense .  morrison looked out as though he might be able to tell just how near the axon they now were  but  of course  there was no way of knowing .     he blanked the radiation  switched to word processing  and printed out in roman lettered russian  he  too  is his victim .     kaliinin at once printed savagely  no .  i don t believe people are their own victims .     morrison thought sadly of his one time wife  his two children  his own inability to present his theory persuasively  or  alternatively  to walk away from it  and tapped out  i believe we are each of us more a victim of ourselves than of anyone else and returned it quickly to the thoughtwave mode .     he sucked in his breath sharply .  the waves on his screen had risen high in intensity despite the fact that the device was still at low .     morrison opened his mouth to comment on the fact  but dezhnev made that unnecessary .   yuri   he said   the cell membrane is curving in and we re curving in with it .      that would account for it  thought morrison .  the cell was narrowing in toward the axon and the skeptic waves were being enormously concentrated .  his device  having filtered out everything else  would radiate the wave function of the skeptic waves throughout the interior of the ship .  and with what results .     konev said with delight   we ll see what happens now .  albert  keep your machine working at top intensity .      boranova said   i hope that whatever happens gives us our answer or at least a start to our answer .  i have grown tired waiting .       i don t blame you   said dezhnev .   as my father used to say   the longer it takes to get to a point  the blunter it turns out to be .       it seemed to morrison that every line of konev s stiff body now betokened excitement and expectant triumph    but morrison did not join in that expectation .        .     morrison stared outward .  they were well into the axon now and being carried along it by the fluid stream within the cell .     in the real world  the axon was an excessively thin fiber  but in the microminiaturized world of the ship  it might be the equivalent of a hundred kilometers across .  as for its length  it was much  much longer than the cell itself .  going from one end to the other of the axon might very well be the equivalent of a trip from the earth to the moon and back a couple of dozen times over .  on the other hand  their apparent speed on the microminiaturized scale must seem  to themselves  to be a respectable faction of the speed of light .     there was no indication of that incredibly rapid speed  however .  the ship was moving with the current and there was far less in the way of macromolecules or organelles in the axon than there had been in the cell body .  if there were structural fibers withstanding the current and remaining motionless with respect to the cell membrane  the current swept them past those too rapidly for them to be visible  even if a sizable number of photons were reflected from them    which  of course  they were not .     so he gave up .  there was nothing to look at outside .     he ought  in any case  to be looking at his screen .  the skeptic waves were becoming even more intense  he could see .  it had grown difficult to wipe out the nonskeptic material .  it was so strong that it flooded the computer s receiving capacity .     what s more  the tight  elaborate vibration of the skeptic waves had become a series of irregular spikes .  even at full expansion  it was clear he wasn t getting all the detail that existed .  morrison had a clear vision of the necessity of a laser printout clear enough to be placed under a microscope .     konev had unclasped himself and had half lifted himself over the back of his seat so that he might stare at the screen .     he said   i haven t seen it like that before .      morrison replied   nor have i and i have been studying skeptic waves for nearly twenty years .  nothing like this .       i was right  then  about the axon .       absolutely  yuri .  the waves have concentrated themselves beautifully .       and the meaning  then .      morrison spread out his hands helplessly .   there you have me .  since i have never seen anything like this  i obviously can t interpret it .       no no   said konev impatiently .   you keep concentrating on the screen and i keep thinking about induction .  our own minds are the true receptors    by way of your machine .  what do you receive .  images .  words .       nothing   said morrison .      that s impossible .       are you getting anything .       it s your machine .  adjusted to you .       you ve had images before  yuri .      dezhnev s voice broke in dryly   my father used to say   if you want to hear  you must begin by listening .       boranova said   dezhnev senior is correct .  we can receive nothing if we fill our minds with contention and shouts .      konev drew a deep breath and said with a softness that was most uncharacteristic of him   very well  then  let us concentrate .      an unnatural quiet fell over the ship s crew .     then kaliinin said  breaking the silence rather timidly   there is no time .       no time for what  sophia   said boranova .      i mean that s the phrase i sensed   there is no time .       morrison said   are you saying that you received it from shapirov s skeptic waves .       i don t know .  is that possible .      boranova said   a moment before i had the same thought .  it occurred to me that a better way of tackling the problem might be to study the recorded skeptic waves on the screen and to wait for sudden changes .  it might be the change of pattern rather than the pattern itself that would produce an image .  but then i thought that the waiting might be an enormously long drawn out affair and for that we lacked the time .       in other words   said morrison   you thought   there is no time .       yes   said boranova   but it was my own thought .       how can you know  natalya .   said morrison .      i know my own thoughts .       you also know your own dreams  but sometimes dreams arise out of external stimuli .  suppose you receive the thought  there is no time .   because you are not accustomed to receiving thoughts  you quickly build up a line of free association that makes it reasonable for you to feel that you have had the thought yourself .       that may be so  but how does one tell  albert .       i m not sure  but sophia apparently sensed the same phrase and we might ask if she were thinking something independently that would give rise to the phrase as a matter of course .       no  i was not   said kaliinin .   i was trying to keep my mind empty .  it just came in .       i didn t sense anything   said morrison .   how about you  yuri .      konev shook his head  frowning ferociously at his failure .   no  i didn t .       in any case   said morrison thoughtfully   it needn t mean anything .  natalya felt it might be an idle thought that arose out of a series of previous thoughts in a natural way and with none but the most superficial meaning .  even if the thought had arisen in shapirov s mind  it might be equally superficial there .       perhaps   said konev   but perhaps not .  his whole life and mind were bound up in the problems of miniaturization .  he would be thinking of nothing else .       you keep saying that   said morrison   but  actually  that is romantic nonsense .  no one thinks of nothing else .  the most lovesick romeo in history could not concentrate on his juliet forever .  a twinge of colic  a distant sound  and he would be distracted at once .       nevertheless  we must take anything shapirov says as possibly significant .       possibly   said morrison .   but what if he were trying to work out the extension of the miniaturization theory and decided to moan he had no time  that there was insufficient time to complete his work .      konev shook his head  more  it seemed  to brush off distraction than in a clear negative .  he said   how about this .  what if it seemed to shapirov that any miniaturization that involved an increase in the speed of light proportional to the decrease in planck s constant would involve a change that was instantaneous  that took no time .  and  of course  as the speed of light increased vastly  so would the inevitable speed of a massless    or nearly massless    object .  he would  in effect  abolish time and could say to himself proudly   there is no time .       boranova said   very farfetched .       of course   said konev   but worth thinking about .  we must record every impression we get  however dim  however apparently meaningless .       i plan to do precisely that  yuri   said boranova .     konev said   then quiet again .  let s see if we can get anything more .      morrison concentrated fiercely  his eyes half buried under jutting eyebrows  but those same eyes were fixed on konev  who sighed and said in a whisper   i get something over and over     nu times c equals m sub s .       morrison said   i got that  too  but i thought it was  m times c square .       no   said konev tightly .   try again .      morrison concentrated  then  quite abashed  said   you re right .  i get it  too   nu times c equals m sub s .   what does it mean .       who can say at first glance .  however  if this is in shapirov s mind  it means something .  we can assume that nu is radiational frequency  c the speed of light  and m sub s is the standard mass    that is  the mass at rest under ordinary conditions .  in the light of        boranova s arms lifted with an admonitory forefinger upraised .  konev stopped short and said uncomfortably   but that is neither here nor there .      morrison grinned   classified material  eh  yuri .      and then dezhnev s voice sounded with an unaccustorned petulance to it .   how is it   he said   that you are hearing all these things about time and standard mass and whatnot and i sense nothing .  is it that i am not a scientist .      morrison said   i doubt that that has anything to do with it .  brains are different .  maybe they come in different types the way blood does .  blood is blood but you can t always transfuse one person s blood into another .  your brain may be sufficiently different from shapirov s so that there is no sensory crossover .       only mine .       not only yours .  there may be billions of minds that can pick up nothing from shapirov .  you ll notice that sophia and natalya can pick up the same things  which yuri and i cannot    and vice versa .       two men and two women   grumped dezhnev   and i am what .      konev said impatiently   you are wasting our time  arkady .  let s not endlessly discuss every tiny thing we pick up .  we have more to hear and little time to do it in .  if you concentrate a little harder  arkady  you  too  may sense something .      silence .     it was broken occasionally by a soft murrnur from one or another who reported sensing an image or a scrap of words .  dezhnev contributed only one thing   i sense a feeling of hunger  but it may be my own .       undoubtedly   said boranova dryly .   console yourself with the thought  arkady  that when we get out of here  you will be allowed seconds and thirds of every dish and unlimited vodka .      dezhnev grinned almost lasciviously at the thought .     morrison said   we don t seem to come across anything mathematical or even out of the ordinary .  i insist that even shapirov must have the great majority of his thoughts concerned with trivia .       nevertheless   grunted konev under his breath   we listen .       for how long  yuri .       till the end of the axon .  right down to the end .      morrison said   do you then intend to run into the synapses or will you double back .       we will go as close to the synapses as possible .  that will bring us into the immediate neighborhood of the adjoining nerve cell and the skeptic waves may be even more easily sensed at that crucial point of transfer than anywhere else .      dezhnev said   yes  yuri  but you are not the captain .     natasha  little flower  is that what you wish  too .      boranova said   why not .  yuri is right .  the synapse is a unique spot and we know nothing about it .       i ask only because half our power supply has now been consumed .  how long dare we continue to remain within the body .       long enough   said boranova   to reach the synapse  certainly .      and silence fell once more .        .     the ship continued to move along the enormous length of the axon and konev dictated the actions of the others more and more .      whatever you get  report .  it doesn t matter whether it makes sense or not  whether it s one word or a paragraph .  if it s an image  describe it .  even if you think it s your own thought  report it if there s the slightest doubt .       you ll have meaningless chatter   said dezhnev  apparently still annoyed at his nonreceiving brain .      of course  but two or three meaningful hints will pay all .  and we won t know what s meaningful until we examine everything .      dezhnev said   if i sense something i think isn t mine  do i throw it in  too .       you  especially   said konev .   if you re as insensitive as you seem to think  anything you do get may be particularly important .  now  please  no more talk .  every second of conversation may mean we miss something .      and there began a period of disjointed phrases out of which  in morrison s opinion  it was impossible to make sense .     one surprise came when kaliinin said suddenly    nobel prize .       konev looked up sharply and almost responded    then  as though realizing who had said it  he subsided .     morrison said  trying not to sound mocking   did you get that  too  yuri .      konev nodded .   at almost the same time .       that s the first crossover between a man and woman   said morrison .   i suppose shapirov had his mind on it in connection with his extension of miniaturization theory .       undoubtedly .  but his nobel prize was sure for what he had already done in miniaturization .       which is classified and therefore unknown .       yes .  but once we perfect the process  it will no longer be unknown .       let s hope so   said morrison sardonically .     konev snapped   we are no more secretive than you americans .       all right .  i m not arguing   but morrison grinned broadly at konev  who was peering over his shoulder at him  and that seemed to irritate the younger man even further .     at one point  dezhnev said    hawking .       morrison s eyebrows lifted in surprise .  he had not expected this .     boranova said  looking displeased   what is this  arkady .       i said   hawking    said dezhnev defensively .   out of nowhere it popped into my mind .  you told me to tell you anything that did .       it is an english word   said boranova   that means  spitting .       or  selling    said morrison cheerfully .     dezhnev said   i don t know enough english to know that word .  i thought it was someone s name .       so it was   said konev uncomfortably .   stephen hawking .  he was a great english theoretical physicist of over a century ago .  i was thinking of him  too  but i thought it was my own thought .      morrison said   good  arkady .  that might be useful .      dezhnev s face split with a grin .   i m not altogether useless  then .  as my father used to say   if the words of a wise man are few  they are nevertheless worth listening to .       an interminable half hour later  morrison said gently   are we getting anywhere at all .  it seems to me that most of the phrases and images tell us nothing .   nobel prize  tells us  reasonably enough  that shapirov thought of winning one  but we know that .   hawking  tells us that that physicist s work was significant  perhaps  in connection with the extension of miniaturization  but it doesn t tell us why .      it was not konev who rose to the defense  as morrison would have expected  but boranova .  konev  who might have been readying himself for a response  seemed willing  on this occasion  to let the captain bear the weight .     boranova said   we are dealing with an enormous cryptogram  albert .  shapirov is a man in a coma and his brain is not thinking in a disciplined or orderly fashion .  it is sparking wildly  those parts of it that remain whole  perhaps randomly .  we collect everything without distinction and it will all be studied by those of us with a deep understanding of miniaturization theory .  they may see meaning where you see none .  and a bit of meaning  in one corner of the field  may be the start of an illumination that will spread to all parts of it .  what we are doing makes sense and it is the proper thing to do .      konev then said   besides  albert  there is something else we can try .  we are approaching a synapse .  this axon will end eventually and split up into many fibers  each of which will approach but not join with the dendrite of a neighboring neuron .       i know that   said morrison impatiently .      the nerve impulse  including the skeptic waves  will have to jump the tiny gap of the synapse and  in doing so  the dominant thoughts will be less attenuated than the others .  in short  if we jump the synapse  too  we will reach a region where we may  for a while at least  detect what we want to hear with less interference from trivial noise .       really .   asked morrison archly .   this notion of differential attenuation is new to me .       it s the result of painstaking soviet work in the area .       ah .      konev fired up at once   what do you mean   ah .   .  is that a dismissal of the value of the work .       no no .       of course it is .  if it s soviet work  it means nothing .       i just mean that i haven t read or heard anything about it   morrison said in defense .       the work was done by madame nastiaspenskaya .  i presume you ve heard of her .       yes  i have .       but you don t read her papers  is that it .       yuri  i can t keep up with the english language literature  let alone with         well  when this is over  i ll see that you get a collection of her papers and you may educate yourself .       thank you  but may i say that on the face of it i think the finding is an unlikely one .  if some types of mental activity survive a synapse better than others  then  considering that there are many hundreds of billions of synapses in the brain  all constantly in use  the final result would be that only a tiny proportion of thoughts would survive at all .       it s not as simple as that   said konev .   the trivial thoughts are not wiped out .  they continue at a lower level of intensity and don t decline indefinitely .  it s just that  in the immediate neighborhood of a synapse  the important thoughts are  for a time  relatively strengthened .       is there evidence for this .  or is it only a suggestion .       there s evidence of a subtle nature .  eventually  with miniaturization experiments  that evidence will be hardened  i m sure .  there are some people among whom this synapse effect is much stronger than average .  why else can creative individuals concentrate so hard and so long  if they are not less distracted by trivia .  and why  on the contrary  are brilliant scholars traditionally absentminded .       very well .  if we find something  i won t quarrel with the rationale .      dezhnev said   but what happens when we come to the end of the axon .  the stream of fluid we re riding will just make a u turn at that point and carry us back again against the opposite wall of the axon .  do i force my way through the membrane .       no   said konev .   of course not .  we d damage the cell .  we ll have to take on the electric charge pattern of acetylcholine .  that carries the nerve impulse pattern across the synapse .      boranova said   sophia  you can give the ship an acetylcholine pattern  can t you .       i can   said kaliinin   but aren t the acetylcholine molecules active on the outside of the cell .       nevertheless  the cell may have a mechanism for ejecting them .  we ll try .      and the trip along the seemingly endless axon continued .        .     suddenly the end of the axon was in sight .  there was no hint  no warning .  konev noticed it first .  he was watching and he knew what he was watching for  but morrison gave him full credit .  he himself was watching  too  and knew what he was watching for  and yet did not see it when it came .     to be sure  konev was in the front seat  while morrison had to stare past konev s head .  that was not much of an excuse either .     in the curiously ineffective light of the ship s beacon  it was clear that there was a hollow ahead and yet the current was beginning to veer away from it .     the axon was beginning to break off into branches  into dendrites like those at the other end of the neuron  at the end where the nucleated cell body was .  the axonian dendrites at the far end of the cell were fewer and thinner  but they were there .  undoubtedly  a portion of the cellular stream flowed into it  but the ship was in the main stream that curved away and they could take no chances .     they would have to push into the first dendrite encountered    if it could be done .      there  arkady  there   cried konev  pointing  and it was only then that all the rest realized they were reaching the end of the axon .   use your motors  arkady  and push over .      morrison could make out the soft throbbing of the motors as they edged the ship toward the side of the stream .  the dendrite toward which they aimed was a tube that was slipping sideways  a huge tube at their size scale  so huge they could only see a small arc of its circumference .     they continued to edge closer to it and morrison found himself leaning toward the dendrite  as though adding body english could improve matters .     but it was not a matter of reaching the tube itself  merely moving over an eddying section of fluid  a rushing of water molecules that quieted into gentle circles and then slipped beyond into another stream that was curving off in another direction .     the ship made the transition and was suddenly plunging forward into the tube opening .      turn off the motors   said konev excitedly .      not yet   grumbled dezhnev .   we may be too near the countercurrent emerging from this thing .  let me slip over a bit closer to the wall .      he did so  but that did not take long .  they were now essentially moving with the current  not against it .  and when dezhnev did finally shut off the engine and pushed back his damp  graying hair  he heaved a great breath and said   everything we do consumes a ton of energy .  there s a limit  yuri  there s a limit .       we ll worry about that later   said konev impatiently .      will we .   said dezhnev .   my father always said   later is usually too late .      natalya  don t leave all this to yuri .  i don t trust his attitude toward our energy supply .       calm yourself  arkady .  i will take care to override yuri if it becomes necessary .     yuri  the dendrite is not very long  is it .       we will come to the ending in short order  natalya .       in that case  sophia  please see to it that we are ready to adopt the acetylcholine pattern at a moment s notice .       you ll give me the signal  then .   said kaliinin .      i will not have to  sophia .  i m sure that yuri will whoop like a cossack when the end is in sight .  shift the pattern to acetylcholine at that moment .      they continued sliding along the final tubular remnant of the neuron they had entered a considerable time before .  it seemed to morrison that  as the dendrite continued to narrow  he could see the wall arc above him  but that was illusion .  common sense told him that even at its narrowest  the tube would appear to be a few kilometers across at their present molecular size .     and  as boranova had foreseen  konev lifted his voice in a great cry  probably quite unaware that he was doing so .   the end is ahead .  quick .  acetylcholine before we re swept around and back .      kaliinin s fingers flickered over the keyboard .  there was no indication from inside the ship that anything about it had changed  but somewhere up ahead was an acetylcholine receptor    or  more likely  hundreds of them    and the patterns meshed  positive to negative and negative to positive  so that the attraction between ship and receptor was sharp and great .     they were pulled out of the stream and melted into and through the wall of the dendrite .  for a few minutes they continued to be pulled through the intercellular medium between the dendrite of the neuron they had just left and the dendrite of the neighbor neuron .     morrison saw almost nothing .  the ship  he felt  was sliding along    or through    a complex protein molecule and then he noticed the formation of a concavity  as when the ship had first entered the first neuron .     konev had unclasped himself so that he could stand up .   quite obviously  he was too excited to feel this was something he could do sitting down .      he said  almost stuttering   now  according to the nastiaspenskaya hypothesis  the filtering out of the important thoughts is most evident immediately after the synapse .  once the cell body is approached  the difference fades .  so once we are in the neighboring dendrite  open your minds .  be ready for anything .  say whatever you hear out loud .  describe any images .  i ll record everything .  you  too  arkady .  albert  you  too .     we re in now .  begin .        chapter       alone .     good company robs even death of some of its terrors .        dezhnev senior       .     morrison watched what followed with a certain detachment .  he did not intend to participate actively .  if something forced itself into his mind  he would respond and report it .  it would be unscientific not to .     kaliinin  at his left  looked grim and her fingers were idle .  he leaned toward her and whispered   have you got us back as l glucose .      she nodded .     he said   are you aware of this nastiaspenskaya hypothesis .      she said   it s not in my field .  i ve never heard of it .       do you believe it .      but kaliinin was not to be trapped .  she said   i m not qualified either to believe or disbelieve  but he believes it .     because he wants to .       do you sense anything .       nothing more than before .      dezhnev was  of course  silent .  boranova occasionally produced a crisp word or two  which  however  seemed to morrison s ears to lack conviction .     only konev seemed to maintain enthusiasm .  at one point  he cried out   did anyone get that .  anyone .   circular rhythm .    circular rhythm .       there was no direct answer and  after a while  morrison said   what does that mean  yuri .      konev did not answer .     and even he grew quiet after a while and was reduced to staring blankly ahead as the ship moved onward in the fluid stream .     boranova asked   well  yuri .      konev said rather hoarsely   i do not understand it .      dezhnev said   yuri  little son  it may be this is a bad neuron and isn t doing much thinking .  we ll have to try another and maybe another .  the first one may have been simply beginner s luck .      konev looked at him angrily .   we don t work with single cells .  we re in a group of cells    a million of them or more    that are a center of creative thought by albert s theory .  what one of them thinks  they all think    with minor variations .      morrison said   that s what i believe i have shown .      dezhnev said   then we don t go looking from cell to cell .       it would be no use   said morrison .      good   said dezhnev heavily   because we don t have the time and we don t have the energy .  so what do we do now .      in the silence that followed  konev said again   i do not understand it .  nastiaspenskaya could not be wrong .      and now kaliinin  with great deliberation  unclasped herself and stood up .     she said   i want to say something and i don t want to be interrupted .  natalya  listen to me .  we have gone far enough .  this is an experiment that perhaps had to be done  even though  in my opinion  it was sure to fail .  well  it has failed .      she pointed a slim finger briefly at konev  without looking at him .   some people want to alter the universe to their liking .  whatever is not so  they would make so by sheer force of will    except that the universe is beyond any person s will  squeeze he ever so hard .      i don t know if nastiaspenskaya is correct or not .  i don t know if albert s theories are correct or not .  but this i know what they think  and what any neuroscientist thinks about the brain generally  must be about a reasonably normal brain .  academician shapirov s brain is not reasonably normal .  twenty percent of it is nonfunctioning dead .  the rest must be distorted in consequence and the fact that he has been in a coma for weeks shows that .      any reasonable human being would realize that shapirov cannot be thinking in normal fashion .  his brain is an army in    in disarray .  it is a factory in which all the equipment has been jarred loose .  it is sparking randomly  emitting broken thoughts  scattered pieces  splinters of memory .  some men     she pointed again     won t admit it because they believe that if they only insist loudly enough and strongly enough  the obvious will retreat and the impossible will somehow come into being .      konev had now also unclasped and was also standing .  he turned slowly and looked at kaliinin .   morrison was astonished .  konev was actually looking at her .  and on his face there was no visible sign of anger or hatred or contempt .  it was a hangdog look  with a touch of self contempt in it .  morrison felt sure of this .      yet konev s voice was steady and hard as he looked away from kaliinin and turned to boranova  addressing her .      natalya  was this point made before we embarked on this voyage .       if you mean  yuri  did sophia say all this to me before this moment .  she did not .       is there any reason we should be plagued with crew members who have no faith in our work .  why should such a person have agreed to come on this voyage .       because i am a scientist   shot back kaliinin and she  too  addressed boranova .   because i wanted to test the effect of artificial electrical patterns on biochemical interaction .  that has been done  so that for me the voyage was a success  and for arkady  since the ship has handled as it should  and for albert  since the evidence for his theories is stronger now  i gather  than it was before we came here  and for you  natalya  since you brought us down here and  presumably  will bring us back safely again .  but for one     pointing at konev     it has been a failure and the mental stability of he who has failed would be greatly helped by the frank admission of that failure .       she s getting back at him with a vengeance  thought morrison .      but konev did not crumple under kaliinin s forceful attack .  he remained surprisingly calm and he said  still to boranova   that is not so .  that is the reverse of what is true .  it was clear from the start that we could not expect shapirov to think as he did when he was in full health .  it was entirely likely we would get bits and pieces of meaning intermingled with meaninglessness and trivialities .  that we did .  i was hoping to get a higher percentage of meaning in this new neuron immediately past the synapse .  there we failed .  that makes the task before us more difficult  but not impossible .      we ve got well over a hundred phrases and images we ve salvaged from shapirov s thinking .  don t forget  nu times c equals m sub s   which must be significant .  there s no possible reason to think of that simply as a triviality .      boranova said   have you thought  yuri  that it is possible that that fragment of a mathematical expression represents something shapirov tried and found wanting .       i have thought of it  but why should it stick in his mind  in that case .  it is certainly worth investigating .  and how much of what seems to be trivial or meaningless would not be so if even one phrase or image gave us a necessary hint .  with each step forward  other things might more easily fall into place .  we certainly have no reason as yet to declare this voyage a failure    or any part in it .      boranova nodded slightly .   well  let s hope you re right  yuri  but  as arkady has already asked  what do we do now .  what  in your opinion  ought we to do now .      with great deliberation  konev said   there s one thing we haven t tried yet .  we ve tried detection outside the neuron  inside the neuron  inside the axon  inside the dendrites  past the synapse  but  in every single case  we have tried it inside the ship  inside its presumably insulating walls .       in that case  then   said boranova   are you suggesting that we make the attempt outside the ship and within the cell fluid itself .  remember  such an observer would still be inside a plastic suit .       a plastic suit is not as thick as a plastic ship and the insulating effect would presumably be less .  besides  the computer itself need not be inside the suit .      morrison said with gathering alarm   who do you have in mind for this .      konev looked at him coolly .   there is only one possibility  albert .  the computer is your design and is made to match your brain .  you are  of necessity  the most sensitive to shapirov s thoughts .  it would be foolish in the highest degree to send out anyone else .  i have you in mind for this  albert .         .     morrison s stomach clenched tightly .  not that .  he couldn t be asked to do it again .     he tried to say so  but his mouth seemed to have dried completely and instantaneously and he could make no sound other than a throaty hiss .  it flashed through his mind that he had been beginning to enjoy the feeling of not being a coward  of wandering  by ship  through the brain cell fearlessly    but he was a coward  after all .      not that .   he cried out  but it wasn t his voice  it was higher by an octave .  it was kaliinin .     she had turned around to face boranova  holding herself down in her seat with knuckles standing out whitely .      not that  natalya   she cried again passionately  her chest heaving in excitement .   it s a cowardly suggestion .  poor albert has been out there once already .  he nearly died and if it hadn t been for him we might still be lost in the wrong capillary and we might never have reached this cell block at all .  why should he have to do that again .  it is surely someone else s turn and since he wants it done     no one questioned who  he  was     let him do it .  he should not ask it of someone else .      morrison  beneath his own fright  wondered faintly if kaliinin s emotion was due to a growing affection for him or a determination to oppose at every point any strong wish of konev s .  there was a corner of morrison s mind that was pragmatic enough to be certain it was the latter .     konev s face had grown slowly redder as sophia spoke .  he said   there s no cowardice here .    he spat out the word  making it quite plain that that was what had most offended him .    i am making the only possible suggestion .  if i go out there  which i am perfectly willing to do  it can only be with albert s device  which won t work as well for me as it would for him .  we cannot choose this one or that one according to whim .  it must be the one who can get the best results and there is no question  in that case  who it must be .       true   said morrison  finding his voice now   but there is no reason to suppose that reception will be better outside the ship than inside .      konev said   there is no reason to think the reverse  either .  and as dezhnev will tell you  our energy supply    and therefore our time    is decreasing .  there is no room for delay .  you ll have to leave the ship as you did before    and now .      morrison said in a low voice  which he hoped would make the remark final   i m sorry .  i will not leave the ship .      but boranova had apparently made up her mind .   i m afraid you ll have to  albert   she said gently .      no .       yuri is right .  only you and your device can give us the information we need .       i am certain there ll be no information .      boranova held out her two hands  palms upward .   perhaps not  but we can t leave that a matter of conjecture .  let us find out .       but        boranova said   albert  i promise you that if you do this one thing for us  your part in all this will be reported honestly when the time comes for open publication .  you will be known as the man who worked out the correct theory of thought  the man who developed the device that could exploit that theory properly  the man who saved the ship in the capillary  and the man who detected shapirov s thinking by bravely venturing into the neuron  as earlier he had ventured into the bloodstream .       are you implying that the truth will not be told if i refuse .      boranova sighed .   you force me to play the role of villainess openly .  i would rather you had been satisfied with the implication .     yes  the truth need not be told .  that  after all  is the only weapon i hold against you .  we cannot very well turn you out of the ship by force  since there is no advantage in your merely being outside .  you must also sense poor shapirov s thought and for that we must have your willing cooperation .  we will reward you for that  but only for that .      morrison looked around at his crewmates  faces  searching for help .  boranova    steadily studying him .  konev    staring him down imperiously .  dezhnev    looking awkward  not willing to commit himself either way .  and kaliinin  .  .  .  his only hope .     morrison gazed at her thoughtfully and said   what do you think  sophia .      kaliinin hesitated  then said in a voice that did not tremble   i think it is wrong to threaten you in this way .  a task like this should be performed voluntarily and not under duress .      dezhnev  who had been humming very softly to himself  now said   my old father used to say   there is no duress like one s own conscience and it is that which makes life so needlessly bitter .        my conscience doesn t trouble me in this matter   said morrison .   shall we put it to a vote .       it wouldn t matter   said boranova .   i am the captain and in a case like this i alone have the vote .       if i am out there and sense nothing  would you believe me .      boranova nodded .   i would .  after all  you might so easily invent something that would sound useful if you wished us to be suitably grateful .  if you come back with nothing or with trivia  i believe i would have a greater tendency to believe that than if you instantly claimed you had heard something of great importance .      konev said   i am not likely to be fooled .  if he comes in with something that seems important  i will be able to tell if it truly is .  and now  surely  we have had enough discussion .  let s go .      and morrison  his heart beating and his throat tightening  managed to say   very well  i will go    but only for a brief time .         .     morrison  of his own accord  stripped himself of his cotton garment .  the first time  was it really only a couple of hours before .   it had seemed to be a violation of modesty  this second time it was almost routine .     he was quite aware  as with kaliinin s help he struggled into the suit  how easily he could suck in his abdomen .  despite a good breakfast  ample water  and a piece of chocolate  his stomach was empty and he was glad it was .  he felt a twinge of nausea as the suit enclosed more and more of his body and to throw up  once enclosed  would have been unbearable .  just before enclosure  he refused another piece of chocolate with what was almost a shudder .     they put his computer into his sheathed hands and boranova said to him loudly   can you work it .      morrison heard her without too much difficulty .  he knew he wouldn t hear her once he was outside the ship .  he balanced the essentially weightless computer in one hand and struck the keys carefully and rather gracelessly with the other .  he shouted back   i think i can manage .      then  rather clumsily  they tied the computer to both his wrists with firm knots of tough plastic twine  probably the same material of which the suit and the ship itself were made  .      so you don t lose it   boranova called out .     out into the air lock he went .  he felt himself embraced by it  then pressured as the air in it was withdrawn  and then he was outside the ship .     outside again .  for only a brief time  he had warned the rest  but what good was that .  how could he enforce that  if the others within the ship refused to let him back in .  already  he was sorry he had let himself be talked out of the ship by any threat  but dared not articulate the thought .  it would do him no good .     morrison tucked the computer under his left arm  partly because he did not entirely trust the plastic twine that secured it and partly because he wanted to protect it from the cellular contents as much as possible .  he felt the surface of the ship for some spot where the electric charge on his suit would adhere to a charge of opposite nature on the ship s hull .     morrison found one that allowed him to keep his back on the ship .  the electric field did not hold him tightly and there was considerable give .  still  he was the size of an atom and it might be difficult to concentrate electric charge on a portion of him .     or would it be .  wouldn t the electrons that were the source of the charge be microminiaturized as well .  he felt    and resented keenly    his ignorance of miniaturization theory .     he was little aware of his motion along the intracellular stream  for everything was moving along with him .  he found himself  however  the center of a shifting and ever changing panorama .  with the thinner plastic of the suit between himself and the scene  with the beacon of his own suit turning here and there as he moved his head and felt the headpiece twist  a little resistantly  with it  he could make out more .     there was the knobbiness of the water molecules rubbing against each other  like dimly seen balloons .  he could see them brush past him slowly  this way or that  and largely ignore him .  occasionally  one would cling for a moment  an electric charge meeting an opposite charge on his suit  so that they clutched at him and released their hold only lingeringly .  it was almost as though a molecule occasionally yearned for him but couldn t manage to turn the wish into deed .     among these were larger molecules  some as large as the ship  some far larger still .  he could see them only because light glinted off them here and there in changing  prismatic fashion .  he did not see them  his mind built them up out of what he could glimpse .  that he could do this at all was the result of his knowing a good deal about the contents of the cell to begin with  or thought he did .  it might also  he thought  simply be his imagination .     it even seemed to morrison that he could make out the skeleton of the cellular interior  the large structures that remained in place while the fluid stream passed them and that gave the cell its more or less fixed shape .  these structures seemed to go by so quickly he could barely take note of them before they were gone .  they alone gave him the impression of the rapid movement of the intercellular stream that carried the ship and him along with it as it weaved in gentle swoops around those fixed structures .     all this observation had not taken very long  but it was enough .  it was time that he now turned his attention to his computer .     why .  it would detect nothing .  morrison was sure of it  but he couldn t act on that belief  however strongly he felt it .  he might be wrong  perhaps  and he owed it to the others    and to himself  too    to make the effort .     he tried clumsily to adjust the computer to maximum sensitivity  barely able to handle the keys correctly and relieved that the self contained power pack in the computer worked properly .  he concentrated hard in order to sense and tap the currents of thought passing by .     the device did its work .  the water molecules drifted by it as gently and untouchingly as they drifted by him and  disregarding them  his computer portrayed the skeptic waves more purely etched  more steep and clear  more finely detailed  than he had ever before seen them .  but for all that  he sensed nothing but a faint hissing whisper that produced neither words nor images but only sadness .     wait .  how did he know the whisper was sad .  surely that was merely a subjective judgment on his part .  or was he detecting an emotion .  was the partially brain dead  totally comatose shapirov sad .  would it be surprising if he were .     morrison looked over his shoulder  back at the ship .  surely what he was detecting was enough .  he was registering sad nothingness and nothing more .  should he signal now to be pulled in .  would they be willing to do so .  and if they brought him in and if he told boranova that he had sensed nothing  would not konev tell him angrily that he had been out there only two minutes  that he hadn t given it a chance .  would konev not demand he go out again .     and if he waited longer .     actually  he could wait longer .  at this stage of miniaturization  or for whatever cause   he did not feel any particular heat .     but if he waited longer    another two minutes  or five minutes  or an hour  for that matter    konev would still say   not enough .      he could make out konev looking out toward him  his expression dark and glowering .  kaliinin was directly behind him  since she had unclasped herself and moved over into what had been morrison s seat .  she was staring outward anxiously .     he caught her eyes and she seemed about to signal to him  but boranova leaned forward and pushed her shoulder firmly .  kaliinin moved back to her own seat at once .   she had to  morrison told himself  for her job was to keep an eye on the charge patterns of the ship and of himself right now and she could not    must not    abandon that job  no matter what her anxiety over him .      for the sake of completeness  morrison tried to catch dezhnev s eye  but the angle required was too great for the twisting ability of his headpiece .  he caught  instead  konev motioning in what seemed  clearly  an interrogative gesture .     morrison looked away petulantly  making no attempt to give information  and became aware of something in the distance looming toward him at a great speed .  he could make out no details  but he automatically winced as he waited for the current to carry the ship and himself around it .     it came straight on like a juggernaut and morrison cowered toward the hull of the ship .       the ship did evade the object  but not by much and as the looming monster passed him morrison felt himself drawn outward and toward it .     it flashed through his mind that kaliinin had put some random electric charge on his suit and that whatever it was he was passing  by the most miserable of coincidences  had a charge that exactly complemented his own .     under normal circumstance  that would not have mattered .  the ship and the structure passed each other at such a speed that no attraction could have sufficed to rip him loose  but he was a tiny object with neither mass nor inertia and  for a moment  he felt    stretched    as though the structure and the ship disputed ownership .  the ship  it seemed to his appalled eyes  briefly faltered and then was pushed loose by the current .     morrison had been peeled off by the object and the ship  still continuing with the current  moved off so rapidly that it was lost to sight at once .  one second it was with him  the next second it was totally gone .     before he had time to realize what had happened  he was alone and helpless    an atom sized object in a brain cell .  his only faint attachment to life and reality    the ship    was forever gone .        .     some minutes must have been lost to morrison .  during that time  he had no conception of where he was or of what had happened .  he was conscious only of absolute panic  of the conviction that he was on the point of death .     when life continued  morrison was almost sorry .  if that moment had been death  it would have been all over .  now he still had to wait for it .     how long would his air last .  would heat and humidity crawl on  even if more slowly than before  inexorably  just the same  perhaps .  would his light give out before he did and would he have to die in utter darkness as well as utterly alone .  he thought  quite madly  how will i know when i m dead if it s absolutely dark before and absolutely dark thereafter .   he thought of ajax s prayer to zeus that if he had to meet death  let it be in the light of day .  and  with this  morrison thought hopelessly  and with one person  at least  to hold one s hand .      what to do  then .     just wait .     what had gone wrong  anyway .     ah  he was not yet dead .  the fear had receded enough to allow room for a little curiosity    and a will to fight and live .     could he somehow get loose from this thing .  it seemed disgraceful  somehow  to die like a fly stuck in amber .     and every moment the ship was getting farther away .  almost at once he thought  it s already too far away for me to be caught  no matter what i do .     the thought drove him to frenzy and morrison writhed with all his might  trying to break loose .  it did no good and it occurred to him that he was wasting energy and increasing the heat within the suit .     he slid his hands upward along the misty structure that held him  but his hands bounced away .  like charges repel each other .     he reached along it    right  left  up  down .  somewhere there was the opposite charge .  he might be able to seize hold then and try to tear the structure apart .   why were his teeth chattering .  fright .  desperation .  both .      his right hand clicked shut as it was attracted to a portion of the structure .  he clenched hard  trying to push past the mere charge and tear at the atomic arrangement itself    if there was any atomic arrangement that had meaning aside from the charge itself .     for a moment  morrison felt the structure resist a too tight grip with a kind of rubbery rebound .  and then  without warning  it crumbled in his hand .  he stared in amazement at his hand  trying to make out what had happened .  there was no tearing  ripping  or wrenching sensation .  it seemed to him that a portion of the structure had simply disappeared .     morrison tried again  groping here and there  until another portion vanished .  what was happening .     wait awhile .  the miniaturization field extended beyond the ship slightly  boranova had said .  it would extend beyond the suit  too .  when he squeezed as hard as he might  some of the atom he was touching would miniaturize and  in so doing  it would lose its normal architecture and break loose from the atoms to which it had formerly been bonded .  anything he touched    if he could touch it hard enough    would miniaturize .     any atom or portion thereof that he miniaturized in this way would become a point sized particle with far less mass than an electron .  it would take off at nearly the speed of light  pass through matter as though that matter weren t there  and be gone .     could this be so .  it had to be so .  nothing else he could imagine would make sense .     and even as he thought this  morrison began to push his hands and feet violently against the imprisoning material    and broke loose .     he was no longer glued to the structure .  he was an independent body coursing along the intercellular stream .     it didn t stop the ship from being forever out of reach  but he was at least on its trail .   foolish .  foolish .  what good was it to be on its trail .  on his own scale  he was dozens of kilometers from the ship    if not scores .      another thought struck him and staggered him .  he had been miniaturizing atoms to get free  but such miniaturization required an input of energy .  not much at this stage  since there was so little mass to remove  but where would the energy come from .     it had to come from the suit s own miniaturization field .  every atom that miniaturized weakened the field  therefore .  how much had he weakened it  then  by getting loose .     and was that why he wasn t feeling the heat .  had the miniaturization of his surroundings soaked up some of the heat as well as of the energy of the miniaturization field .  no  that couldn t be so  for he hadn t felt much in the way of heat even before he began breaking loose .     yet another thought struck him  making his position more desperate still .  if he had broken loose from the structure at the expense of the energy of his field    if his field had been weakened    then he would have deminiaturized slightly .  was that the reason for spontaneous deminiaturization .     boranova had talked of the possibility of such spontaneous deminiaturization .  the possibility of that increased  the smaller the miniaturized object was .     and he was now small .     as long as he had been on the ship  he had been part of the overall miniaturization field of the ship .  he was part of a molecule sized object .  while he was part of the cytoskeleton of the cell  he was part of an even larger object .  but now he was alone  separate  part of nothing beyond himself .  he was an atom sized object .     he was much more likely  now  to deminiaturize spontaneously  except that it wouldn t be spontaneous    it would be the weakening of the field by the miniaturization of surrounding normal objects .     how could he tell if he were deminiaturizing .  if he were  the process would proceed at an exponential rate .  he would be deminiaturizing slowly at first  but as he grew larger he would affect a larger volume of surrounding material and he would grow larger at a faster rate  then still faster  and finally it would be an explosion and he would die .     but what did it matter if he were deminiaturizing .  if he were  then  in a brief time    seconds merely  at most    he would be dead and it would happen too quickly to make any impression upon him .  one moment he would be alive and the next moment there would be nothingness .     how could he ask for a better death .  why should he want to know a second earlier that it was going to happen .     because he was alive and he was human    and wanting to know was what made an object alive and human .     how could he tell .     morrison stared at the dim glinting around him  at the moving swell of the water molecules  turning and shifting around him in a kind of slow motion as both he and they moved along the intercellular stream .     if he were increasing in size  they should seem to be decreasing  and vice versa .     morrison stared .  they were decreasing in size  getting smaller .  was this death .  or his imagination .     wait  were the water molecules increasing in size .  swelling .  getting larger .  ballooning .  if so  it must follow that he was getting smaller .     would he shrink to the size of a subsubatomic particle .  a subelectron .  would he go streaking off at the speed of light and explode when he was halfway to the moon  dying in a vacuum before he had time to know he was in a vacuum .     no  the molecules were shrinking  not expanding    morrison closed his eyes and took a deep breath .  he was going mad .  or was he beginning to experience brain damage .     better to die  then .  better death altogether than a dead brain and living body .     or were the water molecules pulsating .  why should they pulsate .     think  morrison  think .  you re a scientist .  find an explanation .  why should they pulsate .     he knew why the field might weaken    its tendency to miniaturize the surroundings .  why should it strengthen .     it would have to gain energy to strengthen .  from where .     what about the surrounding molecules .  they had more random heat energy per volume than he had because they were at a higher temperature .  ordinarily  heat should flow from the surroundings into his suit until his suit and he himself would be at blood temperature and he would die of his own inability to rid himself of the heat he had accumulated  as he almost had on his earlier venture outside the ship .     but there was not only the heat energy intensity of his body  there was also the energy of the miniaturization field .  and  as he was struck randomly by the water molecules  energy need not flow into him in the form of heat  but in the form of miniaturization activation .  the field would grow more intense and he would shrink .     this must be true at all times when a miniaturized object was surrounded by normal objects of higher temperature .  the energy might flow from the surroundings to the miniaturized object either as heat or as field intensity .  and it must be that the smaller the object  the more intensely miniaturized  the more it was the field that gained the energy and not the object itself .     probably the ship  too  was pulsating  growing larger and smaller constantly  but to an extent not great enough to notice .  still  that was why the brownian motion hadn t increased as far as it might have and that was why the air conditioning could perform its function with less strain .  the miniaturization field formed a cushion in both cases .     but he    morrison  alone in the cell    was much smaller  possessing less mass  and for him the energy inflow went far more into miniaturization than heat .     morrison s fists clenched helplessly .  he let go of the computer and didn t care .  undoubtedly  the others  boranova and konev certainly  knew of this and might have explained it to him .  once again they let him go into danger without warning him .     and now that he had worked it out for himself    what good did it do him .     he opened his eyes suddenly .     yes  there were pulsations .  now that he knew what to expect  he saw them .  the water molecules were expanding and contracting in an irregular rhythm as they gave up energy to the field and then extracted energy from it .  i    morrison watched it with a stupefied swaying rhythm and he found himself muttering soundlessly   larger  smaller  larger  smaller  larger  smaller .      it could only get so large  he thought .  the expansion mirrored his own contraction and there was only so much energy to be pushed into him to power that contraction .  the cellular contents had a temperature only so high .  on the other hand  they could take large quantities of energy from him  and once they took enough  what was left would go more and more quickly  and he would explode .     therefore  when the water molecules expanded in size  and he himself was growing smaller  he was safe .  he would not grow very small .  when the water molecules contracted in size  however  and he himself was growing larger   he was not safe .  if the water molecules continued to contract until they were too small to see that meant he would be expanding toward instantaneous explosion .      larger  smaller    smaller    stop contracting .      morrison let his breath go  for the molecules were expanding again .     over and over .  each time    would the contraction stop .     it seemed to be playing with him and it didn t matter anyway .  no matter if it brought him to the brink of destruction  then snatched him away  and if it did it a million times over  it wouldn t matter .  sooner or later  his air would be gone and he would die a slow  suffocating death .     better a quick death  surely .        .     kaliinin was screaming .  she was the first to realize what had happened and she choked on her words .      he s gone .  he s gone .   she shrieked .     boranova was unable to stop herself from asking the obvious question .   who s gone .      kaliinin turned wide eyes on her and said   who s gone .  how can you ask who s gone .  albert is gone .      boranova stared blankly out at the spot where morrison had been and now wasn t .   what happened .      dezhnev muttered hoarsely   i m not sure .  we cut a corner closely .  albert  attached to the outside of the ship  introduced an asymmetry  perhaps .  i tried to steer the ship away from    from whatever it was  but it didn t respond properly .       a fixed macromolecular organelle   said konev  who looked up now after having buried his face in his hands   scraped him off .  we ve got to get back to him .  he may have the information we need .      boranova by now clearly understood the situation .  she unclasped herself with a quick movement and stood up .   information .   she said tightly .   is that what you feel the loss of  yuri .  information .  do you know what s going to happen now .  albert s miniaturization field is isolated and he s only atom sized .  the chance of his undergoing spontaneous deminiaturization is at least fifty times ours .  given enough time  the chance will become too good .  information or not  we must get him .  if he deminiaturizes  he will kill shapirov and he will kill us .      konev said   we re just arguing motivation .  we both want him back .  the reasons why are secondary .       we should never have sent him out   said kaliinin .   i knew it was wrong to do so .       it is done   said boranova gruffly   and we must proceed from that point .  arkady .       i m trying   said dezhnev .   don t teach a drunkard to hiccup .       i m not trying to teach you anything  old fool .  i m ordering you .  turn around .  back .  back .       no   said dezhnev .   let this old fool tell you that s ridiculous .  do you want me to make a u turn and buck the current .  you want me to try to force my way upstream .      boranova said   if you just stand still  the stream will bring him to us .       he is adhering to something .  he will not be brought to us   said dezhnev .   what we must do is turn to the other side of the dendrite and let the return stream carry us back .      boranova put both hands to her head and said   i apologize for calling you an old fool  arkady  but if we go back by the counterstream we ll miss him .       we have no choice   said dezhnev .   we lack the energy to try to make our way against the stream we re in .      konev said  sounding a bit weary but reasonable   let arkady do as he wishes  natalya .  we will not lose albert .       how can you know that  yuri .       because i can hear him .     or  rather  sense him .     or  rather  sense shapirov s thoughts by way of his instrument  bare and uninsulated in the cell .      there was a momentary silence .  boranova  clearly astonished  said   are you getting something .       of course .  in that direction   said konev  pointing .      you can tell the direction .   said boranova .   how .       i m not sure how .  i just feel .  it s in that direction .      boranova said   arkady  do as you were planning .       i am doing it regardless of what you say  natasha .  you may be captain  but i am navigator with death staring me in the face .  what have i to lose .  as my old father would say   if you are dangling from a rope over an abyss  don t bother snatching at a coin that falls out of your pocket .      it would be better if i had a real steering mechanism than this system of trying to maneuver three off center engines .      boranova had stopped listening .  she peered into the darkness uselessly and said   what is it you hear  yuri .  shapirov s thoughts tell us    what .       nothing at the moment .  it is just noise .  anguish .      kaliinin muttered  as though to herself   do you suppose part of shapirov s mind knows he s in a coma .  do you suppose part of his mind feels trapped and is clamoring to get out .  like albert    trapped .  like we ourselves    trapped .      boranova said sharply   we are not trapped  sophia .  we can move .  we will find albert .  we will get out of this body .  do you understand  sophia .   she reached for the other woman s shoulders  her fingers digging deeply .     kaliinin winced .   please .  i understand .      boranova turned to konev .   is that all you get .  anguish .       but strongly .   then  curiously  staring at boranova   do you sense nothing .       nothing at all .       but it is so strong .  stronger than anything i felt when albert was in the ship .  it was right for him to move outside .       but can t you make out any actual thoughts .  words .       perhaps i am too far .  perhaps albert hasn t got his machine properly focused .  and you really sense nothing .      boranova shook her head decisively and glanced briefly at kalimin  who said in a low voice  rubbing one shoulder    i sense nothing  either .      and from dezhnev came a discontented   i never get any of these mysterious messages .       you got  hawking .   albert suggested there might be different brain types as there are different blood types and that he and i might be of the same type .  he may be right   said konev .     boranova said   from what direction does the sensation come now .       from there .   this time konev pointed much closer to the fore end of the ship .  he said   you are turning  arent you  arkady .       i am   said dezhnev   and i m now fairly close to the doldrums between the two streams .  i am planning to edge only slightly into the counterstream so that we head back  but not too quickly .       good   said boranova .   we don t want to miss him .     yuri  can you judge the intensity .  is it getting stronger .       yes  it is .   konev seemed a bit surprised  as though he had not noticed the rise in intensity until boranova had mentioned it .      is it imagination  do you think .       it might be   said konev .   we haven t really gotten any closer to him .  we re just making a turn .  it s almost as if he s approaching us .       perhaps he s washed off whatever he adhered to or forced himself loose .  in that case  the current would carry him to us  if we re forcing a turn and staying essentially in the same place .       perhaps .       yuri   said boranova vehemently   you just concentrate on the sensation .  keep arkady aware at all times of the direction from which it comes  which means you will have to be pointing toward albert steadily .     arkady  as you get closer to albert  you will have to turn toward the original stream again and get into it as close to his position as possible .  then once we re moving together  it will be easy to drift closer by use of our motors .       easy for one who s not controlling the motors   growled dezhnev .      easy or difficult   said boranova  her formidable eyebrows hunching low   do it .  if not    no  there is no  if not .   do it .      dezhnev s lips moved  but no sound came and silence fell upon the ship    except for the unheard flood of sensation that entered konev s mind but left the other minds empty .     konev remained standing  facing in the direction from which it seemed to him the sensation was coming .  he muttered once   definitely stronger .   then  after several moments   it seems to me i can almost sense words .  maybe  if he comes close enough        his expression grew even more strained  as though it were trying to force the sensation  to cram it into his mind  while taking the noise apart and separating it into words .  his finger kept pointing rigidly and he said finally   arkady  begin curving back into the doldrums and be ready to plunge into the original stream .     quickly .  don t let him pass us .       as quickly as the motors will let me   said dezhnev .  then  in a lower voice   if i could maneuver this ship by the same magic with which the rest of you hear voices         head straight for the membrane   said konev  ignoring the remark .     it was kaliinin who saw the spark of light first .   there he is .   she cried out .   that s the light of his suit .       i don t have to see it   said konev to boranova .   the noise is like a volcanic eruption in kamchatka .       still noise  yuri .  no words .       fright   said konev   incoherent fright .      boranova said   if i were aware in any way of being trapped in a comatose body  it would be precisely how i would feel .     but how has he come to realize it now .  earlier we did make out words and even quiet and peaceful images .      dezhnev said  panting a little in the excitement of the chase  which had him unconsciously holding his breath   it may be something we ve done with this ship .  we ve stirred up his brain .       we re too small   said konev with contempt .   we can t even stir up this one cell noticeably .       we re coming up to albert   said dezhnev .      sophia   said boranova   can you detect his electrical pattern .       faintly  natalya .       well  throw everything you ve got into something complementary that will attract him tightly .       he seems a little large .  natalva .       he s oscillating  i m sure   said boranova grimly .   once you attach him to the ship  he ll become part of our general miniaturization field and his size will adjust .  quickly  sophia .      there was a slight bump as morrison was electronically pulled against the side of the ship .       chapter       death    once the sun sets  it grows dark  don t let that catch you by surprise .        dezhnev senior       .     morrison could not later recall anything that took place    either just before or just after his return to the ship .  try as he might  he did not remember seeing the ship coming for him at any time  nor did he recall the moment of transfer  nor the removal of his plastic suit .     going far enough back  he remembered the despair and loneliness of waiting to explode and die .  going far enough forward  he remembered looking up at the concerned face of sophia kaliinin bending over him .  there was nothing in between .     hadn t this happened already .  the two incidents  joined by kaliinin s care for him  were separated by several hours in time  but melted into one .     he said in a hoarse and almost unintelligible voice   are we headed in the right direction .   he said it in english .     kaliinin hesitated  then answered slowly  also in english and with a moderately heavy accent   yes  albert  but that was some time ago  when we were in the capillary .  you came back and then went out a second time .  we are in a neuron now .  remember .      morrison frowned .  what was all this .     slowly  in bits  his memory returned .  he closed his eyes and tried to get it all straight .  then he said   how did you find me .   he spoke in russian now .     konev said   i sensed    quite strongly    the thought waves of shapirov as it came through your instrument .       my computer .  is it safe .      konev said   it was still attached to you .  did you make out actual thoughts .       actual thoughts .   morrison stared at him fuzzily .   what actual thoughts .  what are you talking about .      konev was clearly impatient  but he set his lips tightly together and then said   i could make out shapirov s thought waves reaching me across the cell by way of your device  but there were no actual words or images .       what did you sense  then .       anguish .      boranova said   the rest of us sensed nothing at all  but it seemed to us that what yuri described was the anguish of a mind that knew it was in a comatose trap  that knew it was a prisoner .  did you sense anything more specific than that .       no .   morrison looked down upon himself and realized that he was sprawled across two seats  his head was in the crook of kaliinin s arms  and that he was in his one piece cotton suit .  he tried to struggle upright .   water  please .      he drank thirstily  then said   i don t recall hearing anything or sensing anything .  in my position        konev said sharply   what has your position to do with it .  your computer was transmitting information .  i sensed it at a considerable distance .  how would it be possible for you not to sense anything .       i had other things to think about  yuri .  i was lost and i was sure of death .  under the circumstances  i paid no attention to anything else .       i can t believe that  albert .  don t lie to me .       i am not lying to you .     madame boranova .   he managed to pronounce the name very formally .   i demand that i be treated in a courteous manner .       yuri   said boranova sharply .   don t make accusations .  if you have questions to ask  ask them .      konev said   then let me put it this way .  i sensed a great deal of emotion  even though i was far from the instrument in terms of our miniaturized state .  you  albert  were right on top of your device and it was keyed to your brain  not mine .  our brains are of similar type  presumably  but they are not identical and you can sense on your instrument more sharply than i can .  how is it possible  then  that i could sense so much and that you should nevertheless claim to have sensed nothing .      morrison said strenuously   do you think i had time or inclination for sensing .  i was swept away from the ship .  i was separated  alone  lost .       i understand that  but you need make no special effort to sense .  the sensations would invade your mind despite anything that might be taking place .       i received no sensations just the same .  what filled my mind was that i was alone and i was going to die .  how is it possible you don t understand that .  i thought i would heat up and die  as i almost did the first time .   a sudden doubt assailed him and he looked across at kaliinin .   there were two times  weren t there .       yes  albert   she said softly .      and then i realized i wasn t heating up .  instead  it seemed to me that i was growing larger and smaller    oscillating .  i was involved in some sort of miniaturization transfer in place of heat transfer .  is that possible  natalya .      boranova hesitated  then said   that effect follows naturally from the field equations of miniaturization .  it has never been tested  but apparently you confirmed it while out there .       it seemed to me that my surroundings were oscillating in size  that the water molecules all around me were expanding and contracting  and it seemed to me to be more logical that it was i who was oscillating  rather than that everything else was .       you were correct and what you report is valuable .  one might argue from this that the turmoil of the event to you was not without its compensation in a larger sense .      konev said indignantly   albert  you tell us that you were perfectly capable of careful and rational thought out there    and yet you expect us to believe that you sensed nothing .      morrison raised his voice   can t you understand  you monomaniac  that it was this very careful and rational thought  as you call it  that filled my mind to the exclusion of everything else .  i was in absolute terror .  i expected  with each contraction of the molecules around me  that contraction would continue indefinitely  which would mean  in actual fact  that i would expand indefinitely  that  in other words  i would undergo spontaneous deminiaturization and explode and die .  i was not in the least concerned with sensing thought waves at that moment .  if any had forced themselves on me  i would  in my condition then  have ignored them .  that is the truth .      konev twisted his face into an expression of scorn .   if i had an important job to do and if a firing squad had their weapons trained on me  then in the few moments before they fired  i would still concentrate on my job .      dezhnev muttered   as my father used to say   anyone can hunt a bear fearlessly when the bear is absent .       konev turned on him fiercely   i ve had enough of your father  you old drunkard .      dezhnev said   repeat that to me when we are safely back in the grotto and you will then find you are hunting the bear when the bear is present .      boranova said   not another word  yuri .  are you intent on quarreling with everyone .       natalya  i m intent on doing my job .  albert must go out again .       no   said morrison in terror .   never .      dezhnev  who glared at konev less than lovingly  said   a hero of the soviet union is heard from .  he must do his job  so albert must go out into the cell again .      boranova said   dezhnev is right  yuri .  you boast that even a firing squad would not interrupt your duty .  go out once  then  as albert has done twice .      konev said   it is his machine .  it is keyed to his brain .       so i understand   said boranova   but you  as you yourself say  have the same brain type .  at least you could sense what he sensed .  certainly you sensed the skeptic waves when he was lost in the intercellular current .  and you were at a distance .  with the machine in your very hand and yourself outside  you would gather data of your own  which should be more valuable to us  in any case .  of what use would it be to have albert s keener perception if you insist on disbelieving whatever he says .      all were staring at konev now .  even kaliinin managed to look at him at intervals through her long lashes .     then morrison coughed slightly and said   i m afraid i urinated into the suit .  a little .  not much  i think .  terror has its price .       i know   said boranova .   i ve drained it and cleaned it as well as i could .  that shouldn t stop yuri .  a little bit of urine residue will surely not stop the dedication to duty of a man like him .      konev said   i resent this clumsy sarcasm on the part of all of you  but i ll go out into the cell .  do you really think i m afraid of doing that .  my only thought to the contrary has been that albert is the best receiver .  still  i am second best  certainly  and if he will not do it  then i will  provided        he paused and dezhnev said   provided the bear is not there  eh  yuri  my hero .      konev said bitterly   no  old sot  provided that i am held firmly to the ship .  albert was torn loose because he was attached feebly  a poor job on the part of the one in charge of that department .  i want no poor jobs done on me .      kaliinin said to no one  her eyes on her fingertips   albert must have struck a structure in such a way as to exactly fit it  electrically speaking .  the chance of that happening was very low .  even so  i shall try to make use of an odd pattern on the ship and the suit in order to reduce the odds as far as i can manage .      konev nodded .   i ll accept that   he said to boranova .  then  to morrison   you say there is no heat transfer .      morrison said   none that i could detect .  just size oscillation .       then i won t bother removing my garment .      boranova said   you understand  yuri  that you won t stay out long .  we cannot stretch the risk of deminiaturization indefinitely .       i understand   said konev and with morrison s help he clambered into the suit .        .     morrison looked through the hull of the ship and watched konev .     twice it had been the other way around .  he had been outside looking in .   and for a while  that second time  he had been nowhere looking nowhere .      morrison felt a little chagrined that konev seemed so composed .  konev did not turn to look into the ship .  he held morrison s computer in his hands  following morrison s hasty instructions on the elementary aspects of expanding and focusing .  he seemed entirely intent on his job .  was he really that icily brave .  would he continue to concentrate even if he were ripped loose as morrison had been .  probably    and morrison felt ashamed of himself .     he looked at the others on the ship .     dezhnev remained at his controls .  he had to stay near the membrane of the cell .  he had suggested moving into the doldrums between the two streams .  nearly motionless as they would then be  probably turning in a slow eddy  actually   they would not risk the kind of accident that had torn morrison loose .  konev had vetoed that at once .  it was along the membrane that the skeptic waves moved and he wanted to be near them .     dezhnev had also suggested turning the ship upside down .  up and down made no difference here in the cell  any more than it did in outer space .  by turning upside down  the air lock would be on the side of the ship away from the membrane and that might keep konev away from cytoskeletal structures .     that merely angered konev .  he pointed out that such structures might be anywhere in the cell and that  in any case  he did not want the bulk of the ship between himself and the membrane .     so he was out there  in just the way he wanted  and dezhnev  paying close attention to his controls  whistled very softly to himself .     boranova watched her instrument  looking up only occasionally to gaze thoughtfully at konev .  kaliinin was fidgety .  it was the only word .  her eyes shifted toward konev a hundred times and they shifted away as many times .     boranova said suddenly   albert  it s your instrument .  do you think yuri can work it .  do you think he s getting anything .      morrison smiled briefly .   i preset it for him .  there isn t much further for him to do and i explained the focusing .  just the same  i know he isn t getting anything  natalya .       how can you know that .       if he were to sense something  i would overhear it    or oversense it  perhaps i should say    as he oversensed me when i was out in the stream .  i sense nothing  absolutely nothing .      boranova looked surprised .   but could that be .  if he sensed something when you held it  why shouldn t he sense something when he holds it .       perhaps conditions have changed .  consider that all this agony that konev says he detected when he followed my machine s broadcast of shapirov s thoughts to me .  that was not characteristic of what we heard before .       i know .  it had been almost idyllic before .  green fields .  mathematical equations .       can it be  then  that the living part of shapirov s brain  if it is capable of consciousness  has just recently recognized its comatose position  that it has done so in the last hour  perhaps         why should that have happened in the last hour .  that s too much of a coincidence that it should do so now  just as we are in the brain .       perhaps we have stimulated the brain by actually being in it  and brought the realization about in consequence .  or  perhaps it is a coincidence .  the funny thing about coincidences is that they do happen .     and perhaps the realization that struck him with anguish not long ago has now caused him to sink into silent apathy .      boranova looked uncertain .   i still can t believe that .  do you really think yuri s not getting anything .       nothing of any significance .  i am quite certain .       perhaps i should call him in .       i would if i were you  natalya .  he s been out nearly ten minutes .  if he isn t getting anything  that s time enough .       but what if he s getting something .       then he ll refuse to come in .  you know konev .      boranova said   tap on the hull of the ship  albert .  you re nearest his face .      morrison did so and konev looked in their direction .  his face was blurred through the plastic headpiece but he wore an unmistakable frown .  boranova gestured for him to come in .     konev hesitated  then nodded  and morrison said to boranova   there s your proof .      konev was brought in and they could see his face was flushed .  they unbuckled his helmet and he drew in a deep breath .      whew .  that s good .  it was getting a little warm out there .  since i was attached to the ship  the size oscillation was less than i expected and the heat transfer was perceptible .     help me get the rest of this plastic armor off .      boranova said in a sudden small spasm of hope   is that why you were ready to come in .  the heat .       that was certainly the chief reason .       did you sense anything  yuri .      and konev scowled and said   no .  not a thing .  nothing .      morrison lifted his head .  a muscle in his right cheek twitched briefly  but he did not smile .        .      well  natasha  little captain   said dezhnev with an air of faded bonhomie .   what do we do next .  any ideas .      he received no answer  in fact  no one seemed to notice that he had spoken .     konev was still mopping away at his chest and at the back of his neck .  his look at morrison had no bonhomie in it at all .  his dark eyes smoldered .   there was a great deal of transmission out there when you were outside the ship .       if you say so   said morrison coldly   but i told you that i don t remember a thing about it .       maybe it does make a difference who holds the device .       i don t believe that .       science is not a matter of belief  but of evidence .  why don t we see what happens when you go out holding your own device exactly as i did .  we ll have you bound firmly so that you don t come loose again and you can stay out the same ten minutes i did .  no more .      morrison said   i won t do it .  that s already been tried .       and i sensed shapirov s thoughts    even if you say you didn t .       you did not sense his thoughts .  you sensed only emotion .  there were no words .       because you let go of the device .  you admitted that yourself .  try it now  without letting go .       no .  it won t work .       you were frightened because you were torn loose .  this time you will not be torn loose  as i was not .  you will not be frightened .       you underestimate my capacity for terror  yuri   said morrison  shrugging .     konev looked disgusted .   is this a time to joke .       i m not joking .  i m easily terrified .  i lack your    whatever .      courage .       all right .  if you want an admission i lack courage  i ll admit it .      konev turned to look at boranova .   natalya .  you are the captain .  direct albert to try once more .       i don t think i can direct him under these conditions   said boranova .   as he himself has said  what good will it do if we combine our strength  force him into the suit  and shove him out .  if he is incapable of doing anything  we ll get nothing out of it .  however  i can ask him .     albert .       save your breath   said morrison wearily .      once more .  not more than three minutes by the clock unless you get a transmission .       we won t .  i m convinced we won t .       then only three minutes to prove the point .      morrison said   to what end  natalya .  if i get nothing  yuri will say i am deliberately misadjusting my computer .  if there is no trust between us  we will accomplish nothing in any case .  how would it be  for instance  if i displayed konev s conviction that to disagree is to lie .  i say i sensed nothing of either shapirov s thoughts or emotions when i was alone in the intracellular stream .  konev said he sensed a great deal .  who else did .  did you  natalya .       no .  i sensed nothing .       sophia .      kaffinin shook her head .      arkady .      dezhnev said in an aggrieved tone   i do not seem to be able to sense very much .      morrison said   well  then  yuri stands alone .  how are we to know he really sensed anything .  i shall not be as unkind as he is .  i shall not accuse him of lying    but isn t it possible that his wild desire to sense something caused him to imagine he had .      konev s face was white with anger  but his voice  except for a slight tremor  was cool enough .   forget all that .  we have spent hours in this body and i m asking for one last observation  one last experiment  that may justify all that has gone before .       no   said morrison .   last pays all .  i ve heard that before .      boranova said   albert  this time there will be no mistake .  one last experiment .      dezhnev said   it would have to be a last experiment .  our power supply is lower than i would like it to be .  finding you was costly  albert .       yet we did find you   said konev   and without counting the cost .  i found you .   he suddenly smiled tightly and fiercely .   and i wouldn t have found you if i did not detect the transmissions emanating from your device .  it would have been impossible .  there s the proof that what i sensed was not imaginary .  and since i found you  pay me back .      morrison s nostrils flared .   you came after me because my explosion would have killed you all in a matter of minutes  perhaps .  what payment do you expect for your anxiety to save your own li      the ship rocked violently without warning .  it swayed heavily and konev  who had been standing  tottered and caught at the back of his seat .      what was it .   called out boranova  clutching with one hand at her own control device .     kaliinin bent over her computer .   i caught a glimpse  but you can t tell in this light .  it may have been a ribosome .       a ribosome   repeated morrison in astonishment .      why not .  they re scattered all over the cell .  they re the protein manufacturing organelles .       i know what they are   said morrison indignantly .      so it landed us a blow .  or rather  as we skimmed along  we landed it a blow .  it doesn t matter which way you look at it  we just had a giant piece of brownian motion .       worse than that   said dezhnev  pointing outward in horror .   we re not getting heat transfer  we re getting field oscillation .      morrison  staring in despair  recognized the phenomenon he had seen when alone in the cell .  the water molecules were expanding and contracting    visibly so .      stop it .  stop it .   shouted konev .      i m trying to   said boranova through tight lips .   arkady  shut off the jets and make all the power available to me .     shut off the air conditioning  lights  everything .      boranova bent over the tiny glow that marked her battery powered computer .     morrison could see nothing except for the light from boranova s computer and  in the seat next to him  kaliinin s .  he could not see  in the otherwise total darkness of a cell buried in the interior of a brain  the water molecules swelling and subsiding .     there was no uncertainty about it  however .  he could feel the jarring in the pit of his stomach .  it was not the water molecules that were oscillating  after all .  it was the miniaturization field that was    and the objects that were buried in it    and he himself .     each time the ship expanded  and the water molecules seemed to contract   the field converted some of its energy to heat and he could feel the flush that swept over him .  then  as boranova forced energy into the field  squeezing it into contraction  the heat vanished .  for a while  he could feel the oscillations slow and subside .     but then they began to grow wilder and he knew that boranova was failing .  she could not fend off the spontaneous deminiaturization that was on the way and  in ten seconds  he knew he would be dead .  he    and all of them  and the body in which they were buried    would be an exploding puff of water vapor and carbon dioxide .     he felt dizzy .  he was going to faint and  in his pusillanimous way  he would thus anticipate death by a second and his last recognizable emotion would be one of intense shame .        .     the seconds passed and morrison didn t faint .  he stirred a little .  he should be dead by now  shouldn t he .   it was inevitable that the next thought should come  can there be an afterlife after all .     he dismissed the possibility quickly .      he was aware of someone sobbing .  no .  it was harsh breathing .     he opened his eyes  he hadn t realized they were closed  and found himself staring at kaliinin in the dim light .  since all the energy available was being pumped into the effort to keep the ship from deminiaturizing  he saw her only by the glow of her own computer .  he could make out her head bent over it  her hair in disarray and her breath whistling sharply through her parted lips .     he looked around in a sudden renewal of hope and thought and life .  the ship s oscillations seemed less extreme .  they were settling downward into a kind of peace even as he watched .     and then cautiously  kaliinin stopped and looked up sidewise at him  her face twitching into a painful smile .   it is done   she said in a hoarse whisper .     the light within the ship brightened slowly  almost tentatively  and dezhnev uttered a huge shuddering sigh .   if i am not dead now   he said   i hope to live yet a little while .  as my father once said   life would be unbearable if death were not worse yet .      thank you  natasha .  you may be my captain forever .       not i   said boranova  her face looking very old    to the point where morrison would not have been surprised to see white streaks in her black hair .   i simply couldn t pump enough energy into the ship .  was it something you did  sophia .      kaliinin s eyes were closed now  but her breasts were still heaving .  she stirred a little  as though reluctant to answer  reluctant to do anything but savor life for a time .  then she said   i don t know .  maybe .      boranova said   what did you do .      kaliinin said   i couldn t just wait for death .  i made the ship the electric duplicate of a d glucose molecule and hoped the cell would do the normal thing and interact with a molecule of atp    adenosine triphosphate .  in doing so  it gained a phosphate group and energy .  the energy  i hoped  would go into reinforcing the miniaturization field .  i then neutralized the ship and the phosphate group fell off .  d glucose again  another gain in energy  then neutral  and so on  over and over .   she stopped to pant a bit .   over and over .  my fingers were working so fast  i didn t know if i were hitting the right keys or not    but i must have .  and the ship gained enough energy to stabilize the field .      boranova said   how did you come to do that .  no one has ever suggested in my hearing that this might         nor in mine   said kaliinin .   nor in mine .  i was just wondering this morning before we got on the ship what i would do    or what anyone could do    if spontaneous deminiaturization began .  we d need energy  but if the ship couldn t pump up enough    i thought  could the cell itself supply the energy .  if it did  it would only be through atp  which every cell has .  i didn t know if it would work .  i had to spend energy  forcing the electrical pattern on and off the ship  and i knew i might spend more than i got from atp .  or the energy of the atp might simply not affect the ship in such a way as to counter the deminiaturization .  it was all such a gamble .      dezhnev said    softly  almost as though to himself   as my old father would say   if you have nothing to lose  gamble freely .    then  briskly  he said   thank you  little sophia .  my life is yours from now on .  i will give it to you at your need .  i will go farther .  i will even marry you if that would strike you as convenient .       a chivalrous offer   said kaliinin  smiling faintly   but i wouldn t ask marriage of you .  your mere life    at need    would be quite enough .      boranova was entirely herself now and she said   this will be cited in detail in the final report .  your quick thinking and your quick action saved everything .      morrison couldn t trust himself to make any speech at all .   unaccountably  he felt near tears .     in gratitude for life .  in admiration for kaliinin .   all he could do was reach for kaliinin s hand  put it to his lips  and kiss it .  then  after clearing his throat vigorously  he said with extraordinary mildness   thank you  sophia .      she looked embarrassed  but did not draw her hand away immediately .  she said   it might not have worked .  i didn t think it would work .       had it not   said dezhnev   we would be no deader .      through all this  only yuri konev had not said a word and morrison turned to look at him .  he sat as he usually sat  very upright and very much turned away from them .     morrison  finding his voice suddenly    and his anger    said   well  yuri  what have you to say .      konev looked over his shoulder briefly and said   nothing .       nothing .  sophia saved the expedition .      konev shrugged   she did her job .       her job .  she did much more than her job .   morrison leaned forward and reached wildly for konev  grabbing his shoulder .   she invented the technique that saved us .  and in doing so  she saved your life  you idiot .  she s the reason you re still alive .  you can at least thank her .       i ll do as i please   said konev  twitching his shoulder and then writhing out of morrison s grasp .     morrison s hands found their way around konev s throat .   you miserable  egotistical barbarian   he grunted out  squeezing desperately .   you love her in your own insane way and you won t give her a kind word .  not one kind word  you piece of dirt .      again konev pulled himself loose and then the two were pummeling each other clumsily .  they were half trapped by the seats from which they had partly risen and neither could maneuver properly under zero gravity conditions .     kaliinin screamed   don t hurt him .      he won t hurt me  thought morrison  striving mightily .  he had not been engaged in this kind of physical combat since he was sixteen and  he thought in embarrassment  he wasn t doing any better now .     boranova s voice rang out sharply .   stop it .  both of you .      and they did .  both of them .     boranova said   albert  you are not here to teach anyone manners .  and yuri  you need not labor to be a boor  it comes natural to you .  if you do not wish to acknowledge sophia s        sophia said with an obvious effort   i m not asking for thanks    from anyone .       thanks .   said konev angrily .   let us all say thanks .  before the deminiaturization started  i was trying to get this american coward to thank us for rescuing him .  i didn t want thanks in words .  this isn t a dance floor .  we needn t bow and curtsy .  i wanted him to show his thanks by getting out there and trying to sense some of shapirov s thoughts .  he refused .  who is he to teach me how and when to say thanks .      morrison said   i said before the deminiaturization that i wouldn t do it and i repeat that now .      dezhnev interrupted and said   we beat a dead horse here .  we have consumed our energy supply as though it were vodka at a wedding .  between pursuits and deminiaturizations  we have very little to spare for the task of deminiaturizing under controlled conditions .  we must get out now .      konev said   it would take very little energy to have this man go out for a couple of minutes and come in again .  then we can leave .      for a moment  konev and morrison stared at each other hostilely and then dezhnev said in a voice that seemed drained of some of its life   my poor old father used to say   the most frightening phrase in the russian language is  that s odd .        konev turned angrily and said   shut up  arkady .      dezhnev replied   i mentioned that only because it is now time for me to say it  that s odd .         .     boranova pushed her dark hair back from her forehead  a bit wearily  morrison thought  and noted the hair itself was clearly damp with perspiration  .  she said   what is odd  arkady .  let us not play games .       the current flow of the cellular material is slowing .      there was a brief silence  then boranova said   how can you tell .      dezhnev said heavily   natasha  dear  if you sat in my seat you would know that there are fibers criss crossing the cell         the cytoskeleton   put in morrison .      thank you  albert  my child   said dezhnev with a grand wave of his hand .   my father used to say   it is more important to know the thing than the name .   still  never mind .  the whatever   you   call   it doesn t stop the cell flow and it doesn t stop the ship  but i can see it glint past .  well  it s glinting past more slowly now .  i assume the fibers don t move  so i take it we re slowing .  and since i m not doing anything to slow the ship  i assume that it is the intracellular flow that is really slowing .     this is called logic  albert  so you don t have to educate me on that point .      kaliinin said in a small voice   i think we have damaged the cell .   she sounded conscience stricken .     morrison took it so and said   one brain cell gone  more or less  won t hurt shapirov in any way  especially in the condition he s in .  i wouldn t be surprised if the cell were gone  though .  after all  the ship came after me in a furious race  i imagine    and i thank you all again for that    and it probably vibrated itself nearly to death and must have vibrated the entire cell as well .      konev said  frowning darkly   that s mad .  we re molecule sized    and a small molecule at that .  do you suppose anything we can do  whether moving or jiggling  is going to damage an entire cell .      morrison said   we don t have to reason it out  yuri .  it s an observed fact .  the intracellular stream is stopping and that isn t normal .       in the first place  that s just arkady s impression   said konev   and he s no neurologist         do i have to be a neurologist to have eyes .   demanded dezhnev hotly  one arm raised as though to strike at the younger man .     konev cast a brief glance at dezhnev  but made no other acknowledgment of his remark .  he said   and besides  we don t know what is normal in a living brain cell from this level of observation .  there may be calms and eddies in the flow  so that even if something like this is observed  it might be only temporary .       you re whistling past the graveyard  yuri   said morrison .   the fact is  we can t use this cell any more and we don t have sufficient remaining energy to wander around searching for another cell .      konev ground his teeth .   there must be something we can do .  we can t give up .      morrison said   natalya  make the decision .  is there any point in investigating this cell any further .  and are we in a position to seek out another cell .      boranova raised her hand and bowed her head in a moment of thought .  the others turned to look at her and konev seized the opportunity to grasp morrison by the upper arm and pull him closer .  his eyes were dark with hostility .  he whispered   how is it you think i am in love with     he jerked his head in kaliinin s direction .   what gives you the right to think so .  tell me that .      morrison looked at him blankly .     at this point  boranova spoke  but it was not to answer morrison s question .  she said mildly   arkady  what is it you are doing .      dezhnev  who was bent over his controls  lifted his head .   i am rearranging the wiring back to what it was .  i am hooking up communications again .      boranova said   have i told you to do that .      dezhnev said   necessity has told me to do that .      konev said   does it occur to you it will be impossible to steer .      dezhnev growled and said in sullen irony   and does it occur to you that there may be no more steering to do .       what is the necessity that drives you  arkady .   said boranova patiently .     dezhnev said   i don t think it s this cell alone that is out of order .  the temperature around us is going down .     slowly .      konev sneered .   by your measurements .       no .  by the ship s measurements .  by the background infrared radiation we re getting .       you can t tell anything by that   said konev .   at our size  we get very few infrared photons .  the level would vary all over the lot .      dezhnev nodded at konev and said   like this .   his hand waved up and down frenetically .   still  it can wave up and down like a rowboat in a typhoon and yet do so at a lower and lower average level .   and his hand sank ever lower as it continued its trembling .     boranova said   why should the temperature be dropping .      morrison smiled grimly .   come on  natalya .  i think you know why .  i know that yuri knows why .  arkady must find out and for that reason necessity is forcing him to put back communications .      an uncomfortable silence fell  except for dezhnev s occasional grunts and muttered expletives as he struggled with the ship s wiring .     morrison gazed out at the surroundings  which he could once again see in the usual unsatisfactory fashion now that ship s lighting had been restored .  there were the usual dim glitter of molecules  large and small  that traveled with them .  now that dezhnev had mentioned it  he saw the occasional reflection of light from a line that stretched across the path before them and then moved over  or under  and behind at express speed .     these were  undoubtedly  very thin collagen fibers that preserved the shape of the irregular neuron and kept it from converting itself into a roughly spherical blob under the pull of its own surface tension .  had he been watching for it  he would have noticed it before .  it occurred to him that dezhnev  as navigator  had to watch for everything and  in the entirely unprecedented situation in which the ship found itself  dezhnev had had no guide  no instruction  no experience to let him know what to watch for .  there was no question but that dezhnev s task had placed him under greater tension than the others had allowed for .     certainly  to morrison himself  dezhnev had been taken for granted as the least of the five .  not fair  morrison thought now .     dezhnev had straightened up now .  he had an earphone in one ear canal and said   i should be able to establish communication .   he said   are you there .  grotto .    grotto .      then he smiled .   yes .  we are  to this point  safe .     i m sorry  but as i told you  it was either communicate or steer .     how is it at your end .     what .  repeat that  more slowly .     yes  i thought so .      he turned to the others .   comrades   he said   academician pyotr leonovich shapirov is dead .  thirteen minutes ago  all vital signs ceased and our task now is to leave the body .        chapter       exit    if trouble were as easy to get out of as into    life would be one sweet song .        dezhnev senior       .     a gray silence fell over the ship .     kaliinin buried her face in her hands and then  after a long moment  broke the silence by whispering   are you sure  arkady .      and dezhnev  blinking hard to hold back tears  said   am i sure .  the man has been on the brink of death for weeks .  the cellular flow is slowing  the temperature is falling  and the grotto  which has him wired with every instrument ever invented  says he is dead .  what is there to be but sure .      boranova sighed .   poor shapirov .  he deserved a better death .      konev said   he might have held out another hour .      boranova said with a frown   he did not pick and choose  yuri .      morrison felt chilled .  until now he had been conscious of some surrounding red corpuscles  of a specific speck of intercellular region  of the interior of a neuron .  his environment had been circumscribed to the immediate .     now he looked out of the ship  through its transparent plastic walls  at what appeared to him  for the first time  to be thickness upon thickness of matter .  on their present scale  with the ship the size of a glucose molecule and himself not much more than the size of an atom  the body of shapirov was larger than the planet earth .     here he was  then  buried in a planetary object of dead organic matter .  he felt impatience over the pause for mourning .  time for that later  but meanwhile    he said in a voice that was perhaps a little louder than it ought to have been   how do we get out .      boranova looked at him in surprise  eyes widening .   morrison was certain that in her grief for shapirov the thought of leaving had been momentarily buried .      she cleared her throat and made a visible effort to be her usual businesslike self .  she said   we must deminiaturize to some extent  to begin with .      morrison said   why only to begin with .  why not deminiaturize all the way to normality right now .   then  as though to forestall the inevitable objection   we will inflict damage on shapirov s body  but it is a dead body and we are still alive .  our needs come first .      kaliinin looked at morrison reproachfully .   even a dead body deserves respect  albert  especially the dead body of a great scientist like academician pyotr shapirov .       yes  but surely not to the entent of risking five lives .   morrison s impatience was growing .  shapirov was only someone he had known by distant reputation and peripherally    to morrison he was not the demigod he seemed to be to the others .     dezhnev said   aside from the question of respect  we are enclosed by shapirov s cranium .  if we expand to fill that cranium and then try to crumble the cranium by the effect of our miniaturization field  we will lose too much energy and deminiaturize explosively .  we must first find our way out of the cranium .      boranova said   albert is right .  let s begin .  i will deminiaturize to cell size .  arkady  have the people in the grotto determine our exact position .  yuri  make sure you locate that position accurately on your cerebrograph .      morrison stared out the hull at the distant cell membrane    a brighter and more continuous sparkle  one that was visible through the occasional flicker of light from the intervening molecules .     the first indication of deminiaturization was the fact that the molecules    subsided .   it was the only word morrison could think of to describe what happened .      it was as though the little curved swellings that filled the space around them    and which morrison s brain constructed out of twinklings rather than saw directly    shrank .  it was for all the world as though they were balloons with the air being let out of them until the surroundings seemed relatively smooth .     but even as the liquid around them grew smooth  the large macromolecules in the distance    the proteins  the nucleic acids  the still larger cellular structures    also shrank and  in doing so  grew more distinct .  the sparks of light they reflected were more closely spaced .     the cell membrane itself seemed to be approaching and it  too  could be seen more clearly .  it came closer still and yet closer .  the ship was  after all  in a narrow dendrite that projected from the cell body itself and if the ship was going to enlarge to the size of a cell  it would have to grow much larger than this mere projection .     it was clear that the membrane was going to collide with the ship and morrison automatically clenched his teeth and steeled himself for the shock of impact .     there was none .  the membrane came closer and closer and then simply separated and was not there .  it was too thin a structure and too lightly bound to withstand the consequences of being forced into a miniaturization field .  though the ship was derniniaturizing to an extent  it was still far  far smaller than the normal world around it and the molecules of the membrane  on entering the field and shrinking  lost contact with each other so that the integrity of the whole vanished .     morrison watched everything after that with fascination .  the surroundings seemed chaotic until  as objects continued to shrink  he began to recognize the intercellular jungle of collagen that they had encountered before entering the neuron .  that jungle continued to shrink  in its turn  until the collagen trunks and cables became nothing more than twine .     boranova said   and that is all .  we will want to be able to fit within a small vein .      dezhnev grunted .   that is all under any circumstances .  our remaining energy supply is not great .      boranova said   it will last until we find our way out of the cranium  surely .      dezhnev said   we can hope so .  however  you re only the captain of the ship  natasha  you are not the captain of the laws of thermodynamics .      boranova shook her head as though in reproof and said   arkady  have them determine our position    and don t lecture me .      konev said   i m certain  natalya  that it is not terribly important to determine our position .  it cannot be measurably different from what it was when we left the capillary .  all our wanderings since have merely taken us to a nearby neuron and from that to a neighboring neuron .  the difference in position on even an ordinary microscopic scale is scarcely measurable .      and then  after a wait of several minutes  the position came through and konev said   as i told you .      morrison said   what s the good of the position  yuri .  we don t know which way we re headed and we can only go in whatever direction that might be .  now that communications are restored  we can t steer .      konev said   well  then  since there is only one way in which we can head  we will head in that direction .  i m sure that arkady s father had a saying concerning that .      dezhnev said at once   he used to say   when only one course of action is possible  there is no difficulty in deciding what to do .        you see .   said konev .   and we will find that whatever direction we go in  we will find a way out .  move ahead  arkady .      the ship moved forward  ploughing through the now fragile threads of collagen  splashing through a neuron  and cutting across a thin axon .   it was hard to believe they were recently inside one of those axons and that it had seemed like a highway a hundred kilometers across .      morrison said dryly   suppose that shapirov was still alive when it became necessary for us to leave his body .  what would we have done .       what do you mean .   said boranova .      i mean  what alternative is there to this .  would we not have had to determine our position .  and to do that  would we not have had to establish communications .  and once that was done  would we not have been able to move in only one direction    forward .  would we not have had to deminiaturize in order not to have to travel the equivalent of tens of thousands of kilometers  but merely the equivalent of a few kilometers .  in short  in order to get out  would we not have had to push our way through the living neurons of a living shapirov  as we are now pushing our way through dying and dead ones .      boranova said   well    yes .       where  then  is the respect for a living body .  after all  we actually hesitated to violate the integrity of a dead one .       you must understand  albert  that this is an emergency operation with an inadequate ship .  we have no choice .  and  in any case  it is not like your suggestion that we deminiaturize completely in the brain  smashing the cranium and leaving shapirov headless .  our present course  even if shapirov was alive  would destroy a dozen neurons    or possibly a hundred    and that would not have been likely to make shapirov s condition appreciably worse .  brain neurons are continually dying throughout life    like red corpuscles .       not quite   said morrison grimly .   red corpuscles are continually replaced .  neurons never are .      konev interrupted  his voice rather loud  as though he were impatiently overriding the idle talk of others .   arkady  stop .  we need another position determination .      there was at once a dead silence within the ship  one that continued    as though any speech might interfere with the measurements being made in the grotto or might hamper the concentration of those making the measurement .     finally dezhnev whispered the measurements to konev  who said   confirm them  arkady .  make sure you have them right .      morrison unclasped himself .  he was still virtually without mass  but there was distinctly more of it than there had been when they were maneuvering within the cell .  he pulled himself cautiously upward  so that he could see the cerebrograph over konev s shoulder .     there were two red spots on it  with a thin red line connecting them .  the map displayed on the screen condensed a bit  the two dots shrinking toward each other  and then it expanded again in a different orientation .     konev s fingers worked busily over the computer keys and the map grew double and uninterpretable .  morrison knew  however  that konev could view it through a device that would render it stereoscopic  displaying a third dimension .     konev laid down that device and said   natalya  this time chance is on our side .  wherever we are and in whatever direction we were traveling  we d be bound to encounter a small vein sooner or later .  in this case  it is sooner .  we are not far away and we will strike it in such a way that we will be able to enter .      morrison heaved an internal sigh of relief  but could not help saying   and what would you have done if chance had dictated a vein very far away .      konev said coolly   then i would have had dezhnev break communications again and steer to a closer one .      dezhnev  however  turned to stare at morrison  made a grimace of disagreement  and mouthed the words   not enough energy .       move forward  arkady   said boranova peremptorily   and get to the vein .      after a few minutes  dezhnev said   yuri s map is right  which i wouldn t have bet on with any enthusiasm .  that s it ahead .      morrison found himself staring at a curving wall reaching into the indefinite haze upward and downward and with just a faint suggestion of tiling to it .  if it was a vein  it was as yet not very far removed from a capillary .  morrison wondered uneasily if the ship would be able to fit inside it .        .     boranova said   is there any way  sophia  that you can give the ship an electric charge pattern that will slip us into the vein .      kaliinin looked doubtful and morrison  holding up his hand  said   i don t think so  natalya .  the individual cells may not be entirely dead even now  but certainly the organization within them has been destroyed .  i don t think any cell in the body can take us in by pinocytosis or by any other means .      what do i do  then .   said dezhnev unhappily   force my way in .       of course   said konev .   lean against the vein wall .  a small bit of it will then miniaturize and disintegrate and you can move in .  you won t have to use your motors much .       ah   said dezhnev   the expert speaks .  the vein will miniaturize and disintegrate at the expense of our field and that would take energy  too    more energy than forcing our way in would .       arkady   said boranova   don t be angry .  this is not the time for it .  use your motors moderately and take advantage of the first weakening of the vein wall through miniaturization to burst through .  using both techniques will consume less energy than either separately .       we can hope so   said dezhnev   but saying so doesn t make it so .  when i was little  my father said to me once   vehemence  my little son  is no guarantee of truth .   he told me this when i swore with great earnestness that i had not broken his pipe .  he asked me if i understood the statement .  i said i didn t and he explained it to me very carefully .  then he walloped me .       yes  arkady   said boranova   but move in now .      konev said   it s not as though you re going to flood the brain with blood .  it wouldn t matter now that shapirov is dead  but  as it happens  the blood isn t flowing now .  virtually nothing will leak .       ah   said dezhnev   this raises an interesting point .  ordinarily  once we enter a vein  the blood flow would carry us in a particular direction .  without blood flow  i must use my engines    but in which direction must we go .       once we penetrate at this point   said konev calmly   you will turn to the right .  so my cerebrograph says .       but if there is no current to turn me to the right and if i enter at an angle to the left .       arkady  you will enter at an angle to the right .  my cerebrograph tells me that  too .  just push in  will you .       go ahead  arkady   said boranova .   we have no choice but to rely on yuri s cerebrograph .      the ship moved forward and  as the prow touched the vein wall  morrison could feel the slight vibration of the laboring motors .  and then the wall simply gave and pulled away in all directions and the ship was inside .     dezhnev stopped the motors at once .  the ship moved in at a rapidly slowing pace  rebounded off the far wall  maintaining contact so briefly as to cause no damage that morrison could see   and straightened out with the long axis of the ship along the enormous tunnel of the vein .  the ship s width was better than half the width of the blood vessel .      well   said dezhnev   are we pointed in the right direction .  if we re not  there s nothing to be done .  i can t back up .  we fit the vein too tightly for albert to get out and turn us around and we have an insufficient remaining supply of energy to miniaturize further and make such a turn possible .       you re pointed in the right direction   said konev sternly .   just get moving and you ll find out soon enough .  the vessel will get larger as we move .       let s hope it does .     and if it does  how far do we have to travel before we can move out of the body .       i can t say yet   said konev .   i have to follow the vein on my cerebrograph  consult with the people in the grotto  and arrange for the insertion of a hypodermic needle into the vein as close as possible to the position in which we ll be when we emerge from within the cranium .      dezhnev said   may i explain that we cannot move on forever .  what with miniaturizing and deminiaturizing  with steering at very low efficiency  with wrong capillaries  and with chasing after albert when he was lost  we have used up much more energy than we had counted on using .  we had much more energy than we thought we d need  but  even so  we ve almost used it all .      boranova said   do you mean we re out of energy .       just about .  haven t i been telling you this for quite a while .   said dezhnev .   haven t i been warning you we were running low .       but how low are we .  are you saying we don t have enough to carry us out of the cranium .       ordinarily  we would have plenty for that  even now .  if we were in a living vein  we could count on a blood current sweeping us along .  but there is no current .  shapirov is dead and his heart isn t beating .  that means i ll have to force my way through the bloodstream with my motors going and the cooler the stream gets  the more viscous it will become  the harder the motors will have to work  and the more rapidly the energy supply will run out .      konev said   we have only a few centimeters to go .      dezhnev said furiously   only a few .  less than the width of my palm .  really .  at our present size  we ve got kilometers to go .      morrison said   should we deminiaturize further  then .       we can t .   dezhnev was now speaking very loudly .   we don t have the energy for it .  uncontrolled deminiaturization takes no energy  it releases energy .  but controlled deminiaturization    look  albert  if you jump out of a high window  you will reach the ground without effort .  but if you want to survive the ordeal and if you want to be lowered slowly while you hang on to a rope  that takes a great deal of effort .  understand .      morrison muttered   i understand .      kaliinin s hand stole to his and squeezed it gently .  she said in a low voice   don t mind dezhnev .  he grumbles and howls  but he ll get us there .      boranova said   arkady  if vehemence doesn t guarantee truth  as you told us just now  neither does it guarantee a cool head and a solution .  rather  the reverse .  so why don t you just push your way along the vein and perhaps the energy will last until we reach the hypodermic .      dezhnev scowled and said   it s what i will do  but if you want me to keep a cool head  you must let me get rid of some heat .      the ship began to move and morrison thought to himself  every meter we go is a meter closer to the hypodermic needle .     it didn t make much sense as a comforting thought  since to fail to reach the needle by a small distance might be as fatal as to fail by a large distance .  yet it worked to slow the beat of his heart and it gave him a sense of accomplishment as he watched the wall slide rapidly backward .     the red corpuscles and platelets seemed far more numerous now than they had been in the arteries and capillaries on the way in .  then there had been a blood flow and there had been only the relatively few objects in their immediate neighborhood that had moved along the flow with them .  now the various formed bodies were largely motionless and the ship moved past what seemed countless numbers  squeezing them right and left and leaving them behind  bobbing  in their wake .     they even passed an occasional white cell  large and globular and quiescent .  now  though  they were totally unresponsive to the presence of a foreign object speeding by .  in one case  the ship simply whipped through a white cell and left it sprawling behind .     konev said   we are going in the right direction .  the vein is now distinctly wider than it was .      and so it was .  morrison had noticed that without managing to grasp the significance .  he had been too intent on simply moving .     he felt a small surge of hope .  to have been going in the wrong direction would have been total disaster .  the vein would have narrowed and burst  leaving them adrift in gray matter with  perhaps  insufficient fuel to find and reach another vein .     konev was taking down something that dezhnev was repeating to him .  he nodded and said   have them confirm those figures  arkady .     good .      he spent some time with his cerebrograph and then said   listen  they know the vein we re in and they will be inserting a hypodermic needle at a specific spot that i have marked off on the cerebrograph .  we will reach it in half an hour or a little less .     can you keep going for half an hour  arkady .       more likely a little less .  if the heart was beating         yes  i know  but it isn t   said konev .  then he said   natalya  may i have whatever records you have concerning what we have sensed of shapirov s thought processes .  i am going to send the raw data    completeout to the grotto .      boranova said   you mean in case we don t make it out .       that s exactly what i mean .  this material is what we went in for and there s no reason to have it perish with us if we can t get out .       that s a proper attitude  yuri   said boranova .      provided   said konev  his voice suddenly taking on a tinge of anger   the data has any value at all .   briefly  he glared at morrison .     konev then bent toward dezhnev and together the two began electronically transmitting the information they had collected  computer to computer  from tiny to large  from inside a vein to the outside world .     kaliinin was still holding morrison s hand  perhaps as much for comfort to herself as to him  morrison thought .     he said in a low voice   what happens  sophia  if we run out of energy before we reach the needle .      she lifted her eyebrows briefly and said   we ll just have to remain passively in place .  the people in the grotto will try to reach us wherever we are .       we won t deminiaturize explosively as soon as the energy is gone  will we .       oh no .  miniaturization is a metastable state .  you remember we explained that .  we ll stay as we are indefinitely .  eventually    sometime    this chance pseudo brownian motion of expanding and contracting will set up spontaneous deminiaturization  but that might not be for    who knows .       years .       possibly .       that won t do us any good  of course   said morrison .   we ll die of asphyxiation .  without energy  we won t be able to recycle our air supply .       i said the people in the grotto would try to reach us .  our computers will still be working and they can home in on us  cut to the vein and into it  and spot us electronically    or even visually .       how can they find one cell among fifty trillion .      kaliinin patted his hand .   you are in a pessimistic mood  albert .  we re an easily recognizable cell    and a broadcasting one .       i think i would feel better if we find the hypodermic needle now and they don t have to look for us .       so would i .  i am merely pointing out that running out of energy and not finding the needle is not the ultimate end .       and if we do find it .       then we are drawn out and the grotto s own energy sources will be applied to the task of derniniaturizing us .       can t they do it now .       we re too closely surrounded by masses of unminiaturized material and it would be too difficult to focus the deminiaturizing field with sufficient accuracy .  once we are out and visible to them  the conditions will be entirely different .      at this point  dezhnev said   have we transmitted everything  yuri .       yes .  everything .       then it is my duty to tell you that i have only enough energy to continue moving this ship for five minutes .  perhaps less  but certainly not more .         .     morrison  kaliinin s hand still in his  squeezed convulsively and the young woman winced .     morrison said   i m sorry  sophia .      he released her hand and she rubbed it vigorously .     boranova said   where are we  yuri .  can we get to the needle .       i should say yes   said konev .   slow down  arkady .  conserve what energy you have .       no  believe me   said dezhnev .   at the present speed  i am cutting through the blood with comparatively little turbulence  thanks to the streamlining and surface characteristics of the ship .  if i slow down  there ll be more turbulence and energy waste .      konev said   but we don t want to overshoot the mark .       we won t .  any time you want me to cut the motors  we begin to slow down at once because of the blood viscosity .  as we slow down  the turbulence builds  we slow down faster  and in ten seconds we re motionless .  if we had our normal mass and inertia  the rapid pace of slowing would plaster us all up against the front of the ship .       stop when i tell you  then .      morrison had risen and was looking over konev s shoulder again .  the cerebrograph  he judged  must be at enormous expansion  perhaps at maximum .  the thin red line that had marked the path of the ship by dead reckoning was now thick and was approaching a small green circle  which  morrison surmised  must represent the position of the hypodermic needle .     but it was dead reckoning and it could be off a bit .  konev was alternating his gaze between the cerebrograph and the view up ahead of the ship .      we should have aimed for an artery   morrison said suddenly .   they re empty after death .  we wouldn t have had to waste energy on viscosity and turbulence .      konev said   useless idea .  the ship cannot progress through air .   he might have gone on  but at this point he stiffened and cried out   stop  arkady .  stop .      dezhnev hit a knob hard with the heel of his hand .  it moved inward and morrison felt himself sway gently forward as the ship slowed and stopped almost at once .     konev pointed .  there was a large circle  glowing with an orange light .  he said   they re using fiber optic methods to make sure the tip glows .  they said i wouldn t miss it .       but we have missed it   said morrison tightly   we re looking at it  but we re not there .  to get into it  we have to turn    and that means that dezhnev has to unhook communications again .       no use   said dezhnev .   i have enough power in my engines to have kept us going another forty five seconds maybe  but i certainly do not have enough to start us moving from scratch .  we are at this moment dead in the water and cannot move again .       well  then .   began morrison with what was almost a wail .      well  then   said konev   there is another kind of motion that is possible .  that hypodermic needle has intelligence at the other end .  arkady  tell them to push it in very slowly .      the orange circle expanded slowly  becoming slightly elliptical .     morrison said   it s going to miss us .      konev made no reply to that  but leaned over toward arkady to speak directly into the transmitter .  the orange ellipse became  for a moment  more markedly elliptical  but this ceased after a bark from konev .  it became nearly circular after that .  the needle was close now and was pointing at them .     and then there was sudden motion everywhere .  the faint outlines of the red corpuscles and the occasional platelet  moved  and converged toward and through the circle .  and the ship was moving  too .     morrison looked up and around as the orange circle moved past them neatly on all sides  then slipped behind the ship  shrank rapidly  and disappeared .     konev said with grim satisfaction   they ve sucked us in .  from this point on  we sit quietly .  they will handle everything .         .     now morrison did his best to wash away thought  to close his mind .  either he would be brought back to the standard world  to normality  to reality  or he would die in a microblink and the rest of the universe would go on without him    as it would do  in any case  in twenty years  or thirty  or forty .     he shut his eyes firmly and tried to respond to nothing  not even to the beating of his heart .  at one point he felt a light touch on his left hand .  that would have to be kaliinin .  he withdrew his hand    not suddenly in rejection  but slowly  as though simply to say   not now .      at another point  he heard boranova say   tell them  arkady  to evacuate section c  to put in strictly long distance controls .  if we go  there is no point in carrying anyone with us .      morrison wondered if section c were indeed evacuated .  he would evacuate if he were ordered to or even if he were not ordered to  but there might be those lunatics who would be anxious to be on the spot when the first crew to explore a living body returned safely .     so they could tell their grandchildren  he supposed .     what happened to such people  he wondered  if they ended up not having grandchildren    if they died too young to see them    if their children chose never to have children    if the       dimly  he was aware that he was deliberately immersing himself in nonsense and trivia .  one can t really think of nothing and especially not if one has spent a lifetime devoting one s self to thought  but one can think of something utterly unimportant .  there are  after all  so many more possible thoughts that are unimportant rather than important  trivial rather than vital  nonsensical rather than sensible  that       he might even have fallen asleep .  thinking about it afterward made him feel certain he had .  he wouldn t have thought it would be possible to be so cold blooded  but it wasn t cold blood  it was weanness  relief from tension  the feeling that someone else was making decisions  that he himself might be totally relaxed at last .  and perhaps  although he didn t want to admit it   it had all been too much and he had simply passed out .     and again he felt a light touch on his left hand and this time it did not go away .  he stirred and opened his eyes on something that looked like ordinary illumination .  too ordinary    it hurt his eyes .  he blinked rapidly and they watered .     kaliinin was looking down at him .   wake up  albert .      he wiped at his eyes  began to make the natural interpretation of his surroundings  and said   are we back .       we are back .  all is well .  we are safe and we re waiting for you .  you re nearest the door .      morrison looked back at the open door and started to his feet  rising a few inches and sinking back .   i m heavy .       kaliinin said   i know .  i feel like an elephant myself .  just get up slowly .  i ll help you .       no no  that s all right .   he fended her off .  the room was crowded .  his vision had cleared to the point where he could see the crowd  face upon face  looking toward him  smiling  watching .  he did not want them    soviet citizens  all    to see the sole american helped to his feet by a young soviet woman .     slowly  a little drunkenly but by himself  he rose to his feet  stepped sidewise to the door and very carefully let himself down to a small flight of stairs .  half a dozen pairs of arms reached out to help him  utterly disregarding his words   it s all right .  i don t need help .      then he said sharply   wait .      before stepping to solid ground  he turned and looked past kaliinin  who was right behind him .      what is it  albert .   she asked .     he said   i was just taking a last look at the ship because i don t intend ever to see it again    not at a distance  not in films  not in any form of reproduction .      then he was on normal ground again and the others followed .  it was with relief that morrison saw that every one of them was helped down .     there would then have been some sort of impromptu celebration  but it was boranova who stepped forward  looking distinctly disheveled and much unlike her usual calm  well cared for self    all the more so since she was wearing the thin cotton coverall that did very little to hide the mature lines of her body .      fellow workers   she said   i m sure there will be appropriate ceremonies at some reasonable time to mark this fantastic voyage of ours  but please  we are in no condition to join you now .  we must rest and recover from an arduous time and we beg your indulgence .      they were all led off to wild shouts and frantic waving and only dezhnev had the presence of mind to take a glass offered to him that contained something that was either water or vodka and morrison  for one  had no doubt as to which of the alternatives was  in fact  the case .  the broad smile on dezhnev s damp face as he sipped made it certain .     morrison said to kaliinin   how long were we on the ship .       i think it was over eleven hours   said kaliinin .     morrison shook his head .   it seemed more like eleven years .       i know   she said  smiling slightly   but clocks lack imagination .       one of dezhnev senior s aphorisms  sophia .       no .  one of my own .       what i want   said morrison   is a chance at the bathroom  and a shower  and fresh clothes  and a good dinner  and a chance to shout and scream  and a good night s sleep .  in that order  i think  especially with the bathroom coming first .       you ll have it all   said kaliinin   as will the rest of us .      and they did and the dinner seemed to morrison to be particularly satisfactory .  throughout their stay on the ship  tension had managed to suppress his appetite  but such things are merely deferred and hunger was gnawing with a vengeance once morrison felt truly safe  truly comfortable  truly clean  and truly clothed .     the main course at the dinner was a roast goose of enormous size which dezhnev carved  saying   be abstemious  my friends  for as my father used to say   eating too much kills more quickly than eating too little .       having said this  he served himself a much larger helping than he served anyone else .     the one outsider present was a very blond tall man  who was introduced as the military commander of the grotto  something which could be seen at once  since he was in full uniform with a spate of decorations .  the others seemed extraordinarily polite to him and extraordinarily uncomfortable at the same time .     throughout the meal  morrison felt the tension returning .  the commander looked at him often  with unsmiling gravity  but said nothing to him directly .  because of the commander s presence  he felt uable to ask the important question and then  finally  when he might have raised it after the commander s departure  he suddenly found himself too sleepy .  he would not be able to argue it out properly if there were any complications .     and when he finally managed to tumble into bed  his last semiconscious thought was that there would be complications .        .     breakfast was late and morrison found that it was for two .  only boranova joined him .     he was mildly disappointed  for he had looked forward to the presence of sophia kaliinin  but when she failed to appear  he decided not to ask after her .  there were other questions he would have to ask .     boranova looked tired  as though she had not had enough sleep  but she looked happy  too .  or perhaps  morrison thought   happy  was too strong a word .  contented  rather .     she said   i had a good talk with the commander last night and there was a two way video call with moscow .  carefully shielded .  comrade rashchin himself spoke with me and was clearly pleased in the highest degree .  he is not a demonstrative man but he told me that he had been in touch with events all yesterday and that  during the interval in which we were not in communication with the outside world  he had been unable to eat or to do anything but pace back and forth .  that  perhaps  was an exaggeration .  he even said he had wept with joy at hearing that we were all safe and that may be true .  undemonstrative men can be emotional when the dam breaks .       it sounds good for you  natalya .       for the whole project .  you understand that  according to the tentative schedule under which we had worked  we were not expected to launch a voyage into a living human body for at least five years .  to have done so with a grossly inadequate ship and to have come out of it alive is viewed as a great triumph .  even the bureaucracy in moscow understood the emergency under which we labored .       i doubt that we really got what we were after .       you mean shapirov s thoughts .  that was  of course  yuri s dream .  on the whole  it was fortunate that he talked us all into following that dream .  we would never have attempted the voyage otherwise .  nor does the failure of the dream dim our feat .  had we failed to return alive  we can be sure that there would have been much criticism of our folly in attempting the matter .  as it is  though  we are the first to have entered a living human body and to have returned alive    a soviet first that will stand forever in history .  there will be no non soviet feat of the sort for years and our soviet leadership is well aware of that and very satisfied .  we are assured of the money we will need for a considerable time  i imagine  provided we can come up with a spectacular feat now and then .      she smiled broadly at this and morrison nodded and smiled politely with her .  he cut away at the ham omelet he had requested and said   would it have been diplomatic to emphasize that an american was one of the crew .  was i mentioned at all .       come  albert  don t think so ill of us .  your feat in turning the ship by hand at the risk of your life was mentioned with emphasis .         and shapirov s death .  that will not be blamed on us  i hope .       the death is understood to have been unavoidable .  it is well known that he was kept alive as long as he was by advanced medical methods only .  i doubt that it will be mentioned to any great extent in the records .       in any case   said morrison   the nightmare is over .       the nightmare .  come  give yourself a month or two and it will seem an exciting episode that you ll be glad you experienced .       i doubt it .       you ll see .  if you live to witness other such voyages  you ll be delighted to say   ah  but i was on the very first   and you ll never tire of telling the story to your grandchildren .      that s the opening  thought morrison .  aloud  he said   i see you assume that i will see my grandchildren someday .  what happens to me once we re finished with breakfast  natalya .       it will be out of the grotto for you and back to the hotel .       no no  natalya .  i want more than that .  what follows that .  i warn you that if the miniaturization project is going to go public and if there s a parade in red square  i don t intend to be part of it .       parades are out of the question  albert .  we re a long way from going public  although we re closer to it by far than we were the day before yesterday .        let me put it baldly then .  i want to go back to the united states .  now .       as soon as possible  certainly .  i imagine there will be pressure from your government .       i should hope so   said morrison dryly .      they would not have been willing to have you back before you had a chance to help us or     her eyes looked into his rather sternly     from their point of view  spied on us .  but now that you have done your part    and i m sure they will be aware of that somehow    they will demand you back .       and you must send me back .  you promised that over and over .       we will keep our promise .       nor need you think i have spied on you  i have seen nothing you have not let me see .       i know that .  yet  when you return to your own country  do you imagine that you will not be questioned exhaustively on what you have seen .      morrison shrugged .   that was the consequence you must have accepted when you brought me here .       true and we won t let it keep us from returning you .  it is quite certain you won t be able to tell your people anything they don t already know .  they poke their noses into our affairs carefully and skillfully         as your people poke their noses into ours     said morrison with some indignation .      undoubtedly   said boranova with a negligent wave of her hand .   of course  you will be able to tell them of our success  but we don t really object to their knowing .  to this day  americans insist on believing that soviet science and technology is second class .  it will do us good to teach them a lesson in this .  one thing  though         ah   said morrison .      not a large thing  but a lie .  you must not say we brought you here by force .  in any public mention of this matter  you must state    if the question arises    that you came here voluntarily  in order to test your theories under conditions not available to you elsewhere in the world .  it is a totally likely thing .  who would disbelieve you .       my government knows otherwise .       yes  but they will themselves urge you to tell the lie .  they are as little eager as we are to plunge the world into a crisis over this .  aside from the fact that crises between the united states and the soviet union would instantly antagonize the rest of the world against both of us in these so called good new days  the united states will no more wish to admit they had let you be taken than we would to admit we had taken you .  come  albert  it is a small thing .      morrison sighed .   if you return me now  as you say you will do  i will keep quiet about this small matter of kidnapping .       you use the conditional .  you say  if .    boranova was grim .   you clearly find it troublesome to believe me to be a person of honor .  why .  because i am a soviet .  two generations of peace  two generations of getting along  and your old habits persist .  is there to be no hope for humanity .       good new days or not  we still don t like your system of government .       who gives you the right to judge us .  we don t like yours  either .     but never mind .  if we begin to quarrel  that will spoil what should be a happy day for you    and what is a happy day for me .       very well .  we will not quarrel .       then let us say good bye now  albert  and someday we will meet again under more normal circumstances i am sure .   she held out her hand to him and he took it .  she went on   i have asked sophia to escort you back to the hotel and to make the arrangements for your leaving .  you will not object to that  i m sure .      morrison pressed her hand strongly .   no .  i rather like sophia .      boranova smiled .   i had sensed that somehow .         .     it was a happy day for boranova and her exhaustion did not prevent her from enjoying it .     exhaustion .  how many days of rest  how many nights of sleep  how long a stretch at home with nikolai and aleksandr would it take to cure that .     but she was alone now and for a period of time there would be nothing to do .  seize the moment .     boranova stretched out luxuriously on the couch in her office and gave herself over to a curious jumble of thought    now a commendation from moscow  with a promotion  all mixed up with days on the beach at crimea with her husband and son .  it became almost real as she slept and dreamed that she was pursuing little aleksandr as he marched firmly into the cold waters of the black sea in heedless lack of concern over the possibility of drowning himself .  she was carrying a drum that she was beating wildly in order to attract the attention he stubbornly refused to give her .     and the vision broke apart and faded and the drumbeat was a hammering at the door .     she rose with a confused effort  smoothed the blouse she was wearing  and strode to the door in hasty concern .  this turned to fury when she threw it open and found konev frowning darkly  his fist raised to renew his assault .      what is this  yuri .   she said indignantly .   is this your way of announcing yourself .  there are signals .       which no one answered  though i knew you to be within .      boranova motioned him in with a quick gesture of her head .  she was not anxious to see him and he was not a pleasant sight .     she said   haven t you slept at all .  you look awful .       i haven t had time .  i ve been working .       at what .       at what do you suppose  natalya .  at the data we obtained yesterday in the brain .      boranova felt her anger seep away .  after all  it was konev whose dream this had been .  the success of survival was sweet for everyone but konev .  only he felt the failure .     she said   sit down  yuri .  try to face it .  the thought analysis didn t work    and it couldn t .  shapirov was too far gone .  even as we went in  he was on the point of death .      konev looked at boranova blankly  as though totally disregarding her words .   where is albert morrison .       there s no use in hounding him  yuri .  he did what he could  but shapirov s was a dying brain .     listen to me .  it was a dying brain .      again that blank look .   what are you talking about  natalya .       the data we got .  the supposed data that you re struggling with .  let it go .  the voyage has been a marvelous success even without it .      konev shook his head .   a marvelous success without it .  you don t know what you re saying .  where is morrison .       he s gone  yuri .  it s finished .  he s on his way back to the united states .  as we promised .      konev s eyes opened wide .   but that s impossible .  he can t go .  he mustn t go .       well  now   said boranova calmly .   what are you talking about .      konev rose to his feet .   i went over the data  you stupid woman  and it s all plain .  we must keep morrison .  at all costs  we must keep him .      boranova s face reddened .   how dare you insult me  yuri .  explain yourself at once or i will have you suspended from this project .  what is this new mad fixation of yours on albert .      konev lifted his hands halfway upward  as though impelled by an overwhelming desire to strike out at something  with nothing present to strike at .     he gasped   i m sorry  i m sorry .  i withdraw the adjective .  but you must understand .  all through our stay in the brain    all the time we were trying to tap shapirov s thoughts    albert morrison was lying to us .  he knew what was happening .  he must have known and he carefully led us in the wrong direction .  we must have him  natalya  and we must have his device .  we can never let him go .        chapter       return       .     the trouble with triumph is that you may be on the other side .        dezhnev senior       .     morrison was doing his best to keep his feelings under control .  there was a natural elation .  he was going to go home .  he was going to be free .  he was going to be safe .  much more than that  he would       but he dared not think of that climactic bit as yet .  yuri konev was fearfully intelligent and already suspicious .  morrison s thoughts  if konev concentrated on them  might give themselves away in his facial expressions somehow .        or were they just playing with him .  that was the other side of the coin .     were they planning to break his spirit and turn him to their own uses .  it was an old trick  to raise hopes and then dash them    far worse than having no hope at all at any time .     would natalya boranova do such a thing .  she had not hesitated to take him forcibly when he would not come willingly .  she had not hesitated to threaten to destroy his reputation forever to get him on the ship .  how much farther would she go .  would she stop at nothing .     his heart bounded with a marked relief when sophia kaliinin appeared .  surely she would not be party to such a deception .     he believed that even more firmly when she smiled at him  looking happier than he had ever seen her .  she took his hand and tucked it under her arm .      you ll be going home now .  i m so glad for you   she said and morrison could not make himself believe that those words    their intonation  her expression    were all part of a careful lie .     nevertheless  he said cautiously   i hope i m going home .      and she said   you are .     have you ever been on a skimmer .      for a moment  morrison stumbled on the russian word  then used a translated english phrase .   do you mean an spf    a solar powered flyer .       this is a soviet design .  much better .  it has light engines .  you can t always trust the sun .       but why a skimmer  then .   they were moving briskly toward the passageway that would lead them out of the grotto .      why not .  we ll be at malenkigrad in fifteen minutes and since you ve never been in a soviet skimmer  you ll love it .  it will be one more way of celebrating your return .       i m a little nervous of heights .  will it be safe .       absolutely .  besides  i couldn t resist .  we re in a wonderful situation now and i don t know how much longer it will last .  whatever we want we getfor the moment .  i said   a skimmer is what we will want   and they smiled all over their faces and said   why  certainly  dr .  kaliinin .  it will be waiting for you .   day before yesterday  i would have had to fill out a proof of need form for a plate of borscht .  today i am a hero of the soviet union    unofficially  as yet .  we all are .  you  too  albert .       i hope i won t be expected to stay for the official ceremonies   said morrison  still cautious .      the official ceremonies will be confined to the grotto  of course  and won t be elaborate at all .  your scroll will undoubtedly be forwarded to you .  perhaps our ambassador can give it to you in a quiet washington ceremony .       not necessary   said morrison .   i would appreciate the honor  but getting it in the mail is all i really want .      they had turned down a corridor that morrison had not taken before and then walked long enough to make him wonder uneasily where they might be going .  no need to have worried  morrison thought as they emerged into a small airfield .     there was no mistaking the skimmer .  it had long wings  glittering with a layer of photovoltaic cells along their entire upper surface  very much as american spfs had .  the american planes  however  relied on the solar panels entirely .  the skimmer he saw had small rotors    gasoline powered  no doubt    as assists .  kaliinin might present that as a soviet improvement but morrison suspected that the soviet photovoltaic cells were not as efficient as the american ones .     a mechanic was standing near the skimmer and kaliinin approached him with long  confident strides .   how does it test out .       sweet as a dream   said the mechanic .     she smiled and nodded  but as he stepped away she muttered to morrison   i ll check it out anyway  of course .  i ve seen dreams that turned into nightmares .      morrison studied the skimmer with a mixture of interest and apprehension .  it looked like the skeleton of a plane  with everything somehow thinner and longer than it should be .  the cockpit was tiny  like a soap bubble under the huge flap of wings and the long backward extension of a thin skeletal structure .     kaliinin had to bend herself nearly double to climb in .  morrison watched her as she fiddled with the controls .  then  after what seemed a considerable lapse of time  she taxied it down the field  turned it  and came back .  she raised the rotos and let them turn slowly and eventually everything was shut down and she got out .      it s working nicely   she said .   the fuel supply is adequate and the sun is shining brilliantly .  one couldn t ask for more .      morrison nodded and looked around .   one could ask for the pilot .  where is he .      kaliinin froze at once .   where is he .  is there some sexual requirement for the task .  i pilot my own skimmer .       you .   exclaimed morrison quite automatically .      yes  i .  why not .  i have my license and i qualify as a master pilot .  get in .       i m sorry   stammered morrison .   i    i rarely fly and piloting anything through the air is almost a mystical thing to me .  i just assumed that a pilot didn t do anything but piloting and that if someone did anything else  he couldn t be a pilot .  do you know what i mean .       i m not even going to try to figure it out  albert .  get in .      morrison climbed in  following her directions and doing his best not to damage his head on any portion of the skimmer    or  perhaps  damaging the skimmer .     he sat in his seat  staring in horror at the skimmer s open side to his right .   isn t there a door to close .       why do you want a closed door .  it would spoil the wonderful feeling of flight .  strap yourself in and you ll be perfectly safe .     here  i ll show you how .     are you ready now .   she was in the seat beside him  looking quite confident and pleased with herself .  they were crowded into contact and that much at least morrison found rather soothing .      i m resigned   he said .   that s as close as i can get to ready .       don t be silly .  you re going to love this .  we ll use the motors to rise .      there was a high pitched throb of the small engine and a rhythmic slap as the rotors began to spin .  slowly the skimmer rose and    as slowly    it turned .  it canted to one side while turning and morrison found himself leaning out over the open side and straining precariously against the strap that held him .  he barely managed to fight off the strong impulse to throw his arms around kaliinin for nothing more than utterly nonerotic security .     the skimmer straightened and kaliinin said   now  listen   as she turned off the engine and threw in a switch labeled  in cyrillic  solar .  the throb ceased and the rotors slackened as the forward propeller began to turn .  the skimmer moved slowly and almost silently forward .      listen to the quiet   whispered kaliinin .   it s like drifting on nothing .      morrison looked down uneasily .     kaliinin said   we won t fall .  even if a cloud passed over the sun or if a circuit failure put the photovoltaic cells out of action  there is enough power in the storage components to bring us across kilometers  if necessary  to a safe landing .  and if we ran out of power  the skimmer is more than half a glider and it would still settle down to a safe landing .  i don t think i could force the craft into a crash even if i tried .  the only real danger is a strong wind and there s none of that now .      morrison swallowed and said   it s a gentle motion .       of course .  we re not going much faster than an automobile would go and the sensation is much pleasanter .  i love it .  try to relax and look at the sky .  there s nothing as peaceful as a skimmer .      he said   how long have you been doing this .       when i was twenty four  i got my master s license .  so did yu   so did he .  many a peaceful summer afternoon we spent in the air in a skimmer like this .  once we each had a racing skimmer and marked out lover s knots in the air .   her face twisted slightly as she said that and it occurred to morrison that she had obtained a skimmer for the short hop to malenkigrad only for the sake of a momentary reliving of memories and for no other reason .      that must have been dangerous   he said .      not really    if you know what you re doing .  once we skimmed along the foothills of the caucasus and that might have been dangerous .  a wind squall can easily smash you into a hillside and that wouldn t be fun at all  but we were young and carefree .     though i might have been better off if that had happened .      her voice trailed away and for a moment her face darkened  but then an inner thought seemed to illuminate her into a smile .     morrison felt his distrust mounting again .  why did the thought of konev make her so happy  when she could not bear to look at him when they were together in the miniaturized ship .     morrison said   you don t seem to mind talking about him  sophia .   then  deliberately  he used the forbidden word   about yuri  i mean .  it even seems to make you happy .  why is that .      and kaliinin said between her teeth   it s not sentimental memories that makes me happy  i assure you  albert .  anger and frustration and    and heartbreak can make a person vicious .  i want revenge and i am mean spirited enough    well  human enough    to enjoy it when it comes .       revenge .  i don t understand .       it s simple enough  albert .  he deprived me of love and my daughter of a father when i had no way of striking back .  that did not bother him as long as he had his dream of bringing miniaturization to practical low energy fruition so that he might become  at a bound  the most famous scientist in the world    or in history .       but he failed at that .  we didn t get the necessary information from shapirov s brain .  you know we didn t .       ah  but you don t know him .  he never gives up  he s driven by the furies .  i ve seen him  fleetingly  looking at you  after the voyage through shapirov s body was done .  i know his looks  albert .  i can tell his thoughts even from the droop of an eyelid .  he thinks you have the answer .       of what was in shapirov s brain .  i don t .  how could i .       it doesn t matter whether you do or not  albert .  he thinks you do and he wants you and your device with a greater yearning than he ever wanted anything in his life  certainly more than he wanted me or his child .  and i m taking you away from him  albert .  with my own hands i am taking you out of the grotto and will watch you leave for your own country .  and i will see him sicken to death of frustrated ambition .      morrison stared at her in astonishment as the skimmer moved along in response to her rock steady hand at the controls .  he had not thought that kaliinin was capable of wearing an expression of such consuming and malignant joy .        .     boranova had listened to konev s emotional and breathless account and felt herself carried along by the wave of his utter conviction .  that had happened before  when he had been convinced that shapirov s dying mind could be tapped and that morrison  the american neurophysicist  was the key to doing that .  she had been swept along then and she tried to resist it now .     she said finally   that sounds quite mad .      konev said   what s the difference what it sounds like if it s true .       ah  but is it true .       i am certain .      boranova muttered   we need arkady here to tell us that his father assured him that vehemence was no guarantee of truth .       neither is it a guarantee of the reverse .  if you accept what i say  you must also see that we can t let him go .  certainly not now and possibly not ever .      boranova shook her head violently .   it s too late .  there s nothing to be done .  the united states wants him back and the government has agreed to let him go .  the government can t very well backtrack now without bringing about a world crisis .       considering what is at stake  natalya  we must surely risk it .  the world crisis will not explode .  there will be loud talk and much posturing for a month or two and then if we have what we want  we might let him go if absolutely necessary    or we might arrange an accident        boranova rose to her feet angrily .   no .  what you are suggesting is unthinkable .  this is the twenty first century  not the twentieth .       natalya  whatever century this is  we face the question of whether the universe is to be ours    or theirs .       you know you re not going to convince moscow that that is what is at stake .  the government has what it wants  a safe voyage into and out of a body .  at the moment it s all they want .  they never understood that we wanted to read shapirov s mind .  we never explained that .       that was a mistake .       come  yuri .  do you know how long it would have taken to persuade them that albert would have to be taken forcibly if he did not come voluntarily .  they would not have wanted to risk a crisis    even as much a crisis as they now face  which is a minor one indeed .  you will now be asking them to face a much larger one .  not only will you fail but you will encourage them to look into the matter of the arrival of albert here and i don t think we can afford that .       the government is not all one piece .  there are many high officials who are convinced that we are too eager to give in to the americans  that we pay too high a price for the occasional pat on the head we receive .  i have people to whom i have entry         i have long known that you have .  that s a dangerous game you play  yuri .  better men than you have been caught up in that sort of intrigue and have come to deplorable ends .       it s the chance i must take .  in a case like this  i can turn the government around .  but we must have albert morrison in our own hands if we re to do it .  once he s gone  it will be all over .     when is he supposed to be leaving .       nightfall .  sophia and i agreed that  for the sake of avoiding obtrusiveness and of needlessly provoking those who tend to be against accommodation with the americans  night is better than day .      he stared at her  eyes opening widely enough so that they almost seemed protuberant .   sophia .   he said harshly .   what s she got to do with it .       she s in charge of the details of returning albert .  she requested it .       she requested it .       yes .  i imagine she wished to be with him for an additional while .   with a touch of spite  she added   perhaps you didn t notice it  but she rather likes the american .      konev sneered in disgust .   not a bit of it .  i know that devil .  i know her if i know anything at all    every thought in her head .  she s getting him away from me .  sitting right next to him in the ship  watching his every move  she must have guessed his importance and she means to deprive me of him .  she won t wait for nightfall .  she ll hurry him off at once .      he rose and left the room at a run .      yuri   boranova called after him .   yuri  what do you intend to do .       stop her   floated back the answer .     she gazed after him thoughtfully .  she could stop him .  she had the authority .  she had the means .  and yet    what if he was right .  what if what was at stake was indeed nothing less than the universe .  if she stopped him  everything    everything    might be handed over to the americans .  if she let him go  there might be a crisis of an intensity that hadn t been dreamed of in generations .     she had to come to a decision at once .     she began again .     if she stopped him  she would have done something .  if he then turned out to have been right  the blame for having stopped him and having lost the universe would rest squarely on her .  if he turned out to be wrong after being stopped    her action would be forgotten .  there is nothing dramatic about a mistake that is not made .     if she did nothing to stop him  however  then all was on konev s head .  if he somehow prevented morrison s return to the united states and if the government were then humiliatingly forced to release him  it would be konev who would be blamed .  boranova would lose nothing  for he had dashed off without telling her what he was going to do and she could reasonably claim she had not dreamed he would try to subvert the known intention of the government .  she would be in the clear .  if  on the other hand  he prevented morrison s return and proved to be right and the government won the battle of wills that followed  she could claim the credit of having done nothing to stop him .  she could say that it had been with her permission that he had worked .     well  then  if she stopped him  the worst was blame  the best was neutral .  if she did nothing  the best was credit  the worst was neutral .     so boranova did nothing .        .     morrison decided that kaliinin was right .  as the minutes passed  he grew less uncomfortable in the skimmer and even began to experience a feeble pleasure .     he could see the ground clearly through the open latticework that made up the chassis of the craft .  it was about thirty meters below  he judged  and moving smoothly backward .     kaliinin sat at the controls  completely absorbed  though it didn t seem to morrison that she had much to do .  presumably  it was skill and patient observation that made it possible for her to keep the skimmer on track without minute by minute adjustment .     he said   what happens if you find yourself moving into a headwind  sophia .      she said without taking her eyes from the controls   then i would have to use the engine and waste fuel .  if it were a fresh wind  it wouldn t pay to use a skimmer at all .  fortunately  today is ideal skimmer weather .      morrison began to feel something that was almost well being for the first time since having left the united states    no  since a considerable length of time before that .  he began to picture himself back in the united states  it was the first time he had dared to do so .     he asked   what happens after we reach the hotel in malenkigrad .       car to an airport   said kaliinin crisply   and then you ll board a plane to america .       when .       tonight  according to schedule .  i ll try to get it done more quickly .      morrison said with what was almost joviality   anxious to get rid of me .      and to his surprise  the answer came back at once .   yes .  exactly .      he studied her face in profile .  the look of studied hatred had long since vanished  but there was a settled anxiety about her expression that caused morrison to quiver .  the picture of himself back in the united states began to fade around the edges .     he said   is anything wrong  sophia .       no  nothing wrong now .  it s just that i expect that    he will come after us .  the wolf is in pursuit  so i must get you away quickly if i can .         .     the city of malenkigrad lay below them  although it was not exactly a city .  small in name  it was small in fact and it raveled off in all directions into the flat countryside .     it was the bedroom community for the people working on the miniaturization project and during the day    now    it seemed all but deserted .  there was a moving vehicle here and there  occasionally a pedestrian  and  of course  children playing in the dusty streets .     it occurred to morrison that he had no way of knowing where  in the mighty stretch of land that made up the soviet union  malenkigrad and the grotto might be .  it wasn t in the birch forest or in the tundra .  the early summer was warm and the ground looked semiarid .  he might be in central asia or in the steppes near the european side of the caspian .  he could not say .     the skimmer was dropping now  more gently than an elevator .  morrison would not have believed that so soothing a descent could be possible .  then the wheels touched the ground and they braked to a nearly instant halt .  they were in the rear of the hotel  a hotel the small size of which he could appreciate when it was seen from the air .     kaliinin left the skimmer with a lively jump and motioned to morrison  who emerged more sedately .     he said   what happens to the skimmer now .      she answered carelessly   i ll pick it up on my return and take it back to the grotto field if the weather holds .  come  let s go around to the front and i ll get you into your room  where you can rest a little and where we can plan the next step .       the room with the soldiers watching me  you mean .      she said impatiently   there ll be no soldiers watching you .  we re not afraid of your trying to escape now .   then  with a quick glance around  she added   though i d rather have the soldiers  actually .      morrison looked about  too  a bit anxiously and decided he d rather not have the soldiers .  it occurred to him that if konev came to reclaim him  as kaliinin clearly feared he might do  he might easily come with soldiers at his back .     and then morrison thought  or is this really something to fear .  she has a thing about yuri .  she ll believe anything of him .     the thought did not quiet him  however .     morrison had not seen the hotel in broad daylight from outside  he had not had the leisure to study it in any case .  it occurred to him that it was probably used only by visiting officials and special guests    such as he himself  if he could lay claim to the category .  he wondered if  small as it was  it was ever full .  certainly  the two nights he had spent here had been quiet indeed .  he recalled no noise in the corridors and the dining room  when he had eaten there  had been all but empty  too .     it was at the moment he thought of the dining room that they approached the front entrance and there  to one side  sitting in the sun and poring over a book  was a stoutish woman with reddish brown hair .  she was wearing half spectacles  perched low on her nose .   morrison was surprised at that bit of archaism .  it was rare to see glasses in these days when eye molding was routine and normal vision had truly become normal .      it was the glasses and the studious look on her face that changed her appearance so that morrison might easily not have recognized her .  he would not have  perhaps  if he had not just thought of the dining room .  the woman was the waitress to whom he had appealed for help three evenings before and who had failed him    valeri paleron .     he said austerely   good morning  comrade paleron .   his voice was stiff and his expression unfriendly .     she did not seem discomfited by this .  she looked up  removed her glasses  and said   ah  comrade american .  you are back safe and sound .  congratulations .       for what .       it is the talk of the town .  there has been an experiment that was a great success .      kaliinin  her face like thunder  said sharply   that should not be the talk of the town .  we need no wagging tongues .       what wagging tongues .   said the waitress with spirit .   who here does not work at the grotto or have a relative there .  why should we not know of it and why should we not speak of it .  and can i fail to hear .  must i stop my ears .  i cannot carry a tray and put my fingers in my ears  too .      she turned to morrison .   i hear that you did very well and are greatly praised for it .      morrison shrugged .      and this man   the waitress said  turning to the frowning and increasingly impatient kaliinin   wished to leave before he had the chance to participate in the great deed .  he turned to me for help in his scheme to leave    to me  a waitress .  i reported him at once  of course  and that made him unhappy .  even now  see how he glares at me .   she wagged her finger at him .   but consider the favor i did you .  had i not prevented you from doing whatever it was they were trying to have you do  you would not now be the great success you are  the toast of malenkigrad and perhaps even of moscow .  and the little tsaritsa here surely loves you for it .      kaliinin said   if you do not stop this impudence immediately  i shall report you to the authorities .       go ahead   said paleron  her hands on her hips and her eyebrows lifting .   i do my work  i am a good citizen  and i have done nothing wrong .  what can you report .     and there is a fancy car here for you  too .       i saw no fancy car   said kaliinin .      it is not in the parking lot  but on the other side of the hotel .       what makes you think it is for me .       you are the only important persons to approach the hotel .  for whom  then  should it be .  for the porter .  for the desk clerk .       come  albert   said kaliinin .   we are wasting our time .   she brushed past the waitress  doing this so closely that she stepped on her foot    perhaps not by accident .  morrison followed meekly .      i hate that woman   muttered kaffinin as they walked up the flight of stairs to morrison s second floor room .      do you think that she is an observer of this place on behalf of the central coordinating committee .   asked morrison .      who knows .  but there is something wrong with her .  she is possessed by a devil of impudence .  she does not know her place .       her place .  are there class distinctions  then  in the soviet union .       don t be sarcastic  albert .  there are supposedly none in the united states  either  but you have them surely .  and so do we .  i know what the theory is  but no person can live by theory alone .  if arkady s father didn t say that  he should have .      they walked up one flight of stairs to what had been morrison s room earlier in the week and apparently still was .  morrison viewed it with mild distaste .  it was a room without charm  though the sunlight made it seem less gloomy than he remembered it to be and  of course  the prospect of returning home was enough to add glitter to anything .     kaliinin sat in the better of the two armchairs in the room  her legs crossed  the upper leg swinging in short arcs .  morrison sat down on the side of the bed and watched her legs thoughtfully .  he had never had good occasion to admire his own calmness under pressure and it seemed to him rather unusual to watch someone be more nervous than he himself was .     he said   you seem greatly troubled  sophia .  what is wrong .      she said   i told you .  that woman paleron troubles me .       she can t upset you that much .  what s wrong .       i don t like waiting .  the days are long now .  it will be nine hours until sunset .       it s amazing that it s only a matter of hours .  the diplomatic maneuvering could have continued for months .   he said so lightly enough  but the thought gave him a cold feeling in the pit of his stomach .      not in a case like this .  i ve seen it work before  albert .  the swedes are involved .  it s not an american plane that s coming .  having an american plane land deep in soviet territory is still something our government shies away from .  but the swedes    well  they serve as an intermediary between the two nations by common consent and they tend to work hard to defuse any possibility of friction .       in the united states  we consider sweden lukewarm toward us at the best .  i think we d prefer to have great britain         oh come  you might as well say texas .  as it is  sweden may be lukewarm toward you  but she is considerably less than that toward us .  in any case  it s sweden and their principle always is that if it is necessary to defuse a situation  it is best to defuse it swiftly .       it seems quite swift to me .  certainly  i m the one who should be in the greater hurry  since it is i who am most anxious to leave .  why should a few hours matter to you .       i ve told you .  he is after us .   she ground out the pronoun .      yuri .  what can he do .  if your government is giving me up         there are elements in the government who might easily not wish to give you up and our    friend    knows some of these well .      morrison raised a finger to his lips and looked around .     kaliinin said   are you worried about being bugged .  that s another american spy novel myth .  bugs are so easily detected these days and so easily scrambled    i carry a small detector myself and i ve never spotted one .      morrison shrugged .   then say what you wish .       our friend is not a political extremist himself  but he finds he can use those in high office who are .  there are extremists in america  too  i suppose .        those who think our policy toward the soviet union is too mild .   morrison nodded .   i ve met a few .       well  then  there you are .  his ambition consumes him and if extremism will advance his plans  then he is prepared to be an extremist .       surely you don t think he can arrange some sort of coup in moscow and put the diehards in control and do it all in time to stop me from leaving for home this evening .       you ve got it the wrong way around  albert .  if he could somehow prevent you from leaving and precipitate a crisis  he may be able to persuade some in the government to stand firm and delay your leaving for a long time .  he can be very persuasive  our friend  when he is in the full grip of his mania .  he can sway even natalya .      kaliinin fell into a silence and bit at her lower lip .  finally she looked up and said   he hasn t given up on you and he won t .  i m sure of it .  i ve got to get you away .      she rose suddenly and paced up and down the room with short  quick steps  looking as though she were trying to force the universe into turning her way .  she stopped in front of the door  listened  then jerked it open suddenly .     valeri paleron  her bland expression shifting rapidly into surprise  had one fist raised  as though she were about to knock .      what do you want .   said kaliinin tightly .      i .   said the waitress .   i want nothing .  it is a question of whether you do .  i have come to ask if you would like some tea .       we have not asked for any .       i did not say you have .  i come out of courtesy .       then go out of courtesy .  and do not return .      paleron  reddening  looked from kaliinin to morrison and said between her teeth   perhaps i interrupt a tender moment .       leave .   said kaliinin .  she closed the door  waited long enough to count to ten in a deliberate manner  her lips moving soundlessly   and then flung it open again .  no one was there .     she closed the door and locked it  walked to the opposite end of the room  and said in a low voice   she had been out there  probably  for quite some time .  i heard feet shuffling .      morrison said   if high tech bugging is pass     then i suppose there is a premium on old fashion eavesdropping .       ah  but for whom .       do you suppose she does it for yuri .  it doesn t seem likely that he would have the money to hire spies    or does he .       it might not take much money .  a woman like that might do it for pleasure .      there was silence for a moment and then morrison said   if it s possible that you re beset by spies  sophia  why not come to america with me .       what .   she seemed not to have heard him .      you might be in trouble for getting me out  you know .       why .  i have official papers that will place you on the plane .  i am under orders .       that might not save you if a scapegoat is needed .  why not just get on the plane with me  sophia  and come to america .       just like that .  what would happen to my child .       we ll send for her afterward .       we ll send for her .  what are you suggesting .      morrison flushed slightly .   i m not sure .  we can be friends  certainly .  you ll need friends in a new country .       but it can t happen  albert .  i appreciate your kindness and concern    or pity    but it can t happen .       yes  it can .  this is the twenty first century  not the twentieth  sophia .  people may move about freely anywhere in the world .       dear albert   said kaliinin   you do tend to live in theory .  yes  people can move about  but every nation has its exceptions .  the soviet union will not allow a highly trained scientist with experience in miniaturization related fields to leave the country .  think about it and you ll see that that s reasonable .  if i do accompany you  there will be an immediate soviet protest  a sure claim that i have been kidnapped  and there will be a loud howl from all corners of the world that i be sent back in order to avoid a crisis .  sweden will act as quickly for me as she has for you .       but in my case  i was kidnapped .       there ll be many who will believe i was    or who might prefer to believe it    and i will be sent back by the united states  as you are being sent back by the soviet union .  we ve papered over  in this fashion  dozens of crises over the last six decades or so    and isn t that better than war .       if you say  firmly and frequently  that you want to stay in the united states         then i never see my child again and my life may be at risk  too .  besides  i don t want to go to the united states .      morrison looked surprised .     kaliinin said   do you find that hard to believe .  do you want to stay in the soviet union .       of course not .  my country     he stopped .     she said   exactly .  you talk endlessly about humanity  about the importance of a global view  but if we scrape you down to your emotions  it s your country .  i have a country also  a language  a literature  a culture  a way of life .  i don t want to give it up .      morrison sighed .   as you say  sophia .      sophia said   but i cannot endure it here in this room any longer  albert .  there s no use waiting .  let us get into the car and i ll drive you to where the swedish plane is waiting .       it probably won t be there .       then we ll wait at the airport  rather than here  and we ll at least be certain that as soon as it arrives you can board it .  i want to see you safely gone  albert  and i want to see his face afterward .      she was out the room and clattering down the stairs .  he followed hastily .  he was  in truth  not sorry to be going .     they strode along a carpeted corridor and through a door that led directly out to the side of the hotel .     there  pulled up close to the wall  was a highly polished black limousine .     morrison  a little breathless  said   they re certainly supplying us with deluxe transportation .  can you drive that thing .       like a dream   said kaliinin  smiling    and then came to a full and sudden halt  her smile forgotten .     around the corner of the hotel stepped konev .  he  too  halted and for long moments they did not stir  either of them    as though they were a pair of gorgons  each of whom had frozen into stone at the glance of the other .        .     morrison was the first to speak .  he said a little huskily   have you come to see me off  yuri .  if so  good bye .  i m leaving .      the phrases sounded false in his own ears and his heart was pounding .     yuri s eyes shifted just enough to glance quickly at morrison and then moved back to their original position .     morrison said   come  sophia .      he might as well have said nothing .  when she spoke    finally    it was to konev .   what do you want .   she demanded harshly .      the american   said konev in a tone no softer than hers .      i m taking him away .       don t .  we need him .  he has deceived us .   konev s voice was becoming quieter .      so you say   said kabinin .   i have my orders .  i am to take him to a plane and see that he gets in .  you cannot have him .       it s not i who must have him .  it s the nation .       tell me .  go on and tell me .  say that holy mother russia needs him and i ll laugh in your face .       i ll say no such thing .  the soviet union needs him .       you care only for yourself .  step out of my way .      konev moved between the two others and the limo .   no .  you don t understand the importance of his staying here .  believe me .  my report has already gone to moscow .       i m sure and i can guess to whom it s going  too .  but old gruff and grumble won t be able to do anything .  he s a blowhard and we all know that .  he won t dare say a word in the presidium and if he does  albert will be long gone .       no .  he s not going .      morrison said   i ll take care of him  sophia .  you open the limo door .   he felt himself trembling slightly .  konev was not a large man  but he looked wiry and he was clearly determined .  morrison did not believe himself to be a successful gladiator under any conditions and he certainly didn t feel like one now .     kaliinin lifted her hand  palm turned toward morrison .   stay where you are  albert .   she then said to konev   how do you intend to stop me .  do you have a gun .      konev looked surprised .   no .  of course not .  carrying a hand weapon is illegal .       indeed .  but i have one .   she drew it from her jacket pocket  a small thing almost enclosed in her fist  its small muzzle gleaming as it edged through the space between her first and second fingers .     konev backed away  eyes widening .   that s a stunner .       of course .  worse than a gun  isn t it .  i thought you might interfere  so i m prepared .       that s also illegal .       then report me and i ll plead the need to fulfill my orders against your criminal interference .  i will probably get a commendation .       you won t .  sophia     he took a step toward her .     she took a step back .   no closer .  i m ready to shoot and i might do so even if you stand where you are .  just keep in mind what a stunner does .  it scrambles your brain .  isn t that what you once told me .  you ll be unconscious and you ll wake up with partial amnesia and it may take you hours to recover or even days .  i ve even heard that some people never quite recover .  imagine if your magnificent brain should not quite regain its fine edge .       sophia   he said again .     she said  through almost closed lips   why do you use my name .  the last time i heard you use it  you said   sophia  we will never speak again  never look at each other again .   you are now speaking to me  looking at me .  go away and keep your promise  you miserable      she used a russian word that morrison didn t understand .      konev  white to his lips  said a third time   sophia    listen to me .  believe that every word i have ever said is a lie  but listen to me now .  that american is a deadly threat to the soviet union .  if you love your country         i m tired of loving .  what has it gotten me .       and what has it gotten me .   whispered konev .      you love yourself   said kaliinin bitterly .      no .  you kept saying that  but it s not so .  if i have some regard for myself now  it is because only i can save our country .       you believe that .   said kaliinin  wondering .   you really believe that .     you are mad to do so .       not at all .  i know my own worth .  i couldn t let anything deter me    not even you .  for the sake of our country and my work  i had to give you up .  i had to give up my child .  i had to tear myself in two and throw the better half of myself away .       your child .   kaliinin said .   are you claiming responsibility .      konev s head bent .   how else could i drive you away .  how else could i be sure i would work unimpeded .     i love you .  i have always loved you .  i have known all along it was my child and that it could be no one else s .       do you want albert so much .   her stunner did not waver .   are you willing to say that it is your child    say you love me    believe i will  for that  give you albert    and then deny it all again .  how low an opinion you must have of my intelligence .      konev shook his head .   how can i convince you .     well  if i deliberately threw it all away  i can t expect to get it back again  can i .  will you  in that case  give me the american for the sake of our nation and then throw me away .  would you let me explain the need for him .       i wouldn t believe the explanation .   kaliinin threw a quick glance in morrison s direction .   do you hear this man  albert .   she said .   you don t know with what cruelty he cast my daughter and me aside .  now he expects me to believe that he loved me all along .      and morrison heard himself say   that much is true  sophia .  he loves you and he has always loved you    desperately .      kaliinin froze for a moment .  her free left hand gestured at morrison while her eyes remained fixed on konev .   how do you know that  albert .  did he lie to you  too .      but konev shouted in excitement   he knows .  he admits it .  don t you see .  he sensed it with his computer .  if you now let me explain  you will believe everything .      kaliinin said   is this true  then  albert .  do you confirm yuri .      and morrison  too late  clamped his mouth shut  but his eyes gave him away .     konev said   my love has been unwavering  sophia .  as much as you have suffered  so much have i .  but give me the american and there will be no more of it .  i will no longer ask that i be spared any chance of hindrance .  i will do my work and have you and the child  too  whatever the cost may be    and may i be cursed if i don t manage both .      kaliinin stared at konev  her eyes suddenly swimming in tears .   i want to believe you   she whispered .      then believe .  the american has told you .      as though she were sleepwalking  she moved toward konev  holding the stunner out to him .     morrison shouted   your orders    to the plane .   he rushed wildly at them .     but as he did so  he collided heavily with another body .  arms were around him  holding him closely  and a voice in his ear said   take it easy  comrade american .  do not attack two good soviet citizens .      it was valeri paleron  who held him in a strong and unbreakable grip .     kaliinin clung as closely to konev  though with different effect  the stunner still gripped loosely in her right hand .     paleron said   academician  doctor  we could become conspicuous here .  let us go back to the american s room .  come  comrade american  and come quietly or i will be compelled to hurt you .      konev  catching morrison s eye  smiled tightly in absolute triumph .  he had it all    his woman  his child  and his american    and morrison saw his dream of returning to america pop like a soap bubble and vanish .       chapter       turnaround    in the true triumph  however  there are no losers .        dezhnev senior       .     morrison sat in the hotel room that he had  for some fifteen minutes  thought he would never see again .  he was close to despair    closer  it seemed to him  than he had been even when he was alone and lost in the cellular stream of the neuron .     what was the use .  over and over again  he thought this  as though the phrase were reverberating in an echo chamber .  he was a loser .  he had always been a loser .     for a day or so  he had thought that sophia kaliinin had been attracted to him  but  of course  she hadn t .  he had been nothing more than her weapon against konev and when konev had called to her    beckoned to her    she had returned to him and had then no further use for her weapons  either for morrison or for her stunner .     he looked at them dully .  they were standing together in the sunlight streaming through the window    they in the sunlight  he in the shadow  as it must always be .     they were whispering together  so lost in each other that kaliinin seemed unaware that she was still holding the stunner .  for a moment  her knees bent as though she was going to get rid of its weight by dropping it on the bed  but then konev said something and she was all attention and again unaware of the stunner s existence .     morrison called out hoarsely   your government will not endure this .  you have orders to release me .      konev looked up  his eyes brightening slightly  as though he were being persuaded  with difficulty  to pay attention to his captive .  it was not  after all  as though he had to watch morrison in any physical sense .  the waitress  valeri paleron  was doing that most efficiently .  she stood a meter from morrison and her eyes  somehow amused    as though she enjoyed the job  never left him .     konev said   my government need not concern you  albert .  it will change its mind soon enough .      kaliinin raised her left hand as though to object  but konev enclosed it in his .      do not be concerned  sophia   he said .   information at my disposal has been forwarded to moscow .  it will make them think .  they will get back to me on my personal wavelength before long and when i tell them we have safely secured morrison  they will take action .  i am sure they will have the persuasive power to make the old man see reason .  i promise you that .      kaliinin said in a troubled voice   albert .      morrison said   are you getting ready to tell me that you are sorry  sophia  that you crossed me out of existence at one word from the man you seemed to have hated .      kaliinin reddened .   you are not crossed out of existence  albert .  you will be well treated .  you will work here as you would have worked in your own country  except that here you will be truly appreciated .       thank you   said morrison  finding some small reservoir of the sardonic inside himself .   if you feel happy for me  of what importance is my feeling for myself .      paleron intervened impatiently   comrade american  you talk too much .  why do you not sit down .     sit down .     she pushed him into a chair .    you may as well wait quietly  since there is nothing else you can do .      she then turned to kaliinin  around whose shoulders konev s right arm was protectively placed .   and you  little tsaritsa   she said   are you still planning to place this fine lover of yours out of action that you hold this stunner so menacingly in your hand .  you will be able to embrace him the more tightly if both arms are free .      paleron reached for the stunner kaliinin was holding and kaliinin gave it up without a word .      actually   said paleron  looking curiously at the stunner   i am relieved at having it .  in the paroxysm of your newfound love  i feared you might shoot in all directions .  it would not be safe in your hands  my little one .      she moved back to the vicinity of morrison  still studying the stunner and turning it in various ways .     morrison stirred uneasily .   don t point it in my direction  woman .  it may go off .      paleron looked at him haughtily .   it will not go off if i don t want it to  comrade american .  i know how to use it .      she smiled in the direction of konev and kaliinin .  relieved of the weapon  kaliinin now had both arms around konev s neck and was kissing him with quick  gentle touches of her lips against his .  paleron said in their direction  but not really to them  for they weren t listening   i know how to use it .  like this .  and like this .      and first konev  then kaliinin crumpled .     paleron turned toward morrison .   now help me  you idiot  we must work quickly .      she said it in english .        .     morrison had difficulty understanding .  he simply stared at her .     paleron pushed his shoulder as though she were trying to awaken him from a deep sleep .   come on .  you grab the feet .      morrison obeyed mechanically .  first konev and then kaliinin were lifted onto the bed  from which paleron had stripped the thin blanket .  she stretched both of them out along the narrow confines of the single mattress  then searched kaliinen in a quick  practiced way .      ah   she said  staring at a sheet of folded paper  whose close set print marked it indelibly as something written in governmentese .  she flipped it into the pocket of her white jacket and continued the search .  other items came to light    a pair of small keys  for instance .  quickly she went over konev  plucking a small metallic disc from the inner surface of his lapel .      his personal wavelength   she said and placed that  too  into her pocket .     finally she retrieved a black rectangular object and said   this is yours  isn t it .      morrison grunted .  it was his computer program .  he had been so far gone he had not been aware that konev had taken it from him .  he clutched at it frantically now .     paleron turned kaliinin and konev toward each other  propping them so that they would not fall apart .  she then placed konev s arm around kaliinin and covered the two with the blanket  tucking it in under each to help keep them in place .      don t stare at me like that  morrison   she said when she was done .   come on .   she seized his upper arm in a firm grip .     he resisted .   where are we going .  what s happening .       i ll tell you later .  not a word now .  there is no time to lose .  not a minute .  not a second .  come .   she ended with soft fierceness and morrison followed her .     out of the room they went  down the stairs as softly as she could manage  he following and imitating   along the carpeted corridor  and out to the limousine .     paleron opened the front door on the passenger side with one of the keys she had obtained from kaliinin s pocket and said brusquely   get in .       where are we going .       get in .   she virtually hurled him into the limo .     she settled quickly behind the wheel and morrison resisted the impulse to ask her if she knew how to drive .  it had finally gotten through to his stunned mind that paleron wasn t simply a waitress .     that she had played the part of one  however  was made plain by the faint odor of onions still clinging to her and mixing rather infelicitously with the richer and pleasanter odor of the limo s interior .     paleron started the engine  looked around the parking area  which was deserted except for a cat going about some business of its own  and moved out over a sandy patch to the path that led to the nearby road .     slowly the limo picked up speed and when it finally reached the ninety five kilometer per hour mark  it was moving along a two lane highway on which  occasionally  an automobile  moving in the other direction  passed them .  morrison found himself capable of thinking normally again .     he glanced back earnestly through the rear window .  a car  far behind them  was turning off at an intersection they had passed some moments before .  no one appeared to be following them .     morrison then turned to watch paleron s profile .  she seemed competent but grim .  it was clear to him now that she was not only no waitress by true profession but was very likely no soviet citizen .  her english had a strong urban accent that no european would learn in school or could pick up in a way that would be true enough to fool morrison s ear .     he said   you were waiting there outside the hotel  reading a book  so that you would see sophia and myself when we came .       you got it   said paleron .      you re an american agent  aren t you .       shrewder and shrewder .       where are we going .       to the designated airport where the swedish plane will pick you up .  i had to get the details on that from kaliinin .       and you know how to get there .       yes  indeed .  i ve been in malenkigrad for considerably longer a period than your kaliinin has been here .     but tell me  why did you tell her this man  konev  was in love with her .  she was just waiting to hear that from a third person .  she wanted it confirmed and you did that for her .  in that way  you handed over the whole game to konev .  why did you do it .       for one thing   said morrison mildly   it was the truth .       the truth .   paleron  looking bemused  shook her head .   you don t belong in the real world .  you sure don t .  i m surprised no one knocked you on the head and buried you long ago    just for your own good .  besides  how do you know it s the truth .      morrison said   i know .     but i was sorry for her .  she saved my life yesterday .  she saved all our lives yesterday .  for that matter  konev saved my life  too .       you all saved each other s life  i suppose .       yes  as a matter of fact .       but that was yesterday .  today you started fresh and you shouldn t have let yesterday influence you .  she would never have taken up with him again if it weren t for your dumb remark .  he could have sworn himself purple about loving her and all the rest of that rubbish and she wouldn t have believed him .  she dared not .  be made a fool of again .  never .  she would have stunned him to the ground in another minute and then you told her   why  yes  kid  that there guy loves you   and that s all she needed .  i tell you  morrison  you shouldn t be out without your keeper .      morrison stirred uneasily   how do you know all this .       i was on the floor in the back seat of this car  ready to go with you and kaliinin and to make sure she took you there .  and then you pulled your dumb trick .  what was there to do but grab you and keep you from being stunned down  then get you back to the room where we could have some privacy  and after that get hold of the stunner somehow .       thank you .       that s all right .     and i made them look like a loving couple  too .  anyone coming in will be bound to say   excuse me   and leave quickly    and that will give us more time .       how long will it be before they re conscious again .       i don t know .  it depends on how accurately i placed the radiation and what each state of mind was and who knows what else .  but when they do come back  it will take them some time to remember what happened .  i m hoping that in their position  the first thing they ll remember is that they re in love .  that would preoccupy them for a while .  then when they do get around to remembering you and what it was that was being done with moscow  it will be too late .       are they going to be permanently damaged .      paleron cast a quick look at morrison s concerned face .   you re worried about them  aren t you .  why .  what are they to you .       well  .  .  .  shipmates .      paleron made an inelegant sound .   i guess they ll recover okay .  they might be better off if some of that supersensitive edge is ground off .  they can get together and make a nice family then .       and what s going to happen to you .  you d better get on the plane with me .       don t be a jackass .  the swedes wouldn t take me .  they ve got orders to take one guy and they ll test you to make sure you re the right one .  they ll have records of your fingerprints and your retina pattern  right out of the files of the population board .  if they take the wrong person or an additional person  that ll be a new incident and the swedes are too smart for that .       but then what will happen to you .       well  for starters  i ll say you got hold of the stunner and rayed them both  then held the stunner on me and made me take you to the airport because you didn t know its location .  you ordered me to stop outside the gates  then stunned me down and tossed the stunner into the car .  early tomorrow  i ll make my way back to malenkigrad  like i was coming out of a stunning .       but konev and kaliinin will deny your story .       they weren t looking at me when they were stunned and almost no one remembers the actual moment of stunning  anyway .  besides  the soviet government knows that they ordered you returned and if you are returned  then anything konev will tell them about you will do him no good .  the government will accept the fait accompli .  it s rubles to kopeks or  better  dollars to kopeks that they ll prefer to forget the whole thing    and i ll just go back to waitressing .       there s bound to be some suspicion clinging to you .       then we ll see   she said .   nichevo .  what will be  will be .   she smiled faintly .     they continued to travel along the highway and morrison finally said with a touch of diffidence   shouldn t we to speed it up a little .       not even by a kilometer per hour   said paleron firmly .   we re going at just under the speed limit and the soviets have every centimeter of the highway radarized .  they have no sense of humor about the speed limit and i don t intend to spend hours trying to get out of a police station because i wanted to save fifteen minutes reaching the plane .      it was past noon now and morrison was beginning to feel the mild  premonitory pinches of hunger .  he said   what was it that konev told moscow about me  do you suppose .      paleron shook her head .   don t know .  whatever it was  he got a response on his personal wavelength .  it signaled about twenty minutes ago .  you didn t hear .       no .       you wouldn t last long in my business .     naturally  they got no answer  so whoever konev was talking to in moscow will try to find out why .  someone will find them and then they ll figure you re on the way to the airport and someone will chase out after us to see if you can be headed off .  like pharaoh s chariots .       we don t have moses to part the red sea for us   muttered morrison .      if we get to the airport  we ll have the swedes .  they won t give you up to anybody .       what can they do against the soviet military .       it won t be the soviet military .  it will be some functionary  working for an extremist splinter group  who will try to bluff the swedes .  but we have official papers giving you up to them and they won t be bluffed .  we just have to get there first .       and you don t think we should go faster .      paleron shook her head firmly .     half an hour later  paleron pointed and said   there we are and we have the breaks .  the swedish plane is in early and has landed .      she stopped the car  pressed a button  and the door flew open on his side .   you go on alone .  i don t want to be seen  but listen     she leaned toward him .   my name is ashby .  when you get to washington  tell them that if they think it s time for me to get out    i m ready .  got it .       i ve got it .      morrison got out of the car  blinking in the sunlight .  in the distance  a man in uniform    not a soviet uniform  as nearly as he could tell    waved him forward .     morrison broke into a run .  there were no speed limits on running and though he could see no one in pursuit he would not have been surprised to see someone rise out of the ground to stop him .     he turned  waved a last time in the direction of the car  thought he saw an answering wave  and continued to run .     the man who had gestured to him advanced  first at a walk  then at a run  and caught him as he all but fell forward .  morrison could see now that he was wearing a european federation uniform .      may i please have your name .   said the man in english .  his accent  to morrison s infinite relief  was swedish .      albert jonas morrison   he said and together they walked toward the plane and the small group waiting to check his identity .        .     morrison sat at the plane window  tense and exhausted  staring downward at the land fleeing east .  a lunch  consisting largely of herring and boiled potatoes  had soothed the inner man but scarcely the inner mind .     had the miniaturized trip through the bloodstream and brain yesterday  only yesterday .   twisted him forever into a mental attitude of apprehension of imminent disaster .  would he never again be able to accept the universe as friendly .  would he never walk through it in serene consciousness that no one and no thing wished him harm .     or had there merely been insufficient time for him to recover .     of course  common sense told him that there was reason not to feel completely safe yet .  that was still soviet earth under the plane .     was there still time for konev s ally in moscow  whoever he might be  to send out planes after the swedes .  was he powerful enough to do so .  would pharaoh s chariots take to the air and continue the pursuit .     for a moment  his heart failed him when he actually saw a plane in the distance    then another .     he turned to the stewardess  who sat across the aisle from him .  he did not have to ask the question .  she apparently read his anxious expression accurately .      federation planes   she said   as escort .  we ve left soviet territory .  the planes are swedish crewed .      then  when they passed over the english channel  american planes joined the escort .  morrison was safe from the chariots  at any rate .     his mind did not let him rest  however .  missiles .  would someone actually commit an act of war .  he tried to calm himself .  surely no man in the soviet union  not even the soviet executive himself  could make such a move without consultation and no consultation would take less than hours or perhaps days .     it couldn t be .     still  it wasn t until the plane had landed on the outskirts of washington that morrison could allow himself to feel that it was over and that he was safely in his own country .        .     it was saturday morning and morrison was recovering .  he had attended to his creature needs .  he had had breakfast and had washed .  he was even partly dressed .     now he lay in bed on his back  arms behind his head .  it was cloudy outside and he had only half clarified the window because he wanted a sense of privacy .  in the hours after he had disembarked from the plane and had been rushed to his present place of concealment  there had been enough official crowding around him to make him wonder a bit if he was any better off in the united states than he had been in the soviet union .     the doctors had finally finished their probing  the initial questions had been asked and answered  even during dinner  and they had finally left him to his sleep in a room that was  in turn  inside something that resembled a fortress for the depth of its security .     well  at least he didn t have to face miniaturization .  there was always that thought to comfort him .     the door signal flashed and morrison reached over his head  feeling the bedboard for the button that would clarify the one way patch on the door .  he recognized the face that appeared and pushed another contact that allowed the door to be opened from the outside .     two men entered .  the one whose familiar face had been at the one way patch said   you remember me  i hope .      morrison made no move to get out of bed .  he was the center now around which all revolved  at least temporarily  and he would take advantage of that .  he simply raised his arm in casual greeting and said   you re the agent who wanted me to go to the soviet union .  rodano  isn t it .       francis rodano  yes .  and this is professor robert g .  friar .  i imagine you know him .      morrison hesitated and then courtesy swung his feet off the bed and lifted him to his feet .   hello  professor .  i know of you  of course  and have seen you on holovision often enough .  i m pleased to make your personal acquaintance .      friar  one of the  visible scientists  whose photographs and hv appearances had made him familiar to most of the world  smiled tightly .  he had a round face  pale blue eyes  an apparently permanent vertical crease between his eyebrows  ruddy cheeks  a sturdy body of average height  and a way of looking around him restlessly .     he said   you  i take it  are albert jonas morrison .       that s right   said morrison easily .   mr .  rodano will vouch for me .  please sit down  both of you  and forgive me if i continue to relax on the bed .  i have about a year s relaxation to catch up on .      the two visitors sat down on a large couch and leaned toward morrison .  rodano smiled a bit tentatively .   i can t promise you much relaxation  dr .  morrison .  at least for a while .  incidentally  we have just received word from ashby .  do you remember her .       the waitress who turned the tables .  yes  indeed .  without her         we know the essentials of the story  morrison .  she wants you to know that your two friends have recovered and are apparently fond of each other still .       and ashby  herself .  she told me she was ready to leave if washington thought it best .  i reported that last night .       yes  we ll get her out one way or another .     and now i m afraid we must bother you again .      morrison frowned .   how long will this keep up .       i don t know .  you must take it as it comes .     professor friar  won t you take over .      friar nodded .   dr .  morrison  do you mind if i take notes .     no  let me rephrase that .  i am going to take notes  morrison .      he plucked a small computer keyboard of advanced design out of his briefcase .     rodano said mildly   where will these notes go  professor .       to my recording device  mr .  rodano .       which is where  professor .       in my office at defense  mr .  rodano   then  with some irritation under the other s continuing stare   into my safe in my office at defense and both the safe and the recording device are well coded .  does that satisfy you .       proceed  professor .      friar turned to morrison and said   is it true that you were miniaturized  morrison .  you  personally .       i was .  at my smallest  i was the size of an atom while part of a ship the size of a glucose molecule .  i spent better than half a day inside a living human body  first in the bloodstream  then in the brain .       and this is true .  no chance of an illusion or trickery .       please  professor friar .  if i were tricked or hypnotized  my testimony now would be worthless .  we can t proceed unless you recognize the fact that i am in my right mind and can be relied on to report events that correspond reasonably well with reality .      friar s lips pressed together and then he said   you are right .  we must make assumptions to begin with and i will assume you are sane and reliable    without prejudice to further reconsideration of such assumptions .       of course   said morrison .      in that case     and friar turned to rodano     we begin with one great and important observation .  miniaturization is possible and the soviets do indeed have it and make use of it and can miniaturize even living human beings without apparent harm to them .      he turned back to morrison .   presumably  the soviets claim to miniaturize by reducing the size of planck s constant .       yes  they do .       of course they do .  there s no other conceivable way of doing it .  did they explain the procedure by which that was done .       certainly not .  you might as well make the assumption that the soviets scientists i dealt with are as sane as we are .  they wouldn t carelessly give away anything they don t want us to know .       very well  then .  assumption made .  now tell us exactly what happened to you in the soviet union .  do not tell it as an adventure story  but only as the observations of a professional physicist .      morrison began to talk .  he was not entirely sorry to do so .  he wanted to exorcise it and he didn t want the responsibility of being the only american to know what he knew .  he told the story in detail and it took hours .  he did not finish until they were sitting at a lunch delivered by room service .     over dessert  friar said   let me summarize  then  as best i can from memory .  to begin with  miniaturization does not affect time flow  nor the quantum interactions    that is  the electromagnetic  weak and strong interactions .  the gravitational interaction is affected  however  and decreases in proportion to mass  as it naturally would .  is that so .      morrison nodded .     friar went on .   light    and electromagnetic radiation  generally    can cross into and out of the miniaturization field  but sound cannot .  normal matter is weakly repelled by the miniaturization field but  under pressure  normal matter can be made to enter it and be itself miniaturized  at the expense of the energy of the field .      morrison nodded again .     friar said   the more miniaturized an object becomes  the less energy is required to miniaturize it further .  do you know if the energy requirement decreases in proportion to the mass remaining at any particular stage of miniaturization .       that would certainly seem logical   said morrison   but i don t recall anyone mentioning the quantitative nature of that phenomenon .       to go on  then .  the more miniaturized an object  the greater the chance of its spontaneous deminiaturization    and that refers to the entire mass within the field  rather than to any component part .  you  as a separated individual  were more likely to deminiaturize spontaneously than you would as part of the ship .  is that right .       that was my understanding .       and your soviet companions admitted that it was impossible to maximize and to make things more massive than they are in nature .       again  that was my understanding .  you must realize  professor friar  that i can only repeat what i was told .  they might have deliberately misled me or they may have been wrong because they had insufficient knowledge themselves .       yes yes  i understand .  do you have any reason to believe they were deliberately misleading you .       no .  it seemed to me they were being honest .       well  perhaps .  now  the most interesting thing to me is that brownian motion was in balance with miniaturization oscillation and that the greater the degree of miniaturization  the greater the shift in balance toward oscillation and away from ordinary brownian motion .       that is an actual observation of my own  professor  and doesn t rest merely on what i was told .       and that shift of balance has something to do with the rate of spontaneous deminiaturization .       that is my own thought .  i cannot state it as fact .       hmm .   friar sipped thoughtfully at his coffee and said   the trouble is that all this is superficial .  it tells us about the behavior of the miniaturization field  but nothing about how the field is produced .     and in decreasing the value of planck s constant  they leave the speed of light untouched  you say .       yes  but that  as i emphasized  means that maintaining the miniaturization field costs enormously in energy .  if they can couple planck s constant with the speed of light  increasing the latter as they decrease the former    but they don t have that yet .       so they say .  it was in shapirov s mind  supposedly  but you were unable to get it out .       that s right .      friar remained lost in thought for a few minutes  then shook his head .   we ll go over everything you ve said and deduce what we can from it  but i fear it won t help .       why not .   asked rodano .      because none of it goes to the heart .  if someone who had never seen a robot or heard anything about any of its component parts were to report a robot in operation  he could describe how the head and limbs moved  how the voice sounded  how it obeyed orders  and so on .  nothing he could observe would tell him how a positronic brainpath works or what a molecular valve is .  he would not even have an inkling that either exists  nor would those scientists who would work from his observations have any .      the soviets have some technique to produce the field and we know nothing about it  nor does anything morrison can tell us help us there .  they might have published material that led up to it  not aware that something crucial was in the making    that was what happened in the mid twentieth century  when early work on nuclear fission was published before it was understood that it ought to be kept secret .  the soviets didn t make that mistake with miniaturization  however .  nor have we succeeded in retrieving information concerning the matter through espionage or by the luck of having some key personnel on the other side defect and come to us .      i will consult with my colleagues on the board  but on the whole  dr .  morrison  i m afraid that your adventure in the soviet union  however daring and praiseworthy has    except for your confirmation that miniaturization does exist    been useless .  i m sorry  mr .  rodano  but it might as well not have happened .         .     morrison s expression did not change as friar advanced his conclusion .  he poured himself a little more coffee  added cream judiciously  and drank it without haste .     then he said   you re quite wrong  you know  friar .      friar looked up and said   are you trying to say that you know something about the production of the miniaturization field .  you had said that         what i m going to say  friar  has nothing at all to do with miniaturization .  it has everything to do with my own work .  the soviets took me to malenkigrad and the grotto in order that i might use my computer program to read shapirov s mind .  it failed at that  which is perhaps not surprising  considering that shapirov was in a coma and near death .  on the other hand  shapirov  who had a remarkably penetrating mind  referred to my program as a  relay station  after he had read some of my papers .  that s what it turned out to be .       a relay station .   friar s face took on a look of puzzled distaste .   what does that mean .       instead of tapping shapirov s thought  my programmed computer  once inside one of shapirov s neurons  was acting as a relay  passing thought from one of us to another .      friar s expression became one of indignation .   you mean it was a telepathic device .       exactly .  i first experienced that when i was aware of an intense emotion of love and sexual desire for a young woman who was on the miniaturized ship with me .  naturally  i assumed it was my own feeling  for she was a very attractive woman .  nevertheless  i was not aware of any conscious feeling of that sort .  it was not until several other instances of the sort that i realized i was receiving the thoughts of a young man on board ship .  he and the young lady were estranged  but the passion between them existed  nevertheless .      friar smiled tolerantly .   are you sure you were in condition  on board the ship  to interpret these thoughts properly .  after all  you were under tension .  did you also receive similar thoughts from the young lady .       no .  the young man and i exchanged thoughts  involuntarily  on several occasions .  when i thought of my wife and children  he thought of a woman and two youngsters .  when i was lost in the bloodstream  it was he who picked up my sensations of panic .  he assumed he had detected shapirov s miseries by way of my machine    which remained in my possession when i was adrift    but those were my feelings  not shapirov s .  i did not exchange thoughts with either woman on board  but they exchanged thoughts with each other .  when they tried to catch shapirov s thoughts  they detected similar words and feelings    from each other  of course    which the young man and myself did not .       a sexual difference .   said friar skeptically .      not really .  the pilot of the ship  a male  received nothing at all  either from the women or from the other men  though on one occasion  he did seem to get a thought .  i couldn t say from whom .  my own feeling is that there are brain types  as there are blood types    probably only a few    and that telepathic communication can be most easily established among those of the same brain type .      rodano interposed softly   even if all this is so  dr .  morrison .  what of it .      morrison said   let me explain that .  for years i ve worked to identify the regions and patterns of abstract thought within the human brain with some unremarkable success .  occasionally  i would catch an image  but i never interpreted that properly .  i thought it was coming from the animal on whose brain i was working  but i now suspect that they came when i was fairly close to some human being who was in the grip of strong emotion or deep thought .  i never noticed that .  my fault .      nevertheless  having been stung by the general indifference and downright disbelief and ridicule of my colleagues  i never published the matter of catching images  but modified my program in an attempt to intensify it .  some of those modifications were never published  either .  thus  i entered shapirov s bloodstream with a device that could more nearly serve as a telepathic relay than anything i had ever had before .  and now that  at last  my thick head has absorbed exactly what it is that i have  i know what to do to improve the program .  i am sure of that .      friar said   let me get this straight  morrison .  you are telling me that  as a result of your fantastic voyage into shapirov s body  you are now certain you can so modify your device as to make telepathy practical .       practical to an extent .  yes .       that would be an enormous thing    if you could demonstrate it .   the skepticism in friar s voice did not disappear .      more enormous than you perhaps think   said morrison with some asperity .   you know  of course  that telescopes  whether optical or radio  can be built in parts over a wide area and  if they are coordinated by computer  can achieve the function of a single large telescope  one much larger than can practically be built in a single piece .       yes .  but what of that .       i mention it as an analogy .  i am convinced that i can demonstrate something of the same sort in connection with the brain .  if we were to have six men united telepathically  the six brains would  for the time  act as one large brain and  in fact  be beyond human in intelligence and in the capacity for insight .  think of the advances in science and technology that could be made  advances in other fields of human endeavor as well .  we would  without going through the tedium of physical evolution or the danger of genetic engineering  create a mental superman .       interesting  if true   said friar  obviously intrigued and as obviously unconvinced .      there is a catch  though   said morrison .   i performed all my experiments on animals  placing leads from my computer into the brain .  that was    and as i see now  must be    not at all precise .  no matter how we refine it  we will have only a crude telepathic system at best .  what we need is to invade a brain and place a miniaturized and property programmed computer in a neuron  where it can act as a relay .  the telepathic process will then be sharpened enormously .       and the poor person on whom you inflict this damage   said friar   will eventually explode when the device deminiaturizes .       an animal brain is much inferior to the human brain   said morrison earnestly   because of the fact that the animal brain has fewer neurons  less intricately ordered .  the individual neuron in a rabbit s brain may  however  not be significantly inferior to a human neuron .  a robot could be used as a relay .      rodano said   american brains working in tandem could  then  work out the secret of miniaturization and perhaps even beat the soviets at the task of coupling planck s constant to the speed of light .       yes   said morrison enthusiastically   and one soviet scientist  yuri konev  who was the shipmate who shared thoughts with me  caught on to this  as i did .  it was for that reason that he tried to hold on to me and to my program in defiance of his own government .  without me and my program  i doubt that he can duplicate my work for a long time  perhaps not for many years .  this is not really his field .       continue   said rodano .   i m beginning to get a feeling for this .      morrison said   this is the situation  then .  right now  we ve got a kind of crude telepathy .  even without miniaturization  it may help us forge ahead of the soviets  but it may not .  without miniaturization    and without the establishment of a properly programmed computer in an animal neuron as a relay    we can t be sure of accomplishing anything .      the soviets  on the other hand  have a crude form of miniaturization .  they may  in the ordinary course of investigation  find a way of linking quantum theory and relativity theory to make a truly efficient miniaturization device  but that might take a very long time .      so if we have telepathy but not miniaturization  and if they have miniaturization but not telepathy  it may be that we may win after a long period of time    or they may win .  the nation that wins has  in a sense  an unlimited speed of travel and the universe will belong to it .  that nation that loses will wither    or at least its institutions will wither .  it would be good for us if we win the race  but it is they who may win and the process of racing may force the breakdown of two generations of an uneasy peace and lead to an alldestructive war .      on the other hand  if we and the soviets are willing to work together and  both of us  to use telepathy as refined and strengthened by a miniaturized relay station in a living neuron  we may achieve  in combination and in a very short time  what amounts to antigravity and infinite speed .  the universe will belong to both the united states and the soviet union  indeed  to the whole globe  to earth  to humanity .      why not  gentlemen .  no one would lose .  everyone would gain .      friar and rodano stared at him in wonder .  friar finally said  swallowing hard   you make it sound good  if indeed you have telepathy .       do you have the time to listen to my explanation .       i have all the time you want   said friar .     it took some hours for morrison to explain his theory in detail .  then he leaned back and said   it s almost dinnertime .  now i know that you    and others as well    will be wanting to interview me and that you will all want me to set up a system which will demonstrate the practicality of telepathy and that that will keep me busy for    well  for the rest of my life  for all i know  but i must have one thing now .       what s that .   asked rodano .      some time off to begin with .  please .  i ve gone through enough .  give me twenty four hours    from now until dinnertime tomorrow .  let me read  eat  think  rest  and sleep .  just one day  if you don t mind  and thereafter i will be at your service .       fair enough   said rodano  rising .   i will arrange that if i can and i suspect i can .  the twenty four hours is yours .  make the most of it .  i agree that you ll have precious little time to yourself thereafter .  and from now on  for quite a while  resign yourself to being the most strictly guarded person in america  not excluding the president .       good   said morrison .   i ll call for a dinner for one .         .     rodano and friar had finished their own dinner .  it had been an unusually silent meal in an isolated and guarded room .     once it was over  rodano said   tell me  dr .  friar  do you think morrison is right in this matter of telepathy .      friar sighed and said cautiously   i will have to consult with some of my colleagues who are more knowledgeable concerning the brain than i am  but i feel he is right .  he is very convincing .     and now i have a question for you .       yes .       do you think morrison was correct as to the necessity of cooperation between the united states and the soviet union in this matter .      there was a lengthy pause and finally rodano said   yes  i think he s right there  too .  of course  there ll be howls from every direction  but we can t risk the soviets getting there first .  everyone will see that .  they ll have to .       and the soviets .  will they see it  too .       they ll have to  also .  they can t risk us getting there first .  besides  the rest of the world will undoubtedly get wind of what is going on and they will clamor for a piece of the action and demand that no new cold war be started .  it may take some years  but in the end we will cooperate .      rodano then shook his head and said   but do you know what really strikes me as peculiar  professor friar .      friar said   what in this whole course of events can possibly strike you as not peculiar .       nothing  i suppose  but what strikes me as most peculiar is this .  i met morrison last sunday afternoon to urge him to go to the soviet union .  at the time  my heart sank .  he struck me as a man without guts  as a zero  as a wimp  as someone who wasn t even bright except in an academic sense .  i didn t think he could be relied on to accomplish anything .  i was simply sending him to his death .  so i thought    and so i said to a colleague the next day    and  so help me  so i still think .  he s nothing and it s simply a miracle that he survived and that s only thanks to others .  and yet         and yet .       and yet he returned  having made an incredible scientific discovery and having set in motion a process whereby the united states and the soviet union will both be forced  against their separate wills  to cooperate .  and  to top it off  he has made himself the most important and  once we publicize these events  the most famous scientist in the world    possibly of all time .      he has  in a sense  destroyed the political system of the world and built a new one    or at least initiated the process of building a new one    and he has done it all between the afternoon of last sunday and the afternoon of today  saturday .  he has done it in six days .  somehow that s a frightening thought .      friar leaned back and laughed aloud .   it s more frightening than you think .  he plans to rest on the seventh day .
