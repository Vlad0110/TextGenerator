terry pratchett   the fifth elephant   a novel of discworld        contents         they say the world is flat and supported on the         about the author    praise    other books by terry pratchett    copyright    about the publisher            they say the world is flat and supported on the back of four elephants who themselves stand on the back of a giant turtle .   they say that the elephants  being such huge beasts  have bones of rock and iron  and nerves of gold for better conductivity over long distances .    they say that the fifth elephant came screaming and trumpeting through the atmosphere of the young world all those years ago and landed hard enough to split continents and raise mountains .   no one actually saw it land  which raised the interesting philosophical point  when millions of tons of angry elephant come spinning through the sky  but there is no one to hear it  does it   philosophically speaking   make a noise .   and if there was no one to see it hit  did it actually hit .   in other words  wasn   t it just a story for children  to explain away some interesting natural occurrences .   as for the dwarfs  whose legend it is  and who mine a lot deeper than other people  they say that there is a grain of truth in it .      on a clear day  from the right vantage point on the ramtops  a watcher could see a very long way across the plains .  if it was high summer  they could count the columns of dust as the ox trains plodded on at a top speed of two miles an hour  each two pulling a train of two wagons carrying four tons each .  things took a long time to get anywhere  but when they did  there was certainly a lot of them .   to the cities of the circle sea they carried raw material  and sometimes people who were off to seek their fortune and a fistful of diamonds .   to the mountains they brought manufactured goods  rare things from across the oceans  and people who had found wisdom and a few scars .   there was usually a day   s traveling between each convoy .  they turned the landscape into an unrolled time machine .  on a clear day  you could see last tuesday .   heliographs twinkled in the distant air as the columns flashed messages back and forth about bandit presence  cargoes and the best place to get double egg  treble chips and a steak that overhung the plate all around .   lots of people traveled on the carts .  it was cheap  it beat walking  and you got there eventually .   some people traveled for free .   the driver of one wagon was having problems with his team .  they were skittish .  he   d expect this in the mountains  where all sorts of wild creatures might regard the oxen as a traveling meal .  here there was nothing more dangerous than cabbages  wasn   t there .   behind him  down in a narrow space between the loads of cut lumber  something slept .      it was just another day in ankh morpork     sergeant colon balanced on a shaky ladder at one end of the brass bridge  one of the city   s busiest thoroughfares .  he clung by one hand to the tall pole with the box on top of it  and with the other he held a homemade picture book up to the slot in the front of the box .      and this is another sort of cart     he said .     got it .            s     said a very small voice from within the box .      o kay     said colon  apparently satisfied .  he dropped the book and pointed down the length of the bridge .      now  you see those two markers what has been painted across the cobbles .            s .         and they mean    .         if a cart g   s tween dem in less   na minute    s goin toofas        the little voice parroted .      well done .  and then you    .         painta pic cher .         taking care to show    .         drivr   s face or cart lisens .         and if it   s nighttime you    .         use der sal   mander to make it brite           well done  rodney .  and one of us will come along every day and collect your pictures .  got everything you want .            s .         what   s that  sergeant .      colon looked down at the very large  brown upturned face  and smiled .      afternoon  all     he said  climbing ponderously down the ladder .     what you   re looking at  mister jolson  is the modern watch for the new millenienienum   num .            s a bit big  fred     said all jolson  looking at it critically .     i   ve seen lots of smaller ones .         watch as in city watch  all .         ah  right .         anyone goes too fast around here and lord vetinari   ll be looking at his picture next morning .  the iconographs do not lie  all .         right  fred .     cos they   re too stupid .         his lordship   s got fed up with carts speeding over the bridge  see  and asked us to do something about it .  i   m head of traffic now  you know .         is that good  fred .         i should just think so .     said sergeant colon expansively .     it   s up to me to keep the  er  arteries of the city from clogging up  leadin    to a complete breakdown of commerce and ruination for us all .  most vital job there is  you could say .         and it   s just you doing it  is it .         well  mainly .  mainly .  corporal nobbs and the other lads help  of course .      all jolson scratched his nose .      it was on a similar subject that i wanted to talk to you  fred     said jolson .      no problem  all .         something very odd   s turned up outside my restaurant  fred .      sergeant colon followed the huge man around the corner .  fred usually liked all   s company because  next to all  he was very skinny indeed .  all jolson was a man who   d show up on an atlas and change the orbit of smaller planets .  paving stones cracked under his feet .  he combined in one body   and there was plenty of room left over   ankh morpork   s best chef and its keenest eater  a circumstance made in mashed potato heaven .  sergeant colon couldn   t remember what the man   s real first name had been  he   d picked up the nickname by general acclaim  since no one seeing him in the street for the first time could believe that it was all jolson .   there was a big cart on broad way .  other traffic was backed up trying to maneuver around it .      had my meat delivered at lunchtime  fred  and when my carter came out        all jolson pointed to the large triangular construction locked around one wheel of the cart .  it had been made of oak and steel  and then someone had sloshed some yellow paint over it .   fred tapped it carefully .      i can see where your problem is  right here     he said .     so how long was your carter in there .         well .  i gave him lunch           and very good lunches you do  all  i   ve always said .  what was the special today .         smitten steak with cream sauce and slumpie  and black death meringue to follow     said all jolson .   there was a moment of silence as they both pictured this meal .  fred colon gave a little sigh .      butter on the slumpie .         you wouldn   t insult me by suggesting i   d leave it off  would you .         a man could linger a long time over a meal like that     said fred .     the trouble is  the patrician  all  gets very short about carts parking on the street for more than ten minutes .  he reckons that   s a sort of crime .         taking ten minutes to eat one of my lunches isn   t a crime  fred  it   s a tragedy     said all .     it says here    city watch   fifteen dollar removal     fred .  that   s a couple of days    profits  fred .         thing is     said fred colon     it   ll be paperwork  see .  i can   t just wave that away .  i only wish i could .  there   s all them counterfoils on the spike in my office .  if it was me running the watch  of course   but my hands are tied  see        the two men stood some way apart  hands in pockets  apparently paying little attention to one another .  sergeant colon began to whistle under his breath .      i know a thing or two     said all  carefully .     people think waiters ain   t got ears .         i know lots of stuff  all     said colon  jingling his pocket change .   both men stared at the sky for a while .      i may have some honey ice cream left over from yesterday        sergeant colon looked down at the cart .      here  mister jolson     he said  in a voice of absolute surprise     some complete bastard   s put some sort of clamp on your wheel .  well  we   ll soon see about that .      colon pulled a couple of round  white painted paddles from his belt  sighted on the watch house semaphore tower peeking over the top of the old lemonade factory  waited until the watching gargoyle signaled him  and with a certain amount of verve and flair ripped off an impression of a man with stiff arms playing two games of table tennis at once .      the team   ll be along any minute   ah  watch this        a little farther along the street two trolls were carefully clamping a hay wagon .  after a minute or two one of them happened to glance at the watch house tower  nudged his colleague  produced two bats of his own and with  rather less   lan than sergeant colon  sent a signal .  when it was answered the trolls looked around  spotted colon  and lumbered toward him .      ta da     said colon  proudly .      amazing  this new technology     said all jolson  admiringly .     and they must   ve been  what  forty or fifty yards away .            s   right  all .  in the old days i   d   ve had to blow a whistle .  and they   ll arrive here knowin    it was me who wanted    em  too .         instead of having to look and see it was you     said jolson .      well  yeah     said colon  aware that what had transpired might not be the brightest ray of light in the new dawn of the communications revolution .     of course  it   d have worked just as well if they   d been streets away .  on the other side of the city  even .  and if i told the gargoyle to  as we say     put    it on the    big    tower over on the tump they   d have got it in sto lat within minutes  see .         and that   s twenty miles .         at least .         amazing  fred .         time moves on  all     said colon  as the trolls reached them .      constable chert  who told you to clamp my friend   s cart .     he demanded .      well  sarge  dis morning you said we was to clamp every           not this cart     said colon .     unlock it right now  and we   ll say no more about it  eh .      constable chert seemed to reach the conclusion that he wasn   t being paid to think  and this was just as well  because sergeant colon did not believe trolls gave value for money in that department .     if you say so  sarge           while you   re doing that  me and all here will have a little chat  right  all .     said fred colon .      that   s right  fred .         well  i say chat  but i   ll be mostly listenin     on account of having my mouth full .         snow cascaded from the fir branches .  the man forced his way through  stood fighting for breath for a moment and then set off across the clearing at a fast jog .   across the valley he heard the first blast on the horn .   he had an hour  then  if he could trust them .  he might not make it to the tower  but there were other ways out .   he had plans .  he could outwit them .  keep off the snow as much as you can  double back  make use of the streams   it was possible  it had been done before .   he was sure of that .   a few miles away sleek bodies set out through the forest .  the hunt was on .      and elsewhere in ankh morpork  the fools    guild was on fire .   this was a problem  because the guild   s fire brigade largely consisted of clowns .   and this was a problem because  if you show a clown a bucket of water and a ladder  he knows only one way to act .  years of training take over .  it   s something in the red nose speaking to him .  he can   t help himself .   sam vimes of the ankh morpork city watch leaned against a wall and watched the show .      we really must put that proposal for a civic fire service to the patrician again     he said .  across the street  a clown picked up a ladder  turned  knocked the clown behind him into a bucket of water  then turned again to see what the commotion was  thus sending his rising victim into the bucket again with a surprising parping noise .  the crowd watched silently .  if it were funny  clowns wouldn   t be doing it .      the guilds are all against it     said captain carrot ironfoundersson  his second in command  as the clown with the ladder had a bucket of water poured down his trousers .     they say it   d be trespass .      the fire had taken hold in a first floor room .      if we let it burn it   d be a blow for entertainment in this city     said carrot earnestly .   vimes looked sideways at him .  that was a true carrot comment .  it sounded as innocent as hell  but you could take it a different way .      it certainly would     he said .     nevertheless  i suppose we   d better do something .     he stepped forward and cupped his hands .      all right  this is the watch .  bucket chain .     he shouted .      aw  must we .     said someone in the crowd .      yes  you must     said captain carrot .     come on  everyone  if we form two lines we   ll have this done in no time at all .  what d   you say  eh .  it might even be fun .      and they did it  vimes noted .  carrot treated everyone as if they were jolly good chaps and somehow  in some inexplicable way  they couldn   t resist the urge not to prove him wrong .   and to the disappointment of the crowd the fire was soon put out  once the clowns were disarmed and led away by kind people .   carrot reappeared  wiping his forehead  as vimes lit a cigar .      apparently the fire eater was sick     he said .      it   s just possible we might never be forgiven     said vimes  as they set off on patrol again .     oh no   what now .      carrot was staring upward  toward the nearest clacks tower .      riot in cable street     he said .     it   s all officers  sir .      they broke into a run .  you always did for an all officers .  the people in trouble might well be you .   there were more dwarfs on the streets as they got nearer  and vimes recognized the signs .  the dwarfs all wore preoccupied looks and were walking in the same direction .      it   s over     he said  as they rounded a corner .     you can tell by the sudden increase in suspiciously innocent bystanders .      whatever else the emergency had been  it had been a big one .  the street was strewn with debris  and a fair amount of dwarfs .  vimes slowed down .      third time this week     he said .     what   s gotten into them .         hard to say  sir     said carrot .  vimes shot him a glance .  carrot had been raised by dwarfs .  he also  if he could possibly avoid it  never told a lie .      that isn   t the same as i don   t know  is it     he said .   the captain looked awkward .      i think it   s   sort of political     he said .   vimes noted a throwing ax buried in a wall .      yes  i can see that     he said .   someone was coming along the street  and was probably the reason why the riot had broken up .  lance constable bluejohn was the biggest troll vimes had ever met .  he loomed .  he was so big that he didn   t stand out in a crowd because he was the crowd  people failed to see him because he was in the way .  and  like many overgrown people  he was instinctively gentle and rather shy and inclined to let others tell him what to do .  if fate had led him to join a gang  he   d be the muscle .  in the watch  he was the riot shield .  other watchmen were peering around him .      looks like it started in gimlet   s delicatessen     said vimes  as the rest of the watch moved in .     get a statement off gimlet .         not a good idea  sir     said carrot firmly .     he didn   t see anything .         how do you know he didn   t see anything .  you haven   t asked him .         i know  sir .  he didn   t see anything .  he didn   t hear anything  either .         with a mob trashing his restaurant and scrapping in the street outside .         that   s right  sir .         ah .  i get it .  there   s none so deaf as those that won   t hear  are you saying .         something like that  sir  yes .  look  it   s all over  sir .  i don   t think anyone   s seriously hurt .  it   ll be for the best  sir .  please .         is this one of those private dwarf things  captain .         yes  sir           well  this is ankh morpork  captain  not some mine in the mountains  and it   s my job to keep the peace  and this  captain  doesn   t look like it .  what   re people going to say about rioting in the streets .         they   ll say it   s another day in the life of the big city  sir     said carrot woodenly .      yes  i suppose they would  at that .  however       vimes picked up a groaning dwarf .     who did this .     he demanded .     i   m not in the mood for being messed around .  come on  i want a name .         agi hammerthief     muttered the dwarf  struggling .      all right     said vimes  letting him go .     write that down  carrot .         no  sir     said carrot .      excuse me .         there is no agi hammerthief in the city  sir .         you know every dwarf .         a lot of them  sir .  but agi hammerthief is only found down mines  sir .  he   s a sort of mischievous spirit  sir .  for example     put it where agi puts the coal     sir  means           yes  i can guess     said vimes .     you   re telling me that dwarf just said this riot was started by sweet fanny adams .     the dwarf had disappeared smartly around a corner .      more or less  sir .  excuse me a moment  sir .     carrot stepped across the street  pulling two white painted paddles out of his belt .     i   ll just get a line of sight on a tower     he said .     i   d better send a clacks .         why .         well  we   ve kept the patrician waiting  sir  so it   d be good manners to let him know we   re late .      vimes pulled out his watch and stared at it .  it was turning out to be one of those days   the sort that you got every day .      it is in the nature of the universe that the person who always keeps you waiting ten minutes will  on the day you are ten minutes tardy  have been ready ten minutes early and will make a point of not mentioning this .      sorry we   re late  sir     said vimes  as they entered the oblong office .      oh  are you late .     said lord vetinari  looking up from his paperwork .     i really hadn   t noticed .  nothing serious  i trust .         the fools    guild caught fire  sir     said carrot .      many casualties .         no  sir .         well  that is a blessing     said lord vetinari carefully .  he put down his pen .      now   what do we have to discuss .     he pulled another document toward him and read it swiftly .      ah   i see that the new traffic division is having the desired effect .     he indicated a large pile of paper .     i am getting any amount of complaints from the carters    and drovers    guild .  well done .  do pass on my thanks to sergeant colon and his team .         i will  sir .         i see in one day they clamped seventeen carts  ten horses  eighteen oxen and one duck .         it was parked illegally  sir .         indeed .         however  a strange pattern seems to emerge .         sir .         many of the carters say that they were not in fact parked but had merely halted while an extremely old and extremely ugly lady crossed the road extremely slowly .         that   s their story  sir .         they know she was an old lady by her constant litany on the lines of    oh deary me  my poor old feet    and similar expressions .         certainly sounds like an old lady to me  sir     said vimes  his face still wooden .      quite so .  what is rather strange is that several of them then report seeing the old lady subsequently legging it away along an alley rather fast .  i   d discount this  of course  were it not for the fact that the lady has apparently been seen crossing another street  very slowly  some distance away shortly afterward .  something of a mystery  vimes .      vimes put his hand over his eyes .     it   s one i intend to solve quite quickly  sir .      the patrician nodded  and made a short note on the list in front of him .   as he went to move it aside he uncovered a much grubbier  much folded scrap of paper .  he picked up two letter knives and  using them fastidiously  unfolded the paper and inched it across the desk toward vimes .      do you know anything about this .     he said .   vimes read  in large  round  crayoned letters   deer cur  the cruelt to homliss dogs in this    city is a dissgrays  wat are the watch    do ing a bout it      sined the leak agyansct crule t to dogs .        not a thing     he said .      my clerks say that one like it is pushed under the door most nights     said the patrician .     apparently no one is seen .         do you want me to investigate .     said vimes .     it shouldn   t be hard to find someone in this city who dribbles when he writes and spells even worse than carrot .         thank you  sir     said carrot .      none of the guards report noticing anyone     said the patrician .     is there any group in ankh morpork particularly interested in the welfare of dogs .         i doubt it  sir .         then i shall ignore it pro tem     said vetinari .  he let the soggy letter splash into the wastepaper basket .      on to more pressing matters     he said briskly .     now  then   what do you know about bonk .      vimes stared .   there was a polite cough from carrot .      the river or the town  sir .     he said .   the patrician smiled .     ah  captain  you have long ago ceased to surprise me .  yes  i was referring to the town .         it   s one of the major towns in   berwald  sir     said carrot  balancing the umlaut perfectly .     exports  precious metals  leather  timber and of course fat from the deep fat mines at shmaltzberg           there   s a place called bonk .     said vimes  still marveling at the speed with which they   d got here from a damp letter about dogs .      strictly speaking  sir  it   s more correctly pronounced beyonk     said carrot .      even so           and in beyonk  sir     morpork    sounds exactly like their words for an item of ladies    underwear     said carrot .     there   s only so many syllables in the world  when you think about it .         how do you know all this stuff  carrot .         oh  you pick it up  sir .  here and there .         really .  so exactly which item of           something extremely important will be taking place there in a few weeks     said lord vetinari .     something which  i have to add  is vital to the future prosperity of ankh morpork .         the crowning of the low king     said carrot .   vimes stared from carrot to the patrician  and back again .      is there some kind of circular that goes around that doesn   t get as far as me .     he said .      the dwarf community has been talking about little else for months  sir .         really .     said vimes .     you mean the riots .  those fights every night in the dwarf bars .         captain carrot is correct  vimes .  it will be a grand occasion  attended by representatives of many governments .  and from various uberwald principalities  of course  because the low king only rules those areas of uberwald that are below ground .  his favor is valuable .  borogravia and genua will be there  without a doubt  and probably even klatch .         klatch .  but they   re even farther from uberwald than we are .  what are they bothering to go for .      he paused for a moment  and then added     hah .  i   m being stupid .  where   s the money .         i beg your pardon  commander .         that   s what my old sergeant used so say when he was puzzled  sir .  find out where the money is and you   ve got it half solved .      vetinari stood up and walked over to the big window  with his back to them .      a large country  uberwald     he said  apparently addressing the glass .     dark .  mysterious .  ancient           huge untapped reserves of coal and iron ore     said carrot .     and fat  of course .  the best candles  lamp oils and soap come ultimately from the shmaltzberg deposits .         why .  we   ve got our own slaughterhouse  haven   t we .         ankh morpork uses a great many candles  sir .         it certainly doesn   t use much soap     said vimes .      there are so many uses for fats and tallows  sir .  we couldn   t possibly supply ourselves .         ah     said vimes .   the patrician sighed .      obviously i hope that we may strengthen our trading links with the various nations within uberwald     he said .     the situation there is volatile in the extreme .  do you know much about uberwald  commander vimes .      vimes  whose knowledge of geography was microscopically detailed within five miles of ankh morpork and merely microscopic beyond that  nodded uncertainly .      only that it   s not really a country     said vetinari .     it   s           it   s rather more what you get before you get countries     said carrot .     it   s mainly fortified towns and fiefdoms with no real boundaries and lots of forest in between .  there   s always some sort of feud going on .  there   s no law apart from whatever the local lords enforce  and banditry of all kinds is rife .         so unlike the home life of our own dear city     said vimes  not quite under his breath .  the patrician gave him an impassive glance .      in uberwald the dwarfs and trolls haven   t settled their old grievances  there are large areas controlled by feudal vampire or werewolf clans  and there are also tracts with much higher than normal background magic .  it is a chaotic place  indeed  and you   d hardly think you were in the century of the fruitbat .  it is to be hoped that things will improve  however  and uberwald will  happily  be joining the community of nations .      vimes and vetinari exchanged looks .  sometimes carrot sounded like a civics essay written by a stunned choirboy .      well put     said the patrician  at last .     but until that joysome day  uberwald remains a mystery inside a riddle wrapped in an enigma .         let me see if i   ve got this right     said vimes .     uberwald is like this big suet pudding that everyone   s suddenly noticed  and now with this coronation as an excuse we   ve all got to rush there with knife  fork and spoon to shovel as much on our plates as possible .         your grasp of political reality is masterly  vimes .  you lack only the appropriate vocabulary .  ankh morpork must send a representative  obviously .  an ambassador  as it were .         you   re not suggesting i should go to this affair  are you .     said vimes .      oh  i couldn   t send the commander of the city watch     said lord vetinari .     most of the uberwald countries have no concept of a modern civil peacekeeping authority .      vimes relaxed .      i   m sending the duke of ankh morpork  instead .      vimes sat bolt upright .      they are mostly feudal systems     vetinari went on .     they set great score by rank           i   m not being ordered to go to uberwald .         ordered  your grace .     vetinari looked shocked and concerned .     good heavens  i must have misunderstood lady sybil   she told me yesterday that a holiday a long way from ankh morpork would do you the world of good           you spoke to sybil .         at the reception for the new president of the tailors    guild  yes .  i believe you left early .  you were called away .  some emergency  i understand .  lady sybil happened to mention how you seemed to be  as she put it  constantly on the job  and one thing led to another .  oh dear  i do hope i haven   t caused some marital misunderstanding           i can   t leave the city now of all times .     said vimes desperately .     there   s so much to do .         that is exactly why sybil says you ought to leave the city     said vetinari .      but there   s the new training school           ticking over nicely now  sir     said carrot .      the whole carrier pigeon network is a complete mess           more or less sorted out  sir  now that we   ve changed their feed .  besides  the clacks seems to be functioning very well .         we   ve got to get the river watch set up           can   t do much for a week or two  sir  until we   ve dredged up the boat .         the drains at the chitterling street station are           i   ve got the plumbers working on it  sir .      vimes knew that he had lost .  he had lost as soon as sybil was involved  because she was always a reliable siege engine against the walls of his defenses .  but there was such a thing as going down fighting .      you know i   m no good at diplomatic talk     he said .      on the contrary  vimes  you appear to have amazed the diplomatic corps here in ankh morpork     said lord vetinari .     they   re not used to plain speech .  it confuses them .  what was it you said to the istanzian ambassador last month .     he riffled through the papers on his desk .     let me see  the complaint is here somewhere   oh yes  on the matter of military incursions across the slipnir river  you indicated that further transgressions would involve him  personally  that is to say the ambassador  and i quote    going home in an ambulance .            i   m sorry about that  sir  but it had been a long day and he was really getting on my           since when their armed forces have pulled back so far that they are nearly in the next country     said lord vetinari  moving the paper aside .     i have to say that your observation complied only with the general thrust of my view in this matter but was  at least  succinct .  apparently you also looked at the ambassador in a very threatening way .         it was only the way i usually look .         to be sure .  happily  in uberwald you will only need to look friendly .         ah  but you don   t want me saying things like    how about selling us all your fat really cheap .     do you .     said vimes  desperately .      you will not be required to do any negotiating  vimes .  that will be dealt with by one of my clerks  who will set up the temporary embassy and discuss such matters with his opposite numbers among the courts of uberwald .  all clerks speak the same language .  you will simply be as ducal as you can .  and  of course  you will take a retinue .  a staff     vetinari added  seeing vimes   s blank look .  he sighed .     people to go with you .  i suggest sergeant angua  sergeant detritus and corporal littlebottom .         ah     said carrot  nodding encouragingly .      sorry .     said vimes .     i think there must have been a whole piece of conversation just then that i must have missed .         a werewolf  a troll and a dwarf     said carrot .     ethnic minorities  sir .            but  in uberwald  they are ethnic majorities     said lord vetinari .     all three officers come from there originally  i believe .  their presence will speak volumes .         so far it hasn   t sent me a postcard     said vimes .     i   d rather take           sir  it will show people in uberwald that ankh morpork is a multicultural society  you see .     said carrot .      oh  i see .     people like us .     people you can do business with     said vimes  glumly .      sometimes     vetinari said  testily     it really does seem to me that the culture of cynicism in the watch is   is           insufficient .     said vimes .  there was silence .     all right     he sighed     i   d better go off and polish the knobs on my coronet  hadn   t i .         the ducal coronet  if i remember my heraldry  does not have knobs on .  it is decidedly   spiky     said the patrician  pushing across the desk of small pile of papers topped by a gold edged invitation card .     good .  i will have a   a clacks sent immediately .  you will be more fully briefed later .  do give my regards to the duchess .  and now  please do not let me detain you further           he always says that     muttered vimes  as the two men hurried down the stairs .     he knows i don   t like being married to a duchess .         i thought you and lady sybil           oh  being married to sybil is fine  fine     said vimes hurriedly .     it   s just the duchess bit i don   t like .  where is everyone tonight .         corporal littlebottom   s on pigeon duty  detritus is on night patrol with swires  and angua   s on special duty in the shades  sir .  you remember .  with nobby .         oh gods  yes .  well  when they come in tomorrow you   d better get them to report to me .  incidentally  get that bloody wig off nobby and hide it  will you .     vimes leafed through the paperwork .     i   ve never heard of the low king of the dwarfs .  i thought that    king    in dwarfish just meant a sort of senior engineer .         ah  well  the low king is rather special     said carrot .      why .         well  it all starts with the scone of stone  sir .         the what .         would you mind a little detour on the way back to the yard  sir .  it   ll make things clearer .         the young woman stood on a corner of the shades .  her general stance indicated that she was  in the specialized patois of the area  a lady in waiting .  to be more precise a lady in waiting for mr .  right  or at least mr .  right amount .   she idly swung her handbag .   this was a very recognizable signal  for anyone with the brains of a pigeon .  a member of the thieves    guild would have passed carefully by on the other side of the lane  giving her nothing more than a gentlemanly and above all nonaggressive nod .  even the less polite freelance thieves that lurked in this area would have thought twice before eyeing the handbag .  the seamstresses    guild operated a very swift and nonreversible kind of justice .   the skinny body of done it duncan however  did not have the brains of a pigeon .  the little man had been watching the bag like a cat for fully five minutes  and now the very thought of its contents had hypnotized him .  he could practically taste the money .  he rose on his toes  lowered his head  dashed out of the alley  grabbed the bag and got several inches before the world exploded behind him and he ended up flat in the mud .   something right by his ear started to drool .  and there was a long  very long drawn out growl  not changing in tone at all  just unrolling a deep promise of what would happen if he tried to move .   he heard footsteps  and out of the corner of his eyes saw a swirl of lace .      oh  done it     said a voice .     bag snatching .  that   s a bit low  isn   t it .  even for you .  you could   ve got really hurt .  it   s only duncan  miss .  he   ll be no trouble .  you can let him up .      the weight was removed from duncan   s back .  he heard something pad off into the gloom of an alley .      i done it  i done it     said the little thief desperately  as corporal nobbs helped him to his feet .      yes  i know you did .  i saw you     said nobby .     and you know what   d happen to you if the thieves    guild spotted you .  you   d be dead in the river with no time off for good behavior .         they hate me    cos i   m so good     said duncan  through his matted beard .        ere  you know the robbery at all jolson   s last month .  i done that .         that   s right  duncan .  you done that .         an    that haul at the gold vaults last week  i done that  too .  it wasn   t coalface and his boys .         no  it was you  wasn   t it  duncan .         an    that job at the goldsmith   s that everyone says crunchie ron done           you done it  did you .            s   right     said duncan .      and it was you what stole fire from the gods  too  wasn   t it  duncan .     said nobby  grinning evilly under his wig .      yeah  that was me     duncan nodded .  he sniffed .     i was a bit younger then  of course .     duncan peered shortsightedly at nobby nobbs .      why   ve you got a dress on  nobby .         it   s hush hush  duncan .         ah  right .     duncan shifted uneasily .     you couldn   t spare me a bob or two  could you  nobby .  i ain   t eaten for two days .      small coins gleamed in the dark .      now push off     said corporal nobbs .      thanks  nobby .  you got any unsolved crimes  you know where to find me .      duncan lurched off into the night .   sergeant angua appeared behind nobby  buckling on her breastplate .      poor old devil     she said .      he was a good thief in his day     said nobby  taking a notebook out of his handbag and jotting down a few lines .      kind of you to help him     said angua .      well  i can get the money back out of petty cash     said nobby .     an    now we know who did the bullion job  don   t we .  that   ll be a feather in my cap with mister vimes .         bonnet  nobby .         what .         your bonnet  nobby .  it   s got a rather fetching band of flowers around it .         oh   yeah           it   s not that i   m complaining     said angua     but when we were assigned this job i thought it was me who was going to be the decoy and you who was going to be the backup  nobby .         yeah  but what with you bein          nobby   s expression creased as he edged his way into unfamiliar linguistic territory        mor   phor   log   ic   ally gifted           a werewolf  nobby .  i know the word .         right   well  obviously  you   d be a lot better at lurkin     an      an    obviously it   s not right  women havin    to act as decoys in police work        angua hesitated  as she so often did when attempting to talk to nobby on difficult matters  and waved her hands in front of her as if trying to shape the invisible dough of her thoughts .      it   s just that   i mean  people might       she began .     i mean   well  you know what people call men who wear wigs and gowns  don   t you .         yes  miss .         you do .         yes  miss .  lawyers  miss .         good .  yes .  good     said angua slowly .     now try another one           er   actors  miss .      angua gave up .     you look good in taffeta  nobby     she said .      you don   t think it makes me look too fat .      angua sniffed .      oh no       she said  quietly .      i thought i   d better put scent on for verysillymitude     said nobby quickly .      what .  oh       angua shook her head  took another breath .     i can smell   some   thing   else           that   s surprising     cos this stuff   s a bit on the pungent side and frankly i don   t think lily of the valley is supposed to smell like this              it   s not perfume              but the lavender stuff they had you could clean brass with           can you get back to the chitterling station by yourself  nobby .     said angua .  despite her rising panic  she mentally added  after all  what could happen .  i mean  really .      yes  miss .         there   s something i   d better   sort out        angua hurried away  the new scent filling her nostrils .  it would have to be powerful to combat eau de nobbs  and it was .  oh  it was .   not here  she thought .  not now .   not him .      the running man swung along a branch wet with snow  and managed at last to lower himself onto a branch belonging to the next tree .  that took him a long way from the stream .  how good was their sense of smell .  pretty damn good  he knew .  but this good .   he   d gotten out of the stream onto another overhanging branch .  if they followed the banks  and they   d be bright enough to do that  they   d surely never know he   d left the stream .   there was a howl  away to the left .   he headed right  into the gloom of the forest .      vimes heard carrot scrabble around in the gloom  and the sound of a key in the lock .      i thought the campaign for equal heights was running this place now     he said .      it   s so hard to find volunteers     said carrot  ushering him through the low door and lighting a candle .     i come in every day just to keep an eye on things  but no one else seems very interested .         i can   t imagine why     said vimes  looking around the dwarf bread museum .   the one positive thing you could say about the bread products around him was that they were probably as edible now as they were on the day they were baked .     forged    was a better term .  dwarf bread was made as a meal of last resort and also as a weapon and a currency .  dwarfs were not  as far as vimes knew  religious in any way  but the way they thought about bread came close .   there was a tinkle and a scrabbling noise somewhere in the gloom .      rats     said carrot .     they never stop trying to eat dwarf bread  poor things   ah  here we are .  the scone of stone .  a replica  of course .      vimes stared at the misshaped thing on its dusty display stand .  it was vaguely sconelike  but only if someone pointed this out to you beforehand .  otherwise  the term    a lump of rock    was pretty accurate .  it was about the size  and shape  of a well sat on cushion .  there were a few fossilized currants visible .      my wife rests her feet on something like that when she   s had a long day     he said .      it   s fifteen hundred years old     said carrot  with something like awe in his voice .      i thought this was the replica .         well  yes   but it   s a replica of a very important thing  sir     said carrot .   vimes sniffed .  the air had a certain pungent quality .      smells strongly of cats in here  doesn   t it .         i   m afraid they get in after the rats  sir .  a rat who   s nibbled on dwarf bread tends not to be able to run very fast .      vimes lit a cigar .  carrot gave it a look of uncertain disapproval .      we do thank people for not smoking in here  sir     he said .      why .  you don   t know they   re not going to     said vimes .  he leaned against the display cabinet .     all right  captain .  why am i really going to   bonk .  i don   t know a lot about diplomacy  but i do know it   s never just about one thing .  what   s the low king .  why   re our dwarfs scrapping .         well  sir   have you heard of kruk .         dwarf mining law .     said vimes .      well done  sir .  but it   s a lot more than that .  it   s about   how you live .  laws of ownership  marriage laws  inheritance  rules for dealing with disputes of all kinds  that sort of thing .  everything  really .  and the low king   well  you could call him the final court of appeal .  he   s advised  of course  but he   s got the last word .  still with me .         makes sense so far .         and he is crowned on the scone of stone and sits on it to give his judgments because all the low kings have done that ever since b   hrian bloodaxe  fifteen hundred years ago .  it   gives authority .      vimes nodded  dourly .  that made sense  too .  you did something because it had always been done  and the explanation was    but we   ve always done it this way .     a million dead people can   t have been wrong  can they .      does he get elected  or born or what .     he said .      i suppose you could say he   s elected     said carrot .     but really a lot of senior dwarfs arrange it among themselves .  after listening to other dwarfs  of course .  taking soundings  it   s called .  traditionally he   s from one of the big families .  but   er           yes .         things are a little different this year .  tempers are a bit   stretched .      ah  thought vimes .      wrong dwarf won .     he said .      some dwarfs would say so .  but it   s more that the whole process has been called into question     said carrot .     by the dwarfs in the biggest dwarf city outside uberwald .         don   t tell me  that must be that place hubward of           it   s ankh morpork  sir .         what .  we   re not a dwarf city .         fifty thousand dwarfs now  sir .         really .         yes  sir .         are you sure .         yes  sir .      of course he is  vimes thought .  he probably knows them all by name .      you have to understand  sir  that there   s a sort of big debate going on     said carrot .     on how you define a dwarf .         well  some people might say that they   re called dwarfs because           no  sir .  not size .  nobby nobbs is shorter than many dwarfs  and we don   t call him a dwarf .         we don   t call him a human  either     said vimes .      and  of course  i am also a dwarf .         you know  carrot  i keep meaning to talk to you about that           adopted by dwarfs  brought up by dwarfs   to dwarfs  i   m a dwarf  sir .  i can do the rite of k   zakra  i know the secrets of h   ragna  i can ha   lk my g   rakha correctly   i am a dwarf .         what do those things mean .         i   m not allowed to tell non dwarfs .     carrot tactfully tried to stand out of the way of the cigar smoke .     unfortunately  some of the mountain dwarfs think that dwarfs who have moved away aren   t proper dwarfs  either .  but this time  the kingship has been swung by the views of the ankh morpork dwarfs  and a lot of dwarfs back home don   t like it .  there   s been a lot of bad feeling all round .  families falling out  that sort of thing .  much pulling of beards .         really .     vimes tried not to smile .      it   s not funny if you   re a dwarf .         sorry .         and i   m afraid this new low king is only going to make matters worse  although of course i wish him well .         tough  is he .         er   i think you can assume  sir  that any dwarf who rises sufficiently in dwarf society to even be considered as a candidate for the kingship did not get there by singing the hi ho song and bandaging wounded animals in the forest .  but by dwarf standards  king rhys rhysson is a modern thinker  although i hear he doesn   t like ankh morpork very much .         sounds like a very clear thinker  too .         anyway  this has upset a lot of the more  er  traditional mountain dwarfs who thought the next king would be albrecht albrechtson .         who is not a modern thinker .         he thinks even coming up above ground is dangerously non dwarfish .      vimes sighed .     well  i can see there   s a problem  carrot  but the thing about this problem  the key point  is that it   s not mine .  or yours  dwarf or not .     he tapped the scone   s case .      replica  eh .     he said .     sure it   s not the real one .         sir .  there is only one real scone .  we call it the    thing and the whole of the thing .            well  if it   s a good replica  who   d know .         any dwarf would  sir .         only joking .         there was a hamlet down there  where two rivers met .  there would be boats .   this was working .  the slopes behind him were white and free of dark shapes .  no matter how good they were  let them try to outswim a boat     hard packed snow crunched under his feet .  he staggered past the few rough hovels  saw the jetty  saw the boats  fought with the frozen rope that moored the nearest one  grabbed an oar and pushed himself out into the current .   there was still no movement on the hills .   now  at last  he could take stock .  it was a bigger boat than one man could handle  but all he had to do was fend off the banks .  that   d do for tonight .  in the morning he could leave it somewhere  perhaps ask someone to get a message through to the tower  and then he   d buy a horse and     behind him  under the tarpaulin in the bows  something started to growl .   they really were very clever .      in a castle not far away  the vampire lady margolotta sat quietly  leafing through twurp   s peerage .   it wasn   t a very good reference book for the countries on this side of the ramtops  where the standard work was the almanac de gothick  in which she herself occupied almost four pages   but if you needed to know who thought they were who in ankh morpork it was invaluable .   her copy was now bristling with bookmarks .  she sighed and pushed it away .   beside her was a fluted glass containing a red liquid .  she took a sip  and made a face .  then she stared at the candlelight  and tried to think like lord vetinari .   how much did he suspect .  how much news got back .  the clacks tower had only been up for a month  and was being roundly denounced throughout bonk as an intrusion .  but it seemed to be doing a good if stealthy local traffic .   who would he send .   his choice would tell her everything  she was sure .  someone like lord rust or lord selachii   well  she   d think a lot less of him if he sent someone like those .  all that she had heard  and lady margolotta heard a lot of things  the ankh morpork diplomatic corps as a whole could not find its backside with a map .  of course  it was good business for a diplomat to appear stupid  right up to the moment when he   d stolen your socks  but lady margolotta had met some of ankh morpork   s finest and no one could act that well .   the growing howling outside began to get on her nerves .  she rang for her butler .      yeth  mithtreth .     said igor  materializing out of the shadows .      go and tell the children of the night to make wonderful music somewhere else  will you .  i have a headache .         indeed  mithtreth .      lady margolotta yawned .  it had been a long night .  she   d think better after a good day   s sleep .   as she went to blow out the candle  she glanced at the book again .  there was a marker in the vs .   but   surely even the patrician couldn   t know that much     she hesitated  and then pulled the bellpull above the coffin .  igor reappeared  in the way of igors .      those keen young men at the clacks tower will be awake  won   t they .         yeth  mithtreth .         send a clacks to our agent asking for everything about commander vimes of the watch  will you .         ith he a diplomat  mithtreth .      lady margolotta lay back .     no  igor .  he   s the reason for diplomats .  close the lid  will you .         sam vimes could parallel process .  most husbands can .  they learn to follow their own line of thought while at the same time listening to what their wives say .  and the listening is important  because at any time they could be challenged and must be ready to quote the last sentence in full .  a vital additional skill is being able to scan the dialogue for telltale phrases  such as    and they can deliver it tomorrow    or    so i   ve invited them for dinner    or    they can do it in blue  really quite cheaply .      lady sybil was aware of this .  sam could coherently carry on an entire conversation while thinking about something completely different .      i will tell willikins to pack winter clothes     she said  watching him .     it   ll be pretty cold up there at this time of year .         yes .  that   s a good idea .     vimes continued to stare at a point just above the fireplace .      we   ll have to host a party ourselves  i expect  so we ought to take a cartload of typical ankh morpork food .  show the flag  you know .  do you think i should take a cook along .         yes  dear .  that would be a good idea .  no one outside the city knows how to make a knuckle sandwich properly .      sybil was impressed .  ears operating entirely on automatic had nevertheless triggered the mouth into making a small but coherent contribution .   she said     do you think we ought to take the alligator with us .         yes  that might be advisable .      she watched his face .  small furrows formed on vimes   s brow as the ears nudged the brain .  he blinked .      what alligator .         you were miles away  sam .  in uberwald  i expect .         sorry .         is there a problem .         why   s he sending me  sybil .         i   m sure havelock shares with me a conviction that you have hidden depths  sam .      vimes sank gloomily into his armchair .  it was  he felt  a persistent flaw in his wife   s otherwise practical and sensible character that she believed  against all evidence  that he was a man of many talents .  he knew he had hidden depths .  there was nothing in them that he   d like to see float to the surface .  they contained things that should be left to lie .   there was also a nagging worry that he couldn   t quite pin down .  had he been able to  he might have expressed it like this  policemen didn   t go on holiday .  where you got policemen  as lord vetinari was wont to remark  you got crime .  so if he went to bonk  however you pronounced the damn place  there would be a crime .  it was something the world always laid on for policemen .      it   ll be nice to see serafine again     said sybil .      yes  indeed     said vimes .   in bonk he would not  officially  be a policeman .  he did not like this at all .  he liked this even less than all the other things .   on the few occasions he   d been outside ankh morpork and its surrounding fiefdom he   d either been going to other local cities where the ankh morpork badge carried some weight  or he had been in hot pursuit  that most ancient and honorable of police procedures .  from the way carrot talked  in bonk his badge would merely figure as extra roughage on someone   s menu .   his brow wrinkled again .      serafine .         lady serafine von uberwald     said sybil .     sergeant angua   s mother .  you remember me telling you last year .  we were at finishing school together .  of course  we all knew she was a werewolf  but nobody would ever dream of talking about that sort of thing in those days .  well  you just didn   t .  there was all that business over the ski instructor  of course  but i   m certain in my own mind that he must have fallen down some crevasse or other .  she married the baron  and they live just outside beyonk .  i write to her with a little news every hogswatch .  a very old werewolf family .         a good pedigree     said vimes  absently .      you know you wouldn   t like angua to hear you say that  sam .  don   t worry so .  you   ll have a chance to relax  i   m sure .  it will be good for you .         yes  dear .         it   ll be like a second honeymoon     said sybil .      yes indeed     said vimes  remembering that what with one thing and another they   d never really had a first one .      on that  er  subject     said sybil  a little more hesitantly     you remember i told you i was going to see old mrs .  content .         oh yes  how is she .     vimes was staring at the fireplace again .  it wasn   t just old school friends  sometimes it seemed sybil kept in touch with anyone she   d ever met .   her hogswatch card list ran to a second volume .      quite well  i believe .  anyway  she agrees that        there was a knocking at the door .   she sighed .     it   s willikins   s evening off     she said .     you   d better answer it  sam .  i know you want to           i   ve told them not to disturb me unless it   s serious     said vimes  getting up .      yes  but you think all crime is serious  sam .      carrot was on the doorstep .      it   s a bit   political  sir     he said .      what   s so political at a quarter to ten at night  captain .         the dwarf bread museum   s been broken into  sir     said carrot .   vimes looked into his honest blue eyes .      a thought occurs to me  captain     he said  slowly .     and the thought is  a certain item has gone missing .         that   s right  sir .         and it   s the replica scone .         yes  sir .  either they broke in just after we left  or     carrot licked his lips nervously     they were hiding while we were there .         not rats  then .         no  sir .  sorry  sir .      vimes fastened his cloak and took his helmet off its peg .      so someone has stolen a replica of the scone of stone a few weeks before the real one is due to be used in a very important ceremony     he said .     i find this intriguing .         that   s what i thought too  sir .      vimes sighed .     i hate the political ones .      when they   d gone  lady sybil sat for a while staring at her hands .  then she took a lamp into the library and pulled down a slim volume  bound in white leather on which had been embossed in gold the words our wedding .   it had been a strange event .  ankh morpork   s high society   so high that it   s stinking  sam always said   had turned up mostly out of curiosity .  she was ankh morpork   s most eligible spinster who   d never thought she   d be married  and he was a mere captain of the guard who tended to annoy a lot of people .   and here were the iconographs of the event .  there she was  looking rather more expansive than radiant  and there sam was  scowling at the camera with his hair hastily smoothed down .  there was sergeant colon with his chest inflated so much his feet had almost left the ground  and nobby grinning widely or perhaps just making a face  it was so hard to tell with nobby .   sybil turned over the pages with care .  she had put a sheet of tissue between each one  to protect them .   in many ways  she told herself  she was very lucky .  she was very proud of sam .  he worked hard for a lot of people .  he cared about people who weren   t important .  he always had far more to cope with than was good for him .  he was the most civilized man she   d ever met .  not a gentleman  thank goodness  but a gentle man .   she never really knew what it was he did .  oh  she knew what the job was  but by all accounts he didn   t spend much time behind his desk .  he tended to drop his clothes into the laundry basket before he eventually came to bed  so she   d only hear later from the laundry girl about the bloodstains and the mud .  there were rumors of chases over rooftops  hand to hand and knee to groin fights with men who had names like harry    the boltcutter    weems     there was a sam vimes she knew  who went out and came home again  and out there was another sam vimes who hardly belonged to her and lived in the same world as all those men with the dreadful names     sybil ramkin had been brought up to be thrifty  thoughtful  genteel in an outdoor sort of way  and to think kindly of people .   she looked at the pictures again  in the silence of the house .   then she blew her nose loudly and went off to do the packing and other sensible things .      corporal cheery littlebottom pronounced her name    cheri .     she was a she  and therefore a rare bloom in ankh morpork .   it wasn   t that dwarfs weren   t interested in sex .  they saw the vital need for fresh dwarfs to leave their goods to and continue the mining work after they had gone .  it was simply that they also saw no point in distinguishing between the sexes anywhere but in private .  there was no such thing as a dwarfish female pronoun or  once the children were on solids  any such thing as women   s work .   then cheery littlebottom had arrived in ankh morpork  and had seen that there were men out there who did not wear chain mail or leather underwear   but did wear interesting colors and exciting makeup  and these men were called    women .         and in the little bullet head the thought had arisen     why not me .      now she was being denounced in cellars and dwarf bars across the city as the first dwarf in ankh morpork to wear a skirt .  it was hard wearing brown leather and as objectively erotic as a piece of wood but  as some older dwarfs would point out  somewhere under there were his knees .    worse  they were now finding that among their sons were some   they choked on the word      daughters .     cheery was only the frothy bit on the tip of the wave .  some younger dwarfs were shyly wearing eye shadow and declaring that  as a matter of fact  they didn   t like beer .  a current was running through dwarf society .   dwarf society was not against a few well thrown rocks in the direction of those bobbing on the current  but captain carrot had put the word on the street that this would be assault on an officer  a subject on which the watch held views  and however short the miscreants  their feet really would not touch the ground .   cheery had retained her beard and round iron helmet  of course .  it was one thing to declare that you were female  but quite unthinkable to declare that you weren   t a dwarf .      open and shut case  sir     she said  when she saw vimes come in .     they opened the window in the back room to get in  a very neat job  and didn   t shut the front door after they left .  smashed the scone   s case  there   s the glass all round the stand .  didn   t take anything else that i can see .  left a lot of footprints in the dust .  i took a few pictures  but they   re scuffed up and weren   t much good in the first place .  that   s about it  really .         no dropped cigarette butts  wallets or bits of paper with an address on them .     said vimes .      no  sir .  they were inconsiderate thieves .         they certainly were     said carrot grimly .      a question that springs to mind     said vimes     is  why does it reek even worse of cat   s piss now .         it is rather sharp  isn   t it     said cheery .     with a hint of sulfur  too .  constable ping said it was like this when he arrived  but there   s no cat prints .      vimes crouched down and looked at the broken glass .      how did we find out about this .     he said  prodding a few fragments .      constable ping heard the tinkle  sir .  he went around the back and saw the window was opened .  then the crooks got out through the front door .         sorry about that  sir     said ping  stepping forward and saluting .  he was a cautious looking young man  who appeared permanently poised to answer a question .      we all make mistakes     said vimes .     you heard glass break .         yessir .  and someone swore .         really .  what did they say .         er      bugger     sir .         and you went around the back and saw the broken window and you    .         i called out    is there anyone there .      sir .         really .  and what would you have done if a voice had said    no    .  no  don   t answer that .  what happened next .         er   i heard a lot more glass break and when i got around to the front the door was open and they were gone .  so i legged it back to the yard and told captain carrot  sir  knowing he sets a lot of store by this place           thank you   ping  is it .         yessir .     entirely unasked  but obviously prepared to answer  ping said     it   s a dialect word meaning    water meadow     sir .         off you go  then .      the lance constable visibly sagged with relief  and left .   vimes let his mind unfocus a little .  he enjoyed moments like these  the little bowl of time when the crime lay before him and he believed that the world was capable of being solved .  this was the time you really looked to see what was there  and sometimes the things that weren   t there were the most interesting things of all .   the scone had been kept on a plinth about three feet high  inside a case made of five sheets of glass  forming a box that was screwed down on the plinth .      they smashed the glass by accident     he said  eventually .      really  sir .         look here  see .     vimes pointed to three loose screws  neatly lined up .     they were trying to take the box apart carefully .  it must have slipped .         but what   s the point .     said carrot .     it   s just a replica  sir .  even if you could find a buyer  it   s not worth more than a few dollars .         if it   s a good one  you could swap it with the real thing     said vimes .      well  yes  i suppose you could try     said carrot .     there would be a bit of a problem  though .         what is it .         dwarfs aren   t stupid  sir .  the replica has got a big cross carved into the underside .  and it   s only made of plaster in any case .         oh .         but it was a good idea  sir     carrot said encouragingly .     you weren   t to know .         i wonder if the thieves knew .         even if they didn   t  they wouldn   t have a hope of getting away with it  sir .         the real scone is very well guarded     said cheery .     it   s very rare that most dwarfs get a chance to see it .         and other people would notice if you had a great lump of rock up your sweater     said vimes  more or less to himself .     so   this was a stupid crime .  but it doesn   t feel stupid .  i mean  why go to all this trouble .  the lock on that door is a joke  you could kick it right out of the woodwork .  if i was going to pinch this thing  i could be in here and out again before the glass had stopped tinkling .  what would be the point of being quiet at this time of night .      the dwarf had been rummaging under a nearby display cabinet .  she drew her hand out .  drying blood glistened on the blade of a screwdriver .      see .     said vimes .     something slipped  and someone cut their hand .  what   s the point of all this  carrot .  cat   s piss and sulfur and screwdrivers   i hate it when you get too many clues  it makes it so damn hard to solve anything .      he threw the screwdriver down .  by sheer luck it hit the floorboards tip first and stood there shuddering .      i   m going home     he said .     we   ll find out what this is all about when it starts to smell .         vimes spent the following morning trying to learn about two foreign countries .  one of them turned out to be called ankh morpork .   uberwald was easy .  it was five or six times bigger than the whole of the sto plains  and stretched all the way up to the hub .  it was mostly so thickly forested  so creased by little mountain ranges and beset by rivers  that it was largely unmapped .  it was mostly unexplored  too .   the people who lived there had other things on their mind  and the people from outside who came to explore went into the forests and never came out again .  and for centuries no one had bothered about the place .  you couldn   t sell things to people hidden by too many trees .   it was probably the coach road that had changed everything  a few years back  when they drove it all the way through to genua .  a road is built to follow .  mountain people had always gravitated to the plains  and in recent years uberwald folk had joined them .  the news got back home  there   s money to be made in ankh morpork  bring the kids .  you don   t need to bring the garlic  though because all the vampires work down at the kosher butchers    .  and if you   re pushed in ankh morpork  you are allowed to push back .  no one cares enough about you to want to kill you .   vimes could just about tell the difference between the uberwald dwarfs and the ones from copperhead  who were shorter  noisier and rather more at home among humans .  the uberwald dwarfs were quiet  tended to scuttle around corners  and often didn   t speak morporkian .  in some of the alleys off treacle mine road you could believe you were in another country .  but they were what every copper desires in a citizen .  they were no trouble .  they mostly had jobs working for one another  they paid their taxes rather more readily than humans did  although to be honest there were small piles of mouse droppings that yielded more money than most ankh morpork citizens  and generally any problems they had they sorted out among themselves .  if such people ever come to the attention of the police  it   s usually only as a chalk outline .   it turned out  though  that within the community  behind the grubby facades of all those tenements and workshops in cable street and whalebone lane  there were vendettas and feuds that had their origins in two adjoining mine shafts five hundred miles away and a thousand years ago .  there were pubs you only drank in if you were from a particular mountain .  there were streets you didn   t walk down if your clan mined a particular lode .  the way you wore your helmet  the way you parted your beard  spoke complicated volumes to other dwarfs .  they didn   t even hand a piece of paper to vimes .      then there   s the way you krazak your g   ardrgh     said corporal littlebottom .      i won   t even ask     said vimes .      i   m afraid i can   t explain in any case     said cheery .      have i got a gaadrerghuh .     said vimes .  cheery winced at the mispronunciation .      yes  sir .  everyone has .  but only a dwarf can krazak his properly     she said .     or hers     she added .   vimes sighed  and looked down at the pages of scrawl in his notebook  under the heading  uberwald .  he wasn   t strictly aware of it  but he treated even geography as if he was investigating a crime  did you see who carved out the valley .  would you recognize that glacier if you saw it again .   .      i   m going to make a lot of mistakes  cheery     he said .      i shouldn   t worry about that  sir .  humans always do .  but most dwarfs can spot if you   re trying not to make them .         are you sure you don   t mind coming .         got to face it sooner or later  sir .      vimes shook his head sadly .      i don   t get it  cheery .  there   s all this fuss about a female dwarf trying to act like  like           a lady  sir .         right  and yet no one says anything about carrot being called a dwarf  but he   s a human           no  sir .  like he says  he   s a dwarf .  he was adopted by dwarfs  he   s performed the y   grad  he observes the j   kargra insofar as that   s possible in a city .  he   s a dwarf .         he   s six foot high .         he   s a tall dwarf  sir .  we don   t mind if he wants to be a human as well .  not even the drudak   ak would have a problem with that .         i   m running out of cough drops here  cheery .  what was that .         look  sir  most of the dwarfs here are   well  i suppose you   d call them liberal  sir .  they   re mainly from the mountains behind copperhead  you know .  they get along with humans .  some of them even acknowledge that   they   ve got daughters  sir .  but some of the more   old fashioned   uberwald dwarfs haven   t gotten out so much .  they still act as if b   hrian bloodaxe were still alive .  that   s why we call them drudak   ak .      vimes had a go  but he knew that to really speak dwarfish you needed a lifetime   s study and  if at all possible  a serious throat infection .            above ground         they negatively          he faltered .         they do not get out in the fresh air enough        cheery supplied .      ah  right .  and everyone thought the new king was going to be one of these .         they say albrecht   s never seen sunlight in his life .  his clan never goes above ground in daylight .  everyone was certain it   d be him .      and as it turned out it wasn   t  thought vimes .  some of the uberwald dwarfs hadn   t supported him .  and the world had moved on .  there were plenty of dwarfs around now who had been born in ankh morpork .  their kids went around with their helmets on back to front and spoke dwarfish only at home .  many of them wouldn   t know a pick ax if you hit them with it .   they weren   t about to be told how to run their lives by an old dwarf sitting on a stale bun under some distant mountain .   he tapped his pencil on his notebook thoughtfully .  and because of this  he thought  dwarfs are punching one another on my streets .      i   ve seen more of those dwarf sedan chair things around lately     he said .     you know  the ones carried by a couple of trolls .  they have thick leather curtains           drudak   ak     said cheery .     very   traditional dwarfs .  if they have to go out in daylight  they don   t look at it .         i don   t recall them a year ago        cheery shrugged .     there   s lots of dwarfs here now  sir .  the drudak   ak feel they   re among dwarfs now .  they don   t have to deal with humans for anything .         they don   t like us .         they won   t even talk to a human .  they   re fairly choosy about talking to most dwarfs  to tell you the truth .         that is daft .     said vimes .     how do they get food .  you can   t live on fungi .  how do they trade ore  dam streams  get wood for shoring up their shafts .         well  either other dwarfs are paid to do it  or humans are employed     said cheery .     they can afford it .  they   re very good miners .  well   they own very good mines  in any case .         sounds to me they   re a bunch of       vimes stopped himself .  he was aware that a wise man should always respect the folkways of others  to use carrot   s happy phrase  but vimes often had difficulty with this idea .  for one thing  there were people in the world whose folkways consisted of gutting other people like clams and this was not a procedure that commanded  in vimes  any kind of respect at all .      i   m not thinking diplomatically  am i .     he said .  cheery watched him with a carefully blank expression .      oh  i don   t know about that  sir     she said .     you didn   t actually finish the sentence .  and   well  a lot of dwarfs respect them .  you know   feel better for seeing them .      vimes looked puzzled .  then understanding dawned .      oh  i get it     he said .     i bet they say things like    thank goodness people are keeping up the old ways     eh .         that   s right  sir .  i suppose that inside every dwarf in ankh morpork is a little part of him   or her   that knows real dwarfs live underground .      vimes doodled on his notepad .     back home     he thought .  carrot had innocently talked about dwarfs    back home .     to all dwarfs far away  the mountains were    back home .     it was funny how people were people everywhere you went  even if the people concerned weren   t the people the people who made up the phrase    people are people everywhere    had traditionally thought of as people .  and even if you weren   t virtuous  as you had been brought up to understand the term  you did like to see virtue in other people  provided it did not cost you anything .      why have these d   r   these traditional dwarfs come here  though .  ankh morpork   s full of humans .  they must have their work cut out avoiding humans .         they   re   needed  sir .  dwarf law is complicated  and there   s often disputes .  and they conduct marriages and that sort of thing .         you make them sound more like priests .         dwarfs aren   t religious  sir .         of course .  oh well .  thank you  corporal .  off you go .  any fallout from last night .  no sulfurous incontinent cats have come forward to confess .         no  sir .  the campaign for equal heights has put out a pamphlet saying it was another example of the second class treatment of dwarfs in the city  but it was the same one they always put out .  you know  the one with blanks to fill in the details .         nothing changes  cheery .  see you tomorrow morning  then .  send detritus up .      why him .  vimes thought .  ankh morpork was lousy with diplomats .  it was practically what the upper classes were for  and it was easy for them because half the foreign bigwigs they   d meet were old chums they   d played wet towel tag with back at school .  they tended to be on first name terms  even with people whose names were ahmed or fong .  they knew which forks to use .  they hunted  shot and fished .  they moved in circles that more or less overlapped the circles of their foreign hosts  and were a long way from the rather grubby circles that people like vimes went around in every working day .  they knew all the right nods and winks .  what chance had he got against a tie and a crest .   vetinari was throwing him among the wolves .  and the dwarfs .  and the vampires .  vimes shuddered .  and vetinari never did anything without a reason .      come in  detritus .      it always amazed sergeant detritus that vimes knew he was at the door .  vimes had never mentioned that the office wall creaked and bent inward as the big troll made his way along the corridor .      you want to see me  sir .         yes .  sit down  man .  it   s this uberwald business .         yessir .         how do you feel about visiting the old country .      detritus   s face remained impassive  as it always did when he was waiting patiently for things to make sense .      uberwald  i mean     vimes prompted .      dunno  sir .  i was a just a pebble when we left dere .  dad wanted a better life in der big city .         there   ll be a lot of dwarfs  detritus .     vimes didn   t bother to mention vampires and werewolves .  either of those who attacked a troll was making the last big mistake of its career in any case .  detritus carried a two thousand pound   draw crossbow as a hand weapon .      dat   s okay  sir .  i   m very modern    bout dwarfs .         these might be a bit old fashioned about you  though .         dem deep down dwarfs .         that   s right .         i heard about dem .         there   s still wars with trolls up near the hub  i hear .  tact and diplomacy will be called for .         you have come to der right troll for that  sir     said detritus .      you did push that man through that wall last week  detritus .         it was done with tact  sir .  quite a fin wall .      vimes let it go at that .  the man in question had just laid out three watchmen with a club  which detritus had broken in one hand before selecting the suitably tactful wall .      see you tomorrow  then .  best dress armor  remember .  send angua now  please .         she   s not here  sir .         blast .  put out some messages for her  will you .         igor lurched through the castle corridors  dragging one foot after the other in the approved fashion .   he was igor  son of igor  nephew of several igors  brother of igors and cousin of more igors than he could remember without checking up in his diary .  igors did not change a winning formula .    and  as a clan  igors liked working for vampires .  they kept regular hours  were generally polite to their servants and  an important extra  didn   t require much work in the bed making and cookery department  and tended to have cool  roomy cellars where an igor could pursue his true calling .  this more than made up for those occasions when you had to sweep up their ashes .   he entered lady margolotta   s crypt and knocked politely on the coffin lid .  it moved aside a fraction .      yes .         thorry to wake you in the middle of the afternoon  your ladythip  but you did thay           all right .  and    .         it   s going to be vimeth  ladythip .  you were right .      a dainty hand came out of the partly opened coffin and punched the air .      yes .         well thpotted  ladythip .         well  well .  samuel vimes .  poor devil .  do the doggies know .      igor nodded .     the baron   th igor was altho collecting a methage  ladythip .         and the dwarfs .         it ith an official appointment  ladythip .  everyone knows .  hith grace the duke of ankh morpork  thir thamuel vimeth  commander of the ankh morpork thity watch .         then the midden has hit the windmill  igor .         very well put  ladythip .  no one liketh a thort thower of thit .         i imagine  igor  that he   ll leave them behind .         let us consider a castle from the point of view of its furniture .   this one has chairs  yes  but they don   t look very lived in .  there is a huge sofa near the fire  and that is ragged with use  but other furnishings look as if they   re there merely for show .   there is a long oak table  well polished and looking curiously unused for such an old piece of furniture .  possibly the reason for this is that on the floor around it are a large number of white earthenware bowls .   one of them has father written on it .   the baroness serafine von uberwald slammed shut twurp   s peerage  irritably .      the man is a   a nothing     she said .     a paper man .  a man of straw .  an insult .         the name vimes goes back a long time     said wolfgang von uberwald  who was doing one handed push ups in front of the fire .      so does the name smith .  what of it .      wolf changed to the other hand  in midair .  he was naked .  he liked his muscles to get an airing .  they shone .  someone with an anatomical chart could have picked out every one .  they might also have remarked on the unusual way his blond hair grew not only on his head but down and across his shoulders as well      he is a duke  mother .         hah .  ankh morpork hasn   t even got a king .            nineteen  twenty   i hear stories about that  mother           oh  stories .  sybil writes a silly little letter to me every year .  sam this  sam that .  of course  she had to be grateful for what she could get  but   the man is just a thief taker  after all .  i shall refuse to see him .         you will not do that  mother     wolf grunted .     that would be   twenty nine  thirty   dangerous .  what do you tell lady sybil about us .         nothing .  i don   t write back  of course .  a rather sad and foolish woman .         and she still writes every year .    thirty six  thirty seven           yes .  four pages  usually .  and that tells you everything about her you need to know .  where is your father .      a flap in the bottom of a nearby door swung back and a large  heavyset wolf trotted in .  it glanced around the room  and then shook itself vigorously .  the baroness bridled .      guye .  you know what i said .  it   s after six .  change when you come in from the garden .      the wolf gave her a look  and strolled behind a massive oak screen at the far end of the room .  there was a   noise  soft and rather strange  not so much an actual sound as a change in the texture of the air .   the baron walked around from behind the screen  doing up the cord of a tattered dressing gown .  the baroness sniffed .      at least your father wears clothes     she said .      clothes are unhealthy  mother     said wolf  calmly .     nakedness is purity .      the baron sat down .  he was a large  red faced man  insofar as a face could be seen under the beard  hair  mustache and eyebrows which were engaged in a bitter four way war over the remaining areas of bare skin .      well .     he growled .      vimes the thief taker from ankh morpork is going to be the alleged ambassador     snapped the baroness .      dwarfs .         of course they   ll be told .      the baron sat staring at nothing  with the same expression detritus used when a new thought was being assembled .      bad .     he ventured  at last .      ruston  i   ve told you about this a thousand times .     said the baroness .     you   re spending far too much time changed .  you know what you   re like afterward .  supposing we had official visitors .         bite    em .         you see .  go on off to bed and don   t come down until you   re fit to be human .         vimes could ruin everything  father     said wolfgang .  he was now doing handstands  using one hand .      ruston .  down .      the baron stopped trying to scratch his ear with his leg .      do .     he said .   wolfgang   s gleaming body dipped a moment as he changed hands again .      city life makes men weak .  vimes will be   fun .  they do say he likes running  though .     he gave a little laugh .     we shall have to see how fast he is .         his wife says he   s very softhearted   ruston .  don   t you dare do that .  if you going to do that sort of thing  do it upstairs .      the baron looked only moderately ashamed  but readjusted his clothing anyway .      bandits .     he said .      yes  they could be a problem at this time of year     said wolfgang .      at least a dozen     said the baroness .     yes  that should        wolf grunted  upside down .      no  mother .  you are being stupid .  his coach must get here safely .  you understand .  when he is here   that is a different matter .      the baron   s massive eyebrows tangled with a thought .      plan .  king .         exactly .      the baroness sighed .     i don   t trust that little dwarf .      wolf somersaulted onto his feet .      no .  but trustworthy or not  he   s all we   ve got .  vimes must get here  with his soft heart .  he may even be useful .  perhaps we should   assist matters .         why .     snapped the baroness .     let ankh morpork look after their own .         there was a knock on the door while vimes was having breakfast .  willikins ushered in a small thin man in neat but threadbare black clothes  whose overlarge head gave him the appearance of a lollypop nearing the last suck .  he was carrying a black bowler hat like a soldier carries his helmet and walked like a man who had something wrong with his knees .      i am so sorry to disturb your grace        vimes laid down his knife .  he   d been peeling an orange .  sybil insisted he eat fruit .      not your grace     he said .     just vimes .  sir samuel if you must .  are you vetinari   s man .         inigo skimmer  sir .  mhm  mhm .  i am to travel with you to uberwald .         ah  you   re the clerk who   s going to do all the whispering and winking while i hand around the cucumber sandwiches  are you .         i will try to be of service  sir  although i   m not much of a winker .  mhm  mhm .         would you like some breakfast .         i ate already  sir .  mhm mhm .      vimes looked the clerk up and down .  it wasn   t so much that his head was big  it was simply that someone appeared to have squeezed the bottom half of it and forced everything up into the top .  he was going bald  too  and had carefully teased the remaining strands of hair across the pink dome .  it was hard to tell his age .  he could be twenty five and a big worrier  or a fresh faced forty .  vimes inclined to the former   the man had the look of someone who had spent his life watching the world over the top of a book .  and there was that   well  was it a nervous laugh .  a giggle .  an unfortunate way of clearing his throat .   and that strange way he walked        not even some toast .  a piece of fruit .  these oranges are fresh from klatch  i really can recommend them        vimes tossed one at the man .  it bounced off his arm  and skimmer took a step backward  mildly appalled at the upper class   s habit of fruit hurling .      are you all right  sir .  mhm mhm .         sorry about that     said vimes .     i was carried away by fruit .      he laid aside his napkin and came around the table  putting his arm around skimmer   s shoulders .      i   ll just take you into the mildly yellow drawing room where you can wait     he said  walking him toward the door and patting him on the arm in a friendly way .     the coaches are loaded up .  sybil is re grouting the bathroom  learning ancient klatchian and doing all those other little last minute things women always do .  you   re with us in the big coach .      skimmer recoiled .     oh  i couldn   t do that  sir .  i   ll travel with your retinue .  mhm mhm .  mhm mhm .         if you mean cheery and detritus  they   re in there with us     said vimes  noting the look of horror deepen slightly .     you need four for a decent game of cards and the road   s as boring as hell for most of the way .         and  er  your servants .         willikins and the cook and sybil   s maid are in the other coach .         oh .      vimes smiled inwardly .  he remembered the saying from his childhood  too poor to paint  but too proud to whitewash        bit of a tough choice  is it .     he said .     i   ll tell you what  you can come in our coach but we   ll give you a hard seat and patronize you from time to time  how about that .         i am afraid you are making a mockery of me  sir samuel .  mhm mhm .         no  but i may be assisting .  and now  if you   ll excuse me  i   ve got to nip down to the yard to sort out a few last minute things .         a quarter of an hour later vimes walked into the charge room at the yard .  sergeant stronginthearm looked up  saluted  and then ducked to avoid the orange that was tossed at his head .      sir .     he said  bewildered .      just testing  stronginthearm .         did i pass  sir .         oh yes .  keep the orange .  it   s full of vitamins .         my mother always told me those things could kill you  sir .      carrot was waiting patiently in vimes   s office .  vimes shook his head .  he knew all the places to tread in the corridor and he knew he didn   t make a sound  and he   d never once caught carrot reading his paperwork  not even upside down .  just once it   d be nice to catch him out at something .  if the man was any straighter you could use him as a plank .   carrot stood up and saluted .      yes  yes  we haven   t got a lot of time for that now     said vimes  sitting behind his desk .     anything new overnight .         an unattributed murder  sir .  a tradesman called wallace sonky .  found in one of his own vats with his throat cut .  no guild seal or note or anything .  we are treating it as suspicious .         yes  i think that sounds fairly suspicious     said vimes .     unless he has a record as a very careless shaver .  what kind of vat .         er   rubber  sir .         rubber comes in vats .  wouldn   t he bounce out .         no  sir .  it   s a liquid in the vat  sir .  mister sonky makes   rubber things           hang on  i remember seeing something once   don   t they make things by dipping them in the rubber .  you made sort of   the right shapes and dip them in to get gloves  boots   that sort of thing .         er   that   er   sort of thing  sir .      something about carrot   s uneasy manner got through to vimes .  and the little file at the back of his brain eventually waved a card .      sonky  sonky   carrot  we   re not talking about sonky as in    a packet of sonkies     are we .      now carrot was bright red with embarrassment .     yes  sir .         my gods  what was he dipping in the vat .         he   d been thrown in  sir .  apparently .         but he   s practically a national hero .         sir .         captain  the housing shortage in ankh morpork would be a good deal worse if it wasn   t for old man sonky and his penny a packet preventatives .  who   d want to do away with him .         people do have views  sir     said carrot coldly .   yes  you do  don   t you  vimes thought .  dwarfs don   t hold with that sort of thing .      well  put some men on it .  anything else .         a carter assaulted constable swires last night for clamping his cart .         assault .         tried to stamp on him  sir .      vimes had a mental picture of constable swires  a gnome six inches tall but a mile high in pent up aggression .      how is he .         well  the man can speak  but it   ll be a little while before he can climb back on a cart again .  apart from that  it   s all run of the mill stuff .         nothing more about the scone theft .         not really .  lots of accusations in the dwarf community  but no one really knows anything .  like you say  sir  we   ll probably know more when it goes bad .         any word on the street .         yes  sir .  it   s    halt     sir .  sergeant colon painted it at the top of lower broadway .  the carters are a lot more careful now .  of course  someone has to shovel the manure off every hour or so .         this whole traffic thing is not making us very popular  captain .         no  sir .  but we aren   t popular anyway .  and at least it   s bringing in money for the city treasury .  er   there is another thing  sir .         yes .         have you seen sergeant angua  sir .         me .  no .  i was expecting her to be here .     then vimes noticed just the very edge of concern in carrot   s voice .     something wrong .         she didn   t turn up for duty last night .  it wasn   t full moon  so it   s a bit   odd .  nobby said she was rather concerned about something when they were on duty the other day .      vimes nodded .  of course  most people were concerned about something if they were on duty with nobby .  they tended to look at clocks a lot .      have you been to her lodgings .         her bed hadn   t been slept in     said carrot .     or her basket  either     he added .      well  i can   t help you there  carrot .  she   s your girlfriend .         she   s been a bit   worried about the future  i think     said carrot .      um   you   she   the  er  werewolf thing    .     vimes stopped  acutely embarrassed .      it preys on her mind     said carrot .      perhaps she   s just gone somewhere to think about things .     like how on earth could she go out with a young man who  magnificent though he was  blushed at the idea of a packet of sonkies .      that   s what i hope  sir     carrot said .     she does that sometimes .  it   s really quite stressful  being a werewolf in a big city .  i know we   d have heard if she   d run into any trouble        there was the sound of harness outside  and the rattle of a coach .  vimes was relieved .  seeing carrot worried was so unusual that it had the shock of the unfamiliar .      well  we   ll have to go without her     he said .     i want to be kept in touch about everything  captain .  a fake scone going missing a week or two before a big dwarf coronation   that sounds like another shoe is about to drop and it might just hit me .  and while you   re about it  put the word out that i   m to be sent anything about sonky  will you .  i don   t like mysteries .  the clacks do a skeleton service as far as uberwald now  don   t they .      carrot brightened up .     it   s wonderful  sir  isn   t it .  in a few months they say we   ll be able to send messages all the way from ankh morpork to genua in less than a day .         yes  indeed .  i wonder if by then we   ll have anything sensible to say to each other .         lord vetinari stood at his window  watching the semaphore tower on the other side of the river .  all eight of the big shutters facing him were blinking furiously   black  white  white  black  white     information was flying into the air .  twenty miles behind him  on another tower in sto lat  someone was looking through a telescope and shouting out numbers     how quickly the future comes upon us  he thought .   he always suspected the poetic description of time like an ever rolling stream .  time  in his experience  moved more like rocks   sliding  pressing  building up force underground and then  with one jerk that shakes the crockery  a whole field of turnips has mysteriously slipped sideways by six feet .   semaphore had been around for centuries  and everyone knew that knowledge had a value  and everyone knew that exporting goods was a way of making money .  and then  suddenly  someone realized how much money you could make by exporting to genua by tonight things known in ankh morpork today .  and some bright young man in the street of cunning artificers had been unusually cunning .   knowledge  information  power  words   flying through the air  invisible     and suddenly the world was tap dancing on quicksand .   in that case  the prize went to the best dancer .   lord vetinari turned away  took some papers from a desk drawer  walked to a wall  touched a certain area and stepped quickly through the hidden door that noiselessly swung open .   beyond was a corridor  lit by borrowed light from high windows and paved with small flagstones .  he walked forward  hesitated  said       no  this is tuesday       and moved his descending foot so that it landed on a stone that in every respect appeared to be exactly the same as its fellows .    anyone overhearing his progress along the passages and stairs may have caught muttered phrases on the lines of       the moon is   waxing       and    yes  it is before noon .     a really keen listener would have heard the faint whirring and ticking inside the walls .   a really keen and paranoid listener would have reflected that anything the lord vetinari said aloud even while he was alone might not be totally worth believing .  not  certainly  if your life depended on it .   eventually he reached a door  which he unlocked .   there was a large attic room beyond  suddenly airy and bright and cheerful with sunlight from the windows in the roof .  it seemed to be a cross between a workshop and a storeroom .  several bird skeletons hung from the ceiling and there were a few other bones on the worktables  along with coils of wire and metal springs and tubes of paint and more tools  many of them probably unique  than you normally saw in any one place .  only a narrow bed  wedged between a thing like a loom with wings and a large bronze statue  suggested that someone actually lived here .  they were clearly someone who was obsessively interested in everything .   what interested lord vetinari right now was the device all by itself on a table in the middle of the room .  it looked like a collection of copper balls balanced on one another .  steam was hissing gently from a few rivets  and occasionally the device went blup        your lordship .      vetinari looked around .  a hand was waving desperately at him from behind an upturned bench .   and something made him look up as well .  the ceiling above him was crusted with some brownish substance  which hung from it like stalactites     blup  with quite surprising speed the patrician was behind the bench .  leonard of quirm smiled at him from underneath his homemade protective helmet .      i do apologize     he said .     i   m afraid i wasn   t expecting anyone to come in .  i   m sure it will work this time  however .      blup     what is it .     said vetinari .   blup     i   m not quite sure  but i hope it is a        and then it was  suddenly  too noisy to talk .   leonard of quirm never dreamed that he was a prisoner .  if anything  he was grateful to vetinari for giving him this airy work space  and regular meals  and laundry  and protecting him from those people who for some reason always wanted to take his perfectly innocent inventions  designed for the betterment of mankind  and use them for despicable purposes .  it was amazing how many of them there were   both the people and the inventions .  it was as if all the genius of a civilization had funneled into one head which was  therefore  in a constant state of highly inventive spin .  vetinari often speculated upon the fate of mankind should leonard keep his mind on one thing for more than an hour or so .   the rushing noise died away .  blup .   leonard peered cautiously over the bench and smiled broadly .      ah .  happily  we appear to have achieved coffee     he said .      coffee .      leonard walked over to the table and pulled a small lever on the device .  a light brown foam cascaded into a waiting cup with a noise like a clogged drain .      different coffee     he said .     very fast coffee .  i rather think you will like it .  i   m calling this the very fast coffee machine .         and that   s today   s invention  is it .     said vetinari .      well  yes .  it would have been a scale model of a device for reaching the moon and other celestial bodies  but i was thirsty .         how fortunate .     lord vetinari carefully removed an experimental pedal powered shoe polishing machine from a chair and sat down .     and i have brought you some more little   messages .      leonard almost clapped his hands .      oh  good .  and i have finished the other ones you gave me last night .      lord vetinari carefully removed a mustache of frothy coffee from his upper lip .     i beg your    .  all of them .  you broke the ciphers on all those messages from uberwald .         oh  they were quite easy after i had finished the new device     said leonard  rummaging through the piles of paper on a bench and handing the patrician several closely written sheets .     but once you realize that there are only a limited number of birth dates a person can have  and that people do tend to think the same way  ciphers are really not very hard .         you mentioned a new device .     said the patrician .      oh yes .  the   thingy .  it is all very crude at the moment  but it suffices for these simple codes .      leonard pulled a sheet off something vaguely rectangular .  it seemed to vetinari to be all wooden wheels and long thin spars which  he saw when he moved closer  were inscribed thickly with letters and numbers .  a number of the wheels were not round but oval or heart shaped or some other curious curve .  when leonard turned a handle  the whole thing moved with a complex oiliness quite disquieting in something merely mechanical .      and what are you calling it .         oh  you know me and names  my lord .  i think of it as the engine for the neutralizing of information by the generation of miasmic alphabets  but i appreciate that it does not exactly roll off the tongue .  er           yes  leonard .         er   it   s not   wrong  is it  reading other people   s messages .      vetinari sighed .  the worried man in front of him  who was so considerate of life that he carefully dusted around spiders  had once invented a device that fired lead pellets with tremendous speed and force .  he thought it would be useful against dangerous animals .  he   d designed a thing that could destroy whole mountains .  he thought it would be useful in the mining industries .  here was a man who  in his tea break  would doodle an instrument for unthinkable mass destruction in the blank spaces around an exquisite drawing of the fragile beauty of the human smile .  with a list of numbered parts .  and if you taxed him with it  he   d say  ah  but such a thing would make war completely impossible  you see .  because no one would dare use it .   leonard brightened up as a thought apparently struck him .     but  on the other hand  the more we know about one another  the more we will learn to understand .  now   you asked me to construct some more ciphers for you .  i am sorry  my lord  but i must have misunderstood your requirements .  what was wrong with the first ones i did .      vetinari sighed .     i am afraid they were unbreakable  leonard .         but surely           it is hard to explain     said vetinari  aware that what to him were the lucid waters of politics was so much mud to leonard .     these new ones you have are   merely devilishly difficult .         you specified fiendishly  sir     said leonard  looking worried .      oh yes .         there does not appear to be a common standard for fiends  my lord  but i did some research in the more accessible occult texts and i believe these ciphers will be considered    difficult    by more than ninety six percent of fiends .         good .         they may perhaps verge on the diabolically difficult in places           that is not a problem .  i shall use them forthwith .      leonard still seemed to have something on his mind .      it would be so easy to make them archdemonically diff           but these will suffice  leonard     said vetinari .      my lord     leonard almost wailed     i really cannot guarantee that sufficiently clever people will be unable to read your messages .         good .         but  my lord  they will know what you are thinking .      vetinari patted him on the shoulder .      no  leonard .  they will merely know what is in my messages .         i really do not understand  my lord .         no  but on the other hand  i cannot make exploding coffee .  what would the world be like if we were all alike .      leonard   s face clouded for a moment .      i   m not sure     he said     but if you would like me to work on the problem  i may be able to devise a           it was merely a figure of speech  leonard .      vetinari shook his head ruefully .  it often seemed to him that leonard  who had pushed intellect into hitherto undiscovered uplands  had discovered there large and specialized pockets of stupidity .  what would be the point of ciphering messages that very clever enemies couldn   t break .  you   d end up not knowing what they thought you thought they were thinking        there was one rather strange message from uberwald  my lord     said leonard .     it arrived yesterday morning  apparently .         strange .         it was not ciphered .         not at all .  i thought everyone used codes .         oh  the sender and recipent are code names  but the message is quite plain .  it was a request for information about commander vimes  of whom you have often spoken .      lord vetinari went quite still .      the return message was mostly clear  too .  a certain amount of   gossip .         all about vimes .  sent yesterday morning .  before i    .         my lord .         tell me     said the patrician     this   message from uberwald   it yields no clue at all to the sender .      sometimes  like a ray of light through clouds  leonard could be quite perceptive .      you think you might know the originator  my lord .         oh  in my younger days i spent some time in uberwald     said the patrician .     in those days rich young men from ankh morpork used to go on what we called the grand sneer  visiting far flung countries and cities in order to see at first hand how inferior they were .  or so it seemed  at any rate .  oh yes   i spent some time in uberwald        it was not often leonard of quirm paid attention to what people around him were doing  but he saw the faraway look in lord vetinari   s eye .      you have fond memories  my lord .     he ventured .      hmm .  oh   she was a very   unusual lady but  alas  rather   older than me     said vetinari .     much older  i have to say .  but   it was a long time ago .  life teaches us its small lessons  and we move on .  the world changes .     there was the distant look again .     well  well  well           and no doubt the lady is now dead     said leonard .  he was not much good at this sort of conversation .      oh  i very much doubt that     said vetinari  coming back to the present .     i have no doubt she thrives .     he smiled .  the world was becoming more   interesting .     tell me  leonard     he said     has it ever occurred to you that one day wars will be fought with brains .      leonard picked up his coffee cup .      oh dear .  won   t that be rather messy .     he said .   vetinari sighed again .      not perhaps as messy as the other sort     he said  trying the coffee .  it really was rather good .      the ducal coach rolled past the last of the outlying buildings and onto the vast  flat sto plains .  cheery and detritus had tactfully decided to ride on the top for the morning  and leave the duke and duchess alone inside .  skimmer was indulging in some uneasy class solidarity and riding with the servants for a while .      angua seems to have gone into hiding     said vimes  watching the cabbage fields pass by .      poor girl     said sybil .     the city   s not really the place for her .         well  you couldn   t winkle carrot out of it with a big pin     said vimes .     and that   s the problem  i suppose .         part of the problem     said sybil .   vimes nodded .  the other part  which no one talked about  was children .   sometimes it seemed to vimes that everyone knew that carrot was the true heir to the redundant throne of the city .  it just so happened that he didn   t want to be .  he wanted to be a copper  and everyone went along with the idea .  but kingship was a bit like a grand piano   you could put a cover over it  but you could still see what shape it was underneath .   vimes wasn   t sure what the result was if a human and a werewolf had kids .  maybe you just got someone who had to shave twice a day around full moon and occasionally felt like chasing carts .  and when you remembered what some of the city   s rulers had been like  a known werewolf as ruler ought to hold no terrors .  it was the buggers who looked human all the time that were the problem .  that was just his view  though .  other people might see things differently .  no wonder she   d gone off to think about things .   he realized he was looking  unseeing  out of the window .   to take his mind off this he opened the package of papers that skimmer had handed him just as he got on the coach .  it was called    briefing material .     the man seemed to be an expert on uberwald  and vimes wondered how many other clerks there were in the patrician   s palace  beavering away  becoming experts .  he settled down glumly and began to read .   the first page showed the crest of the unholy empire that had once ruled most of the huge country .  vimes couldn   t recall much about it  except that one of the emperors once had a man   s hat nailed to his head for a joke .  uberwald seemed to be a big  cold  depressing place  so perhaps people would do anything for a laugh .   the crest was altogether too florid for vimes   s taste and was dominated by a double headed bat .   the first document was entitled  the fat bearing strata of the shmaltzberg region     the land of the fifth elephant     .   he knew the legend  of course .  there had once been five elephants  not four  standing on the back of great a   tuin  but one had lost its footing or had been shaken loose and had drifted off into a curved orbit before eventually crashing down  a billion tons of enraged pachyderm  with a force that had rocked the entire world and split it up into the continents people knew today .  the rocks that fell back had covered and compressed the corpse and the rest  after millennia of underground cooking and rendering  was fat history .  according to legend  gold and iron and all the other metals were also part of the carcass .  after all  an elephant big enough to support the world on its back wasn   t going to have ordinary bones  was it .   the notes in front of him were a little more believable  talking about some unknown catastrophe that had killed millions of the mammoths  bison and giant shrews and then covered them over  pretty much like the fifth elephant in the story .  there were notes about old troll sagas and legends of the dwarfs .  possibly ice had been involved .  or a flood .  in the case of the trolls  who were believed to be the first species in the world  maybe they   d been there and seen the elephant trumpeting across the sky .   the result  anyway  was the same .  everyone   well  everyone except vimes   knew the best fat came from the shmaltzberg wells and mines .  it made the whitest  brightest candles  the creamiest soap  the hottest  cleanest lamp oil .  the yellow tallow from ankh morpork   s boilers didn   t come close .   vimes didn   t see the point .  gold   now that was important .  people died for it .  and iron   ankh morpork needed iron .  timber  too .  stone  even .  silver  now  was very     he flocked back to a page headed natural resources  and under silver read     no silver has been mined in uberwald since the diet of bugs in am      and the possession of the metal is technically illegal .      there was no explanation .  he made a note to ask inigo .  after all  where you got werewolves  didn   t you need silver .  and things must have been pretty bad if everyone had to eat insects .   anyway   silver was useful  too  but fat was just   fat .  it was like biscuits  or tea  or sugar .  it was just something that turned up in the cupboard .  there was no style to it  no romance .  it was stuff in tubs .   a note was clipped to the next page .  he read     the fifth elephant as a metaphor also appears in the uberwald languages .  depending on context it can mean    a thing which does not exist     as we would say    klatchian mist        a thing which is other than it seems    and    a thing which  while unseen  controls events     in the same way that we would use the term eminence gris  .      i wouldn   t  thought vimes .  i don   t use words like that .          constable shoe     said constable shoe  when the door of the bootmaker   s factory was opened     homicide .         you come    bout mister sonky .     said the troll who   d opened the door .  warm damp air blew out into the street  smelling of incontinent cats and sulfur .      i meant i   m a zombie     said reg shoe .     i find that telling people right away saves embarrassing misunderstandings later on .  but coincidentally  yes  we   ve come about the alleged deceased .         we .     said the troll  making no comment about reg   s gray skin and stitch marks .      doon here  bigjobs .      the troll looked down  not a usual direction in ankh morpork  where people preferred not to see what they were standing in .      oh     he said  and took a few steps backward .   some people said that gnomes were no more belligerent than any other race  and this was true .  however  the belligerence was compressed down into a body six inches high and  like many things when they are compressed  had an inclination to explode .  constable swires had been on the force only for a few months  but news had gone around and already he inspired respect  or at least the bladder trembling terror that can pass for respect on these occasions .      don   t ye just stand there gawpin     where   s yon stiff .     said swire  striding into the factory .      we put him in der cellar     said the troll .     and now we got half a ton of liquid rubber running to waste .  he   d be livid    bout that   if he was alive  o   course .         why   s it wasted .     said reg .      gone all thick and manky  hasn   t it .  i   m gonna have to dump it later on  and dat   s not easy .  we was supposed to be dipping a load of ribbed magical delights today  too  but all der ladies felt faint when i hauls him outa der vat and dey went off home .      reg shoe looked shocked .  he was not  for various reasons  a patron of mr .  sonky   s wares  romance not being a regular feature of the life of the dead  but surely the world of the living had some standards  didn   t it .      you employ ladies here .     he said .   the troll looked surprised .      yeah .  sure .  it   s good steady work .  dey   re good workers  too .  always laughing and tellin    jokes while dey   re doin    the dippin    and packin        specially when we   re doin    der big boys .     the troll sniffed .     pers   nally  i don   t unnerstan der jokes .         dem big boys are bludy good value for a penny     said buggy swires .   reg shoe stared at his tiny partner .  there was just no way that he was going to ask the question .  but swires must have seen his expression .      after a bit of work wi    yon scissors  ye won   t find a better mackintosh in the whole city     said the gnome  and laughed nastily .   constable shoe sighed .  he knew that mr .  vimes had an unofficial policy of getting ethnic minorities into the watch   but he wasn   t sure this was wise in the case of gnomes  even though there was  admittedly  no ethnic group that was more minor .  they had a built in resistance to rules .  this didn   t just apply to the law  but to all the invisible rules that most people obeyed unthinkingly  like    do not attempt to eat this giraffe    or    do not head butt people in the ankle just because they won   t give you a chip .     it was best to think of constable swires simply as a small independent weapon .      you   d better show us the d   the person who is currently vitally challenged     he said .   they were led downstairs .  what was hanging from a beam in the cellar would have frightened the life out of anyone who wasn   t already a zombie .      sorry    bout dat     said the troll  pulling it down and tossing it into a corner  where it coiled into a rubbery heap .      what d   heel wazzit .     said constable swires .      we had to pull der rubber off   f him     said the dwarf .     sets quick  see .  once you get it out in der air .         hey  dat   s a    biggest sonky i ever saw     chuckled buggy .     a whole body sonky .  reckon that   s the way he wanted to go .      reg looked at the corpse .  he didn   t mind being sent out on murders  even messy ones .  the way he saw it  dying was really just a career change .  been there  done that  worn the shroud   and then you got over it and got on with your life .  of course  he knew that many people didn   t  for some reason  but he thought of them as not prepared to make the effort .   there was a ragged wound in the neck .      any next of kin .     he said .      he got a brother in uberwald .  we   ve sent word     the troll added .     on der clacks .  it cost twenty dollars .  dat   s murder .         can you think of any reason why someone would kill him .      the troll scratched his head .      well     cos dey wanted him dead  i reckon .  dat   s a good reason .         and why would anyone want him dead  do you think .     reg shoe could be very  very patient .     has there been any trouble .         business ain   t been so good  i know dat .         really .  i   d have thought you   d be coining money here .         oh yeah  dat   s what you   d fink  but not everyfing people calls a sonky is made by us  see .  it   s to do wid us becomin          the troll   s face screwed up with cerebral effort     jer nair rick .  lots of other buggers are jumping up and down on the bandwagon  and dey got better plant and new ideas like makin       em in cheese and onion flavor an    wid bells on an    stuff like dat .  mister sonky won   t have nothin    to do wid dat kind of fing and dat   s been costin    us sales .         i can see this would worry him     said reg  in a keep on talking tone of voice .      he   s been locking himself in his office a lot .         oh .  why   s that .     said reg .      he   s der boss .  you don   t ask der boss .  but he did say dat dere was a special job comin    up and dat   d put us back on our feets .         really .     said reg  making a mental note .     what kind of job .         dunno .  you don   t              ask the boss     said reg .     right .  i suppose no one saw the murder  did they .      once again the troll screwed up its enormous face in thought .      der murderer  yeah  an    prob   ly mister sonky .         was there a third party .         i dunno  i never get invited to dem things .         apart from mister sonky and the murderer     said shoe  still as patient as the grave     was there anyone else here last night .         dunno     said the troll .      thank you  you   ve been very helpful     said shoe .     we   ll have a look around  if you don   t mind .         sure .      the troll went back to his vat .   reg shoe hadn   t expected to find anything and was not disappointed .  but he was thorough .  zombies usually are .  mr .  vimes had told him never to get too excited about clues  because clues could lead you on a dismal dance .  they could become a habit .  you ended up finding a wooden leg  a silk slipper and a feather at the scene of a crime and constructing an elegant theory involving a one legged ballet dancer and a production of chicken lake .   the door to the office was open .  it was hard to tell if things had been disturbed  shoe got the impression that the mess was normal .  a desk was awash with paperwork  mr .  sonky having followed the usual    put it down somewhere    method of filing .  a bench was covered with samples of rubber  bits of sacking  large bottles of chemicals and some wooden molds that reg refrained from looking at too closely .      did you hear corporal littlebottom talking about that museum theft when we came on duty today  buggy .     he said  opening a jar of yellow powder and sniffing it .      no .         i did     said reg .   he put the lid on the sulfur again and sniffed the air of the factory .  it smelled of liquid rubber  which is very much like the smell of incontinent cats .      and some things stick in the mind     he said .     special job  eh .         it was constable visit the infidel with explanatory pamphlets   s week as communications officer  which largely meant looking after the pigeons and keeping an eye on the clacks  with of course the assistance of constable downspout .  constable downspout was a gargoyle .  when it came to staring fixedly at one thing  you couldn   t beat a gargoyle .  the gargoyles were getting a lot of employment in the clacks industry .   constable visit quite enjoyed the pigeons .  he sang them hymns .   they listened to short homilies  cocking their heads from side to side .  after all  he reasoned  had not bishop horn preached to the mollusks of the sea .  and there was no record of them actually listening  whereas he was certain that the pigeons were taking it in .  and they seemed to be interested in his pamphlets on the virtues of omnianism  admittedly as nesting material at the moment  but this was certainly a good start .   a pigeon fluttered in as he was scraping the perches .      ah  zebedinah     he said  lifting her up and removing the message capsule from her leg .     well done .  this is from constable shoe .  and you shall have some corn  provided locally by josiah frument and sons  seed merchants  but ultimately by the grace of om .      there was a whir of wings and another pigeon settled on the perch .  constable visit recognized it as wilhelmina  one of sergeant angua   s pigeons .   he removed the message capsule .  the thin paper inside was tightly folded and on it someone had written cpt .  carrot  personal .   he hesitated  then put the message from reg shoe into the pneumatic tube and heard the whoosh of the suction as it headed off to the main office .  the other one  he decided  required a more careful delivery .   carrot was working in vimes   s office but  visit noticed  not at the commander   s desk .  instead  he   d set up a folding table in the corner .  the tottering piles of paperwork on the desk were slightly less alpine than yesterday .  there were even occasional patches of desktop .      personal message for you  captain .         thank you .         and constable shoe wants a sergeant down at sonky   s boot factory .         did you send the message down to the office .         yes  sir .  the pneumatic tube is very useful     visit added dutifully .      commander vimes isn   t very keen on it  but i   m sure it will eventually save us time     said carrot .  he unfolded the note .   visit watched him .  carrot   s lips moved slightly as he read .      where did the pigeon come from .     he said at last  screwing up the note .      it looks pretty worn out  sir .  not from inside the city  i   m sure .         ah .  right .  thank you .         bad news  sir .     visit angled .      just news  constable .  don   t let me detain you .         right  sir .      when the disappointed visit had gone  carrot went and looked out of the window .   there was a typical ankh morpork street scene outside  although people were trying to separate them .   after a few minutes he went back to his table  wrote a short note  put in into one of the little carriers and sent it away with a hiss of air .   a few minutes later  sergeant colon came panting along the corridor .  carrot was very keen on modernizing the watch  and in some strange way sending a message via the tube was so much more modern than simply opening the door and shouting  which is what mr .  vimes did .   carrot gave fred colon a bright smile .      ah  fred .  everything going well .         yessir .     said fred colon  uncertainly .      good .  i am off to see the patrician  fred .  as senior sergeant you are in charge of the watch until mister vimes gets back .         yessir .  er   until you get back  you mean           i shall not be coming back  fred .  i am resigning .         the patrician looked at the badge on the desk .         and well trained men     carrot was saying  somewhere in front of him .     after all  a few years ago there were only four of us in the watch .  now it   s functioning just like a machine .         yes  although bits of it do go boing occasionally     said lord vetinari  still staring at the badge .     could i invite you to reconsider  captain .         i   ve reconsidered several times  sir .  and it   s not captain  sir .         the watch needs you  mister ironfoundersson .         the watch is bigger than one man  sir     said carrot  still looking straight ahead .      i   m not sure if it   s bigger than sergeant colon  though .         people get mistaken about old fred  sir .  he   s a man with a solid bottom to his character .         he   s got a solid bottom to his bottom  ca   mister ironfoundersson .         i mean he doesn   t flap in an emergency  sir .         he doesn   t do anything in an emergency     said the patrician .     except possibly hide .  i might go so far as to say that the man appears to consist of an emergency in his own right .         my mind is made up  sir .      lord vetinari sighed  sat back  and stared up the ceiling for a moment .      then all i can do is thank you for your services  captain  and wish you good luck in your future endeavor .  do you have enough money .         i   ve saved quite a lot  sir .         nevertheless  it is a long way to uberwald .      there was silence .      sir .         yes .         how did you know .         oh  people measured it years ago .  surveyors and so forth .         sir .      vetinari sighed .     i think the term is   deduction .  be that as it may   captain  i am choosing to believe that you are merely taking an extended leave of absence .  i understand that you   ve never taken a holiday while you have been here .  i am sure you are owed a few weeks .      carrot said nothing .      and if i were you  i   d begin my search for sergeant angua at the shambling gate     vetinari added .   after a while  carrot said quietly     is that as a result of information received  my lord .      vetinari smiled a thin little smile .     no .  but uberwald is going through some troubling times  and of course she is from one of the aristocratic families .  i surmise that she has been called away .  beyond that  i cannot be of much help .  you will have to follow  as they say  your nose .         no  i think i can find a much more reliable nose than mine     said carrot .      good .     lord vetinari went back to his desk and sat down .     i wish you well in your   search .  nevertheless  i   m sure we will be seeing you again .  a lot of people here   depend on you .         yes  sir .         good day to you .      when carrot had gone lord vetinari got up and walked across to the other side of the room  where a map of uberwald was unrolled on a table .  it was quite old  but in recent years any mapmakers who had wandered off the beaten track in that country had spent all their time trying to find it again .  there were a few rivers  their courses mostly guesswork  and the occasional town or at least the name of a town  probably put in to save the cartographer the embarrassment of filling his chart with  as they said in the trade  mmbu .    the door opened and vetinari   s head clerk  drumknott  eased his way in with the silence of a feather falling in a cathedral .      a somewhat unexpected development  my lord     he said quietly .      an uncharacteristic one  certainly     said vetinari .      do you wish me to send a clacks to vimes  sir .  he could be back in a day or so .      vetinari was looking intently at the blind  blank map .  it was  he felt  very much like the future  a few things were outlined  there were some rough guesses  but everything else was waiting to be created        hmm .     he said .      do you wish me to recall vimes  sir .         good heavens  no .  vimes in uberwald will be more amusing than an amorous armadillo in a bowling alley .  and who else could i send .  only vimes could go to uberwald .         but surely this is an emergency  sir .         hmm .         what else are we to call it  sir  when a young man of such promise throws away his career for the pursuit of a girl .      the patrician stroked his beard and smiled at something .   there was a line across the map  the progress of the semaphore towers .  it was mathematically straight  a statement of intellect in the crowding darkness of miles and miles of bloody uberwald .      possibly   a bonus     he said .     uberwald has much to teach us .  fetch me the papers on the werewolf clans  will you .  oh   and although i swore i would never ever do this   please prepare a message for sergeant colon  too .  promotion  alas  beckons .         a grubby cloth cap lay on the pavement .   on the pavement beside the cap  someone had written in damp chalk       plese help this little doggie  beside it sat a small dog .   it was not cut out by nature to be a friendly little waggy tailed dog  but was making the effort .  whenever someone walked by it sat up on its hind legs and whined pitifully .   something landed in the cap .  it was a washer .   the charitable pedestrian had gone only a few steps farther along the road when he heard     and i hope your legs falls off  mister .      he turned .  the dog was watching him intently .      woof .     it said .   he looked puzzled  shrugged  and then turned and walked on .      yeah   bloody woof woof     said the strange voice  as he was about to turn the corner .   a hand reached down and picked up the dog by the scruff of its neck .      hello  gaspode .  i believe i   ve solved a little mystery .         oh no       the dog moaned .      that   s not being a good dog  gaspode     said carrot  lifting the dog so they could meet eye to eye .      all right  all right  put me down  will you .  this hurts  you know .         i need your help  gaspode .         not me .  i don   t help the watch .  nothing personal  but it doesn   t do anything for my street cred .         i   m not talking about helping the watch  gaspode .  this is personal .  i need your nose .     carrot lowered the dog to the pavement  and rubbed his hand on his shirt .     unfortunately  this means i need the rest of you as well  although of course i am aware that under that itchy exterior beats a heart of gold .         really     said gaspode .     nothing good starts with    i need your help .            it   s angua .         oh dear .         i want you to track her .         huh  not many dogs could track a werewolf  mister .  they   re cunning .         always go to the best  i always say     said carrot .      finest nose known to man or beast     said gaspode  wrinkling it .     where   s she gone  then .         to uberwald  i think .      carrot moved fast .  gaspode   s flight was hindered by the hand gripping his tail .      that   s hundreds of miles away .  and dog miles is seven times longer .  not a chance .         oh .  all right  then .  silly of me to suggest it     said carrot  letting go .     you   re right .  it   s ridiculous .      gaspode turned  suddenly full of suspicion .      no  i didn   t say it was ridiculous     he said .     i just said it was hundreds of miles away           yes  but you said you had no chance .         no  i said that you had no chance of getting me to do it .         yes  but winter   s coming on and  as you say  a werewolf is very hard to track and on top of that angua   s a copper .  she   ll work out that i   d use you  so she   ll be covering her trail .      gaspode whined .     look  mister  respect is hard to earn in this dog   s town .  if i   m not smelled around the lampposts for a couple of weeks my stock is definitely in the gutter  right .         yes  yes  i understand .  i   ll make some other arrangements .  nervous nigel   s still around  isn   t he .         what .  that spaniel .  he couldn   t smell his own bottom if you put it in front of him .         they say he   s pretty good  nasally .         and he widdles every time anyone looks at him .     snapped gaspode .      i heard he can smell a dead rat two miles away .         yeah .  well  i can smell what color it is .      carrot sighed .     well  i   ve got no choice  i   m afraid .  you can   t do it  so i   ll           i didn   t say       gaspode stopped  and then went on .     i   m going to do it  aren   t i .  i   m bloody well going to do it .  you   re going to trick me or blackmail me or whatever it takes  aren   t you           yes .  how do you manage to write  gaspode .         i holds the chalk in me mouth .  easy .         you   re a smart dog .  i   ve always said so .  the world   s only talking dog  too .         lower your voice  lower your voice .     said gaspode  looking around .     here  uberwald   s wolf country  isn   t it .         oh yes .         i could   ve bin a wolf  you know .  with diff   rent parents  of course .      gaspode sniffed  and looked furtively up and down the street again .      steak .         every night .         right .         sergeant colon was a picture of misery  drawn on a lumpy pavement in bad crayon on a wet day .  he sat on a chair and occasionally glanced at the message which had just been delivered  as if hoping that the words would somehow fade away .      bloody hell  nobby     he moaned .      there  there  fred       said nobby  currently a vision in organdy .      i can   t be promoted .  i   m not an officer .  i am base  common and popular .         i   ve always said that about you  fred .  you got common off to a treat .         but it   s writ down  nobby .  look  his lordship   s signed it .         we ell  the way i see it  you   ve got three choices     said nobby .      yeah .         you can go and tell him you   re not doing it        the panic in colon   s face was replaced by glazed gray terror .      thank you very much  nobby     he said bitterly .     let me know if you   ve got any more suggestions like that     cos i   ll need to go and change my underwear .         or you could accept it and make such a screw up of it that he takes it away from you           you   re doing this on purpose  nobby .         might be worth a try  fred .         yeah  but the thing about screw ups  nobby  is that it   s hard for you to be  you know  precise .  you might think you   re making a little screw up and then it blows up in your face and it turns out to be in fact a big screw up  and in those circumstances  nobby  i   m sort of worried that what his lordship might take away from me wouldn   t just be the job .  i hope i don   t have to draw you a picture .         good point  fred .         what i   m saying is  screw ups is like   well  screw ups is   well  the thing about screw ups is you never know what size they   re going to be .         well  fred  the third choice is you putting up with it .         that   s not helpful  nobby .         it   ll only be for a couple of weeks  then mister vimes   ll be back .         yeah  but supposing he isn   t .  nasty place  uberwald .  i heard where it   s a misery wrapped in an enema .  that doesn   t sound too good .  you can fall down things .  then i   m stuck  right .  i don   t know how to do officering .         no one knows how to do officering  fred .  that   s why they   re officers .  if they knew anything  they   d be sergeants .      now colon   s face screwed up again in desperate thought .  as a lifelong uniformed man  a three striped peg that had found a three striped hole very early in its career  he subscribed automatically and unthinkingly to the belief that officers as a class could not put their own trousers on without a map .  he conscientiously excluded vimes and carrot from the list  automatically elevating them to the rank of honorary sergeant .   nobby was watching him with an expression of combined concern  friendliness and predatory intent .      what shall i do  nobby .         well     captain        said nobby  and then he gave a little cough     what officers mainly have to do  as you know  is sign things        the door was knocked on and opened at the same time  by a flustered constable .      sarge  constable shoe says he really does need an officer down at sonky   s factory .         what  the rubber wally man .     said colon .     right .  an officer .  right .  we   ll be along .         and that   s captain colon     said nobby quickly .      er   er   yes  and that   s captain colon  thank you very much     said colon  adding as his resolve stiffened     and i   ll thank you not to forget it .      the constable stared at them  and then stopped trying to understand .      and there   s a troll downstairs who insists on speaking to whoever   s in charge           can   t stronginthearm deal with it .         er   is sergeant stronginthearm still a sergeant .     said the constable .      yes .         even unconscious .         what .         he   s flat on the floor right now  sa   captain .         what   s the troll want .         right now he wants to kill someone  but mainly i think he wants someone to take the clamp off   f his foot .         gaspode ran up and down  nose barely an inch from the ground .  carrot waited  holding his horse .  it was a good one .  carrot hadn   t spent a lot of his wages  up until now .   finally the dog sat down and looked depressed .      so tell me about this wonderful nose the patrician has got  then     he said .      not a trace .         you better get vetinari down here  if he   s so good     said gaspode .     what   s the point of starting here .  worst place in the whole city .  it   s the gate to the cattle market  am i right .  trying not to smell stuff is the trick here  is the point i   m makin    .  there   s ground in stink .  if you wanted to get on the trail of somebody  this is the last place i   d start .         very good point     said carrot  carefully .     so   what   s the strongest smell heading hubward .         dung carts  o   course .  yesterday .  always a big clear out of the pens first thing friday morning .         you can follow the smell .      gaspode rolled his eyes .     with my head in a bucket .         good .  let   s go .         so     said gaspode  as they began to leave the gate   s bustle behind     we   re chasing this girl  right .         yes .         just you .         yes .         not like with dogs  then  where there might be twenty or thirty .         no .         so we   re not looking at a bucket of cold water here .         no .         constable shoe saluted  but a little testily .  he   d been waiting rather a long time .      afternoon  sergeant           that   s captain     said captain colon .     see the pip on my shoulder  reg .      reg looked closely .     i thought it was bird doings  sarge .         that   s captain     said colon automatically .     it   s only chalk now because i ain   t got time to get it done properly     he said     so don   t be cheeky .         what   s up with nobby .     said reg .  corporal nobbs was holding a damp cloth over one eye .      bit of a contry tomps with an illegally parked troll     said captain colon .      shows what kind of troll he was  striking a lady     muttered nobby .      but you ain   t a lady  nobby .  you   re just wearing your traffic calming disguise .         he wasn   t to know .         you   d got your helmet on .  anyway  you shouldn   t have clamped him .         he was parked  fred .         he   d been knocked down by a cart     said captain colon .     and that   s captain .         well  they always have excuses     said nobby sullenly .      you   d better show us the corpus  reg     said colon .   the body in the cellar was duly inspected .         and i remember cheery saying there was a smell of cat   s pee and sulfur at the dwarf bread museum     said reg .      certainly hangs about     said colon .     you wouldn   t have blocked sinuses if you worked here for a day .         and i thought     i wonder if someone   d tried to make a mold of the replica stone     sir     said reg .      now that is clever     said fred colon .     you   d get the real one back then  wouldn   t you .         er   no  sarge   captain .  but you   d get a copy of the replica .         would that be legal .         can   t say  sir .  i wouldn   t think so .  it wouldn   t fool a dwarf for five minutes .         then who   d want to kill him .         a father of thirteen kids  maybe .     said nobby .     haha .         nobby  will you stop pinching the merchandise .     said colon .     and don   t argue  i just saw you put a couple of dozen in your handbag .         dat don   t matter     rumbled the troll .     mister sonky always said dey was free to the watch .         that was very   civic of him     said captain colon .      yeah  he said der last fing we wanted was more bloody coppers around the city .      a pigeon chose that diplomatic moment to flutter into the factory and land on colon   s shoulder  where it promoted him .  he reached up  removed the message capsule and unfolded the contents .      it   s from visit     he said .     there   s a clue  he says .         what to .     said nobby .      not to anything  nobby .  just a clue .     he took off his helmet and wiped his brow .  this was what he   d hoped to avoid .  in his heart of battered hearts  he suspected that vimes and carrot were good at putting clues next to other clues and thinking about them .  that was their talent .  he had other   well  he was good with people  and he had a shiny breastplate  and he could sergeant in his sleep .      all right  write up your report     he said .     well done .  we   re going back to the yard .         i can see this is going to get on top of me     said colon  as they walked away .     there   s paperwork  too .  you know me and paperwork  nobby .         you   re a very thorough reader  that   s all  fred     said nobby .     i   ve seen you take ages over just one page .  digesting it magisterially  i thought .      colon brightened a little .     yes  that   s what i do     he said .      even if it   s only the menu down at the klatchian takeout  i   ve seen you staring at one line for a minute at a time .         well  obviously you can   t let people put one over on you     said colon  sticking out his chest  or at least sticking it further up .      what you need is an aide de camp     said nobby  lifting his dress to step over a puddle .      i do .         oh yes .     cos of you being a figurehead and setting an example to your men     said nobby .      ah .  right .  yes     said colon  grasping the idea with relief .     a man can   t be expected to do all that and read long words  am i right .         exactly .  and  of course  we   re down one sergeant at the yard now     said nobby .      good point  nobby .  it   s going to be busy .      they walked on for a while .      you could promote someone     nobby prompted .      could i .         what good   s being the boss if you can   t .         that   s true .  and it   s sort of an emergency   hmm   any thoughts  nobby .      nobby sighed inwardly .  a penny could drop through wet cement faster than it could drop for fred colon .      a name springs to mind     he said .      ah  right .  yes .  reg shoe  right .  good at writing  a keen thinker  and of course he   s coolheaded     said colon .     icy  practically .         but a bit on the dead side     said nobby .      yes  i suppose that counts against him .         and he goes to pieces unpredictably     said nobby .      that   s true     said captain colon .     no one likes shaking hands and ending up with more fingers than they started with .         so p   raps it might be better to consider someone who has been unreasonably overlooked     said nobby  going for broke .     someone who   s face dunt fit  p   raps .  someone who   s experience in the watch gen   rally and in traffic in particular could be great service to the city if people wouldn   t go on about one or two lapses which didn   t happen in any case .      the dawn of intelligence rose across the vistas of colon   s face .      ah     he said .     i see .  well  why didn   t you come right out with that at the start  nobby .         well  it   s your decision  fred   i mean  captain     said nobby earnestly .      but    sposing mister vimes doesn   t agree .  he   ll be back in a couple of weeks .         that   ll be long enough     said nobby .      and you don   t mind .         me .  mind .  not me .  you know me  fred  always ready to do my bit .         nobby .         yes  fred .         the dress           yes  fred .         i thought we weren   t doing the   traffic calming any more .         yes  fred .  but i thought i   m keep it on ready to swing into action just in case you decided that we should .         a chilly wind blew across the cabbage fields .   to gaspode it brought  beside the overpowering fumes of the cabbage and the dark red smell of the dung carts  hints of pine  mountains  snow  sweat and stale cigar smoke .  the last came from the cart men   s habit of smoking large  cheap cigars .  they kept the flies off .   it was better than vision .  the world of smell stretched before gaspode .      my paws hurt     he said .      there   s a good dog     said carrot .   the road forked .  gaspode stopped  and snuffled around .      well  here   s an int   resting fing     he said .     some of the dung   s jumped down off   f the cart and headed away across the fields here .  you were right .         can you smell water anywhere around .     said carrot  scanning the flat plain .   gaspode   s mottled nose wrinkled up in effort .      pond     he said .     not very big .     bout a mile away .         she   ll be heading toward it .  very meticulous about cleanliness  angua .  that   s not usual in werewolves .         never been one for water myself     said gaspode .      is that a fact .         here  no need for that .  i had a b   a   t   h once  you know  it   s not as if i don   t know what it   s like .      the pond was in a clump of windblown trees .  dry grass rustled in the breeze .  a single coot scuttled into the reeds as carrot and gaspode approached .      yeah  here we are     said gaspode .     a lot of muck goes in  and       he sniffed at the stirred up mud .     er   yeah  she comes out .  um .         is there a problem .     said carrot .      what .  oh  no .  clear scent .  headin    for the mountains  just like you said .  um .     gaspode sat down and scratched himself with a hind leg .      there is a problem  isn   t there       said carrot .      well   supposin    there was something really bad that you wouldn   t really want to know  and i knew what it was   how   d you feel about me tellin    you .  i mean  some people   d rather not know .  it   s a pers   nal thing .         gaspode .         she   s not alone .  there   s another wolf .         ah .      carrot   s mild  uninformative smile did not change .      er   of the male persuasion     said gaspode .     a boy wolf .  er .  very much so .         thank you  gaspode .         extremely male .  um .  in a very def   nite way .  unmistakably .         yes  i think i understand .         and this is just words .  in smell  it   s a lot more  well  emphatic .         thank you for that  gaspode .  and they   re heading           still straight for the mountains  boss     said gaspode  as kindly as he could .  he wasn   t certain of the details of human sexual relationships  and the ones he was certain of he still couldn   t quite believe  but he knew that they were a lot more complicated than those enjoyed by the doggy fraternity .      this smell           the extremely male one i was talkin    about .         the very one  yes     said carrot levelly .     you could still smell it if you were on the horse  could you .         i could smell it with my nose in a sack of onions .         good .  because i think we should move a little faster now           yes  i thought you   d think that .         constable visit saluted when nobby and colon entered pseudopolis yard .      i thought you ought to know about this right away  sir     he said  flourishing a square of paper .     i just got it off ronald .         who .         the imp on the bridge  sir .  he paints pictures of carts going too fast .  no one had been feeding him     visit added  in a mildly accusing tone .      oh .  someone speeding     said colon .     so .     he looked again .     that   s one of those sedan chairs the deep down dwarfs use  isn   t it .  them trolls must   ve been moving .         it was just after the scone was stolen     said visit .     ronald writes the time in the corner  see .  a bit odd  i thought .  like a kind of getaway vehicle  sir .         what   d a dwarf want to steal a worthless lump of rock for .     said colon .     especially them dark dwarfs .  they give me the creeps in those stupid clothes they wear .      angry silence rang like a dropped girder in a temple .  there were three dwarfs in the room .      you two .  you ought to be out on patrol .     barked sergeant stronginthearm .     i   ve got business down at chitterling street .      all three dwarfs marched out  somehow contriving even to walk angrily .      well  what was that about .     said fred colon .     bit touchy  aren   t they .  mister vimes says that sort of thing all the time and no one minds .         yes  but that   s because he   s sam vimes     said nobby .      oh .  and are you inferring i   m not .     said captain colon .      well   yes  fred .  you   re fred colon     said nobby patiently .      oh  i am  am i .         yes  captain colon .         and they   d better bloody remember it .     colon snapped .     i   m not a soft touch  me .  i   m not going to take insubordination like that .  i   ve always said vimes was a bit too soft on those dwarfs .  they gets the same pay as us and they   re only half the size .         yes  yes     said nobby  waving his hands placatingly in a desperate attempt to calm things down     but  fred  trolls are twice as big as us and they get paid the same  so it           but they   ve only got a quarter of the brains  so it   s just the same like i said        the noise they heard was long and drawn out and menacing .  it was the sound of lance constable bluejohn   s chair being pushed back .   the floor creaked as he shambled past colon  removed his helmet from its peg with one enormous hand  and headed for the door .         m goin    on patrol     he mumbled .      you   re not on patrol for another hour     said constable visit .         m goin    now     said bluejohn .  the room was darkened for a moment as he eclipsed the doorway  and then he was gone .      why   s everyone so tetchy all of a sudden .     said colon .  the remaining constables tried not to catch his eye .      did i hear someone snigger .     he demanded .      i didn   t hear anyone snigger  sarge     said nobby .      oh .  oh .  you think i   m a sergeant  do you  corporal nobbs .         no  fred  i   oh gawds           i can see things have got pretty slack around here     said captain colon  an evil little gleam in his eye .     i bet you were all thinking  oh  it   s only fat old fred colon  it   s all going to be gravy from now on  eh .         oh  fred  no one thinks you   re old   oh gawds           just fat  eh .     fred glowered around the room .  suddenly  and against all previous evidence  everyone was vitally interested in their paperwork .      right .  well  from now on things are going to be different     said captain colon .     oh yes .  i   m up to all your little tricks   who said that .         said what  captain .     said nobby  who   d also heard the little whispered    we learned    em all from you  sarge    but at this moment would eat live coals rather than admit it .      someone said something blotto voice     said captain colon .      i   m sure they didn   t  captain     said nobby .      and i won   t be eyeballed like that  neither .         no one   s looking at you .     wailed nobby .      aha  you think i don   t know that one .     colon shouted .     there   s plenty of ways to eyeball someone without lookin    at    em  corporal .  that man over there is earlobing me .         i think constable ping is just really interested in the report he   s writing  fre   sar   captain .      colon   s ruffled feathers settled a little .     well   all right .  and now i   m going up to my office  all right .  there   ll be some changes around here .  and someone bring me a cup of tea .      they watched him go up the stairs  enter the office and slam the door .      well  the       constable ping began  but nobby  who had a lot more experience with the colon personality  waved one hand frantically for silence while he held the other one to his ear  very theatrically .   then they all heard the door click open again  quietly .      a change is as good as a rest  i suppose     said constable ping .      as the prophet ossory says  better an oxen in the potters    fields of hersheba than a sandal in the wine presses of gash     said constable visit .      yeah  so i   ve heard     said nobby .     well  i   ll just make him his tea .  everyone feels better after a cup of tea .      a couple of minutes later the constables heard colon shouting  even through the door .      what is wrong with this mug  corporal .         nothing  sa   sir .  it   s yer mug .  you always have your tea in it .         ah  but  you see  it is a sergeant   s mug  corporal .  and what is it that officers drink out of .         well  carrot and mister vimes have got their own mugs           no  they may choose to drink out of mugs  corporal  but watch regulations say officers have a cup and saucer .  says so right here  regulation three oh one  subsection c .  do you understand me .         i don   t think we   ve got any           you know where the petty cash is .  usually  you   re the only person that does .  you   re dismissed  corporal .      nobby came down the stairs white faced  holding the offending receptacle .   the door opened again .      and none of you are to gob in it  neither .     shouted colon .     i know that one .  and it   s to be stirred with a spoon  understand .  i know that one  too .     the door slammed .   constable visit took the mug from nobby   s shaking hand and patted him on the shoulder .      chalky the troll does some very good seconds  i understand       he began .   the door opened .      bloody china  too .      the door slammed .      anyone seen the petty cash lately .     said constable ping .   nobby reached mournfully into his pocket and pulled out some dollars .  he handed them to visit .      better go to that posh shop in kings way     he said .     get one of those cups and saucers thin enough to see through .  you know  with gold around the rim .     he looked around the other constables .     what   re you lot doing here .  you won   t catch many criminals in here .         does the petty cash count  nobby .     said ping .      don   t you nobby me  ping .  you just get out there .  and the rest of you .         days rolled by .  more accurately  they rattled by .  it was a comfortable coach  as coaches went  and as coaches on this road went over continual potholes  it swayed and rocked like a cradle .  initially  the motion was soothing .  after a day or two  it palled .  so did the scenery .   vimes stared glumly out of the window .   there was another clacking tower on the horizon .  they were putting them near the road  he recalled  even though that wasn   t the direct route .  only a fool would build them across the badlands .  you had to remember  sometimes  that within a few hundred miles of ankh morpork there were still trolls who hadn   t caught on to the fact that humans weren   t digestible .  besides  most of the settlements were near the road .   the new guild must be coining money .  even from here he could see the scaffolding  as workers feverishly attached still more gantries and paddles to the main tower .  the whole thing would likely be matchsticks after the next hurricane  but by then the owners would probably have earned enough to build another five .  or fifty .   it had all happened so fast .  who   d have believed it .  but all the components had been there for years .  semaphore was ancient   a century ago the watch had used a few towers to relay messages to patrolling officers .  and gargoyles had nothing to do all day but sit and watch things  and usually were too unimaginative to make mistakes .   what had happened was that people thought differently about news now .  once upon a time they   d have used something like this to relay information about troop movements and the death of kings .  true  that was something that people need to know  but they didn   t need to know it every day .  no  what they needed to know every day were things like how much are cattle selling for in ankh morpork today .  because  if they weren   t fetching much  maybe it was better to drive them to quirm instead .  people needed to know these little things .  lots and lots of little things .  little things like did my ship get there safely .  that   s why the guild was driving hell bent across the mountains on to genua  four thousand miles away .  it took many months for a ship to round cape terror .  how much  exactly  would a trader pay to know  within a day  when it had arrived .  and how much the cargo was worth .  has it been sold .  is there credit to my name in ankh morpork .   coining money .  oh yes .   and it had caught on as fast as every other craze did in the big city .  it seemed as though everybody who could put together a pole  a couple of gargoyles and some secondhand windmill machinery was in on the business .  you couldn   t go out to dinner these days without seeing people nip out of the restaurant every five minutes to check that there weren   t any messages for them on the nearest pole .  as for those who cut out the middleman and signaled directly to their friends across a crowded room  causing mild contusions to those nearby     vimes shook his head .  that was messages without meaning  telepathy without brains .   but   it had been good  hadn   t it  last week .  when don   t know jack had pinched that silver in sto lat and then galloped at speed to the sanctuary of the shades in ankh morpork .  and sergeant edge of the sto lat watch  who   d trained under vimes  had put a message on the clacks that arrived on vimes   s desk more than an hour before jack sauntered through the city gates and into the waiting embrace of sergeant detritus .  legally it had been a bit tricky  since the offense hadn   t been committed on ankh morpork soil and a semaphore message did not  strictly speaking  come under the heading of    hot pursuit     but jack had kindly solved that one by taking a wild swing at the troll  resulting in his arrest for assault on a watch officer and treatment for a broken wrist     there was a gentle snore from lady sybil .  a marriage is always made up of two people who are prepared to swear that only the other one snores .   inigo skimmer was hunched in a corner  reading a book .  vimes watched him for some time .      i   m just going up top for some air     he said at last  opening the door .  the clattering of the wheels filled the tiny  hot space  and dust blew in .      your grace       inigo began  standing up .  vimes  already clambering up the side of the coach  stuck his head back in .      you   re not making any friends with that attitude     he said  and kicked the door shut with his foot .   cheery and detritus had made themselves comfortable on the roof .  it was a lot less stuffy and at least there was a view  if vegetables were your idea of a panorama .   vimes worked himself into a niche between two bundles and leaned toward cheery .      you know about the clacks  right .     he said .      well  sort of  sir           good .     vimes passed her a piece of paper .     there   s bound to be a tower near where we stop tonight .  cipher this and send it to the watch  will you .  they ought to be able to turn it around in an hour  if they ask the right people .  tell them to try washable topsy  she does the laundry there .  or gilbert gilbert  he always seems to know what   s going on .      cheery read the message  and then stared at vimes .      are you sure  sir .     she said .      maybe .  make sure you send the description .  names don   t mean much .         may i ask what makes you think           his walk .  and he didn   t catch an orange     said vimes .     mhm .  mhm .         constable visit was cleaning out the old pigeon loft when the message arrived on the clacks .   he had been spending more and more time with the pigeons these days .  it wasn   t a popular job  so no one had tried to take it away from him  and at least up here the shouts and door slammings were muffled .   the perches gleamed .   constable visit enjoyed his job .  he didn   t have many friends in the city .  truth to tell  he didn   t have many friends in the watch  either .  but at least there were people to talk to  and he was making headway with the religious instruction of the pigeons .   but now there was this     it was addressed to captain carrot .  that meant it probably ought to be delivered to captain colon now  and personally  because captain colon thought that people were spying on his messages sent via the suction tube .   constable visit had been fairly safe up until now .  omnians were good at not questioning orders  even ones that made no sense .  visit instinctively respected authority  no matter how crazy  because he   d been brought up properly .  and he had plenty of time to keep his armor bright .  brightly polished armor had suddenly become very important in the watch  for some reason .   even so  going into colon   s office needed all the courage that the legendary bishop horn had shown when entering the city of the oolites  and everyone knew what they did to strangers .   visit climbed down from the loft and made his nervous way to the main building  taking care to walk smartly .   the main office was more or less empty .  there seemed to be fewer watchmen around these days .  usually people preferred to loaf indoors in this chilly weather  but suddenly everyone was keen to be out of captain colon   s view .   visit went up to the office and knocked on the door .   he knocked again .   when there was no reply he pushed open the door  walked carefully over to the sparkling clean desk and went to tuck the flimsy message under the ink bottle in case it blew away        aha .      the ink soared up as visit   s hand jerked .  he had a vision of the blue black shower passing his ear  and heard the splat as it hit something behind him .   he turned like an automaton  to see a captain colon who would have been white faced if it weren   t for the ink .      i see     said colon .     assault on a superior officer  eh .         it was an accident  captain .         oh  was it .  and why  pray  were you sneaking into my office .         i didn   t think you were in here  captain .     visit gabbled .      aha .         sorry .         sneaking a look at my private papers  eh .         no  captain .     visit rallied a little bit .     why were you standing behind the door  captain .         oh .  i   m not allowed to stand behind my own door  is that it .      it was then that constable visit made his next mistake .  he tried to smile .      well  it is a bit odd  sir           are you suggesting there is anything odd about me  constable .     said captain colon .     is there anything about me that you find funny .      visit stared at the mottled face  speckled with ink .      not a thing  sir .         you   ve been working acceptably  constable     said colon  standing slightly too close to visit     and therefore i don   t intend to be harsh with you .  no one could call me an unfair man .  you is demoted to lance constable  understand .  your pay will be adjusted and backdated to the beginning of the month .      visit saluted .  it was probably the only way to get out of there alive .  one of colon   s eyes was twitching .      however  you could redeem yourself     said colon     if you was to tell me who has been stealing  i said stealing  the sugar lumps .         sir .         i knows there was forty three last night .  i counted    em very thoroughly .  there   s forty one this morning  constable .  and they   re locked in the cupboard .  can you explain that .      if visit had been suicidal and honest  he had said  well  captain  while of course i think you have many worthy qualities  i have known you to count your fingers twice and come up with different answers .      er   mice .     he said  weakly .      hah .  off you go  lance constable  and just you think about what i said .      when the dejected visit had gone  captain colon sat down at his big  clean desk .   the little flickering part of his brain that was still sparking coherent thought through the fog of mind numbing terror that filled colon   s head was telling him that he was so far out of his depth that the fish had lights on their noses .   yes  he did have a clean desk .  but that was because he was throwing all the paperwork away .   it wasn   t that he was illiterate  but fred colon did need a bit of a think and a run up to tackle anything much longer than a list and he tended to get lost in any word that had more than three syllables .  he was  in fact  functionally literate .  that is  he thought of reading and writing like he thought about boots   you needed them  but they weren   t supposed to be fun  and you got suspicious about people who got a kick out of them .   of course  mr .  vimes had kept his desk piled high with paperwork  but it occurred to colon that maybe vimes and carrot between them had developed a way of keeping just ahead of the piles  by knowing what was important and what wasn   t .  to colon  it was all gut wrenchingly mysterious .  there were complaints  and memos  and invitations  and letters requesting    a few minutes of your time    and forms to fill in  and reports to read  and sentences containing words like    iniquitous    and    immediate action    and they tottered in his mind like a great big wave  poised to fall on him .   the sane core of colon was wondering if the purpose of officers wasn   t to stand between the sergeants and all this sh   this slush  so that they could get on with sergeanting .   captain colon took a deep  wobbly breath .   on the other hand  if people were nicking the sugar lumps  no wonder things weren   t working properly .  get the sugar lumps right  and everything else would work out .   that made sense .   he turned  and his eye caught the huge accusing heap of paperwork in the corner .   and the empty fireplace  too .   that was what officering was all about  wasn   t it .  making decisions .      lance constable visit walked dejectedly back down to the main office  which had filled up for a watch change .   everyone was clustered around one of the desks on which lay  looking slightly muddy  the scone of stone .      constable thighbiter found it in zephire street  just lying there     said sergeant stronginthearm .     the thief must   ve gotten scared .         a long way from the museum  though     said reg shoe .     why lug it all the way across the city and leave it in a posh part of town where someone   s bound to trip over it .         oh woe is me  for i am undone     said lance constable visit  who felt he was playing a poor second fiddle to what he would call  if he had no use for his legs  a pagan image .      could be drafty     said corporal nobbs  a man of little sympathy .      i mean i have been reduced to lance constable     said visit .      what .  why .     said sergeant stronginthearm .      i   m   not sure     said visit .      that just about does it .     said the dwarf .     he sacked three of the officers up at dolly sisters yesterday .  well  i   m not waiting for it to happen to me .  i   m off to sto lat .  they   re always looking for trained watchmen .  i   m a sergeant .  i could name my price .         but  look  vimesy used to say that sort of thing  too  i heard him     said nobby .      yeah  but that was different .         how .         that was mister vimes     said stronginthearm .     remember that riot in easy street last year .  bloke came after me with a club when i was on the ground  and mister vimes caught it on his arm and punched the man right in the head .         yeah     said constable hacknee  another dwarf     when your back   s against the wall  mister vimes is right behind you .         but old fred   you all know old fred colon  boys     nobby wheedled  taking a kettle off the office stove and pouring the boiling water into a teapot .     he knows coppering inside and out .         his kind of coppering  yeah     said hacknee .      i mean  he   s been a copper longer than anyone in the watch     said nobby .   one of the dwarfs said something in dwarfish .  there were a few smiles from the shorter watchmen .      what was that .     said nobby .      well  roughly translated     said stronginthearm        my bum has been a bum for a very long time but i don   t have to listen to anything it says .            he fined me half a dollar for mumping     said hacknee .     fred colon .  he practically goes on patrol with a shopping bag .  and all i had was a free pint at the bunch of grapes and i found out that posh wally is suddenly flashing a lot of money lately .  that   s worth knowing .  i remember going out on patrol with fred colon when i started and you could practically see him tucking his napkin under his chin whenever we walked past a caf   .     oh no  sergeant colon  wouldn   t dream of seeing you pay .     they used to lay the table when they saw him turn the corner .         everyone does it     said stronginthearm .      captain carrot never did     said nobby .      captain carrot was   special .         but what am i supposed to do with this .     said visit  waving the ink speckled message .     mister vimes wants some information urgently  he says .      stronginthearm took the paper and read it .      well  this shouldn   t be hard     he said .     old wussie staid in kicklebury street was a janitor there for years and he owes me a favor .         if we   re going to send a clacks to mister vimes then we ought to tell him about the scone and sonky     said reg shoe .     you know he left a message about that .  i   ve done a report .         why .  he   s hundreds of miles away .         i   d just feel happier if he knew     said reg .        cos it worries me .         what good will it do sending it to him  then .         because then it   ll worry him  and i can stop worrying     said reg .      corporal nobbs .         he listens at the door  i   ll swear he does     said stronginthearm .     i   m off .         coming  captain .     shouted nobby .  he pulled open the bottom drawer of his battered and stained desk and took out a packet of chocolate biscuits  some of which he arranged daintily on a plate .      does me no good at all to see you acting like this     stronginthearm went on  winking at the other dwarfs .     you   ve got it in you to be a really bad copper  nobby .  breaks my heart to see you throwin    it all away to become a really bad waitress .         ha ha ha     said nobby .     just you wait  that   s all i   m saying .     he raised his voice .     coming right now  captain .      there was a sharp smell of burned paper in the captain   s room when nobby entered .      nothing cheers up the day like a good fire  i always say     he said  putting the tray on the desk .   but captain colon wasn   t paying any attention .  he   d removed the sugar bowl from the locked drawer of his desk and had laid the cubes out in rows .      do you see anything wrong with these lumps  corporal .     he said quietly .      well  they   re a bit manky where you   ve been handling them every           there   s thirty seven  corporal .         sorry about that  captain .         visit must   ve pinched them when he was in here .  he must   ve used some fancy foreign trick .  they can do that  you know .  climb ropes and disappear up the top of    em  that sort of thing .         did he have a rope .     said nobby .      are you making fun of me  corporal .      nobby saluted .     nossir .  maybe it was a invisible one  sir .  after all  if they can disappear up a rope  they can make the rope disappear  too .  obviously .         good thinking  corporal .         on the subject of thinking  sir     said nobby  plunging in     have you had time in your busy schedule to give some thought to the promotion of the new sergeant .         i have  as a matter of fact  put that very thing in hand  corporal .         good  sir .         i   ve borne in mind everything you said  and the choice was starin    me in the face .         yessir .     said nobby  sticking out his chest and saluting .      i just hope it don   t cause loss of morals .  it can do that  when people are promoted .  so if there   s any trouble like that  i want the sugar stealing person reported to me right away  understand .         yessir .     nobby   s feet had almost left the ground .      and i shall rely on you  corporal  to let me know if sergeant flint has any trouble .         sergeant flint     said nobby  in a little voice .      i know he   s a troll  but i won   t have it said i   m an unfair man .         sergeant flint .         i know i can rely on you  corporal .         sergeant flint .         that will be all .  i   ve got to go and see his lordship in an hour and i want some time to think for .  that   s what my job is  thinking .         sergeant flint .         yes .  i should go and report to him if i was you .         white chicken feathers were scattered across the field .  the farmer stood at the door of his henhouse  shaking his head .  he glanced up as a horseman approached .      good morrow  sir .  are you experiencing trouble .      the farmer opened his mouth for a witty or at least snappy response  but something stopped him .  perhaps it was the sword the horseman had slung across his back .  perhaps it was the man   s faint smile .  the smile was somehow more frightening .      er   somethin   s been at my fowls     he ventured .     fox  i reckon .         wolf  i suspect     said the rider .   the man opened his mouth to say    don   t be daft  we don   t get wolves down here this time of the year     but again the confident smile made him hesitate .      got many hens  did they .         six     said the farmer .      and they got in by           well  that   s the strange th   here  keep the dog away .      a small mongrel had leapt down from the saddle and was sniffing around the henhouses .      he won   t be any trouble     said the rider .      i shouldn   t push your luck  mate .  he   s in a funny mood     said a voice behind the farmer .  he turned around quickly .   the dog looked up at him innocently .  everyone knew that dogs didn   t talk .      woof .  bark .  whine .     it said .      he   s highly trained     said the rider .      yeah  right     said the voice behind the farmer .  he felt an overpowering desire to see the back of the horseman .  the smile was getting on his nerves  and now he was hearing things .      i can   t see how they got in     he said .     the door   s latched           and wolves don   t usually leave payment  right .     said the rider .      how the hell did you know that .         well   several reasons  sir  but i couldn   t help noticing that you clenched your fist tightly as soon as you heard me  and i surmise therefore that you found   let me see   three dollars left in the chicken house .  three dollars would buy six fine birds in ankh morpork .      the man opened his fist  wordlessly .  the coins glinted in the sunlight .      but   but i sells    em at the gate for ten pence .     he wailed .     they only had to arsk .         probably didn   t want to bother you     said the horsemen .     since i am here  sir  i would be grateful if you could sell me a chicken        behind the farmer the dog said    woof woof .            two chickens  and i will not trespass further upon your time .         woof woof woof .         three chickens     said the rider  wearily .     and if you have them dressed and cooked while i tend to my horse  i will gladly pay a dollar apiece .         woof  woof .         without garlic or any seasoning on two of the chickens  please     said the rider .   the farmer nodded wordlessly .  a dollar a chicken wasn   t chicken feed .  you didn   t turn up your nose at an offer like that .  but most importantly  you didn   t disobey a man with that faint little smile on his face .  it didn   t seem to move  or change .  as smiles went  you wanted this one to go as far away as possible .   he hurried off to the yard that held his best fowls  reached down to select the fattest   and paused .  a man who was fool enough to pay a dollar for a good chicken might be quite content with just a reasonable chicken  after all   he stood up .      only the best  mister .      he spun around .  no one was there except the little scruffy dog  which had followed him and was now raising a cloud of dust as it scratched itself .      woof .     it said .   he threw a stone at it  and it trotted off .  then he selected three of the very best chickens .   carrot was lying down under a tree  trying to make his head comfortable on a saddlebag .      did you see in the dust where she   d almost rubbed out her footprints .     said gaspode .      yes     said carrot  closing his eyes .      does she always pay for chickens .         yes .         why .      carrot turned over .      because animals don   t .      gaspode looked at the back of carrot   s head .  on the whole he enjoyed the unusual gift of speech  but something about the reddening of carrot   s ears told him that this was the time to employ the even rarer gift of silence .   he settled down in the position he almost unconsciously categorized as faithful companion keeping watch  got bored  scratched himself absentmindedly  curled up in the pose known as faithful companion curled up with his nose pressed on his bottom   and fell asleep .   he awoke shortly afterward  to the sound of voices .  there was also a faint smell of roast chicken coming from the direction of the farmhouse .   gaspode rolled over  and saw the farmer talking to another man on a cart .  he listened for a moment and then sat up  locked in a metaphysical conundrum .   finally he awoke carrot by licking his ear .      fzwl   what .         you got to promise to collect the roast chicken first  all right .     said gaspode urgently .      what .     carrot sat up .      get the chickens and then we gotta go  right .  you gotta promise .         all right  all right  i promise .  what   s happening .         you ever heard of a town call scant cullot .         i think it   s about ten miles from here           one of mister farmer   s neighbors has just told him that they   ve caught a wolf there .         killed it .         no  no  no   but the wolf hunters   there   s wolf hunters in these parts  see     cos of the sheep up on the hills and   they have to train their dogs first remember you promised about the chickens .         at precisely eleven o   clock there was a smart rap on lord vetinari   s door .   the patrician gave the woodwork a puzzled frown .  at last he said     come .      fred colon entered with difficulty .  vetinari watched him for a few moments until pity overcame even him .      acting captain  it is not necessary to remain at attention at all times     he said  kindly .     you are allowed to unbend enough for the satisfactory manipulation of a doorknob .      yes  sah .      lord vetinari raised a hand to his ear protectively .      you may be seated .         yes  sah .         you may be quieter  too .         yes  sah .      lord vetinari retreated to the protection of his desk .      may i commend you on the gleam of your armor  acting captain           spit and polish  sah .  no substitute for it  sah .     sweat was streaming down colon   s face .      oh  good .  clearly you have been purchasing extra supplies of spit .  now then  let me see        lord vetinari drew a sheet of paper from one of the small stack in front of him .      now then  acti           sah .         to be sure .  i have here another complaint of overenthusiastic clamping   i   m sure you know to what i refer .         it was causing serious traffic congestion  sah .         quite so .  it is well known for it .  but it is  in fact  the opera house .         sah .         the owner feels that big yellow clamps at each corner detract from what i might call the tone of the building .  and  of course  they do prevent him from driving it away .         sah .         indeed .  i think that this is a case where discretion might be advisable  acting captain .         got to make an example to the others  sah .         ah .  yes .     the patrician held another piece of paper delicately between thumb and forefinger  as though it were some rare and strange creature .     the others being   let me see if i can recall  some things do stick in the mind so   ah  yes   three other buildings  six fountains  three statues and the gibbet in nonesuch street .  oh  and my own palace .         i fully understand you   re parked on business  sah .      lord vetinari paused .  he found it difficult to talk to frederick colon .  he dealt on a daily basis with people who treated conversation as a complex game  and with colon he had to keep on adjusting his mind in case he overshot .      pursuing the business of your recent career with  i have to admit  some considerable and growing fascination  i am moved to ask you why the watch now appears to have a staff of twenty .         sah .         you had around sixty a little while ago  i   m sure .      colon mopped his face .      cutting out the dead wood  sah .  making the watch leaner an    fitter  sah .         i see .  the number of internal disciplinary charges you have laid against your men     and here the patrician picked up a much thicker document     seems somewhat excessive .  i see no fewer than one hundred and seventy three offenses of eyeballing  earlobing and nostrilling  for example .         sah .         nostrilling  acting captain .         sah .         oh .  and i see  ah yes  one charge of    making his arm fall off in an insubordinate way    laid against constable shoe .  commander vimes has always given me glowing reports about this officer .            e   s a nasty piece of work  sah .  you can   t trust the dead ones .         nor  it would seem  most of the live ones .         sah .     colon leaned forward  his face twisted in a ghastly grimace of conspiratoriality .     between you and me  sir  commander vimes was a good deal too soft on them .  he let them get away with too much .  no sugar is safe  sah .      vetinari   s eyes narrowed  but the telescopes on planet colon were far too unsophisticated to detect his mood .      i certainly recall him mentioning a couple of officers whose timekeeping  demeanor  and all around uselessness were a dreadful example to the rest of the men     said the patrician .      there   s my point     said colon triumphantly .     one bad apple ruins the whole barrel .         i think there   s only a basket now     said the patrician .     a punnet  possibly .         don   t you worry about a thing  your lordship .  i   ll turn things around .  i   ll soon get them smartened up .         i am sure you have it in you to surprise me even further     said vetinari  leaning back .     i shall definitely keep my eye on you as the man to watch .  and now  acting captain  do you have anything else to report .         all nice and quiet  sah .         i would that it was     said vetinari .     i was just wondering if there was anything going on involving any person in this city called       he looked down at another sheet of paper     sonky .      captain colon almost swallowed his tongue .      minor matter  sah .     he managed .      so   sonky is alive .         er   found dead  sah .         murdered .         sah .         dear me .  many people would not consider that a minor matter  acting captain .  sonky  for one .         well  sah  not everyone agrees with what he does  sah .         are we by any chance talking about wallace sonky .  the manufacturer of rubber goods .         sah .         boots and gloves seem noncontroversial to me  acting captain .         it   s   er   the other stuff  sah .     colon coughed nervously .     he makes them rubber wallies  sah .         ah .  the preventatives .         lot of people don   t agree with that sort of thing  sah .         so i understand .      colon drew himself up to attention again .      not natural  in my view  sah .  not in favor of unnatural things .      vetinari looked perplexed .      you mean   you eat your meat raw and sleep in a tree .         sah .         oh  nothing  nothing .  someone in uberwald seems to be taking an interest in him lately .  and now he   s dead .  i would not dream of telling the watch their job  of course .      he watched colon carefully to see if this had sunk in .      i said that it is entirely up to you to choose what to investigate in this bustling city     he prompted .   colon was lost in unfamiliar country without a map .      thank you  sah .     he barked .   vetinari sighed .     and now  acting captain  i   m sure there   s much that needs your attention .         sah .  i   ve got plans to           i meant  do not let me detain you .         oh  that   s all right  sir  i   ve got plenty of time           goodbye  acting captain colon .      out in the anteroom  fred colon stood very still for a while  until his heartbeat wound down from a whine to at least a purr .   it had  on the whole  gone quite well .  very well .  amazingly well  really .  his lordship had practically taken him into his confidence .  he   d called him    a man to watch .      fred wondered why he   d been so scared of officering all these years .  there was nothing to it  really  once you got the bull between your teeth .  if only he   d started years ago .  of course  he wouldn   t hear a word said about mr .  vimes  who should certainly be looking after himself in those dangerous foreign parts   but   well  fred colon had been a sergeant when sam vimes was a rookie  hadn   t he .  it was only his nat   ral deference that   d held him back all these years .  when sam vimes came back  and with the patrician there to put in a good word for him  fred colon would definitely be on the promotion ladder .   only to full captain  of course  he thought as he strutted down the stairs   with great care  because strutting is usually impossible while walking downward .  he wouldn   t want to outrank captain carrot .  that would be   wrong .   this fact shows that  however crazed with power someone may become  a tiny instinct for self preservation always remains .      he got the chickens first  thought gaspode  winding his way through the legs of the crowd .  amazin    .   they hadn   t stopped to eat them  though .  gaspode had been stuffed into the other saddlebag and would not like to have to go through ten miles like that again  especially so close to the smell of roast chicken .   it looked as though there was a market going on  and the wolf baiting had been saved as a sort of closing ceremony .  hurdles had been arranged on a rough circle .  men were holding the collars of dogs   big  heavy  unpleasant looking dogs  which were already wild with excitement and deranged stupidity .   there was a coop by the hurdles .  gaspode made his way to it  and peered through the wooden bars at the heap of matted gray fur in the shadows .      looks like you   re in a spot of strife  friend     he said .   contrary to legend   and there are so many legends about wolves  although mostly they are legends about the way men think about wolves   a trapped wolf is more likely to whine and fawn than go wild with rage .   but this one must have felt it had nothing to lose .  foam flecked jaws snapped at the bars .      where   s the rest of your pack  then .     said gaspode .      no pack  shorty .         ah .  a lone wolf  eh .     the worst kind  gaspode thought .      roast chicken isn   t worth this     he muttered .  out loud  he growled     you seen any other wolves around here .         yes .         good .  you want to get out of here alive .         i   ll kill them all .         right  right   but there   s dozens of    em  see .  you won   t stand a chance .  they   ll tear you to bits .  dogs   re a lot nastier than wolves .      in the shade  the eyes narrowed .      why   re you telling me  dog .            cos i am here to help you  see .  you do what i tell you  you could be out of here in half an hour .  otherwise you   re a rug on someone   s floor tomorrow .  your choice .  o   course  there might not be enough of you left to make a rug .      the wolf listened to the baying of the dogs .  there was no mistaking their intent .      what did you have in mind .     it said .   a few minutes later the crowd was gently nudged aside as carrot edged his horse toward the pen .  the hubbub died .  a sword on a horse always commands respect  the rider is often a mere courtesy detail  but in this case it was not so .  the watch had put the final swell and polish on carrot   s muscles .   and there was that faint smile .  it was the sort you backed away from .      good day .  who is in charge here .     he said .   there was a certain amount of comparison of status  and a man cautiously raised his hand .      i   m the deputy mayor  y   honor     he said .      and what is this event .         we   m about to bait a wolf  y   honor .         really .  i myself own a wolfhound of unusual strength and prowess .  may i test it against the creature .      there was more mumbling among the bystanders  the general consensus being  why not .  anyway  there was that smile        go ahead  y   honor     said the deputy mayor .   carrot stuck his fingers in his mouth and whistled .   the townspeople watched in astonishment as gaspode walked out from between their legs and sat down .  then the laughter started .   it died away after a while  because the faint smile didn   t .      is there a problem .     said carrot .      it   ll get torn limb from limb .         well .  do you care what happens to a wolf .      laughter broke out again .  the deputy mayor had a feeling he was being got at .      it   s your dog  mister     he said  shrugging .   the little dog barked .      and to make it interesting  we   ll wager a pound of steak     said carrot .   the dog barked again .      two pounds of steak     carrot corrected himself .      oh  i reckon it   s going to be interesting enough as it is     said the deputy mayor .  the smile was beginning to prey on his nerves .     all right  boys   fetch the wolf .      the creature was dragged into the ring of hurdles  slavering and snarling .      no  don   t tie it up     said carrot  as a man went to wrap the halter around a post .      it   ll get away if we don   t .         it won   t have a chance  believe me .      they looked at the smile  dragged the muzzle from the wolf  and leapt to safety .      now  just in case you were havin    second thoughts about our agreement     said gaspode to the wolf     i suggest you look at the face of the bloke on the horse  right .      the wolf glanced up .  it saw the wolverine smile of the face of the rider .   gaspode barked .  the wolf yelped and rolled over .   the crowd waited .  and then        is that it .         yes  that   s how it normally goes     said carrot .     it   s a special bark  you see .  all the blood in the victim congeals in an instant  out of sheer terror .         it hasn   t even worried the body .         what     said carrot     would be the point of that .      he got down from the horse  pushed his way into the ring  picked up the body of the wolf and flung it across the saddle .      it grunted .  i heard it       someone began .      that was probably air being expressed from the corpse     said carrot .  the smile still hadn   t gone  and at that point it suggested very subtly that carrot had heard the last gasp of hundreds of corpses .      yeah  that   s right     said a voice in the crowd .     everyone knows that .  and now what about the steak for the brave little doggie .      the people looked around to see who had said this .  none of them looked down  because dogs can   t talk .      we can forgo the steak     said carrot  mounting up .      no  w   no you can   t     said the voice     a deal   s a deal .  who was risking their life here  that   s what i   d like to know .         come  gaspode     said carrot .   whining and grumbling  the little dog emerged from the crowd and trailed after the horse .   it wasn   t until they were at the edge of the town square that one of the people said    oi  what the hell happened there .     and the spell broke .  but by then both horse and dog were traveling really  really fast .      vimes hated and despised the privileges of rank  but they had this to be said for them  at least they meant that you could hate and despise them in comfort .   willikins would arrive at an inn an hour before vimes   s coach and  with an arrogance that vimes would never dare employ  take over several rooms and install vimes   s own cook in the kitchen .  vimes complained about this to inigo .      but you see  your grace  you   re not here as an individual but as ankh morpork .  when people look at you  they see the city  mhm  mhm .         they do .  should i stop washing .         that is very droll  sir .  but you see  sir  you and the city are one .  mhm  mhm .  if you are insulted  ankh morpork is insulted .  if you befriend  ankh morpork befriends .         really .  what happens when i go to the lavatory .         that   s up to you  sir .  mhm  mph .      at breakfast next morning vimes sliced the top off a boiled egg  thinking  this is ankh morpork slicing the top off a boiled egg .  if i cut my toast into soldiers  we   re probably at war .   constable littlebottom entered  carefully  and saluted .      your message came back  sir     she said  handing him a scrap of paper .     from sergeant stronginthearm .  i   ve deciphered it for you .  er   the scone from the museum   s been found  sir .         well  that   s the other shoe dropped     said vimes .     i was worried there for a moment .         er  in fact constable shoe is bothered about it     said cheery .     it   s a bit hard to follow what he says  but he seems to think someone made a copy of it .         what  a fake of a fake .  what good   s that .         i really couldn   t say  sir .  your other   surmise was correct .      vimes glanced at the paper .      hah .  thanks  cheery .  we   ll be down shortly .         you   re humming  sam     said sybil  after a while .     that means that something awful is going to happen to somebody .         wonderful thing  technology     said vimes  buttering a slice of toast .     i can see it has its uses .         and when you grin in that shiny sort of way it means that someone   s playing silly buggers and doesn   t know you   ve just thrown a six .         i don   t know what you mean  dear .  it   s probably the country air agreeing with me .      lady sybil put down her teacup .      sam .         yes  dear .         this is probably not the best time to mention it  but you know i told you i went to see old mrs .  content .  well  she says        there was another knock at the door .  lady sybil sighed .   this time it was inigo who entered .      we should be leaving  your grace  if you don   t mind .  i would like us to be at slake by lunchtime and through the pass at wilinus before dark  mhm  mhm .         do we have to rush so .     sighed sybil .      the pass is   slightly dangerous     said inigo .     somewhat lawless .  mhm  mhm .         only somewhat .     said vimes .      i will just feel happier when it is behind us     said inigo .     it would be a good idea if the second coach follows us closely and your men stay alert  your grace .         they teach you tactics in lord vetinari   s political office  do they  inigo .     said vimes .      just common sense  mhm  mhm  sir .         why don   t we wait until tomorrow before attempting the pass .         with respect  your grace  i suggest not .  for one thing  the weather is worsening .  and i   m sure we are being watched .  we must demonstrate that there is no yellow in the ankh morpork flag  mhm  mhm .         there is     said vimes .     it   s on the owl and the collars of the hippos .         i mean     said inigo     that the colors of ankh morpork do not run .         only since we got the new dyes     said vimes .     all right  all right .  i know what you mean .  but  look  i   m not risking the servants if there   s any danger .  and there   s to be no arguing  understand .  they can stay here and take the mail coach tomorrow .  no one attacks the mail coaches anymore .         i suggest lady sybil remains here  too  sir .  mhm .         absolutely not     said sybil .     i wouldn   t hear of it .  if it   s not too dangerous for sam  it   s not too dangerous for me .         i wouldn   t argue with her  if i were you     said vimes to inigo .     i really wouldn   t .         the wolf was not very happy about being tethered to a tree but  as gaspode said  never trust nobody .   they   d paused awhile in a wood about five miles from the town .  it   d be a brief stop  carrot had said .  some of the people in the square looked the sort who treasured their lack of a sense of humor .   after some barking and growling  gaspode said     you got to understand that matey here is pers   naly non gratis in local wolf society  being a bit of  ahaha  lone wolf           yes .     carrot was taking the roast chickens out of their sack .  gaspode   s eyes fixed on them .      but he hears the howlin    at night .         ah   wolves communicate .         basic   ly your wolf howl is just another way of pissin    against a tree to say it   s your damn tree  but there   s always bit of news  too .  something nasty   s happenin    in uberwald .  he doesn   t know what .     gaspode lowered his voice .     between you and me  our friend here was well behind the door when the brains was handed out .  if wolves was people  he   d be like foul ole ron .         what is his name .     said carrot  thoughtfully .   gaspode gave carrot a look .  who cared what a wolf was called .      wolf names is difficult     he said .     much prefer vampires .  vamtion  see .  it   s not like callin    yourself mister snuggles or bonzo  you understand           yes  i know .  so what is his name .         you want to know what his name is  then .         yes  gaspode .         so  in fact  it   s the name of this wolf you want to know .         that is correct .      gaspode shifted uneasily .      asshole     he said .      oh .     to the dog   s frank astonishment  carrot blushed .      that   s basic   ly a summary  but it   s a pretty good translation     he said .     i wouldn   t have mentioned it  but you did ask        gaspode stopped and whined for a moment  trying to convey the message that he was losing his voice due to lack of chicken .      er   there   s been a lot on the howl about angua     he went on  when carrot seemed unable to take the hint .     er   they think she   s bad news .         why .  she   s traveling as a wolf  after all .         wolves hate werewolves .         what .  that can   t be right .  when she   s wolf shaped she   s just like a wolf .         so .  when she   s human shaped she   s just like a human .  and what   s that got to do with anything .  humans don   t like werewolves .  wolves don   t like werewolves .  people don   t like wolves that can think like people  an    people don   t like people who can act like wolves .  which just shows you that people are the same everywhere     said gaspode .  he assessed this sentence and added     even when they   re wolves .         i never thought of it like that .         and she smells wrong .  wolves are very sensitive to that sort of thing .         tell me more about the howl .         oh  it   s like the clacky thing .  news gets spread for hundreds of miles .         do the howls   mention her   companion .         no .  if you like  i   d ask ass           i   d prefer a different name  if it   s all the same to you     said carrot .     words like that aren   t clever .      gaspode rolled his eyes .      there nothing wrong with the word among us pedestically gifted species     he said .     we   re very smell orientated .     he sighed .     how about    bum    .  in the sense of  er  migratory worker .  he   s a freelance chicken throttler  style of fing .      he turned to the wolf  and spoke in canine .      now then  bum  this human is insane and believe me  i know a mad human when i see one .  he   s frothing at the mouth inside and he   ll rip your hide off and nail it to a tree if you aren   t straight with us  understand .         what was that you just told him .     said carrot .      just explainin    we   re friends     said gaspode .  to the cowering wolf he barked     okay  he   s prob   ly going to do that anyway  but i can talk to him  so your only chance is to tell us everything           know nothing .     the wolf whined .     she was with a big he wolf from uberwald .  from the clan that smells like this .      gaspode sniffed .     he   s a long way from home  then .         he   s a bad news wolf .         tell it there   ll be roast chicken for its trouble     said carrot .   gaspode sighed .  it was a hard life  being an interpreter .      all right     he growled .     i   ll persuade him to untie you .  it   ll take some doing  mark you .  if he offers you a chicken  don   t take it    cos it   ll be poisoned .  humans  eh .      carrot watched the wolf flee .      odd     he said .     you   ve have thought it   d be hungry  wouldn   t you .      gaspode looked up from the roast chicken .     wolves  eh .     he said  indistinctly .   that night  when they heard the wolves howling in the distant mountains  gaspode picked up one solitary  lonely howl behind them .      the towers followed them up into the mountains although  vimes noticed  there were some differences in construction .  down on the plains they were more or less just a high wooden gantry with a shed at the bottom but here  although the design was the same  it was clearly temporary .  next to it men were at work on a heavy stone base   fortifications  he realized  which meant that he really was beyond the law .  of course  technically he   d been beyond his law since leaving ankh morpork  but laws were where you could make it stick and these days a city watch badge would at least earn respect  if not actual cooperation  everywhere on the plains .  up here  it was just an ugly brooch .   slake turned out to be a stone walled coaching inn and not much else .  it had  vimes noticed  very heavy shutters on the window .  it also had what he thought was a strange iron griddle over the fireplace until he recognized it for what it was  a sort of portcullis that could block off the chimney .  this place expected to withstand the occasional siege that might include enemies who could fly .   it was sleeting when they went out to the coaches .      a storm   s closing in  mmm  mhm     said inigo .     we shall have to hurry .         why .     said sybil .      the pass will probably be closed for several days  your ladyship .  if we wait  we may even miss the coronation .  and   er   there may be slight bandit activity           slight bandit activity .     said vimes .      yes  sir .         you mean they wake up and decide to go back to bed .  or they just steal enough for a cup of coffee .         very droll  sir .  they do  notoriously  take hostages           bandits don   t frighten me     said sybil .      if i may       inigo began .      mister skimmer     said lady sybil  drawing herself up to her full width     i did in fact just tell you what we are going to do .  see to it  please .  there are servants at the consulate  aren   t there .         there is one  i believe           then we shall happily make do as best we can .  won   t we  sam .         certainly  dear .      it was seriously snowing by the time they left  in great feather lumps which fell with a faint damp hiss  muffling all other sound .  vimes wouldn   t have known that they   d reached the pass if the coaches hadn   t stopped .      the coach with your   men on it should go in front     said inigo  as they stood in the snow beside the steaming horses .     we should follow close behind .  i   ll ride with our driver  just in case .         so that if we are attacked by anyone you can give them a potted summary of the political situation .     said vimes .     no  you will ride inside with lady sybil  and i   ll ride on the box .  got to protect the civilians  eh .         your grace  i           however  your suggestion is appreciated     vimes went on .     you get inside  mister skimmer .      the man opened his mouth .  vimes raised an eyebrow .      very well  your grace  but it is extremely           good man .         i should like my leather case down from the roof  though .         certainly .  a bit of fact finding will take your mind of things .      vimes walked forward to the other carriage  poked his head inside and said     we   re going to be ambushed  lads .         dat   s interestin        said detritus .  he grunted slightly as he wound the windlass of his crossbow .      oh     said cheery .      i don   t think they   ll try to kill us     vimes went on .      does dat mean we don   t try to kill dem .         use your own judgment .      detritus sighted along a thick bundle of arrows .  they were his idea .  since his giant crossbow was capable of sending an iron bolt through the gates of a city under siege  he had felt it rather a waste to use it on just one person  so he had adapted it to fire a sheaf of several dozen arrows all at once .  the threads holding them together were supposed to snap under acceleration .  they did so .  quite often the arrows also shattered in midair as they failed to withstand the enormous pressure .   he called it the piecemaker .  he   d only tried it once  down at the butts  vimes had seen a target vanish .  so had the targets on either side of it  the earth bank behind it  and a spiraling cloud of feathers floating down had been all that remained of a couple of seagulls who had been in the wrong place at the wrong time .  in this instance  the wrong place had been vertically above detritus .   now no other watchmen would go on patrol with the troll unless they could stay at least a hundred yards directly behind him .  but the test had the desired effect  because someone saw everything in ankh morpork and news about the targets had got around .  now just the knowledge that detritus was on his way cleared a street much faster than any weapon .      i got lots of judgment     he said .      you be careful with that thing     said vimes .     you could hurt someone .      the party started out again  through the swirls of snow .  vimes made himself comfortable among the luggage  lit a cigar and then  when he was sure that the rattling of the coach would mask the sounds  rummaged farther under the tarpaulin and drew out inigo   s cheap  scarred leather case .   from his pocket he took a small roll of black cloth  and unrolled it on his knee .  intricate little lockpicks glinted for a moment in the light of the coach lamps .   a good copper has to be able to think like a criminal .  vimes was a very good copper .   he was also a very alive copper and intended to remain that way .  that was why  when the case   s lock went click  he laid it down on the shaking roof with its lid opening away from him and  leaning back  carefully lifted the lid with his boot .   a long blade flicked out .  it would have terminally ruined the digestion of a casual thief .  someone obviously expected very bad hotel security on this journey .   vimes carefully eased it back into its spring loaded sheath  looked upon the contents of the case  smiled in a not very happy way  and carefully lifted out something that gleamed with the silvery light of carefully designed  beautifully engineered and very compact evil .   he thought  sometimes it would be nice to be wrong about people .       gaspode knew they were in the high foothills now .  places to buy food were getting scarce .  however carefully carrot knocked at the door of some isolated farmstead  he   d end up having to talk to people who were hiding under the bed .  people here were not used to the idea of muscular men with swords who were actually anxious to buy things .   in the end it generally worked out quicker to walk in  go through the contents of the pantry  and leave some money on the table for when the people came up out of the cellar .   it had been two days since the last cottage  and there was so little there that carrot  to gaspode   s disgust  had just left some money .   the forest thickened .  alder became pine .  there were snow showers every night .  the stars were pinpoints of frost .   and  colder and harder  rising with the sunset  was the howl .   it went up on every side  a great mournful ululation across the freezing forests .      they   re so close i can smell    em     said gaspode .     they   ve been shadowing us for days .         there has never been an authenticated case of an unprovoked wolf attacking an adult human being     said carrot .  they were both huddling under his cloak .   after a while gaspode said     an    that   s good  is it .         what do you mean .         we ell  o   course us dogs only has little brains  but it seems to me that what you just said was pretty much the same as sayin       no unprovokin    adult human bein    has ever returned to tell the tale     right .  i mean  your wolf has just got to make sure they kill people in quiet places where no one   ll ever know  yes .      more snow settled on the cloak .  it was large  and heavy  and a relic of many a long night in the ankh morpork rain .  in front of it  a fire flickered and hissed .      i wish you hadn   t said that  gaspode .      these were big  serious flakes of snow .  winter was moving fast down the mountains .      you wish i hadn   t said it .         but   no  i   m sure there   s nothing to be afraid of .      a drift had nearly covered the cloak .      you shouldn   t   ve traded the horse for those snowshoes back at the last place     said gaspode .      the poor thing was done in .  anyway  it wasn   t exactly a trade .  the people wouldn   t come down out of the chimney .  they did say to take anything we wanted .         they said to take everything  only spare their lives .         yes .  i don   t know why .  i smiled at them .      there was a doggy sigh .      trouble is  see  you could carry me on the horse  but this is deep snow and i am a little doggie .  my problems are closer to the ground .  i hope i don   t have to draw you a picture .         i   ve got some spare clothes in my pack .  i might be able to make you a   coat           a coat wouldn   t do the trick .      another howl began  quite close this time .   the snow was falling a lot faster .  the hissing of the fire turned into a sizzle .  then it went out .   gaspode was not good at snow .  it was not a precipitation he normally had to face .  in the city  there was always somewhere warm if you knew where to look .  anyway  snow only stayed snow for an hour or two  and then it became brown slush and was trodden into the general slurry of the streets .   streets .  gaspode really missed streets .  he could be wise on streets .  out here  he was dumb on mud .      fire   s gone out     he said .   there was no answer from carrot .      fire   s gone out  i said        this time there was a snore .      hey  you can   t go to sleep .     gaspode whined .     not now .  we   ll freeze to death .      the next voice in the howl seemed only a few trees away .  gaspode thought he could see dark shapes in the endless curtain of snow .         if we   re lucky     he mumbled .  he licked carrot   s face  a move that usually resulted in the lickee chasing gaspode down the street with a broom .  there was merely another snore .   gaspode   s mind raced .   of course  he was a dog  and dogs and wolves   well  they were the same  right .  everyone knew that .  so oo  said a treacherous inner voice   maybe it wasn   t exactly gaspode and carrot in trouble .  maybe it was only carrot .  yeah  right on  brothers .  let us join together in wild runs in the moonlight .  but first  let us eat this monkey .   on the other paw     he   d got hard pad  soft pad  the swinge  licky end  scroff  mange and something rather strange on the back of his neck that he couldn   t quite reach .  gaspode somehow couldn   t imagine the wolves saying hey  he   s one of us .   besides   while he   d begged  fought  tricked and stolen  he   d never actually been a bad dog .   you needed to be a moderate good theological disputant to accept this  especially since a fair number of sausages and prime cuts had disappeared from butchers    slabs in a blur of gray and a lingering odor of lavatory carpet  but nevertheless gaspode was clear in his own mind that he   d never crossed the boundary from merely being a naughty boy .  he   d never bitten a hand that fed him .  he   d never done it on the carpet .  he   d never shirked a duty .  it was a bugger  but there you were .  it was a dog thing .   he whined when the ring of dark shapes closed in .   eyes gleamed .   he whined again  and then growled as unseen fanged death surrounded him .   this was clearly impressing no one  not even gaspode .   he wagged his tail nervously .      just passin    through .     he said  in a strangulatedly cheerful voice .     no trouble to anyone .      there was a definite feeling that the shadows beyond the snowflakes were getting more crowded .      so   have you had your holidays yet .     he squeaked .   this also did not appear to be well received .   well  this was it  then .  famous last stand .  plucky dog defends his master .  what a good dog .  shame there   d be no one left to tell anyone     he barked    mine .  mine .     and leapt snarling toward the nearest shape .   a huge paw swatted him out of the air and then pinned him down  spread eagled  in the snow .   he looked up past white fangs and a long muzzle into eyes that seemed familiar        hmine     growled the wolf .  it was angua .      the coaches slowed to a walk on a road that was rough with potholes under the unbroken snow  every one a wheel breaking trap in the dark .   vimes nodded to himself when he saw lights flickering beside the road a few miles into the pass .  on either side  old landslides had formed banks of scree  down which the forests had spilled .   he dropped quietly off the back of the coach and vanished into the shadows .   the leading coach stopped at a log which had been dropped across the road .  there was some movement  and then the driver swung himself down into the mud and set off at a dead run back down the pass .   figures moved out of the trees .  one of them stopped at the door of the first coach and tried the handle .   there was a moment when the world held its breath .  the figure must have sensed it  because he was already leaping aside when there was a click and the whole door and its surrounding frame blew outward in a cloud of splinters .   the thing about fires  vimes had once observed  was that only an idiot got between them and a troll holding a two thousand pound crossbow .  all hell hadn   t been let loose .  it was merely detritus .  but from a few feet away you couldn   t tell the difference .   another figure reached for the door of the second coach just before vimes fired out of the darkness and hit his shoulder with a butcher   s sound .  then inigo dived through the window  rolled with unclerklike grace as he hit the ground  rose in front of one of the bandits and brought his hand around  edge first  on the man   s neck .   vimes had seen this trick done before .  usually  it just made people angry .  occasionally  it managed an incapacitating blow .   he   d never seen it remove a head .      everybody stop .      sybil was pushed out of the coach .  behind her  a man stepped out .  he was holding a crossbow .      your grace vimes .     he shouted .  the word bounced back and forth between the cliffs .      i know you   re here  your grace vimes .  and here is your lady .  and there are many of us .  come out  your grace vimes .      flakes of snow hissed over the fires .   then there was a whisper in the air followed by a second smack of steel into muscle .  one of the hooded figures collapsed into the mud  clutching at its leg .   inigo slowly got to his feet .  the man holding the crossbow appeared not to notice .      it is like chess  your grace vimes .  we have disarmed the troll and the dwarf .  and i have the queen .  and if you shoot at me  can you be sure i won   t have time to fire .      firelight glowed on the twisted trees bordering the road .   several seconds passed .   then the sound of vimes   s crossbow landing in the circle of light was very loud .      well done  your grace vimes .  and now yourself  if you please .      inigo made out the shape that appeared at the very edge of the light  with both hands up .      are you all right  sybil .     said vimes .      a bit cold  sam .         you   re not hurt .         no  sam .         keep your hands where i can see them  your grace vimes .         and are you going to promise me you   ll let her go .     said vimes .   a flame flickered near vimes   s face  a bright pool in the darkness  as he lit a cigar .      now  your grace vimes  why ever should i do that .  but i am sure ankh morpork will pay a lot for you .         ah .  i thought so     said vimes .  he shook the match out  and the cigar end glowed for a moment .     sybil .         yes  sam .         duck .      there was a second filled only with the indrawing of breath  and then  as lady sybil dived forward  vimes   s hand came around from behind him in an arc  there was a silken sound  and the man   s head was flung back .   inigo leapt and caught his crossbow as it was dropped  then rolled and came up firing .  another figure staggered .   vimes was aware of a commotion elsewhere as he grabbed sybil and helped her back into the coach .  inigo had vanished  but a scream in the dark didn   t sound like anyone that vimes knew .   and then   only the hiss of snow in the fire .      i   think they   re gone  sir     said cheery   s voice .      not as fast as us .  detritus .         sir .         are you okay .         feelin    very tactful  sir .         you two take that coach  i   ll take this  and let   s get the hell out of here  shall we .         where   s mister skimmer .     said sybil .   there was another scream from the woods .      forget him .         but he   s           forget him .      the snow was falling thicker as they climbed the pass .  the deep snow dragged at the wheels  and all vimes could see were the darker shapes of the horses against the whiteness .  then the clouds parted briefly  and he wished they hadn   t  because here they revealed that the darkness on the left of his wasn   t rock any more but a sheer drop .   at the top of the pass the lights of an inn glowed out onto the thickening snow .  vimes drove the carriage into the yard .      detritus .         sir .         i   ll watch our backs .  make sure this place is okay  will you .         yessir .      the troll jumped down  slotting a fresh bundle of arrows into the piecemaker .  vimes spotted his intention just in time .      just knock  sergeant .         right you are  sir .      the troll knocked and entered .  the buzz of sound from inside suddenly ceased .  vimes heard  muffled by the door     der duke of ankh morpork is coming in .  anyone have a problem with dis .  just say der word .     and in the background  the little humming  singing noise the piecemaker made under tension .   vimes helped sybil down from the coach .      how do you feel now .     he said .   she smiled faintly .     i think this dress will have to go for dusters     she said .  she smiled a little more when she saw his expression .      i knew you   d come up with something  sam .  you go all slow and cold and that means something really dreadful   s going to happen .  i wasn   t frightened .         really .  i was scared shi   stiff     said vimes .      what happened to mister skimmer .  i remember him rummaging in his case and cursing           i suspect inigo skimmer is alive and well     said vimes grimly .     which is more than can be said for those around him .      there was silence in the main room of the inn .  a man and a woman  presumably the landlord and his wife  were standing flat against the back of the bar .  the dozen or so other occupants lined the walls  hands in the air .  beer dribbled from a couple of spilled mugs .      everyt   ing normal an    peaceful     said detritus  turning around .   vimes realized that everyone was staring at him .  he looked down .  his shirt was torn .  mud and blood caked his clothes .  melted snow dripped off him .  in his right hand  un regarded  he was still holding his crossbow .      bit of trouble on the road     he said .     er   you know how it is .      no one moved .      oh  good gods   detritus  put that damn thing down  will you .         right  sir .      the troll lowered his crossbow .  two dozen people all began to breathe again .   then the skinny woman stepped around from behind the bar  nodded at vimes  carefully took lady sybil   s hand from his  and pointed toward the wide wooden stairs .  the black look she gave vimes puzzled him .   only then did he realize that lady sybil was shaking .  tears were running down her face .      and   er   my wife is a bit shaken up     he said weakly .     corporal littlebottom .     he yelled  to cover his confusion .   cheery stepped through the doorway .      go with lady syb        he stopped because of the rising hubbub .  one or two people pointed .  someone laughed .  cheery stopped  looking down .      what   s up .     vimes hissed .      er   it   s me  sir .  ankh morpork dwarf fashions haven   t really caught on here  sir     said cheery .      the skirt .     said vimes .      yes  sir .      vimes looked around at the faces .  they seemed more shocked than angry  although he spotted a couple of dwarfs in one corner who were definitely unhappy .      go with lady sybil     he repeated .      it might not be a very good id       cheery began .      godsdammit .     shouted vimes  unable to stop himself .  the crowd went silent .  a ragged bloodstained madman holding a crossbow can command a rapt audience .   then he shuddered .  what he wanted now was a bed  but what he wanted  before bed  more than anything  was a drink .  and he couldn   t have one .  he   d learned that long ago .  one drink was one too many .      all right  tell me     he said .      all dwarfs are men  sir     said cheery .     i mean   traditionally .  that   s how everyone thinks of it up here .         well   stand outside the door  or   or shut your eyes or something  okay .      vimes lifted lady sybil   s chin .      are you all right  dear .     he said .      sorry to let you down  sam     she whispered .     it was just so awful .      vimes  designed by nature to be one of those men unable to kiss their own wives in public  patted her helplessly on the shoulder .  she thought she   d let him down .  it was unbearable .      you just   i mean  cheery will   and i   ll   sort things out and be along right away     he said .     we   ll get a good bedroom  i suspect .      she nodded  still looking down .      and   i   m just going out for some fresh air .      vimes stepped outside .   the snow had stopped for now .  the moon was half hidden by clouds  and the air smelled of frost .   when the figure dropped down from the eaves it was amazed at the way vimes spun and rushed it bodily against the wall .   vimes looked through a red mist at the moonlit face of inigo skimmer .      i   ll damn well       he began .      look down  your grace     said skimmer .     mhm  mhm .      vimes realized he could feel the faintest prick of the knife blade on his stomach .      look down farther     he said .   inigo looked down .  he swallowed .  vimes had a knife  too .      you really are no gentleman  then     he said .      make a sudden move and neither are you     said vimes .     and now it appears that we have reached what sergeant colon persists in referring to as an imp arse .         i assure you i will not kill you     said inigo .      i know that     said vimes .     but will you try .         no .  i am here for your protection  mhm  mhm .         vetinari sent you  did he .         you know we never divulge the name of           that   s true .  you people are very honorable     vimes spat the word     in that respect .      both men relaxed a little .      you left me alone surrounded by enemies     said inigo  but without much accusation in his tone .      why should i care what happens to a bunch of bandits .     said vimes .     you are an assassin .         how did you find out .  mmm .         a copper watches the way people walk .  the klatchians say a man   s leg is his second face  did you know that .  and that little clerky  i   m so harmless walk of yours is too good to be true .         you mean that just from my walk you           no .  you didn   t catch the orange     said vimes .      come now           no  people either catch or flinch .  you saw it wasn   t a danger .  and when i took your arm i felt metal under your clothes .  then i just sent a clacks back with your description .      he let go of inigo and walked over to the coach  leaving his back exposed .  he took something down from the box and came back and waved it at the man .      i know this is yours     he said .     i pinched it out of your luggage .  if i ever catch anyone with one of these in ankh morpork  i will make their life a complete misery as only a copper knows how .  is that understood .         if you ever catch anyone with one of these in ankh morpork  your grace  mhm  they will still be lucky that the assassins    guild didn   t find them first  mmm .  they are on our forbidden list  within the city .  but we are a long way from ankh morpork now .  mmm  mmm .      vimes turned the thing over and over in his hands .  it looked vaguely like a long handled hammer  or perhaps a strangely made telescope .  what it was  basically  was a spring .  that   s all a crossbow was  after all .      it   s a devil to load     he said .     i nearly ruptured myself cocking it against a rock .  you   d only get one shot .         but it   s the shot no one expects  mhm  mhm .      vimes nodded .  you could even conceal this thing down your pants  although the thought of all that coiled power that close would require nerves of steel and other parts of steel  too  if it came to it .      this is not a weapon .  this is for killing people     he said .      uh   most weapons are     said inigo .      no  they   re not .  they   re so you don   t have to kill people .  they   re for   for having .  for being seen .  for warning .  this isn   t one of those .  it   s for hiding away until you bring it out and kill people in the dark .  and where   s that other thing .         your grace .         the palm dagger .  don   t try to lie to me .      inigo shrugged .  the movement shot something silver out of his sleeve  it was a carefully shaped blade  padded on one side  that slid along the edge of his hand .  there was a click from somewhere inside his jacket .      good gods     breathed vimes .     do you know how often people have tried to assassinate me  man .         yes  your grace .  nine times .  the guild has set your fee at six hundred thousand dollars .  the last time an approach was made  no guild member volunteered .  mhm  mhm .         hah .         incidentally  and very informally of course  we would appreciate knowing the whereabouts of the body of the honorable eustace bassingly gore  mhm  mhm .      vimes scratched his nose .      was he the one who tried poisoning my shaving cream .         yes  your grace .         well  unless his body is an extremely strong swimmer  it   s still on a ship bound for ghat via cape terror     said vimes .     i paid the captain a thousand dollars not to take the chains off before zambingo  too .  that   ll give it a nice long walk home through the jungles of klatch where i   m sure its knowledge of rare poisons will come in very handy  although not as handy perhaps as a knowledge of antidotes .         a thousand dollars .         well  he had twelve hundred dollars on him .  i donated the rest to the sunshine sanctuary for sick dragons .  i got a receipt  by the way .  you chaps are keen on receipts  i think .         you stole his money .  mhm  mhm .      vimes took a deep breath .  his voice  when it emerged  was flat calm .     i wasn   t going to waste any of my own .  and he had just tried to kill me .  think of it as an investment  for the good of his health .  of course  if in due course he cares to come and see me  i shall make sure he gets what   s coming to him .         i   m   astounded  your grace .  mhm  mhm .  bassingly gore was an extremely competent swordsman .         really .  i generally never wait to find out about that sort of thing .      inigo smiled his thin little smile .      and two months ago sir richard liddleley was found tied to a fountain in sator square  painted pink and with a flag stuck           i was feeling generous     said vimes .     i   m sorry  i don   t play your games .         assassination is not a game  your grace .         it is the way you people play it .         there have to be rules .  otherwise there would just be anarchy .  mhm  mhm .  you have your code  and we have ours .         and you   ve been sent here to protect me .         i have other skills  but   yes .         what makes you think i   ll need you .         well  your grace   here they don   t have rules .  mhm  mhm .         i   ve spent most of my life dealing with people who don   t have rules .         yes  of course .  but when you kill them  they don   t get up again .         i   ve never killed anyone .     said vimes .      you shot that bandit in the throat .         i was aiming for the shoulder .         yes  the thing does pull to the left     said inigo .     you mean that you have never tried to kill anyone .  i have  on the other hand .  and here  hesitation may not be an option .  mmm .         i didn   t hesitate .      inigo sighed .     in the guild  your grace  we don   t   grandstand .         grandstand .         that business with the cigar           you mean  when i shut my eyes and they had to look at a flame in the darkness .         ah       inigo hesitated .     but they might have shot you there and then .         no .  i wasn   t a threat .  and you heard his voice .  i hear that sort of voice a lot .  he   s not going to shoot people too soon and spoil the fun .  i can assume that you have not got a contract on me .         that is correct .         and you   d still swear to that .         on my honor as an assassin .         yes     said vimes .     that   s where i hit a difficulty  of course .  and   i don   t know how to put this  inigo  but you don   t act like a typical assassin .  lord this  sir that   the guild is the school for gentlemen but you   and gods know i don   t mean any offense here   are not exactly        inigo touched his forelock .      scholarship boy  sir     he said .   my gods yes  thought vimes .  you can find your average  amateur killers on every street .  they   re mostly deranged or drunk or some poor woman who   s had a hard day and the husband has raised his hand once too often and suddenly twenty years of frustration takes over .  killing a stranger without malice or satisfaction  other than the craftsman   s pride in a job well done  is such a rare talent that armies spend months trying to instill it into their young soldiers .  most people will shy away from killing people they haven   t been introduced to .   the guild had to have one or two people like inigo .  didn   t some philosophical bastard once say that a government needed butchers as well as shepherds .   he indicated the little crossbow .      all right  take it     he said .     but you can put the word about that if i ever  ever see one on the street the owner will find it put where the sun does not shine .         ah     said inigo     that   s the rather amusingly named place in lancre  isn   t it .  only about fifty miles from here  i believe .  mhm  mhm .         rest assured that i can find a shortcut .         gaspode tried blowing in carrot   s ear again .      time to wake up     he growled .   carrot opened his eyes  blinked the snow out of them  and then tried to move .      you just lie still  right .     said gaspode .     if it helps  just try to think of them as a very heavy eiderdown .      carrot struggled feebly .  the wolves piled on top of his shifted position .      warming you up a treat     said gaspode  grinning nervously .     a wolf blanket  see .  o   course  you   re going to be a bit whiffy on the nose for a while  but better to be itchy than dead  eh .     he scratched an ear industriously with a hind leg .  one of the wolves growled at him .     sorry .  grub   ll be up in a moment .         food .     muttered carrot .   angua appeared in carrot   s vision  dressed in a leather shirt and leggings .  she stood looking down at him  hands on her hips .  to gaspode   s amazement  carrot actually managed to push himself up on his elbows  dislodging several wolves .      you were tracking us .     he said .      no  they were     said angua .     they thought you were a bloody fool .  i heard it on the howl .  and they were right .  you haven   t eaten anything for three days .  and up here  winter doesn   t drop a few hints over a month or so .  it turns up in one night .  why were you so stupid .      gaspode looked around the clearing  angua had rekindled the fire  gaspode wouldn   t have believed it if he hadn   t seen it  but actual wolves had dragged in actual fallen wood for her .  and then another had turned up with a small deer  still fat after the autumn .  he dribbled at the smell of it roasting .   something human and complicated was going on between carrot and angua .  it sounded like an argument but it didn   t smell like one .  anyway  recent events all made perfect sense to gaspode .  the female ran away and the male chased her .  that   s how it went .  actually  it was usually about twenty males of all sizes  but obviously  gaspode conceded  things were a bit different for humans .   pretty soon  he reckoned  carrot would notice the big male wolf sitting by the fire  and then the fur would fly .  humans  eh .   gaspode wasn   t sure of his own ancestry .  there was some terrier  and a touch of spaniel  and probably someone   s leg  and an awful lot of mongrel .  but he took it as an article of faith that there was in all dogs a tiny bit of wolf  and his was urgently sending messages that the wolf by the fire was one you didn   t even stare directly at .   it wasn   t that the wolf was obviously vicious .  he didn   t need to be .  even sitting still  he radiated the assurance of competent power .  gaspode was  if not the victor  then at least the survivor of many a street fight  and as such would not have gone up against this animal even if backed up by a couple of lions and a man with an ax .   instead  he sidled over to a female wolf who was watching the fire haughtily .      yo  bitch     he said .      vot vas that .      gaspode reconsidered his strategy .      hi  foxy   er   wolf lady     he tried .   a certain lowering of the temperature suggested that this one hadn   t worked either .         ullo  miss     he said  hopefully .   her muzzle turned to point at him .  her eyes narrowed .      vot har you .     ice slithered off every syllable .      gaspode   s the name     barked gaspode  with insane cheerfulness .        m a dog .  that   s a kind of wolf  sort of thing .  so   what   s your name  then .         go avay .         no offense meant .     ere  i heard tell wolves mate for life  right .         vell .         wish i could .      gaspode froze as the she wolf   s muzzle snapped an inch from his nose .      vere i come from  ve eat things like you     she said .      fair enough  fair enough     muttered gaspode  backing away .     i don   t know  you try to be friendly and this is what you get        nearer the fire  the humans were getting complicated .  gaspode slunk back and lay down .      you could have told me     carrot was saying .      it would   ve taken too long .  you always want to understand things .  anyway  it   s none of your business .  this is family .      carrot waved a hand toward the wolf .      he   s a relative .     he said .      no .  he   s a   friend .      gaspode   s ears waggled .  he thought  whoops        he   s very big for a wolf     said carrot slowly  as if filing new information .      he   s a very big wolf     said angua  shrugging .      another werewolf .         no .         just a wolf .         yes     said angua sarcastically     just a wolf .         and his name is    .         he would not object to being called gavin .         gavin .         he once ate someone called gavin .         what  all of him .         of course not .  just enough to make certain that the man set no more wolf traps .     angua smiled .     gavin is   quite unusual .      carrot looked at the wolf and smiled .  he picked up a piece of wood and tossed it gently toward him .  the wolf snapped it  doglike  out of the air .      i   m sure we will be friends     he said .   angua sighed .     wait .      gaspode  the unheeded spectator  watched as gavin  without taking his eyes off carrot  very slowly bit the wood in two .      carrot .     said angua  sweetly .     don   t do that again .  gavin isn   t even in the same clan as these wolves  and he took over the pack without anyone even whining .  he   s not a dog .  and he   s a killer  carrot .  oh  don   t look like that .  i don   t mean he pounces on wandering kids or eats up the odd grandmother .  i mean that if he thinks a human ought to die  that human is dead .  he will always  always fight .  he   s very uncomplicated like that .         he   s an old friend .     said carrot .      yes .         a   friend .         yes .     angua rolled her eyes and said  in a voice of singsong sarcasm     i was out in the woods one day and i fell into some old pit trap under the snow and some wolves found me and would have killed me but gavin turned up and faced them down .  don   t ask me why .  people do things sometimes .  so do wolves .  end of story .         gaspode said wolves and werewolves didn   t get on     said carrot patiently .      he   s right .  if gavin wasn   t here they   d have torn me to pieces .  i can look like a wolf  but i   m not a wolf .  i   m a werewolf .  i   m not a human  either .  i   m a werewolf .  get it .  you know some of the remarks people make .  well  wolves don   t make remarks .  they go for the throat .  wolves have got a very good sense of smell .  you can   t fool it .  i can pass for human  but i can   t pass for wolf .         i never thought of it like that   i mean  you would just think that wolves and werewolves           that   s how it is     sighed angua .      you said this was family     said carrot  as if working down a mental checklist .      i meant it   s personal .  gavin came all the way into ankh morpork to warn me .  he even slept on the timber wagons during the day so that he   d keep moving .  can you imagine how much nerve that took .  it   s got nothing to do with the watch .  it   s got nothing to do with you .      carrot looked around .  the snow was falling again  turning into rain above the fire .      i   m here now .         go away .  please .  i can sort this out .         and then you   ll come back to ankh morpork .  afterward .         i       angua hesitated .      i think i should stay     said carrot .      look  the city needs you     said angua .     you know vimes relies on           i   ve resigned .      for a moment  gaspode thought he could hear the sound of every settling snowflake .      not really .         yes .         and what did old stoneface say .         er  nothing .  he   d already left for uberwald .         vimes is coming to uberwald .         yes .  for the coronation .         he   s got mixed up in this .     said angua .      mixed up in what .         oh   my family   s been   stupid .  i   m not quite sure i know everything  but the wolves are worried .  when werewolves make trouble  it   s the real wolves that always suffer .  people   ll kill anything with fur .     angua stared at the fire for a moment and then said  with forced brightness     so who   s been left in charge .         i don   t know .  fred colon   s got seniority .         ha  yes .  in his nightmares .     angua hesitated .     you really left .         yes .         oh .      gaspode listened to some more snowflakes .      well  you won   t get far by yourselves now     said angua  standing up .     rest for another hour .  and then we   ll be going through the deep forest .  not too much snow there yet .  we   ve got a lot of ground to cover .  i hope you can keep up .         at breakfast early next morning vimes noticed that the other guests were keeping so far away from him that they were holding on to the walls .      the men who went out came back around midnight  sir     said cheery quietly .      did they catch anyone .         um   sort of  sir .  they found seven dead bodies .         seven .         they think some others might have got away where there   s a path up the rocks .         but   seven .  detritus got one  and   i got one  and a couple were wounded  and inigo got   one       vimes   s voice tailed off .   he stared at inigo skimmer  who was sitting on the other side of the room at a crowded public table .  the ones around vimes and lady sybil were deserted  sybil had put it down to deference .  the little man was eating soup in a little neat self contained world among the waving arms and intrusive elbows .  he   d even tucked a napkin under his chin .      they were   very dead  sir     cheery whispered .      well  that was   interesting     said sybil  wiping her mouth delicately .     i   ve never had soup with sausages in it for breakfast before .  what is it called  cheery .         fatsup  your ladyship     said cheery .     it means    fat soup .     we   re close to the shmaltzberg fat layers now  and   well  it   s nourishing and keeps out the cold .         how very   interesting .      lady sybil looked at her husband .  he hadn   t taken his eyes off inigo .   the door opened and detritus ducked inside  banging snow off his knuckles .      it   s not too bad     he said .     dey say it   d be a good idea to make an early start  sir .         i bet they do     said vimes  and thought  they don   t want someone like me hanging around  there   s no knowing who   ll die next .   several faces he vaguely recalled from last night were missing now .  presumably some travelers had started off even earlier  which meant that the news was probably running ahead of him .  he   d staggered in  covered in blood and mud  carrying a crossbow and  d   you know  when they went back to look there were seven dead men .  by the time that sort of story had gone ten miles he   d be carrying an ax as well  and make that thirty dead men and a dog .   the diplomatic career had certainly got off to a good start  eh .   as they got into the coach he saw the little dart stuck in the door jamb .  it was metallic  with metal fins  and had overall a look of speed  as if  when you touched it  you   d burn your fingers .   he walked around to the back of the coach .  there was another  much larger arrow high in the woodwork .      they tried to catch up with you on the upgrade     said inigo  behind him .      you killed them .         some got away .         i   m surprised .         i   ve only got one pair of hands  your grace .      vimes glanced up at the inn sign .  crudely painted on the boards was a large red head  complete with trunk and tusks .      this is the inn of the fifth elephant     said inigo .     you left the law behind when we passed lancre  your grace .  here it   s the lore .  what you keep is what you can .  what   s yours is what you fight for .  the fittest survive .         ankh morpork is pretty lawless  too  mister skimmer .         ankh morpork has many laws .  it   s just that people don   t obey them .  and that  your grace  is quite a different bowl of fat  mhm  mmm .      they set off in convoy .  detritus sat on the roof on the leading coach  which lacked a door and most of one side .  the view was flat and white  a featureless expanse of snow .   after a while they passed a clacks tower .  burn marks on one side of the stone base suggested that someone had thought that no news was good news  but the semaphore shutters were clacking and twinkling in the light .      the whole world is watching     said vimes .      but it   s never cared     said skimmer .     up until now .  and now it wants to rip the top off the country and take what   s underneath  mph  mhm .      ah  thought vimes  our killer clerk does have more than one emotion .      ankh morpork has always tried to get on well with other nations     said sybil .     well   these days  at least .         i don   t think we exactly try  dear     said vimes .     it   s just that we found that   why   re we stopping .      he pulled down the window .      what happening  sergeant .         waiting for dese dwarfs  sir     the troll called down .   several hundred dwarfs  four abreast  were trotting across the white plain toward them .  there was  vimes thought  something very determined about them .      detritus .         yessir .         try not to look too troll like  will you .      tryin    like hell  sir .      the column was abreast of them before someone barked the command to halt .  a dwarf detached himself from the rest and walked over to the coach .      ta   grdzk .     he bellowed .      would you like me to take care of this  your grace .     said inigo .      i   m the damn ambassador     said vimes .  he stepped down .      good morning  dwarf  indicating miscreant   i am overseer vimes of the look .      lady sybil heard inigo give a little groan .      krz .  gr   dazak yad .         hang on  hang on  i know this one   i am sure you are a dwarf of no convictions .  let us shake our business  dwarf  indicating miscreant  .         yes  that will just about do it  i think     said inigo .     mmm  mhm .      the senior dwarf had gone red in those areas of his face that could be seen behind the hair .  the rest of the squad were taking a renewed interest in the coach .   the leader took a deep breath .      d   kraha .      cheery dropped down from the coach .  her leather skirt flapped in the wind .   as one dwarf  the column swiveled to stare at her .  their leader went pop eyed .      b   dan .  k   raa .  d   kraga    ha   ak    .      vimes saw the expression that appeared on cheery   s small round face .   above him there was a clunk as detritus rested the loaded piecemaker on the edge of the coach .      i know dat word he said to her     he announced to the world .     it is not a good word .  i do not want to hear dat word again .         well  this is all very jolly  mph  mhm     said inigo  getting down .     and now if everyone will just relax for a moment we might get out of here alive  mmm .      vimes reached up and carefully pushed the end of detritus   s crossbow toward a less threatening direction .   inigo talked very fast in what seemed to vimes to be a torrent of perfect dwarfish  although he was sure he heard the occasional    mmm .     he opened his leather case and produced a couple of documents affixed with big waxy seals .  these were inspected with considerable suspicion .  the dwarf pointed at cheery and detritus .  inigo flapped a hand impatiently  the universal symbol for dismissing that which was not important .  more papers were examined .   eventually  with more universal body language meaning    i could do something bad to you but right now it   s just too much bother    the dwarf waved inigo away  gave vimes a look that suggested that  against all physical evidence  vimes was beneath him  and strode back to his troops .   an order was barked .  the dwarfs set off again  leaving the road and heading off toward the forest .      well  that all seems sorted out     said inigo  getting back into the coach .     miss littlebottom was a bit of a sticking point  but a dwarf does respect very complicated documents .  something   s up .  he wouldn   t say what it was .  he wanted to search the coach .         the hell with that .  what for .         who knows .  i persuaded him that we have diplomatic immunity .         and what did you tell him about me .         i tried to convince him that you were a bloody idiot  your grace .  mph  mhm .         oh really .     vimes heard lady sybil repress a laugh .      it was necessary  believe me .  street dwarfish wasn   t a good idea  your grace .  but when i pointed out that you were an aristocrat  he           i am not an   well  i   m not really a           yes  your grace .  but if you   ll be advised by me  a lot of diplomacy lies in appearing to be a lot more stupid than you are .  you   ve made a good start  your grace .  and now  i think we   d better be moving  mhm .         i   m glad to see you   re being less deferential  inigo     said vimes  as they got under way again .      oh well  your grace  i   ve gotten to know you better now .         gaspode had confused recollections of the rest of that night .  the pack moved fast  and he realized that most of them were running ahead of carrot  to flatten down the snow .   it wasn   t flat enough for gaspode .  eventually a wolf picked him up by the scruff of the neck and carried him bodily  while making muffled comments about the foul taste .   the snow stopped after a while and there was a slip of moonlight behind the clouds .   and all around  near and far  was the howl .  occasionally the pack would stop  in a clearing or on the crisp white brow of a hill  and join in .   gaspode limped to angua while the cries went up around them .      what   s this for .     he said .      politics     said angua .     negotiation .  we   re crossing territories .      gaspode glanced at gavin .  he hadn   t joined in the howl but sat a little way off  regally dividing his attention between carrot and the pack .      he has to ask permission .     he said .      he has to make sure they   ll let me through .         oh .  that   s giving him problems .         none that he can   t bite through .         oh .  er   is the howl saying anything about me .            small  horrible  smelly dog .            ah  right .      they set off again a few minutes later  down a long snow crusted slope in the moonlight toward the forest again  and gaspode saw shadows angling fast across the snowfield toward them .  for a moment he was flanked by two packs  the old and the new  and then their original escort dropped away .   so we   ve got a new honor guard  he thought  as he ran in the center of a wall of blurred gray legs .  wolves we haven   t met before .  i just hope the howl added    doesn   t taste nice .      then carrot fell over in the snow .  it was a moment before he pushed himself up again .   the wolves circled uncertainly  occasionally glancing at gavin .  gaspode caught up with carrot  jumping awkwardly through the snow .      you all right .         hard   to   run           i don   t want to  you know  worry you or anything     whined gaspode     but we   re not exactly among friends here  know what i mean .  our gavin isn   t going to win the prize of the wolf with the waggiest tail anywhere .         when did he last sleep .     angua demanded  pushing her way through the wolves .      dunno  really     said gaspode .     we   ve been moving pretty fast the last few days           no sleep  no food and no proper clothing     snarled angua .     idiot .      there was growling and whining from some of the wolves around gavin .  gaspode sat down by carrot   s head and watched as angua   argued .   he couldn   t speak pure wolf and  besides  gesture and body language played a far greater part than it did in canine .  but you didn   t have to be bright to see that things weren   t going well .  there was def   nitly a lot of atmosphere in the atmosphere .  and gaspode had a feeling that  if things went all pear shaped in a hurry  one small dog had all the survival chances of a chocolate kettle on a very hot stove .   there was a lot of whining and growling .  one wolf   gaspode mentally named him awkward   was not happy .  it looked as though a number of wolves were agreeing with him .  one of them bared its teeth at angua .   then gavin stood up .  he shook some snowflakes off his coat  looked around in an offhand fashion  and padded toward awkward .   gaspode felt every hair on his body stand on end .   the other wolves crouched back .  gavin ignored them .  when he was a few feet away from awkward  he put his head on one side and said    hrurrrm .      it was almost a pleasant noise .  but right down inside gaspode   s bones it bounced a harmonic which said  at this point  we could go two ways .  there is the easy way  and that is very easy .   you   ll never know about the hard way .   awkward held eye contact for a while  and then looked down .   gavin snarled something .  half a dozen of the wolves  led by angua  loped off toward the forest .   they returned twenty minutes later .  angua was human again   at least  gaspode corrected himself  human shaped   and the wolves were harnessed to a big dog sled .      borrowed it from a man in the village over the hill     she said  as it slid to a halt by carrot .      nice of him     said gaspode  and decided not to pursue the subject .     i   m surprised to see wolves in harness  though .         well  this was the easy way     said angua .   it   s odd  gaspode mused  as he lay in the sled alongside the slumbering carrot .  he was so int   rested when bum talked about the howl and how it could send messages right up into the mountains .  if i was a suspicious dog  i   d wonder if he knew that she   d come back for him if he was really in trouble  if he decided to gamble everything on it     he poked his head out from under the blanket .  snow stung his eyes .  running alongside the sled  only a few feet away from carrot  and glowing silver in the moonlight  was gavin .   this is me  thought gaspode  stuck between the humans and the wolves .  it   s a dog   s life .      this is the life  thought acting captain colon .  hardly any paperwork was coming up here now  and by dint of much effort he   d entirely cleared the backlog .  it was a lot quieter  too .   when vimes was here   and fred colon suddenly found himself thinking the word    vimes    without prefixing it with the word    mister      the main office was full of so much noise and bustle you could hardly hear yourself speak .  completely inefficient  that was .  how could anyone hope to get anything done .   he counted the sugar again .  twenty nine .  but he   d had two in his tea  so that was all right .  toughness was paying off .   colon went and opened his door a fraction so that he could just see down into the office .  it was amazing how you could catch them out that way .   quiet .  and neat  too .  every desk was clear .  much better than the mess you used to get .   he went back to the desk and counted the sugar lumps .   there were twenty seven .   ah ha .  someone was trying to drive him mad .  well  two could play at that game .   he counted the lumps again .   there were twenty six  and there was a knock at the door .   this caused it to swing inward  and colon to jump up in evil triumph .      ah ha .  burst in on me  eh .    oh        the    oh    was because the knocker was constable dorfl  the golem .  he was taller than the doorway and strong enough to tear a troll in half  he   d never done this  since he was an intensely moral being  but not even colon was going to pick an argument with someone who had glowing red holes where his eyes should be .  ordinary golems would not harm a human because they had magic words in their head that ordered them not to .  dorfl had no magic words  but he didn   t harm people because he   d decided that it wasn   t moral .  this left the worrying possibility that  given enough provocation  he might think again .   beside the golem was constable shoe  saluting smartly .      we   ve come to pick up the wages chitty  sir     he said .      the what .         the wages chitty  sir .  the monthly chitty  sir .  and then we take it to the palace and bring back the wages  sir .         i don   t know anything about that .         i put it on your desk yesterday  sir .  signed by lord vetinari  sir .      colon couldn   t hide the flicker in his eyes .  the black ash in the fireplace was  by now  overflowing .   shoe followed his gaze .      i haven   t seen any such thing     said colon  while the color drained from his face like a sucked popsicle .      i   m sure i did  sir     said constable shoe .     i wouldn   t forget a thing like that  sir .  in fact  i distinctly remember saying to constable visit     washpot  i   m just going to take this              look  you can see i   m a busy man .     snapped colon .     get one of the sergeants to sort it out .         there   s no sergeants left except sergeant flint  sir  and he spends all his time going around asking people what he should be doing     said constable shoe .     anyway  sir  it   s the senior officer who must sign the chitty        colon stood up  leaning on his knuckles  and shouted     oh  i    must     must i .  that   s a nerve and no mistake .     must     eh .  most of you lot are lucky anyone even gives you a job .  bunch of zombies and loonies and lawn ornaments and rocks .  i   ve had it up to here with you .      shoe leaned back out of range of the spittle .      then i am afraid i must take this up with the guild of watchmen  sir     he said .      guild of watchmen .  hah .  and since when has there been a guild of watchmen .         dunno .  what   s the time now .     said corporal nobbs  ambling into the room .     got to be a couple of hours  at least .  morning  captain .         what are you doing here  nobby .         that   s mister nobbs to you  captain .  and i   m president of the guild of watchmen  since you ask .         there   s no such bloody thing .         all legit  captain .  registered at the palace and everything .  amazin    how people rushed to join  too .     he pulled his grubby notebook .     got a few matters to take up with you  if you have a moment .  well  i say a few           i   m not putting up with this .     bellowed colon  his face crimson .     this is high treason .  you   re all sacked .  you   re all           we   re all on strike     said nobby  calm in the face .      you can   t go on strike while i   m sacking you .         our strike headquarters are in the back room of the bucket  on gleam street     said nobby .      here  that   s my boozer .  i forbid you to go on strike in my own pub .         we shall be there when you wish to talk terms .  come  brothers .  we are now officially in a dispute situation .      they marched out .      don   t bother to come back .     colon shouted after them .      bonk wasn   t what vimes had expected .  in fact he   d find it hard to say what he had expected  except that this wasn   t it .   it occupied a narrow valley with a white water river winding through it .  there were city walls .  they were not like those of ankh morpork  which had become at first a barrier to expansion and then a source of masonry for it .  these had an inside and an outside .   there were castles on the hills .  there were castles on most hills in these parts .  and there were high gates across the road .   detritus thumped on the side of the coach .  vimes stuck his head out .      dere   s guys in der road     said the troll .     dey got halibuts .      vimes looked out of the windows .  there were half a dozen guards  and they did indeed have halberds .      what are they after .     he said .      i expect they   ll also want to see our papers and make a search of the coaches     said inigo .      papers are one thing     said vimes  getting out of the coach     but no one is rummaging in our stuff .  i know that trick .  they   re not looking for anything  they just want to show us who   s boss .  you come along and do the translating .     he added     don   t worry  i   ll be diplomatic .      the two men barring the way did have helmets and they were holding weapons  but their uniforms did not conform to normal uniformity .  no guards  vimes thought  should be dressed in red  blue and yellow .  people would be able to see them coming .  vimes liked a uniform you could lurk in .   he pulled out his badge and held it up  advancing with an ingratiating smile .      just repeat this  mister skimmer     vimes raised his voice .     hello  fellow officer  as you can see i am commander v        a blade swung around .  if vimes hadn   t stopped  he   d have walked into it .   inigo stepped forward  leather case already open  one hand holding several impressive pieces of paper  mouth already framing some suitable sentences .  a guard took one of the pieces of paper and stared at it .      this is a studied insult     said inigo  contriving to speak out of the corner of his mouth while maintaining a smile .     someone wishes to see how you react  mmm  mhm .         them .         no .  we are being watched .      the paper was handed back .  there was a terse conversation .      the captain of the guard says there are special circumstances and he will search the coaches     said inigo .      no     said vimes  taking in the expression on the captain   s white face .     i know when people are playing silly buggers     cos i   ve done it myself .      he pointed to the door of his coach .      see this .     he said .     tell him this is an ankh morpork crest .  and this is an ankh morpork coach  property of ankh morpork .  if they lay hands on it  that will constitute an act of war against ankh morpork .  tell him that .      he saw the man lick his lips nervously as inigo translated .  poor sod  he thought .  he didn   t ask for this .  he was probably expecting a quiet day on the gate .  but someone gave him some orders .   inigo said     he says he   s very sorry  but those are his instructions  and he quite understands if his grace wishes to make a complaint at the highest level  mmm  mhm .      a guard turned the handle of the coach door .  vimes slammed it shut .      tell him the war will start right now     he said .     and then it   ll work its way up .         your grace .      the guards looked at detritus .  it was quite hard to hold the piecemaker nonchalantly  and he wasn   t even making the attempt .   vimes maintained eye contact with the captain of the guard .  if the man had any sense  he   d realize that if detritus fired the thing it   d kill them all  besides sending the coach backward at high speed .   please just let him have the sense to know when to fold  he prayed .   out of the corner of his ear  he could hear the guards whispering to one another .  he caught the word    wilinus .      the captain stepped back and saluted .      he apologizes for any inconvenience and hopes you will enjoy your stay in his beautiful city     said inigo .     he particularly hopes you will visit the chocolate museum in prince vodorny square  where his sister works .      vimes saluted .      tell him i think he is an officer with a great future     said vimes .     a future which  i trust  is going to very soon include opening the damn gates .      the captain had nodded to the men before inigo was halfway through the translation .  aha        and ask him his name     he said .  the man was bright enough not to respond until this had been translated .      captain tantony     inigo said .      i shall remember it     said vimes .     oh   and tell him he has a fly on his nose .      tantony won a prize .  his eyes barely flickered .  vimes grinned .   as for the town itself   it was just a town .  roofs were steeper than in ankh morpork  some maniac with a fretsaw had been allowed to amuse himself on the wooden architecture  and there was more paint than you saw back home .  not that this told you anything  many a rich man had become rich by  metaphorically  not painting his house .   the coaches bowled over the cobbles .  not the right sort of cobbles  of course .  vimes knew that .   the coach stopped again .  vimes stuck his head out of the window .  two rather scruffier guards had barred the road this time .      ah  i recognize this one     said vimes grimly .     i reckon that this time we   ve just met colonesque and nobbski .      he stepped out and walked up to them .      well .      the fatter of the two hesitated  and then held out his hand .      pisspot     he said .      inigo .     said vimes quietly  without turning his head .      ah     said inigo  after some muttered exchanges .     now the problem seems to be sergeant detritus .  no trolls are allowed in this part of town during the hours of daylight  apparently  without a passport signed by their   owner .  uh   in bonk the only trolls allowed are prisoners of war .  they have to carry identification .         detritus is a citizen of ankh morpork and my sergeant     said vimes .      however  he is a troll .  perhaps in the interests of diplomacy you could write a short           do i need a pisspot .         a passport   no  your grace .         then he doesn   t  either .         nevertheless  your grace           there is no nevertheless .         but it may be advisable to           there   s no advisable  either .      a few other guards had drifted over .  vimes was aware of watching eyes .      he could be ejected by force     said inigo .      now there   s an experiment i wouldn   t want to miss     said vimes .   detritus made a rumbling noise .     i don   t mind goin    back if           shut up  sergeant .  you   re a free troll .  that   s an order .      vimes permitted himself another brief scan of the growing  silent crowd .  and he saw the fear in the eyes of the men with the halberds .  they did not want to be doing this  any more than the captain had .      i   ll tell you what  inigo     he said     tell the   guards that the ambassador from ankh morpork commends them for their diligence  congratulates them on their dress sense  and will see that their instruction is obeyed forthwith .  that should do it  shouldn   t it .         certainly  your grace .         and now turn the coach around  detritus .  coming  inigo .      inigo   s expression changed rapidly .      we passed an inn about ten miles back     vimes went on .     ought to make it by dark  do you think .         but you can   t go  your grace .      vimes turned  very slowly .      would you repeat that  mister skimmer .         i mean           we are leaving  mister skimmer .  what you do  of course  is up to you .      he sat down inside the coach .  opposite him  sybil made a fist and said    well done .         sorry  dear     said vimes  as the coach turned .     it didn   t look like a very good inn .         serves them right  the little bullies     said sybil .     you showed them .      vimes glanced out and saw  at the edge of the crowd  a black coach with dark windows .  he could make out a figure in the gloom within .  the luckless guards were looking at it  as if for instructions .  it waved a gloved hand languidly .   he started counting under his breath .   after eleven seconds inigo trotted alongside the coach and jumped onto the running board .      your grace  apparently the guards acted quite without authority and will be punished           no they didn   t .  i was looking at    em .  they   d been given an order     said vimes .      nevertheless  diplomatically it would be a good idea to accept the explan           so that the poor buggers can be hung up by their thumbs .     said vimes .     no .  just you go back and tell whoever   s giving the orders that all our people can go anywhere they like in this city  d   you see  whatever shape they are .         i don   t think you can actually demand that  sir           those lads had old burleigh and stronginthearm weapons  mister skimmer .  made in ankh morpork .  so did the men on the gate .  trade  mister skimmer .  isn   t that part of what diplomacy is all about .  you go back and talk to whoever   s in the black carriage  and then you   d better get them to lend you a horse  because i reckon we   ll have gone a little way by then .         you could perhaps wait           wouldn   t dream of it .      in fact the coach was outside the gates of the town before skimmer caught it up again .      there will not be a problem with either of your requests     he panted  and for a moment there appeared to be a touch of admiration in his expression .      good man .  tell detritus to turn around again  will you .         you   re grinning  sam     said sybil  as vimes sat back .      i was just thinking that i could take to the diplomatic life     said vimes .      there is something else     said inigo  getting into the coach .     there   s some   historical artifact owned by the dwarfs  and there   s a rumor           how long ago was the scone of stone stolen .      inigo   s mouth stayed open .  then he shut his mouth and his eyes narrowed .      how in the world did you know that  your grace .  mmm .         by the pricking of my thumbs     said vimes  his face carefully blank .     i   ve got very odd thumbs  when it comes to pricking .         really .         oh yes .         dogs had a much easier sex life than humans  gaspode decided .  that was something to look forward to  if he ever managed to have one .   it wasn   t going to start here  that was definite .  the female wolves snapped at him if he came too close  and they weren   t just warnings  either .  he was having to be very careful where he trod .   the really odd thing about human sex  though  was the way it went on even when people were fully clothed and sitting on opposite sides of a fire .  it was in the things they said and did not say  the way they looked at one another and looked away .   the packs had changed again  overnight .  the mountains were higher  the snow was crisper .  most of the wolves were sitting at some distance from the fire that carrot had made   just enough distance  in fact  to establish that they were proud wild creatures that didn   t have to rely on this sort of thing but close enough to get the benefit .   and then there was gavin  sitting a little way off  turning to look from one to the other .      gavin   s people hate my family     angua was saying .     i told you  it   s always wolves who suffer when werewolves get too powerful .  werewolves are smarter at escaping hunters .  that   s why wolves much prefer vampires .  vampires leave them alone .  werewolves sometimes hunt wolves .         i   m surprised     said carrot .   angua shrugged .     why .  they hunt humans  don   t they .  we   re not nice people  carrot .  we   re all pretty dreadful .  but my brother wolfgang is something special .  father   s frightened of him and so   s mother if she   d only admit it  but she thinks he   ll make the clan powerful  so she indulges him .  he drove my other brother away and he killed my sister .         how    .         he said it was an accident .  poor little elsa .  she was a yennork  just like andrei .  that   s a werewolf that doesn   t change  you know .  i   m sure i   ve mentioned it .  our family throws them up from time to time .  wolfgang and i were the only classic bi morphs in the litter .  elsa looked human all the time  even at full moon .  andrei was always a wolf .         you mean you had a human sister and a wolf brother .         no  carrot .  they were both werewolves .  but the  well  the little   switch   inside them didn   t work .  do you understand .  they always stayed the same shape .  in the old days  the clan would kill off a yennork quickly  and wolfgang is a traditionalist when it comes to nastiness .  he says they made the blood impure .  you see  a yennork would go off and be a human or be a wolf but they   d still be carrying the werewolf   blood  and then they   d marry and have children   or pups   and  well  that   s where the fairytale monsters come from .  people with a bit of wolf and wolves with that extra capacity for violence that is so very human .     she sighed  and glanced momentarily at gavin .     but elsa was harmless .  after that  andrei didn   t wait for it to happen to him .  he   s a sheepdog over in borogravia now .  doing well  i hear .  wins championships     she added sourly .   she poked the fire aimlessly .      wolfgang   s got to be stopped .  he   s plotting something with some of the dwarfs .  they meet in the forest  gavin says .         he sounds very well informed for a wolf     said carrot .  angua almost snarled at him .      he   s not stupid  you know .  he can understand more than eight hundred words .  a lot of humans get by on less .  and he   s got a sense of smell that   s almost as good as mine .  the wolves see everything .  the werewolves are out all the time now .  they   re chasing people down   the game  we call it .  the wolves get the blame .  it looks like they   re breaking the arrangement .  and there   s been these meetings  right out in the forest where they think no one will see them .  some dwarfs have got some sort of nasty scheme  by the sound of it .  they asked wolfgang for help .  that   s like asking a vulture to pick your teeth .         what can you do .     said carrot .     if even your parents can   t control him           we used to fight when we were younger .     rough and tumble     he   d call it .  but i could send him off howling .  wolfgang hates to think there   s anyone who can beat him  so i don   t think he   ll relish the thought of me turning up .  he   s got plans .  this part of uberwald has always  well  worked because no one was too powerful  but if the dwarfs start squabbling among themselves then wolfgang   s the lad to take advantage  with his stupid uniforms and his stupid flag .         i don   t think i want to see you fighting  though .         then you can look the other way .  i didn   t ask you to follow me .  do you think i   m proud of this .  i   ve got a brother who   s a sheepdog .         a champion sheepdog     said carrot earnestly .   gaspode watched angua   s expression .  it was one you   d never get on a dog .      you mean that     she said at last .     you actually mean that  don   t you   you really do .  and if you   d met him it wouldn   t worry you  would it .  to you everyone   s a person .  i have to sleep in a dog basket seven nights a month and that doesn   t worry you either  does it .         no .  you know it doesn   t .         it should .  don   t ask me why  but it should .  you   re so   unthinkingly nice about it .  and sooner or later a girl can have too much nice .         i don   t try to be nice           i know .  i know .  i just wish you   d   oh  i don   t know   complain a bit .  well  not exactly complain .  just sigh  or something .         why .         because   oh  because it   d make me feel better .  oh  it   s too hard to explain .  it   s probably a werewolf thing .         i   m sorry           and don   t be sorry all the time  either .      gaspode curled up so close to the fire that he steamed .  dogs had it down a lot better  he decided .      the building that was to be the embassy was set back from the road on a quiet side street .  they rattled under an arch into a small rear courtyard containing some stables .  it reminded vimes of a large coaching inn .      it   s really only a consulate at the moment     said inigo  leafing through his papers .     we should be met by   ah  yes  wando sleeps .  been here for several years  mhm .      behind the coaches a pair of gates were swung shut .  there was the sound of heavy bolts shooting home .  vimes stared at the apparition that came limping back toward the coach door .      he looks it     he said .      oh  i don   t think this is           good evening  marthterth  mithtreth       said the figure .     welcome to ankh morpork .  i   m igor .         igor who .     said inigo .      jutht igor  thir .  alwayth   jutht igor     said igor calmly  unfolding the step .     i   m the odd job man .         you don   t say .     said vimes  mesmerized .      have you had a terrible accident .     said lady sybil .      i did thpill tea down my thirt thith morning     said igor .     kind of you to notice .         where   s mister sleeps .     said inigo .      i   m afraid marthter thleeps ith nowhere to be found .  i wath rather hoping you would know what   d happened to him .         us .     said inigo .     mhm  mmm .  we assumed he was here .         he left rather urgently two weeks ago     said igor .     he did not vouchthafe to me where he wath going .  do go inthide  and i will thee to the baggage .      vimes glanced up .  a little bit of snow was falling now  but there was enough light to see that  across the whole courtyard  was an iron mesh .  with the bolted doors and the walls of the building all around  they were in a cage .      jutht a little leftover from the old dayth     said igor cheerfully .     nothing to worry about  thir .         what a fine figure of a man     said sybil weakly  as they stepped inside .      more than one man  by the look of him .         sam .         sorry .  i   m sure his heart   s in the right place .         good .         or someone   s heart  anyway .         sam  really .         all right  all right  but you must admit he does look a bit   odd .         none of us can help the way we   re made  sam .         he looks as if he tried   good grief           oh dear     said lady sybil .   vimes was not against hunting  if only because ankh morpork seldom offered any better game than the large rats you got along the waterfront .  but the sight of the walls of the new embassy might have been enough to make the keenest hunter take a step back and cry    oh  i say  hold on        the previous occupant had been keen on hunting  shooting and fishing and  to have covered every single wall with the resultant trophies  he must have been doing all three at the same time .   hundreds of glass eyes  obscenely alive in the light of the fire in the huge hearth  stared down at vimes .      it   s just like my grandfather   s study     said lady sybil .     there was a stag   s head in there that used to frighten the life out of me .         there   s just about everything here   oh no           my gods       whispered lady sybil .   vimes looked around desperately .  detritus was just entering  carrying some of the trunks .      stand in front of it     vimes hissed .      i   m not that tall  sam .  or that wide .      the troll looked up at them  then at the trophies  and then grinned .  it   s colder up here  vimes thought .  he   s quicker on the uptake .   even nobby won   t play poker with him in the winter .  damn .      something wrong .     said detritus .   vimes sighed .  what was the point .  he   d spot it sooner or later .      i   m sorry about this  detritus     he said  standing aside .   detritus looked at the horrible trophy and nodded .      yeah  dere used to be a lot of dat sort of fing in der old days     he said calmly  putting down the luggage .     dey wouldn   t be de real diamond teef  o   course .  dey   d take dem out and put bigger glass ones in .         you don   t mind .     said lady sybil .     it   s a troll   s head .  someone actually mounted a troll   s head and put it on the wall .         ain   t mine     said detritus .      but it   s so horrible .      detritus stood in thought for a moment  and then opened the stained wooden box that contained all he had felt it necessary to bring .      dis is de old country  after all     he said .     so if it   d made you feel better        he pulled out a smaller box and rummaged among what appeared to be bits of rock and cloth until he found something yellowy brown and round  like a shallow cup .      should   ve bunged it away     he said     but it   s all i got to remember my old granny by .  she kept fings in it .         it   s a bit of human skull  isn   t it     said vimes  at last .      yep .         whose .         anyone ask dat troll dere his name .     said detritus  and the glint in his eye had a brittle edge to it for a moment .  then he carefully put the bowl away .     tings were diff   rent in dem days .  now you don   t chop our heads off an    we don   t make drums outa your skin .  everyt   ing is hunky dory .  dat   s all we have to know .      he picked up the boxes again and followed lady sybil toward the staircase .  vimes took another look at the trophy head .  the teeth were longer  far longer than they   d be on a real troll .  a hunter   d have to be very brave and very lucky to go up against a fighting troll and survive .  it   d be so much easier to go after an old one and later replace the ground down stumps with sparkly fangs .   my gods  the things we do        igor .     he said  as the odd job man lurched past under the weight of two more bags .      yeth  your exthelenthy .         i   m an excellency .     said vimes to inigo .      yes  your grace .         and still my grace as well .         yes  your grace .  you are his grace his excellency the duke of ankh morpork  commander sir samuel vimes  your grace .         hang on  hang on   his grace cancels out the sir  i know that .  it   s like having an ace in poker .         strictly speaking this is true  your grace  but great score is set by titles here and it is best to play with a full deck  mmm .         i was once blackboard monitor at school     said vimes sharply .     for a whole term .  would that help .  dame venting said no one could clean a blackboard like me .         a useful fact  your grace  which may possibly be helpful in the event of a tie breaker  mmm  mhm     said inigo  his face carefully blank .      we igorth have alwayth preferred    marthter        said igor .     what wath it you were requiring .      vimes gestured toward the heads that covered every wall .      i want them taken down as soon as possible .  i can do this  can   t i  mister skimmer .         you are the ambassador  sir .  mmm  mmm .         well  they   re coming down .  all of them .      igor gave the camphor smelling multitude a worried look .      even the thwordfith .         even the swordfish     said vimes firmly .      and the thnow leopardth .         both of them  yes .         what about the troll .         especially the troll .  see to it .      igor could have been said to have looked as if his world had fallen down around his ears were it not for the fact that he already looked as if this had happened .      what do you want to do with them  mathter .         that   s up to you .  throw them in the river  maybe .  ask detritus about the troll   maybe it should be buried  or something .  is there any supper .         there   th walago   noggi     sclot     swinefletht and thauthageth     said igor  still clearly upset about the trophies .     i   ll thop tomorrow  if her ladythip giveth me inshtructionth .         is swineflesh the same as pork .     said vimes .  people in drought stricken areas would have paid good money to have igor pronounce    sausages .         yes     said inigo .      and what   s in the sausages .         er   meat .     said igor  looking as though he was ready to run .      good .  we   ll give them a try .      vimes went upstairs and followed the sound of conversation until he reached a bedroom  where sybil was laying clothes on a bed the size of a small country .  cheery was assisting her .   the walls were carved panels of wood .  the bed was carved panels of wood .  the mad fretworker of bonk had been hard at work here  too .  only the floors weren   t wood  they were stone  and radiated cold .      it   s a bit like the inside of a cuckoo clock  isn   t it     said sybil .     cheery has volunteered to be my lady   s maid for now .      cheery saluted .      why not .     said vimes .  after a day like this  a lady   s maid with a long flowing beard now seemed perfectly normal .      the floors are a bit chilly  though .  tomorrow i shall measure up for some carpets     said sybil firmly .     i know we won   t be here long  but we ought to leave something for the next people .         yes  dear .  that would be a good idea .         there   s a bathroom through there     said sybil  nodding .     there   s hot springs near here  apparently .  they pipe them in .  you   ll feel better for a hot bath .      ten minutes later vimes was happy to agree .  the water was a funny color and smelled a little of what he would politely call bad eggs  but it was good and hot and he could feel it drawing the tension out of his muscles .   a distressing scent of secondhand baked beans sloshed around him as he lay back .  at the other end of the huge bath  the lump of pumice stone that he   d been using to rasp the dead skin off his feet banged against the side .  vimes watched it  unseeing  while he filed the thoughts of the day .   things were starting to smell  just like the bathwater .  the scone of stone had been stolen  had it .  now there was a coincidence .   it had been a complete shot in the dark .  but lately he was on the lucky side when it came to nocturnal targets .  someone had pinched the replica scone  and now the real one had gone missing  and someone in ankh morpork who was good at making rubber molds had been found dead .  you didn   t need the brains of detritus in a snowdrift to suspect a connection .   a recollection nagged at him .  someone had said something and he   d thought it odd at the time but then something else had happened and it had gone out of his mind .  something about   a welcome to bonk .  only     well  he was here .  no doubt about that .   absolute confirmation of the fact was brought forth half an hour later  at supper .   vimes cut into a sausage  and stared .      what is in these .  all this   pink stuff .     he demanded .      er   that   s the meat  your grace     said inigo  on the other side of the table .      well  where   s the texture .  where   s the white bits and the yellow bits and those green bits you always hope are herbs .         to a connoisseur here  your grace  an ankh morpork sausage would not be considered a sausage  mph  mhm .         oh really .  so what would he call it .         a loaf  your grace .  or possibly a log .  here  a butcher can be hanged if his sausages are not all meat  and at that it must be from a named domesticated animal  and i perhaps should add that by name i mean that it should not have been called    spot    or    ginger     mmm  mmm .  i   m sure that if your grace would prefer the more genuine ankh morpork taste  igor could make up some side dishes of stale bread and sawdust .         thank you for that patriotic comment     said vimes .     however  these are   okay  i suppose .  they just came as a bit of a shock  that   s all .  no .      he put his hand over his mug to prevent igor from filling it with beer .      ith there thomething wrong  marthter .         just water  please     said vimes .     no beer .         the marthster doth not drink   beer .         no .  and perhaps in a mug without a face on it .     he took another look at the stein .     why   s it got a lid  by the way .  are you afraid of the rain getting in .         i   ve never been quite certain of that one     said inigo  as igor shuffled off .     from observation  though  i believe the purpose of the stein is to stop the beer being spilled while using the mug to conduct the singing  mmm  mmm .         ah  the old quaffing problem     said vimes .     what a clever idea .      sybil patted him on the knee .      you   re not in ankh morpork anymore  dear     she said .      now we   re alone  your grace     said inigo  leaning closer     i   m very worried about mister sleeps .  the acting consul  you remember .  he seems to have vanished  mmm  mmm .  some of his personal items have gone  too .         holiday .         not at a time like this  sir .  and        there was a thud of wood against wood as igor reentered  pointedly carrying a stepladder .  inigo sat back .   vimes found that he was yawning .      we   d better talk about that in the morning     he said  as the ladder was dragged toward the horrible hunting trophies .     it   s been a long day  what with one thing and another .         of course  your grace .      the bed   s mattress was so soft that vimes sank into it nervously  afraid it might close over the top of his head .  that was just as well  because the pillow was   well  everyone knew a pillow was a sack full of feathers  didn   t they .  not an apprentice eiderdown like this thing .      just fold it up  sam     said sybil  from the depths of the mattress .     g   night .         g   night .         sam    .      there was a snore from sam vimes .  sybil sighed  and turned over .   vimes awoke a few times  when there were two thuds from downstairs .      snow leopards     he muttered  and drifted away again .   there was a louder crash .      moose     murmured lady sybil .      elk .     mumbled vimes .      def   nitly moose .      some time later there was a muffled scream  a thud  and a sound very much like the sound made when a huge wooden ruler is held against a desk and twanged .      swordfish     said sam and sybil together  and went back to sleep .         you should present your credentials to the rulers of bonk     said inigo in the morning .   vimes was looking out of the window .  two guards in the rainbow colored uniforms were standing stiffly to attention outside the embassy .      what   re they doing here .     he said .      guarding     said inigo .      guarding who from what .         just generally guarding  mmm .  i suppose it   s thought that guards give such a finished look to an important building .         what was that you said about credentials .         they   re just formal letters from lord vetinari  confirming your appointment .  mph  mmm   the lore is a little complex  but at the moment the order of precedence is the future low king  the lady margolotta and the baron von uberwald .  each  of course  will pretend that you are not calling on the other two .  it   s called the arrangement .  it   s an awkward system but it keeps the peace .         if i understood your briefing     said vimes  still watching the guards     in the days of imperial uberwald the whole bloody show was run by the werewolves and the vampires and everyone else was lunch .         somewhat simplistic but broadly true  mmm     said inigo  brushing some dust off vimes   s shoulder .      and then it all broke up and the dwarfs became powerful because there   s dwarfs from one end of uberwald to the other and they all keep in touch           their system certainly survives political upheaval  yes .         and then   what was it .  a diet of beetles .         the diet of bugs  mmm .  diet being an uberwaldean word for meeting  and bugs being an important town further up river  famous for its pastries made from flax .  everyone came to an   arrangement .  no one would wage war on any of the others  and everyone could live in peace .  no garlic to be grown  no silver to be mined .  and the werewolves and vampires promised that those things wouldn   t be needed .  mmm  mmm .         seems a bit trusting     said vimes .      it appears to have worked  mhm .         what did the humans think about it all .         well  humans have always been a bit of background noise in the history of uberwald  your grace .         it must be a bit dull for the undead  though .         oh  the bright ones know the old days can   t come back .         ah  well   that   s always the trick  isn   t it .  finding the bright ones .     vimes put on his helmet .     and what   re the dwarfs like .         the future low king is considered pretty clever  your grace .  mhm .         how does he stand on ankh morpork .         he can take ankh morpork or leave it alone  your grace .  on balance  i believe he doesn   t much like us .         i thought it was albrecht that didn   t like us .         no  your grace .  albrecht is the one who would be happy to see ankh morpork burned to the ground .  rhys merely wishes we didn   t exist .         i thought he was one of the good guys .         your grace  i did hear you express some negative sentiments about ankh morpork on the way here  mhm  mhm .         yes  but i live there .  i   m allowed to .  that   s patriotic .         across the whole of the world  your grace  there inexplicably appear to be definitions of  mmm  mhm     good guy    which do not automatically mean    likes ankh morpork .     you will find out  i daresay .  the other two are a lot easier to deal with .  it may have been the lady margolotta who tried the little trick with the guards last night .  she was the one who got me to bring you back  anyway .  she has invited you for drinks .         oh .         she   s a vampire  mmm  mmm .         what .      inigo sighed .      your grace  i thought you understood .  vampires are simply part of uberwald .  this is where they belong .  i   m afraid this is something you will have to come to terms with .  i understand that now they   obtain blood by arrangement .  some people are   impressed by a title  your grace .         good grief           quite so .  in any case  you will be safe .  remember your diplomatic immunity  mmm  mhm .         i didn   t quite see that working in the wilinus pass the other day .         oh  they were common bandits .         really .  has your man sleeps turned up .  haven   t you taken this to the watch here .         there   s no watch here  as you understand the term .  you saw them .  they   re   gate guards  enforcers for the city rulers  mhm  mmm  not officers of the law .  but   inquiries are being made .         does sybil come with me for this bit .     said vimes  and thought  we were guards like that  not so long ago        it is usually done by the new ambassador and his guards .         well  detritus is staying here to keep an eye on her  all right .  she said this morning she really thinks this place would be better for some decent carpet  and there   s no stopping her when she   s in a tape measure mood .  i   ll take cheery and one of the lads from outside  for the look of the thing .  i assume you   re coming .         i won   t be required  sir .  mmm .  the new coachman knows the way  morporkian is the diplomatic language  after all  and   i shall be making inquiries .         delicate ones .         indeed  your grace .         if he   s been killed  won   t that be an act of war .         yes and no  your grace .         what .  sleeps was   is our man .      inigo looked awkward .     it would depend on   exactly where he was and what he was doing        vimes gave him a blank look  and then the penny dropped and operated his brain .      spying .         acquiring information .  everyone does it  mm  mmm .         yes  but if you find a diplomat going too far you just sent him home with a sharp note  don   t you .         around the circle sea  your grace  that is the case .  here   they may have a different approach           something rather sharper than a note .         exactly .  mmm .      captain tantony was one of the guards .  there was some minor difficulty  but the argument that  since he was guarding vimes  he might as well be where vimes was  eventually carried some weight .  tantony had the look of an agonizingly logical man .   he kept giving vimes curious looks as the coach rattled out of the town .  beside him  cheery sat with her legs dangling .  vimes noticed  although it was not the kind of thing he generally made a habit of noticing  that the shape of her breastplate had been subtly altered  probably by the same armorer that angua went to  to indicate that the chest underneath it was not quite the same shape of chest that you got under the armor of  say  corporal nobbs  although of course probably no one had a chest the same shape as that of corporal nobbs .   she was wearing her high heeled iron boots  too .      look  you don   t have to come     he said out loud .      yes  i do .         i mean i could go and get detritus instead .  although i suppose there   d be even more upshot if i took a troll into a dwarf mine   i mean  rather than a   a              girl     said cheery helpfully .      er   yes .     vimes felt the coach slow to a halt  even though they hadn   t left the town yet  and he looked out .   in front of them  across a small square  was a fort of sorts  but with much larger gates than you   d expect for its size .  as vimes stared at them  they were swung open from within .   inside  there was a slope .  all the fort consisted of was four walls around a large  sloping tunnel .      the dwarfs live underneath the town .     he said  as the light from outside was gradually replaced by the infrequent glow of torches .  but they clearly showed the coach was rattling past a long  long line of stationary carts .  the pools of light revealed horses  and drivers talking in groups .      under quite a lot of uberwald     said cheery .     this is just the nearest entrance  sir .  we   ll probably have to stop in a minute  because the horses don   t like   ah .      the coach stopped again  and the coachman banged on the side to indicate that this was the end of the line .  the queue of carts wound off down another tunnel  but the coach had stopped in a small cave with a big door .  a couple of dwarfs were waiting there .  they had axes slung across their backs  although by dwarf standards this counted merely as    politely dressed    rather than    heavily armed .     their attitude  however  was in the international language of people guarding gates everywhere .      commander sam vimes  ankh morpork ci   ambassador from ankh morpork     said vimes  handing one of them his papers .  at least it was not hard to assume a lofty air with dwarfs .   to his surprise  the document was read thoroughly  one dwarf looking over the other one   s shoulder and pointing out interesting subclauses .  the official seal was carefully examined .   one guard pointed to cheery .      kra   k .         my official guard     said vimes .     included in    associated members of staff    on page two     he added helpfully .      mhust searhch thy coash     said the guard .      no .  diplomatic immunity     said vimes .     tell    em  cheery .      they listened to cheery   s urgent dwarfish .  then the other guard  whose face had indicated that there was something on his mind and it was jumping up and down  nudged his companion and pulled him aside .   there was a torrent of whispers .  vimes couldn   t understand  but he caught the word    wilinus .     and  shortly afterward  the word    hr   grag     dwarfish for    thirty .         oh gods     he said .     and a dog .         good guess  sir     said cheery .   the document was handed back  hurriedly .  vimes could read the body language  even written smaller than usual   there was probably an expensive problem here  so the guards were inclined to leave it to someone who earned more money than they did .   one of them pulled a bellpull by the door .  after some time  the door slid open  revealing a small room .      we have to go in  sir     said cheery .      but there   s no other doors .         it   s all right  sir .      vimes stepped inside .  the dwarfs slid the door back  leaving them in the room lit only by one candle .      some kind of waiting room .     said vimes .   somewhere far off  something went clonk .  the floor trembled for a moment  and then vimes has an uneasy sensation of movement .      the room moves .     he said .      yes  sir .  several hundred feet down  probably .  i think it   s all done by counterweights .      they stood silently  unsure of what to say  as walls around them creaked and groaned .  then there was a rattle  a passing sensation of weight  and the room stopped moving .      wherever we   re headed  keep your ears open     said vimes .     something   s going on  i can feel it        the door slid back .   vimes looked out onto the night sky  underground .  the stars were all around him   below him        i think we went down   too far     he said .  and then his brain made sense of what his eyes had seen .  the moving room had brought them out somewhere on the side of a huge cave .  he was looking at a thousand points of candlelight  spread out on the cavern floor and in other galleries .  now that he could grasp the scale of things  he realized that many of them were moving .   the air was full of one huge sound made up of thousands of voices  echoed and re echoing .  occasionally a shout or a laugh would stand out  but mostly it was just an endless sea of sound  beating on the shores of the eardrum .      i thought you people lived in little mines     said vimes .      well  i thought humans lived in little cottages  sir     said cheery  taking a candle from a large rack beside the door and lighting it .     and then i saw ankh morpork .      there was something recognizable about the way the lights were moving .  a whole constellation of them was heading in toward one invisible wall  where reflected light now indicated  very faintly  the mouth of a large tunnel .  in front of it was a row of lights .   think of it as a lot of people heading for something which one row of people was   guarding .      people down there aren   t happy     said vimes .     that looks like a mob to me .  look  you can tell by the way they move           commander vimes .      he turned .  in the gloom he could make out several dwarfs  each with a candle fixed to his helmet .  in front of them was  presumably  another dwarf .   he   d seen clothes like this in ankh morpork  but always scurrying away .  this was   a deep down dwarf .   it was wearing some sort of robe made of overlapping leather plates .  instead of the small round iron helmet which vimes had always thought dwarfs were born with  it had a pointed leather hat with more leather flaps all around it .  the one at the front had been tied up  to allow the wearer to look out at the world  or at least that part of it that was underground .  the general effect was of a mobile cone .      er   yes  that   s me     said vimes .      welcome to shmaltzberg  your excellency .  i am the king   s jar   ahk   haga  which in your language you would call        but vimes   s lips had been moving fast as he tried to translate .      ideas   taster .     he said .      hah .  that would be a way of putting it  yes .  my name   is dee .  would you care to follow me .  this should not take long .      the figure swept away .  one of the other dwarfs prodded vimes very gently  indicating that he should follow .   the sound from far below redoubled .  someone was yelling .      is there some problem .     said vimes  catching up with the fast moving dee .      we have no problems .      ah  he   s already lied to me  thought vimes .  we   re being diplomatic .   vimes trailed after the dwarf through more caves .  or tunnels   it was hard to tell  because in the darkness vimes could only rely on a sense of the space around him .  occasionally they passed the lighted entrance to another cave or tunnel .  several guards  with candles on their helmets  stood at each one .   the well honed copper   s radar was beeping at him continuously .  something bad was going on .  he could smell the tension  the sense of quiet panic .  the air was thick with it .  occasionally other dwarfs scuttled past  distracted  on some mission .  something very bad .  people didn   t know what to do next  so they were trying to do everything .  and  in the middle of this  important officials had to stop what they were doing because some idiot from some distant city had to hand over a piece of paper .   eventually a door opened in the darkness .  it led into a large  roughly oblong cave that  with its book lined walls and paper strewn tables  had the look of an office about it .      do be seated  commander .      a match burst into life .  one candle was lit  all lost and alone in the dark .      we try to make guests feel welcome     said dee  scuttling behind his desk .  he pulled off his pointed hat and  to vimes   s amazement  put on a pair of thick smoked glasses .      you had papers .     he said .  vimes handed them over .      it says here    his grace        the dwarf said  after reading them for a while .      yes  that   s me .         and there   s a sir .         that   s me  too .         and an excellency .            fraid so .     vimes narrowed his eyes .     i was blackboard monitor for a while  too .      there was the sound of angry voices from behind a door at the far end of the room .      what does a blackboard monitor do .     said dee  raising his voice .      what .  er   i had to clean the blackboard after lessons .      the dwarf nodded .  the voices grew louder  more intense .  dwarfish was such a good language to be annoyed in .      erasing the teachings when they were learned .     said dee  shouting to be heard .      er   yes .         a task only given to the trustworthy .         could be  yes .      dee folded up the letter and handed it back  glancing briefly at cheery .      well  these seem to be in order     he said .     would you care for a drink before you go .         sorry .  i thought i had to present myself to your king .     the swearing from the other side of the door was threatening to burn through the woodwork .      oh  that won   t be necessary     said dee .     at the moment he should not be bothered with              trivial matters .     said vimes .     i thought it was how the thing ought to be done .  i thought dwarfs always did the thing that ought to be done .         at the moment it   would not be advisable     said dee  talking very loudly again in an effort to drown out the noise .     i   m sure you understand .         let   s assume i   m very stupid     said vimes .      i assure you  your excellency  that what i see the king sees  and what i hear the king hears .         that   s certainly true at the moment  isn   t it .      dee drummed his fingers on his desk .      your excellency  i have spent only long enough in your   city to gain a general insight into your ways  but i might feel you are making fun of me .         may i speak freely .         from what i have heard of you  your monitorship  you usually do .         have you found the scone of stone yet .      the expression on dee   s face told vimes that he had scored .  and that  almost certainly  the next thing the dwarf said would be another lie .      what a strange and untruthful thing to say .  there is no possibility that the scone could have been stolen .  this has been firmly declared .  this is not a lie we wish to hear repeated .         you told me i       vimes tried .  by the sound of it  there was a fight going on behind the door now .      the scone will be seen by all at the coronation .  this is not a matter for ankh morpork or anyone else .  i protest this intrusion into our private affairs .         i merely           nor do we have to show the scone to any prying troublemaker .  it is a sacred trust and well guarded .      vimes kept quiet .  dee was better than done it duncan .      every person leaving the scone cave is carefully watched .  the scone cannot be removed .  it is perfectly safe .      dee was shouting now .      ah  i understand     said vimes quietly .      good .         so   you haven   t found it yet  then .      dee opened his mouth  shut it again  and then slumped back in his seat .      i think  your grace  that you had better        the door at the other end of the room rolled back .  another dwarf  cone shaped in his robes  stamped out  stopped  glared around him  went back to the doorway again to shout some afterthoughts to whomever was beyond  and then made to head out of the room .  he was brought up short when he almost walked into vimes .   the dwarf tilted its head to look up at him .  there was no real face there  just the suggestion of the glint of angry eyes between the leather flaps .      arnak morporak .         yes .      vimes didn   t understand the words that followed  but the nasty tone was unmistakable .  the important thing was to keep smiling .  that was the diplomatic way .      why  thank you     he said .     and may i say it        there was a grunt from the dwarf .  he   d seen cheery .      ha   ak .     he shouted .   vimes heard a gasp .  there were other dwarfs clustered around the doorway .  then he glanced down at cheery .  her eyes were shut .  she was trembling .      who is this dwarf .     he said to dee .      this is albrecht albrechtson     said the ideas taster .      the runner up .         yes     said dee hoarsely .      then can you tell the creature that if he uses that word again in the presence of myself or any of my staff there will be  as we diplomats say  repercussions .  wrap that up in diplomacy and give it to him  will you .      the corners of vimes   s ears picked up a suggestion that not every dwarf listening was ignorant of the language .  a couple of dwarfs were already heading purposefully toward them .   dee babbled a stream of hysterical dwarfish just as the other dwarfs caught up with the gaping albrecht and led him quietly but firmly away  but not before one of them had whispered something to the ideas taster .      the   er   the king wishes to see you     he mumbled .   vimes looked toward the doorway .   more dwarfs were hurrying through it now .  some of them were dressed in what vimes thought of as    normal    dwarf clothing  others in the heavy black leathers of the deep down clans .  all of them glared at him as they went past .   then there was just empty floor  all the way to the door .      do you come too .     he said .      not unless he asks for me     said dee .     i wish you luck  your monitorship .      beyond the door   was a room of bookshelves  stretching up  stretching away .  here and there a candle merely changed the density of the darkness .  there were lots of them  though  punctuating the distance .  vimes wondered how big this room must be        in here is a record of every marriage  every birth  every death  every movement of a dwarf from one mine to another  the succession of the king of each mine  every dwarf   s progress through k   zakra  mining claims  the history of famous axes   and other matters of note     said a voice behind him .     and perhaps most importantly  every decision made under dwarf law for fifteen hundred years is written down in this room  look you .      vimes turned .  a dwarf  short even by dwarf standards  was standing behind him .   he seemed to be expecting a reply .      er   every decision .         oh yes .         er   were they all good .     said vimes .      the important thing is that they were all made     said the king .     thank you  young   dwarf  you may straighten up .      cheery was bowing .      sorry  should i be doing that .     said vimes .     you   re   not the king  are you .         not yet .         i   i   m   i   m sorry  i was expecting someone more   er           do go on .            someone more   kingly .      the low king sighed .      i meant   i mean  you look just like an ordinary dwarf     said vimes weakly .   this time the king smiled .  he was slightly shorter than average for dwarfs  and dressed in the usual almost uniform of leather and home forged chain mail .  he looked old  but dwarfs started looking old around the age of five years and were still looking old three hundred years later  and he had that musical cadence to his speech that vimes associated with llamedos .  if he   d asked vimes to pass the ketchup in gimlet   s whole food delicatessen  vimes wouldn   t have given him a second look .      this diplomacy business     said the king     are you getting the hang of it  do you think .         it doesn   t come easy  i must admit   er  your majesty .         i believe you have been  up until now  a watchman in ankh morpork .         er  yes .         and you had a famous ancestor  i believe  who was a regicide .  took an ax  he did  and cut the head off .      here it comes  thought vimes .      yes  stoneface vimes     he said  as levelly as possible .     i   ve always thought that word was a bit unfair  though .  it was only one king .  it wasn   t as if it was a hobby .         you don   t like kings     said the dwarf .      i don   t meet many  sir .  not in ankh morpork     said vimes  hoping that this would pass for a diplomatic answer .  it seemed to satisfy the king .      i went to ankh morpork once  when i was a young dwarf     he said  walking toward a long table piled high with scrolls .      er   really .         lawn ornament  they called me .  and   what was it   ah  yes   shortass .  some children threw stones at me .         i   m sorry .         i expect you will tell me that sort of thing doesn   t happen anymore .         it doesn   t happen as much .  but you always get idiots who don   t move with the times .      the king gave vimes a piercing glance .      indeed .  the times   but now they are always ankh morpork   s times  see .         i   m sorry .         when people say    we must move with the times    they really mean    you must do it my way .     that is what i   m tellin    you .  and there are some who would say that ankh morpork is   a kind of vampire .  it bites  and what it bites it turns into copies of itself .  it sucks  too .  it seems all our best go to ankh morpork  where they live in squalor .  you leave us dry .      vimes was at a loss .  it was clear that the little figure now sitting at the long table was a lot brighter than he was  although right now he felt as dim as a penny candle in any case .  it was also clear that the king hadn   t slept for quite some time .  he decided to go for honesty .      can   t really answer that  sir     he said  adopting a variant on his talking to vetinari approach .     but           yes .         i   d wonder   you know  if i were a king   i   d wonder why people were happier living in squalor in ankh morpork than staying back home   sir .         ah .  you   re telling me how i should think  now .         no  sir .  just how i think .  but   there   s dwarf bars all over ankh morpork  and they   ve got mining tools wired to the wall  and there   s dwarfs in    em every night quaffing beer and singing sad songs about how they wish they were back in the mountains digging for gold .  but if you said to them  fine  the gate   s open  off you go and send us a postcard  they   d say    oh  well  yeah  i   d love to  but we   ve just got the new workshop finished   maybe next year we   ll go to uberwald .            they come back to the mountains to die     said the king .      they live in ankh morpork .         why is this  do you think .         i couldn   t say  sir .  because no one tells them how to  i suppose .         and now you want our gold and iron     said the king .     is there nothing we can keep .         don   t know about that either  sir .  i wasn   t trained for this job .      the king muttered something under his breath .  then  much louder  he said     i can offer you no favors  your excellency .  these are difficult times  see .         but my real job is finding things out     said vimes  a little louder .     if there is anything that i could do to        the king thrust the papers at vimes .      your letters of accreditation  your excellency .  their contents have been noted .      and that shuts me up  vimes thought .      i would ask you one thing  though     the king went on .      yes  sir .         really thirty men and a dog .         no .  there were only seven men .  i killed one of them because i had to .         how did the others die .         er   victims of circumstances  sir .         well  then   your secret is safe with me .  good morning  miss littlebottom .      cheery looked stunned .   the king gave her a brief smile .      ah  the rights of the individual  a famous ankh morpork invention  or so they say .  but what rights are they  really  and whence do they come .  thank you  dee  his excellency was just leaving .  you may send in the copperhead delegation .      as vimes was ushered out he saw another party of dwarfs assembled in the anteroom .  one or two of them nodded at him as they were herded in .   dee turned back to vimes .      i hope you didn   t tire his majesty .         someone else has already been doing that  by the look of it .         these are sleepless times     said the ideas taster .      scone turned up yet .     said vimes  innocently .      your excellency  if you persist in this attitude a complaint will go to your lord vetinari .         he does so look forward to them .  was it this way out .      it was the last word said until vimes and his guards were back in the coach and the doors to daylight were opening ahead of them .   out of the corner of his eye vimes saw that cheery was shaking .      certainly hits you  doesn   t it  the cold air after the warmth underground       he ventured .   cheery grinned in relief .      yes  it does     she said .      seemed quite a decent sort     said vimes .     what was that he muttered when i said i hadn   t been trained .         he said    who has .      sir .         it sounded like it .  all that arguing   it   s not a case of sitting on the throne and saying    do this  do that     then .         dwarfs are very argumentative  sir .  of course  many wouldn   t agree .  but none of the big dwarf clans are happy about this .  you know how it is   the copperheads didn   t want albrecht  and the shmaltzburgers wouldn   t support anyone called glodson  the ankh morpork dwarfs were split both ways  and rhys comes from a little coal mining clan near llamedos that isn   t important enough to be on anyone   s side           you mean he didn   t get to be king because everyone liked him but because no one disliked him enough .         that   s right  sir .      vimes glanced at the crumpled letter that the king had thrust into his hand .   by daylight he could see the faint scribble on one corner .  there were just two words .   midnight  see .   humming to himself  he tore the piece of paper off and rolled it into a ball .      and now for the damn vampire     he said .      don   t worry  sir     said cheery .     what   s the worst she can do .  bite your head off .      vimes grunted .     thank you for that  corporal .  tell me   those robes some of the dwarfs were wearing   i know they wear them on the surface so they   re not polluted by the nasty sunlight  but why wear them down there .         it   s traditional  sir .  er   they were worn by the   well  it   s what you   d call the knockermen  sir .         what did they do .         well  you know about firedamp .  it   s a gas you get in mines sometimes .  it explodes .      vimes saw the images in his mind as cheery explained     the miners would clear the area  if they were lucky .  and the knockerman would go in  wearing layer after layer of chain mail and leather  carrying his sack of wicker globes stuffed with rags and oil .  and his long pole .  and his slingshot .   down in the mines  all alone  he   d hear the knockers   agi hammerthief and all the other things that made noises  deep under the earth .  there could be no light  because light would mean sudden  roaring death .  the knockerman would feel his way through the utter dark  far below the surface .   there was a type of cricket that lived in the mines .  it chirruped loudly in the presence of firedamp .  the knockerman would have one in a box  tied to his hat .   when it sang  a knockerman who was either very confident or extremely suicidal would step back  light the torch on the end of his pole  and thrust it ahead of him .  the more careful knockerman would step back rather more  and slingshot a ball of burning rags into the unseen death .  either way  he   d trust in his thick leather clothes to protect him from the worst of the blast .   it was an honorable trade but  at least to start with  it didn   t run in families .  they didn   t have families .  who   d marry a knockerman .  they were dead dwarfs walking .  but sometimes a young dwarf would ask to become one  his family would be proud  wave him goodbye  and then speak of him as if he were dead  because that made it easier .   sometimes  though  knockermen came back .  and the ones that survived went on to survive again  because surviving is a matter of practice .  and sometimes they would talk a little of what they heard  all alone in the deep mines   the tap tapping of dead dwarfs trying to get back into the world  the distant laughter of agi hammerthief  the heartbeat of the turtle that carried the world .   knockermen became kings .   vimes  listening with his mouth open  wondered why the hell it was that dwarfs believed that they had no religion and no priests .  being a dwarf was a religion .  people went into the dark for the good of the clan  and heard things  and were changed  and came back to tell     and then  fifty years ago  a dwarf tinkering in ankh morpork had found that if you put a simple fine mesh over your lantern flame it   d burn blue in the presence of the gas but wouldn   t explode .  it was a discovery of immense value to the good of dwarfkind and  as so often happens with such discoveries  almost immediately led to a war .      and afterward there were two kinds of dwarfs     said cheery sadly .     there   s the copperheads  who all use the lamp and the patent gas exploder  and the shmaltzburgers  who stick to the old ways .  of course we   re all dwarfs     she said     but relations are rather   restrained .         i bet they are .         oh  no  all dwarfs recognize the need for the low king  it   s just that              they don   t quite see why knockermen are still so powerful .         it   s all very sad     said cheery .     did i tell you my brother snorey went off to be a knockerman .         i don   t think so .         he died in an explosion somewhere under borogravia .  but he was doing what he wanted to do .     after a moment she added  conscientiously     well  up to the moment when the blast hit him .  after that  i don   t think so .      now the coach was rumbling up the mountain on one side of the town .  vimes looked down at the little round helmet beside him .  funny how you think you know about people  he thought .   the wheels clattered over the wood of a drawbridge .   as castles went  this one looked as though it could be taken by a small squad of not very efficient soldiers .  its builder had not been thinking about fortifications .  he   d been influenced by fairy tales and possibly by some of the more ornamental sorts of cake .  it was a castle for looking at .  for defense  putting a blanket over your head might be marginally safer .   the coach stopped in the courtyard .  to vimes   s amazement  a familiar figure in a shabby black coat came shuffling up to open the door .      igor .         yeth  marthter .         what the hell are you doing here .         er   i   m opening thif here door  marthter     said igor .      but why aren   t you        then it stole over vimes that igor was different .  this igor had both eyes the same color  and some of his scars were in different places .      sorry     he mumbled .     i thought you were igor .         oh  you mean my couthin igor     said igor .     he workth down at the embathy .  how   th he getting on .         er   he   s looking   well     said vimes .     pretty   well .  yes .         did he mention how igor   th getting on  thir .     said igor  shambling away so fast that vimes had to run to keep up .     only none of uth have heard from him  not even igor  who   th alwayth been very clothe .         i   m sorry .  is your whole family called igor .         oh yeth  thir .  it avoidth confuthion .         it does .         yeth  thir .  anyone who ith anyone in uberwald wouldn   t dream of employing any other thervant but an igor .  ah  here we are  thir .  the mithtreth ith expecting you .      they   d walked under an arch and igor was opening a door with far more studs in it than was respectable .  this led to a hallway .      are you sure you want to come .     said vimes to cheery .     she is a vampire .         vampires don   t worry me  sir .         lucky for you     said vimes .  he glanced at the silent tantony .  the man was looking as strained as vimes felt .      tell our friend here he won   t be needed and he   s to wait for us in the coach  the lucky devil     he said .     but don   t translate that last bit .      igor opened an inner door as tantony almost ran out of the hall .      hith grathe hith exthelenthy           ah  sir samuel     said lady margolotta .     do come in .  i know you don   t like being your grace .  isn   t this tiresome .  but it has to be done  doesn   t it .      it wasn   t what he   d expected .  vampires weren   t suppose to wear pearls  or sweaters in pink .  in vimes   s world they didn   t wear sensible flat shoes  either .  or have a sitting room in which every conceivable piece of furniture was upholstered in chintz .   lady margolotta looked like someone   s mother  although possibly someone who   d had an expensive education and a pony called fidget .  she moved like someone who had grown used to her body and  in general  looked like what vimes had heard described as    a woman of a certain age .     he   d never been quite certain what age that was .   but   things weren   t quite right .  there were bats embroidered on the pink sweater  and the chintzy pattern on the furniture had a sort of   bat look .  the little dog with a bow round its neck  lying curled on a cushion  looked more like a rat than a dog .  vimes was less certain about that one  though  dogs of that nature tended to look a bit ratlike in any case .  the effect was as if someone had read the music but had never heard it played .   he realized she was politely waiting for him  and bowed  stiffly .      oh  don   t bother with that  please     said lady margolotta .     do take a seat .     she walked over to the cabinet and opened it .     do you fancy a bull   s blood .         is that the drink with the vodka .  because           no     said lady margolotta quietly .     this  i am afraid  is the other kind .  still  ve have that in common  don   t ve .  neither of us drinks   alcohol .  i believe you vere an alcoholic  sir samuel .         no     said vimes  completely taken aback     i was a drunk .  you have to be richer than i was to be an alcoholic .         ah  vell said .  i have lemonade  if you vish .  and miss littlebottom .  ve don   t have beer  you   ll be pleased to hear .      cheery looked at vimes in amazement .      er   perhaps a sherry .     she said .      certainly .  you may leave us  igor .  isn   t he a treasure .     she added  as igor retired .      he certainly looks as though he   s just been dug up     said vimes .  this was not going according to his mental script .      oh  all igors look like that .  he   s been in the family for almost two hundred years .  most of him  anyvay .         really    .         extremely popular with the young ladies  for some reason .  all igors are .  i   ve found it best not to speculate vhy .     lady margolotta gave vimes a bright smile .     vell  here   s to your stay  sir samuel .         you know a lot about me     said vimes weakly .      most of it good  i assure you     she said .     although you   re inclined to forget your papervork  you get exasperated easily  you are far too sentimental  you regret your own lack of education and distrust erudition in others  you are immensely proud of your city and you vonder if you may be a class traitor .  my   friends in ankh morpork were unable to find out anything very bad and  believe me  they are pretty good at that sort of thing .  and you loathe vampires .         i           quite understandable .  ve   re dreadful people  by and large .         but you           i try to look on the bright side     said lady margolotta .     but  anyvay   how did you like the king .         he   s very   quiet     said vimes the diplomat .      try cunning .  he vill have found out a lot more about you than you did about him  i   m sure .  vould you like a biscuit .  i don   t eat them myself  of course  but there   s a little man down in the town that does vonderful chocolate   igor .         yes  mithtreth     said igor .  vimes nearly sprayed his lemonade across the room .      he was out of the room .     he said .     i saw him go .  i heard the door shut .         igor has strange vays .  do give sir samuel a napkin  igor .         you said the king was cunning     said vimes  mopping lemonade off his breeches .  igor put down a plate of biscuits and shuffled out of the room .      did i .  no  i don   t think i could possibly have said that .  it   s not the diplomatic thing to say     said lady margolotta smoothly .     i   m sure ve all support the new low king  the choice of dvarfdom in general  even if they thought they vere getting a traditionalist and got an unknown quantity .         did you just say that last bit .     said vimes  awash on a sea of diplomacy and damp trousers .      absolutely not .  you know their scone of stone has been stolen .         they say it hasn   t     said vimes .      do you believe them .         no .         the coronation cannot go ahead without it  did you know that .         we   ll have to wait until they bake another one .     said vimes .      no .  there will be no more low kings     said lady margolotta .     legitimacy  you see .  the scone represents continuity all the vay to b   hrian bloodaxe .  they say he sat on it vhile it vas still soft and left his impression  as it vere .         you mean kingship has passed from bu   backside to backside .         humans believe in crowns  don   t they .         yes  but at least they   re at the other end .         thrones  then .     lady margolotta sighed .     people set such store by strange things .  crowns .  relics .  garlic   anyvay   there will be a civil var over the leadership which albrecht vill surely vin  and he   ll cease all trading with ankh morpork .  did you know that .  he thinks the place is evil .         i know it is     said vimes .     and i live there .         i   ve heard that he plans to declare all dvarfs there d   hrarak     the vampire went on .   vimes heard cheery gasp .     it means    not dwarfs .            that   s very big of him     said vimes .     i shouldn   t think our lads   ll worry about that .         um     said cheery .      quite so .  the young lady looks vorried  and you   d do vell to listen to her  sir samuel .         excuse me     said vimes     but what is all this to you .         you really don   t drink at all  sir samuel .         no .         not even vun .         no     said vimes  more sharply .     you   d know that  if you knew anything about           yet you keep half a bottle in your bottom drawer as a sort of permanent test     said lady margolotta .     now that  sir samuel  suggests a man who vears his hair shirts on the inside .         i want to know who   s been saying all this .      lady margolotta sighed .  vimes got the impression that he   d failed another test .     i am rich  sir samuel .  vampires tend to be .  didn   t you know .  lord vetinari  i know  believes that information is currency .  but everyone knows that currency has alvays been information .  money doesn   t need to talk  it merely has to listen .      she stopped and sat watching vimes  as if she   d suddenly decided to listen .  vimes moved uncomfortably under the steady gaze .      how is havelock vetinari .     she said .      the patrician .  oh   fine .         he must be quite old now .         i   ve never really been certain how old he is     said vimes .     about my age  i suppose .      then she stood up suddenly .     this has been an interesting meeting  sir samuel .  i trust lady sybil is vell .         er   yes .         good .  i am so glad .  ve vill meet again  i am sure .  igor vill see you out .  my regards to the baron  vhen you see him .  pat him on the head for me .         what the hell was that all about  cheery .     said vimes  as the coach set off down the hill again .      which bit  sir .         practically all of it  really .  why should ankh morpork dwarfs object if someone says they   re not dwarfs .  they know they   re dwarfs .         they won   t be subject to dwarf law  sir .         i didn   t know they were .         i mean   it   s like   how you live your life  sir .  marriages  burials   that sort of thing .  marriages won   t be legal .  old dwarfs won   t be allowed to be buried back home .  and that   d be terrible .  every dwarf dreams of going back home when he   s old and starting up a little mine .         every dwarf .  even the ones who were born in ankh morpork .         home can mean all sorts of things  sir     said cheery .     there   s other things  too .  contracts won   t be valid .  dwarfs like good solid rules  sir .         we   ve got laws in ankh morpork  too .  more or less .         between themselves dwarfs prefer to use their own  sir .         i bet the copperhead dwarfs won   t like it if that happens .         yes  sir .  there   ll be a split .  and another war .     she sighed .      but why was she going on about drink .         i don   t know  sir .         i don   t like    em .  never have  never will .         yes  sir .         did you see that rat .         yes  sir .         i think she was laughing at me .      the coach rolled through the streets of bonk once more .      how big a war .         probably a worse one than the one fifty years ago  i expect     said cheery .      i don   t recall people talking about that one     said vimes .      most humans didn   t know about it     said cheery .     it mostly took place underground .  under mining passages and digging invasion tunnels and so on .  perhaps a few houses fell into mysterious holes and people didn   t get their coal  but that was about it .         you mean dwarfs just try to collapse mines on other dwarfs .         oh yes .         i thought you were all law abiding .         oh yes  sir .  very law abiding .  just not very merciful .      ye gods  thought vimes  as the coach rolled over the bridge on the center of the town  i haven   t been sent to a coronation .  i   ve been sent to a war that hasn   t started yet .   he glanced up .  tantony was watching him intently  but looked away quickly .      lady margolotta watched the coach until it reached the gates of the town .  she stood back a little from the window .  there was a slight overcast  but habits of preservation died hard .      what a very angry man  igor .         yeth  mithtreth .         you can see it piling up behind his patience .  i vonder how far he can be pushed .         i   ve brought the hearthe around  mithreth .         oh  is it that late .  ve had better be going  then .  everyone feels despondent if i miss a meeting  you know .         the castle on the other side of the valley was much more rugged than lady margolotta   s confectionery item .  even so  the gates were wide open and didn   t look as though they were often closed .   the main door was tall and heavy looking .  the only thing that suggested it hadn   t been ordered for the standard castle catalog was the smaller  narrow door  a few feet high  set into it .      what   s that for .     said vimes .     even a dwarf would bump their head .         i suppose it depends on what shape you are when you go in     said cheery darkly .   the main door opened as soon as vimes had laid his hand on the wolf   s head knocker .  but he was ready this time .      good morning  igor     he said .      good day  your exthelency     said igor  bowing .      igor and igor send their regards  igor .         thank you  your exthelency .  thince you mention it  could i put a parthel on your coach for igor .         you mean the igor at the embassy .         that   s who i thaid  thir     said igor  patiently .     he athked me if i could lend him a hand .         yes  no problem there .         good .  it   th well wrapped up and the ithe with keep it nithe and frethh .  would you thtep thith way .  the marthter ith changing at the moment .      igor shambled into a wide hall  one side of which was mostly fireplace  and bowed out .      did he say what i thought he said .     said vimes .     about the hand and ice .         it   s not what it sounds like  sir     said cheery .      i hope so .  my gods  look at that damned thing .      a huge red flag hung from the rafters .  in the middle of it was a black wolf   s head  its mouth full of stylized flashes of lightning .      their new flag  i think     said cheery .      i thought it was just a crest with the doubled headed bat .         perhaps they thought it was time for a change  sir           ah  your excellency .  isn   t sybil with you .      the woman who had entered was angua  but padded somewhat with years .  she was wearing a long  loose green gown  very old fashioned by ankh morpork standards  although there were some styles that never go out of style on the right figure .  she was brushing her hair as she walked across the floor .      er   she   s staying at the embassy today .  we had rather a difficult journey .  you would be the baroness serafine von uberwald .         and you   re sam vimes .  sybil   s letters are all about you .  the baron won   t be long .  we were out hunting and lost track of time .         i expect it   s a lot of work  seeing to the horses     said vimes politely .   serafine   s smile went strange for a moment .      hah .  yes     she said .     can i get igor to fetch you a drink .         no  thank you .      she sat down on one of the overstuffed chairs and beamed at him .      you   ve met the new king  your excellency .         this morning .         i believe he   s having trouble .         what makes you think that .     said vimes .  serafine looked startled .      i thought everyone knew .         well  i   ve hardly been here five minutes     said vimes .     i probably don   t count as everyone .      now  he was pleased to note  she looked puzzled .      we   just heard there was some problem     she said .      oh  well   a new king  a coronation to organize   a few problems are bound to occur     he said .  well  he thought  so this is diplomacy .  it   s lying  only for a better class of people .      yes .  of course .         angua is well     said vimes .      are you sure you won   t have a drink .     said serafine quickly  standing up .     ah  here is my husband        the baron entered the room like a whirlwind which had swept up several dogs .  they bounded ahead of him and danced around him .      hello .  hello .     he boomed .   vimes looked at an enormous man   not fat  not tall  just built to perhaps one tenth over scale .  he didn   t so much have a face with a beard as a beard with  peeking over the top in that narrow gap between the mustache and the eyebrows  small remnants of face .  he bore down on vimes in a cloud of leaping bodies  hair and a smell of old carpets .   vimes was ready for the handshake when it came but even so had to grimace as his bones were ground together .      good of you to come  hey .  heard so much about you .      but not enough  vimes thought .  he wondered if he   d ever have the use of his hand again .  it was still being gripped .  the dogs had transferred their attention to him .  he was being sniffed .      greatest respect for ankh morpork  hey .     said the baron .      er   good     said vimes .  blood was getting no farther than his wrist .      have seat .     the baron barked .  vimes had been trying to avoid the word  but that was exactly how the man spoke   in short  sharp  sentences  every one an exclamation .   he was herded toward a chair .  then the baron let go of his hand and flung himself onto the huge carpet  the excited dogs piling on top of him .   serafine made a noise somewhere between a growl and the    tch .     of wifely disapproval .  obediently the baron pushed the dogs aside and flung himself into a chair .      you   ll have to take us as you find us     said serafine  smiling with her mouth alone .     this has always been a very informal household .         it is a very nice place     said vimes weakly  staring around the enormous room .  trophy heads lined the walls  but at least there were no trolls .  no weapons  either .  there were no spears  no rusty old swords  not even a broken bow had been hung up anywhere  which was practically against the law of castle furnishing .  he stared at the wall again  and then at the carving over the fireplace .  and then his gaze traveled down .   one of the dogs  and vimes had to be clear about this  he was using the term dogs merely because they were indoors and that was a place where the word wolf was not usually encountered  was watching him .  he   d never seen such an appraising look on a creature   s face .  it was weighing him up .   there was something familiar about the pale gold hair that was a sort of mane .  in fact  the dog looked quite like angua  but heavier set .  and there was another difference  which was small yet horribly significant .  as with angua  he had this sensation of movement stilled  but  whereas angua always looked as if she was poised to flee  this one looked poised to leap .      the embassy is to your liking .  we owned it  you know  before we sold it to lord v   ve           vetinari     said vimes  reluctantly taking his eyes off the wolf .      of course  your people made a lot of changes     she went on .      we   ve made a few more     said vimes  recalling all those patches of shiny woodwork where the hunting trophies had been removed .     i must say i was really impressed with the bathroo   i   m sorry .      there had been almost a yelp from the baron .  serafine was glaring at her husband .      yes     she said sharply     i gather interesting things have been done .         you   re so lucky to have the thermal springs     said vimes .  and this was diplomacy  too  he thought  when you let your mouth chatter away while you watched people   s eyes .  it   s just like being a copper .     sybil wants to go to take the waters at bad heisses bad        behind him he heard a faint growl from the baron and saw the look of annoyance flash across serafine   s face .      i   m saying the wrong thing .     he said innocently .      my husband is a little unwell at the moment     said serafine  in the special wife voice which vimes recognized as meaning    he thinks he   s fine right now but just you wait until i get him alone .         i suppose i   d better present my credentials     said vimes  pulling out the letter .   serafine reached across quickly and took it from his hand .      i shall read it     she said  smiling sweetly .     of course  it   s a mere formality .  everyone   s heard of commander vimes .  i mean no offense  of course  but we were a little surprised when the patrician           lord vetinari     said vimes helpfully  putting a slight stress on the first syllable and hearing the growl on cue .      yes  indeed   said that you would be coming .  we were expecting one of the more   experienced   diplomats           oh  i can hand around the thin cucumber sandwiches like anything     said vimes .     and if you want little golden balls of chocolate piled up in a heap  i   m your man .      she gave him a slow  blank stare .      your pardon  your excellency     she said .     morporkian is not my first language  and i fear we may have inadvertently misled one another .  i gather that you are  in real life  a pol ice man .         in real life  yes     said vimes .      we   ve always been against a police force in bonk     said the baroness .     we feel it interferes with the liberties of the individual .         well  i have certainly heard that argument advanced     said vimes .     of course  it depends on whether the individual you are thinking of is yourself or the one climbing out of the bathroom     he noted the grimace     window with the family silver in a sack .         happily  security has never been a problem for us     said serafine .      i   m not surprised     said vimes .     i mean   because of all the walls and gates and things .         i do hope you will bring sybil to the reception this evening .  but i see that we are keeping you  and i know you must have much to do .  igor will show you out .         yeth  mithtreth     said igor  behind vimes .   vimes could feel the river of fury building up behind the levees of his mind .      i shall tell sergeant angua you asked after her     he said  standing up .      indeed     said serafine .      but right now i   m looking forward to a really relaxing bath     said vimes  and watched with satisfaction as both the baron and his wife flinched .     good day to you .      cheery marched along beside him across the hallway .      don   t say a word until we   re out of here     hissed vimes .      sir .         because i want to get out of here     said vimes .   several of the dogs had followed him out .  they weren   t growling  they hadn   t bared their teeth  but they were carrying themselves with rather more purpose than vimes had come to associate with groin sniffers in general .      i   ve put the parthel in the coach  your exthelenthy     said igor  opening the coach door and knuckling his forehead .      i   ll be sure to give it to igor     said vimes .      oh  not to igor  thir .  thif ith for igor .         oh  right .      vimes looked out of the windows as the horses trotted away .  the golden haired wolf had come to the steps and was watching him leave .   he sat back as the coach rumbled out of the castle  and closed his eyes .  cheery was wise enough to remain silent .      no weapons on the walls  did you notice .     he said  after a while .  his eyes were still shut  as if he were looking at a picture on the back of them .     most castles like that have the things hanging all over the place .         well  they are werewolves  sir .         does angua ever talk about her parents .         no  sir .         they didn   t want to talk about her  that   s certain .      vimes opened his eyes .     dwarfs .     he said .     i   ve always got on with dwarfs .  and werewolves   well  never had a problem with werewolves .  so why is the only person who hasn   t tried to blow me out this morning the blood sucking vampire .         i don   t know  sir .         big fireplace they had .         werewolves like to sleep in front of the fire at night  sir     said cheery .      the baron certainly didn   t seem comfortable in a chair  i spotted that .  and what was that motto carved into that great big mantelpiece .     homini                 homo homini lupus     sir     said cheery .     it means    every man is a wolf to another man .            hah .  why haven   t i promoted you  cheery .         because i get embarrassed about shouting at other people  sir .  sir  did you notice the strange thing about the trophies they had on the wall .      vimes shut his eyes again .     stag  bears  some kind of mountain lion   what   re you asking me  corporal .         and did you notice something just below them .         let   s see   i think there was just space below them .         yes  sir .  with three hooks in it .  you could just make them out .      vimes hesitated .      do you mean     he said carefully     three hooks that might have had trophies hanging from them until they were removed .         very much that sort of hook  sir  yes .  only perhaps the heads haven   t been hung up yet .         trolls    heads .         who knows  sir .      the coach entered the town .      cheery  have you still got that silver chain mail vest you used to have .         er   no  sir .  i stopped because it seemed a bit disloyal to angua  sir .  why .         just a passing thought .  oh  ye gods   is that igor   s parcel under the seat .         i think so  sir .  but look  i know about igors .  if that   s a real hand  the original owner hasn   t got a use for it  believe me .         what .  he cuts bits off dead people .         better than live people  sir .         you know what i mean .         sir  it   s considered good manners  if one of the igors has helped you  to put it in your will that they can help themselves to any   bits of you that might help someone else .  they never ask for any money .  they   re very respected in uberwald .  very good men with a scalpel and a needle .  it   s a kind of vocation  really .         but they   re covered in scars and stitches .         they won   t do to anyone else what they are not prepared to try on themselves .      vimes decided to explore the full horror of this .  it took his mind off the missing trophies .      are they any   igorinas .  igorettes .         well  any igor is considered a good catch for a young lady           he is .         and their daughters tend to be very attractive .         eyes at the same height  that sort of thing .         oh yes .      but the door  when it was finally opened in response to impatient knocking  revealed not the switchback features of igor but the business end of detritus   s crossbow  which was marginally worse .      it   s us  sergeant     said vimes .   the crossbow was removed  and the door opened farther .      sorry  sir  but you said i was to be on guard     said detritus .      there   s no need to           igor   s been hurt  sir .          igor was sitting in the huge kitchen  a bandage around his head .  lady sybil was fussing over him .      i went to look for him a couple of hours ago and there he was  flat on the snow     she said .  she leaned closer to sam vimes .     he doesn   t remember very much .         can you recall what you were doing  old chap .     said vimes  sitting down .   igor gave him a bleary look .      well  thir  i went out to unpack the foodthtuffth from the other coach  and i   d just got hold of thomething and then all the lighth went out  thir .  i reckon i mutht   ve thlipped .         or someone hit you .      igor shrugged .  for a moment  both of his shoulders were at the same level .      there   s nothing on the coach worth stealing .     said lady sybil .      not unless someone was dying for a knuckle sandwich     said vimes .     was anything taken .         i checked everything against der list her ladyship gave me  sir     said detritus  meeting vimes   s gaze .     there wasn   t anything missing  sir .         i   ll just go and take a look for myself     said vimes .   when they were outside he walked over to the coach and looked at the snow around it .  the cobbles were visible here and there .  then he looked up at the grating .      all right  detritus     he said .     talk to me .         just a feelin     sir     rumbled the troll .     i know    fick    is my middle name           i didn   t know you had a first name  sergeant .         i don   t fink this was one of dem accidents dat happens by accident .         he might have fallen off the coach when he was unloading it     said vimes .      an    i might be the fairy clinkerbell  sir .      vimes was impressed .  this was low temperature thinking from detritus .      der street doors is open     said detritus .     i reckon igor disturbed someone who was pinchin    stuff .         but you said nothing was missing .         maybe der thief took fright  sir .         what  at seeing igor .  could be        vimes looked at the bags and boxes .  then he looked again .  things had been thrown down any old how .  that wasn   t how you unpacked a coach  unless you were looking for something in a real hurry .  no one would go to these lengths to steal food .      nothing was missing       he rubbed his chin .     who packed the coach  detritus .         dunno  sir .  i fink her ladyship just ordered a lot of stuff .         and we left in a bit of a rush  too       vimes stopped .  best to leave it there .  he had an idea but   well  where was the evidence .  you could say  nothing that should have been there was missing  so what must have been taken was something that shouldn   t have been there .  no .  for now  it was just something to remember .   they walked into the hall  and vimes   s eye fell on a pile of cards on a table by the door .      dere   s been a lot of visitors     said detritus .   vimes took a handful of cards .  some of them had gold edging .      dem diplomatics all want you to come for drinky poos an    stories about chickens     the troll added helpfully .      cocktails  i think you   ll find     said vimes  reading through the pasteboards .     hmm   klatch   muntab   genua   lancre   lancre .  it   s a kingdom you could spit across .  they   ve got an embassy here .         no  sir  mostly dey   ve got a letterbox .         will we all fit in .         dey   ve rented a house for der coronation  sir .      vimes dropped the invitations back onto the table .      i don   t think i can face any of this stuff     he said .     a man can only drink so much fruit juice and listen to so many bad jokes .  where is the nearest clacks tower  detritus .         about fifteen miles hubward  sir .         i   d like to find out what   s going on back home .  i think that this afternoon lady sybil and i will have a nice quiet ride in the country .  it   ll take her mind off this .      and then  he thought  i   ll wait until midnight  see .   and it   s still only lunchtime .      in the end  vimes took igor as driver and guide  and the guards tantony and the one he would forever think of as colonesque .  skimmer still hadn   t returned from whatever nefarious expedition was occupying his time  and vimes was damned if he   d leave the embassy unguarded .   yet another word for diplomat  vimes mused  was    spy .     the only difference was that the host government knew who you were .  the game was to outwit them  presumably .   the sun was warm  the breeze was cold  the mountain air made every peak look as if vimes could reach out and touch it .  outside the town snow covered vineyards and farms clung to slopes that in ankh morpork would be called walls  but after a while the pine forests closed in .  here and there  at a curve in the road  the river was visible far below .   up on the box  igor was crooning a lament .      he told me igors heal very fast     said lady sybil .      they   d have to .         mister skimmer said they are very gifted surgeons  sam .         except cosmetically  perhaps .      the coach slowed .      do you come up here a lot  igor .     said vimes .      mister thleep used to have me drive over on the a week to collect methages  marthter .         i   d have thought it   d be easier to have a pickup tower in bonk .         the counthil are dead againtht it  thir .         and you .         i am very modern in my outlook  thir .      the tower was quite close now  and loomed .  the first twenty feet or so were of stone with narrow  barred windows .  then there was a broad platform from which the main tower grew .  it was a sensible arrangement .  an enemy would find it hard to break in or set fire to it  there was enough storage room inside to see out a siege  and the enemy would be aware that the lads inside would have signaled for help thirty seconds after the attack began .  the company had money .  they were like the coaching agents in that respect .  if a tower went out of action  someone would be along to ask expensive questions .  there was no law here  the kind of people who   d turn up would be inclined to leave a message to the world that towers were not to be touched .   everyone should know this  and therefore it was odd to see that the big signal arms were stationary .   the hairs rose on vimes   s neck .      stay in the carriage  sybil     he said .      is there something wrong .         i   m not   sure     said vimes  who was sure .  he stepped down and nodded to igor .      i   m going to have a look inside     he said .     if there is any   trouble  you   re to get lady sybil back to the embassy  all right .      vimes leaned back into the coach and  trying not to look at sybil  lifted up one of the seats and pulled out the sword he had hidden there .      sam .     she said  accusingly .      sorry  dear .  i thought i ought to carry a spare        there was a bellpull by the door of the tower .  vimes tugged at it  and heard a clang somewhere above .   when nothing else happened  he tried the door .  it swung open .      hello .      there was silence .      this is the wa       vimes stopped .  it wasn   t the watch  was it .  not out here .  the badge didn   t work .  he was just an inquisitive trespassing bastard .      anyone there .      the room was piled high with sacks  boxes and barrels .  a wooden stairway led up to the next floor .  vimes climbed up into a combined bedroom and mess room  there were only two bunks  their covers pulled back .   a chair was on the floor .  a meal was on the table  knife and fork laid down carefully .  on the stove something had boiled dry in an iron pot .  vimes opened the firebox door  and there was a whoomph as the inrushing air rekindled the charred wood .   and  from above  the chink of metal .   he looked at the ladder and trapdoor to the next floor .  anyone climbing it would be presenting their head at a convenient height for a blade or a boot        tricky  isn   t it  your grace     said someone above him .     you   d better come up .  mmm  mhm .         inigo .         it   s safe enough  your grace .  there   s only me here .  mmm .         that counts as safe  does it .      vimes climbed the ladder .  inigo was sitting at a table  leafing through a stack of papers .      where   s the crew .         that  your grace     said inigo     is one of the mysteries  mmm  mmm .         and the others are    .      inigo nodded toward the steps leading upward .     see for yourself .      the controls for the arms had been comprehensively smashed .  laths and bits of wire dangled forlornly from their complex framework .      several hours of repair work for skilled men  i   d say     said inigo  as vimes returned .      what happened here  inigo .         i would say the men who lived here were forced to leave  mmm  mhm .  in some disorder .         but it   s a fortified tower .         so .  they have to cut firewood .  oh  the company has rules  and then they put three young men in some lonely tower for weeks at a time and they expect them to act like clockwork people .  see the trapdoor up to the controls .  that should be locked at all times .  now you  your grace  and myself as well  because we are   are              bastards .     vimes supplied .      well  yes   mmm   we   d have devised a system that meant the clacks couldn   t even be operated unless the trapdoor was shut  wouldn   t we .         something like that  yes .         and we   d have written into the rules that the presence of any visitor in the tower would  mhm  be automatically transmitted to the neighboring towers  too .         probably .  that   d be a start .         as it is  i suspect that any harmless looking visitor with a nice fresh apple pie for the lads would be warmly welcomed     sighed inigo .     they do two month shifts at a time .  nothing to look at but trees  mmm .         no blood  not much sign of a struggle     said vimes .     have you checked outside .         there should be a horse in the stable .  it   s gone .  we   re more or less on rock here .  there   s wolf tracks  but there   s wolf tracks everywhere around here .  and the wind   s blown the snow .  they   ve   gone  your grace .         are you sure the men let someone in through the door .     vimes said .     anyone who could land on the platform could be in one of these windows in an instant .         a vampire  mmm .         it   s a thought  isn   t it .         there   s no blood around           it   s a shame to waste good food     said vimes .     think of those poor starving children in muntab .  what are these .      he pulled a box from under the lower bunk .  inside it were two long tubes  about a foot long  open at one end .         badger and normal  ankh morpork       he read aloud        mortar flare  red  .  light fuse .  do not place in mouth .     it   s a firework  mister skimmer .  i   ve seen them on ships .         ah  there was something       inigo leafed through the book on the table .     they could send up an emergency flare if there   s a big problem .  yes   the tower nearest ankh morpork will send out a couple of men and a bigger squad comes up from the depot down on the plains .  they take a downed tower very seriously .         yes  well  it could cost them money     said vimes  peering into the mouth of the mortar .     we need this tower working  inigo .  i don   t like being stuck out here .         the roads aren   t too bad yet .  they could be here by tomorrow evening   i   m sure you shouldn   t do that  sir .      vimes had pulled the mortar out of its tube .  he looked at inigo quizzically .      they won   t go off until you light the charge in the base     he said .     they   re safe .  and they   d make a stupid weapon     cos you can   t aim them worth a damn and they   re only made of cardboard in any case .  come on  let   s get it onto the roof .         not until dark  your grace  mmm .  that way two or three towers on each side will see it  not just the closest .         but the closest towers are watching they   ll certainly see           we don   t know that there is anyone there to watch  sir .  perhaps what happened here has happened there  too .  mmm .         good grief .  you don   t think           no  i don   t think  sir  i   m a civil servant .  i advise other people  mmm  mmm .  then they think .  my advice is that an hour or two won   t hurt  sir .  my advice is that you return with lady sybil now  sir .  i will send up a flare as soon as it is dark and make my way back to the embassy .         hold on  i am commander in           not here  your grace .  remember .  here you are a civilian in the way  mhm  mmm .  i   ll be safe enough           the crew weren   t .         they weren   t me  mhm  mhm .  for the sake of lady sybil  your grace  i advise you to leave now .      vimes hesitated  hating the fact that inigo was not only right but was  despite his claim to mindlessness  doing the thinking that he should be doing .  he was supposed to be out for an afternoon   s drive with his wife  for heaven   s sake .      well   all right .  just one thing  though .  why are you here .         the last time sleeps was seen he was on his way up here with a message .         ah .  and am i right in thinking that your mister sleeps was not exactly the kind of diplomat that hands around the cucumber sandwiches .      inigo smiled thinly .      that   s right  sir .  he was   the other sort .  mmm .         your sort .         mmm .  and now go  your grace .  the sun will be setting soon .  mmm  mmm .         corporal nobbs  president and convenor of the guild of watchmen  surveyed his troops .      all right  one more time     he said .     whadda we want .      the strike meeting had been going on for some time  and it had been going on in a bar .  the watchmen were already a little forgetful .   constable ping raised his hand .      er   a proper grievance procedure  a complaints committee  an overhaul of the promotion procedures   er              better crockery in the canteen     someone supplied .         freedom from unwarranted accusations of sucrose theft     said someone else .         no more than seven days straight on nights              an increase in the boots allowance              at least three afternoons off for grandmother   s funerals per year              not having to pay for our own pigeon feed              another drink .     this last demand met with general approval .   constable shoe got to his feet .  he was still  in his spare time  organizer of the campaign for dead rights  and he knew how this sort of thing went .      no  no  no  no  no     he said .     you   ve got to get it a lot simpler than that .  it   s got to have bounce .  and rhythm .  like    whadda we want .  dum dee dum dee .  when do we want it .  now .     see .  you need one simple demand .  let   s try it again .  whadda we want .      the watchmen looked at one another  no one quite wanting to be the first .      another drink .     someone volunteered .      yeah .     said someone at the back .     when do we want it .  now .         well  that one seems to have worked     said nobby  as the policemen crowded round the bar .     what else are we going to need  reg .         signs for the picket     said constable shoe .      we   ve got to picket .         oh yes .         in that case     said nobby firmly     we   ve got to have a big metal drum to burn old scrap wood in  while we   re pickin    at it .         why .     said reg .      you got to stand around warmin    your hands over a big drum     said nobby .     that   s how people know you   re an official picket and not a bunch of bums .         but we are a bunch of bums  nobby .  people think we are  anyway .         all right  but let   s be warm ones .         the sun was a finger   s width above the rim when vimes   s coach set off from the tower .  igor whipped the horses up .  vimes looked out of the window at the road   s edge  a few feet away and several hundred feet above the river .      why so fast .     he shouted .      got to be home by thunthet .     igor shouted .     it   th tradithional .      the big red sun was moving through bars of cloud .      oh  let him  dear  if it gives the poor soul any pleasure     said lady sybil  shutting the window .     now  sam  what happened at the tower .         i don   t really want to worry you  sybil           well  now that you   ve got me really worried  you may as well tell me .  all right .      vimes gave in and explained the little that he knew .      someone   s killed them .         possibly .         the same people that ambushed us back in that gorge .         i don   t think so .         this isn   t turning out to be much of a holiday  sam .         it   s not being able to do anything that makes me sick     said vimes .     back in ankh morpork   well  i   d have leads  contacts  some kind of a map .  everyone here is   well  hiding something  i think .  the new king thinks i   m a fool  the werewolves treated me as if i was something the cat dragged in   the only person who   s been halfway civil was a vampire .         not the cat     said sybil .      what .     said vimes  mystified .      werewolves hate cats     said sybil .     i distinctly remember that .  definitely not cat people .         hah .  no .  dog people .  they don   t like words like bath or vet  either .  i reckon if you threw a stick at the baron he   d leap out of his chair to catch it           i suppose i ought to tell you about the carpets     said sybil  as the coach rocked around a corner .      what  isn   t he house trained .         i meant the carpets in the embassy .  you know i said i   d measure up for them .  but the measurements aren   t right  on the first floor           i don   t want to sound impatient  dear  but is this a carpet moment .         sam .         yes  dear .         just stop thinking like a husband and start listening like a   a copper  will you .         vimes marched into the embassy and summoned detritus and cheery .      you two are coming with us to the ball tonight     he said .     it   ll be posh .  have you got anything to wear apart from your uniform  sergeant .         no  sir .         well  go and see igor .  there   s a good man with a needle if i ever saw one .  how about you  cheery .         i do  er  have a gown     said cheery  looking down shyly .      you do .         yes  sir .         oh .  well .  good .  i   m putting the two of you on the embassy staff  too .  cheery  you   re   you   re military attach   .         oh     said detritus  disappointed .      and  detritus  you   re cultural attach   .      the troll brightened up considerably .     you will not regret dis  sir .         i   m sure i won   t     said vimes .     right now  i   d like you to come with me .         is dis a cultural matter  sir .         broadly .  perhaps .      vimes led the troll and sybil up the stairs and into the office  where he stopped in front of a wall .      this one .     he said .      yes     said his wife .     it   s hard to notice until you measure the rooms  but that wall really is rather thick        vimes ran his hands along the paneling  looking for anything that might go click .  then he stood back .      give me your crossbow  sergeant .         here we are  sir .      vimes staggered under its weight  but managed to get it pointed at the wall .      is this wise  sam .     said sybil .   vimes stood back to take aim  and the floorboard moved under his heel .  a panel in the wall swung gently .      you scared der hell out of it  sir     said detritus loyally .   vimes carefully handed the crossbow back  and tried to look as though he   d meant things to happen this way .   he   d expected a secret passage .  but this was a tiny workroom .  there were jars on shelves  with labels   new suet strata  area     grade a fat  the big hole .  there were lumps of crumbling rock  with neat cardboard tags attached to them saying things like level     shaft    double pick mine .   there was a set of drawers .  one of them was full of makeup  including a selection of mustaches .   wordlessly  vimes opened one of a stack of notebooks .  the first pages had a pencil drawn street map of bonk  with red lines threading through it .      good grief  look at this     he breathed  flicking onward .     maps .  drawings .  there   s pages of stuff about the assaying of fat deposits .  huh  says here       the new suets  while initially promising  are now suspected of having high levels of bcbs and are likely to be soon exhausted .     and here it says    a werewolf putsch is clearly planned in the chaos following the loss of the scone         k .  reports that many of the younger werewolves now follow w .   who has changed the nature of the game      this stuff   this stuff is spying .  i wondered how vetinari always seems to know so much .         did you think it came to him in dreams  dear .         but there   s loads of details here   notes about people  lots of figures about dwarf mining production  political rumors   i didn   t know we did this sort of thing .         you use spies all the time  dear     said sybil .      i do not .         well  what about people like foul ole ron and no way jos   and cumbling michael .         that is not spying  that is not spying .  that   s just    information received .     we couldn   t do the job if we didn   t know what   s happening on the street .         well   perhaps havelock just thinks in terms of   a bigger street  dear .         there   s loads more of this muck  look .  sketches  more bits of ore   what the hell   s this .      it was oblong  and about the size of a cigarette packet .  there was a round glass disk on one face  and a couple of levers on one side .   vimes pushed one of them .  a tiny hatch opened on one side  and the smallest head that he   d ever seen that could speak said       s .         i know dat .     said detritus .     dat   s a nano imp .  dey cost over a hundred dollars .  dey   re really small .         no one   s bloody fed me for a fortnight .     the imp squeaked .      it   s an iconograph small enough to fit in a pocket     said vimes .     something for a spy   it   s as bad as inigo   s damn one shot crossbow .  and look        steps led downward .  he took them carefully  and swung open the little door at the end .   wet heat slapped into him .      pass me down a candle  will you  dear .     he said .  and by its light he looked out into a long dank tunnel .  crusted pipes  leaking steam at every joint  lined the far wall .      a way in and out where no one will see him  too     he said .     what a dirty world we live in           the clouds had covered the sky and the wind was whipping thick snowflakes around the tower when inigo finished setting up the red mortar on the platform below the big square shutters .   he lit a couple of matches but the wind streamed them out before he could even cup his hands around them .      damn .  mmm  mmm .      he slid down the ladder and into the warmth of the tower .  it   d be better to spend the night here  he thought  as he rummaged in drawers .  the night didn   t hold many terrors for him  but this storm had the feel of another big snow and the mountain roads would soon be treacherous .   finally an idea struck him  and he opened the door of the stove and pulled out a smoldering log on the tongs .   it burst into flame when he carried it out at the top of the tower  and he directed them into the touch hole at the base of the tube .   the mortar fired with a phut that was lost in the wind .  the flare itself tumbled invisibly up into the snow and then  a few seconds later  exploded a hundred feet overhead  casting a brief red glare over the forests .   inigo had just gotten back into the room when there was a knock at the door  down at ground level .   he paused .  there was a window and hatch at this level  the designers of the tower had at least realized that it would be a good idea to be able to look down and see who was a knocking .   there was no one there .   when he   d climbed back into the room  the knock came again .   he hadn   t locked the door after vimes went .  a bit late to regret that now  he realized .  but inigo skimmer had trained in an academy that made the school of hard knocks look like a sandpit .   he lit a candle and crept down the ladder in the darkness  shadows fleeing and dancing among the stacks of provisions .   with the candle set down on a box  he pulled the one shot crossbow from inside his coat and  with an effort  cocked it against the wall .  then he flexed his left arm and felt the palm dagger ease itself into position .   he clicked his heels in a certain way and sensed the tiny blades slide out from the toes .   and inigo settled down to wait .   behind him  something blew the candle out .   as he turned  and the crossbow   s one bolt whirred into darkness  and the palm dagger scythed at nothing  it occurred to inigo skimmer that you could knock on either side of a door .   they really were very clever        mhm  m           cheery twirled  or at least attempted to .  it was not a movement that came naturally to dwarfs .      you look very   nice     said lady sybil .     it goes all the way to the ground  too .  i don   t think anyone could possibly complain .      unless they were remotely fashion conscious  she had to admit .   the problem was that the   well  she had to think of them as the new dwarf women   hadn   t quite settled on a look .   lady sybil herself usually wore ball gowns of a light blue  a color often chosen by ladies of a certain age and girth to combine the maximum of quiet style with the minimum of visibility .  but dwarf girls had heard about sequins .  they seemed to have decided in their bones that  if they were going to overturn thousands of years of subterranean tradition  they weren   t going to go all through that for no damn twin set and pearls .      and red is good     said lady sybil sincerely .     red is a very nice color .  it   s a nice red dress .  er .  and the feathers .  er .  the bag to carry your ax  er           not glittery enough .     said cheery .      no .  no   if i was going to carry a large ax on my back to a diplomatic function  i think i   d want it glittery  too .  er .  it is such a very large ax  of course     she finished lamely .      you think perhaps a smaller one might be better .  for evening wear .         that would be a start  yes .         perhaps with a few rubies set in the handle .         yes     said lady sybil weakly .     why not  after all .         what about me  ladyship .     detritus rumbled .   igor had certainly risen to the occasion  applying to a number of suits found in the embassy wardrobes the same pioneering surgical skills that he used on unfortunate loggers and other people who may have strayed too close to a band saw .  it had taken him just ninety minutes to construct something around detritus .  it was definitely evening dress .  you couldn   t get away with it in daylight .  the troll looked like a wall with a bow tie .      how does all it feel .     said lady sybil  playing for safety .      it are rather tight around der   what   s this bit called .         i really have no idea     said lady sybil .      it makes me lurch a bit     said detritus .     but i feel very diplomatic .         not the crossbow  however     said lady sybil .      she got her ax     said detritus accusingly .      dwarf axes are accepted as a cultural weapon     said lady sybil .     i don   t know the etiquette here  but i suppose you could get away with a club .     after all  she added to herself  it   s not as though anyone would try to take it off you .      der crossbow ain   t cultural .         i   m afraid not .         i could put  like  glitter on it .         not enough  i   m afraid   oh  sam           yes  dear .     said vimes  coming down the stairs .      that   s just your watch dress uniform .  what about your ducal regalia .         can   t find it anywhere     said vimes innocently .     i think the bag must have fallen off the coach in the pass  dear .  but i   ve got a helmet with feathers in it and igor   s buffed up the breastplate until he could see his face in it  although i   m not sure why .     he quailed at her expression .     duke is a military term  dear .  no soldier would ever go to war in tights .  not if he thought he might be taken prisoner .         i find this highly suspicious  sam .         detritus will back me up on this     said vimes .      dat   s right  sir     the troll rumbled .     you distinctly said to say dat           anyway  we   d better be goi   good grief  is that cheery .         yes  sir     said cheery nervously .   well  thought vimes  she comes from a family where people go off in strange clothes to face explosions far away from the sun .      very nice     he said .      lamps were lit all along the tunnel to what vimes had come to think of as downtown bonk .  dwarf guards waved the coach through after mere glances at the ankh morpork crest .  the ones around the giant elevator were more uncertain .  but sam vimes had learned a lot from watching lady sybil .  she didn   t mean to act like that  but she   d been born to it  into a class which had always behaved this way  you went through the world as if there was no possibility that anyone would stop you or question you  and most of the time that   s exactly what didn   t happen .   there were others in the elevator as it rumbled downward .  mostly they were diplomats that vimes didn   t recognize  but there was also  now  in a roped off corner  a quartet of dwarf musicians playing pleasant yet slightly annoying music that ate its way into vimes   s head as the interminable descent went on .   when the doors opened he heard sybil gasp .      i thought you said it was like a starry night down here  sam .         er   they   ve certainly turned the wick up        candles by the thousand burned in brackets all around the walls of the huge cavern  but it was the chandeliers that caught the eye .   there were scores of them  each at least four stories high .  vimes  always ready to look for the wires behind the smoke and mirrors  made out the dwarfs working inside the gantries and the baskets of fresh candles being lowered through holes in the ceiling .  if the fifth elephant wasn   t a myth  at least one whole toe must be being burned tonight .      your grace .      dee was advancing through the crowds .      ah  ideas taster     said vimes .  as the dwarf approached     do allow me to introduce the duchess of ankh morpork   lady sybil .         uh   er   yes   indeed   so delighted to make your acquaintance       dee murmured  caught off guard by the charm offensive .     but  er        sybil had picked up the code .  vimes loathed the word    duchess     so if he was using it then he wanted her to out dutch everyone .  she enveloped dee   s pointy head in delighted duchessness .      mister dee  sam has told me so much about you .     she trilled .     i understand you   re quite the right hand man              dwarf       hissed vimes .         dwarf to his majesty .  please  you must tell how you have achieved such a delightful lighting effect here .         er   lots of candles       dee muttered  glaring at vimes .      i think dee wishes to discuss some political matters with me  dear     said vimes smoothly  putting his hand on the dwarf   s shoulder .     if you   ll just take the others down  i   ll join you shortly  i   m sure .     and he knew that no power in the world was going to prevent sybil sweeping on down to the reception .  that woman could sweep .  things stayed swept after she   d gone past .      you brought a troll  you brought a troll .     muttered dee .      and he   s an ankh morpork citizen  remember     said vimes .     covered by diplomatic immunity and a rather bad suit .         even so           there is no    even so        said vimes .      we are at war with the trolls .         well  that   s what diplomacy is all about  isn   t it .     said vimes .     a way to stop being at war .  anyway  i understand it   s been going on for five hundred years  so obviously no one is trying very hard .         there will be complaints at the very highest level .      vimes sighed .     more .     he said .      some are saying ankh morpork is deliberately flaunting its wickedness at the king .         the king .     said vimes pleasantly .     he   s not exactly king yet  is he .  not until the coronation  which involves a certain   bject           yes  but of course that is a mere formality        vimes moved closer .      but it isn   t  is it .     he said quietly .     it is the thing and the whole of the thing .  without the magic  there is no king .  just someone like you  unaccountably giving orders .         someone called vimes teaches me about royalty .     said dee  miserably .      and without the thing  all the bets are off     said vimes .     there will be a war .  explosions underground .      there was a tinny little sound as he took out his watch and opened it .      my word  it   s midnight     he said .      follow me     dee muttered .      am i being taken to see something .     said vimes .      no  your excellency .  you are being taken to see where something is not .         ah .  then i want to bring corporal littlebottom .         that .  absolutely not .  that would be a desecration of           no  it wouldn   t     said vimes .     and the reason is  she won   t come with us because we   re not going  are we .  you   re certainly not taking the representative of a potentially hostile power into your confidence and revealing that your house of cards is missing a card on the bottom layer  are you .  of course not .  we are not having this conversation .  for the next hour or so we   ll be nibbling tidbits in this room .  i haven   t even just said this  and you didn   t hear me .  but corporal littlebottom is the best scene of crime officer i   ve got  and so i want her to come along with us .         you   ve made your point  your excellency .  graphically  as always .  fetch her  then .      vimes found cheery standing back to back  or at least back to knees  with detritus .  they were surrounded by a ring of the curious .  whenever detritus raised his hand to sip his drink  the nearby dwarfs jumped back hurriedly .      where are we going  sir .         nowhere .         ah .  that sort of place .         but things are looking up     said vimes .     dee has discovered a new pronoun  even if he does spit it .         sam .     said lady sybil  advancing through the throng     they   re going to perform    bloodaxe and ironhammer    .  isn   t that wonderful .         er           it   s an opera  sir     cheery whispered .     part of the koboldean cycle .  it   s history .  every dwarf knows it by heart .  it   s about how we got laws  and kings   and the scone  sir .         i sung the part of ironhammer when we did it at finishing school     said lady sybil .     not the full five week version  of course .  it   d be marvelous to see it done here .  it   s really one of the great romances of history .         romances .     said vimes .     like   a love story .         yes .  of course .         bloodaxe and ironhammer were both   er   weren   t both       vimes began .      they were both dwarfs  sir     said cheery .      ah .  of course .     vimes gave up .  all dwarfs were dwarfs .  if you tried to understand their world from a human point of view  it all went wrong .     do  er  enjoy it  dear .  i   ve got to   the king wants me to   i   ll just be somewhere else for a while   politics        he hurried away  with cheery trailing behind him .   dee led the way led through dark tunnels .  when the opera began it was a whisper far away  like the sea in an ancient shell .   eventually they stopped at the edge of a canal  its waters lapping at the darkness .  a small boat was tethered there  with a waiting guard .  dee urged them into it .      it is important that you understand what you are seeing  your grace     said dee .      practically nothing     said vimes .     and i thought i had good night vision .      there was a clink in the gloom  and then a lamp was lit .  the guard was punting the boat under an arch and into a small lake .  apart from the tunnel entrance  the walls rose up sheer .      are we at the bottom of a well .     said vimes .      that is quite a good way of describing it .     dee fished under his seat .  he produced a curved metal horn and blew one note  which echoed up the rock walls .   after a few seconds another note floated down from the top .  there was a clanking  as of heavy  ancient chains .      this is quite a short lift compared to some up in the mountains     said dee  as an iron plate ground across the entrance  sealing it .     there   s one half a mile high that will take a string of barges        water boiled beside the boat .  vimes saw the walls begin to sink .      this is the only way to the scone     said dee behind him .   now the boat was rocking in the bubbling water and the walls were blurred .      water is diverted into reservoirs up near the peaks .  then it is simply a matter of opening and closing sluices  you see .         yes     mumbled vimes  experiencing vertigo and seasickness in one tight green package .   the walls slowed .  the boat stopped shaking .  smoothly  the water lifted them over the lip of the well and into a little channel  where there was a dock .      any guards below .     vimes managed  stepping out onto the blessedly solid stone .      there are usually four     said dee .     for tonight i   arranged matters .  the guards understand .  no one is proud of this .  i must tell you  i disapprove most strongly of this enterprise .      vimes looked around the new cave .  a couple of dwarfs were standing on a lip of stone which overlooked what was now a placid pool .  by the look of it  they were the ones who operated the machinery .      shall we proceed .     said the dwarf .   there was a passage leading off the cave  which rapidly narrowed .  vimes had to bend almost double along one length .  at one point metal plates clanked under his feet  and he felt them shift slightly .  then he was standing almost upright again  passing under another arch  and there     either the dwarfs had cut into a huge geode  or they had with great care lined this small cave with quartz crystals until every surface reflected the light of the two small candles that stood on pillars in the middle of the sandy floor .  the effect dazzled even vimes  after the darkness of the tunnels .      behold     said dee gloomily     where the scone should be        a round flat stone  midway between the candles and only a few inches high  clearly contained nothing .   behind it  water bubbled up in a natural basin and split into two streams that flowed around the stone and disappeared again into another stone funnel .      all right     said vimes .     tell me everything .         it was found missing three days ago     said dee .     dozy longfinger found it gone when he unlocked the door to replace the candles .         and his job is    .         captain of the candles .         ah .         it   s a very responsible position .         i   ve seen the chandeliers .  and how often does he go in there .         he went in there every day .         went .         he no longer holds the position .         because he   s a prime suspect .     said vimes .      because he   s dead .         and how did that happen .     said vimes  slowly and deliberately .      he   took his own life .  we are certain of this  because we had to break down the door of his cave .  he   d had been captain of the candles for sixty years .  i do not think he could bear the thought of suspicion falling on him .         to me he does sound a likely suspect .         he did not steal the scone .  we know that much .         but the robes you people wear could hide practically anything .  was he searched .         certainly not .  but   i shall demonstrate     said dee .  he walked off along the narrow  metal floored corridor .      can you see me  your excellency .         yes  of course .      the floor rattled as dee came back .     now this time i will carry something   your helmet  if you please .  just for the demonstration        vimes handed it to him .  the ideas taster walked back down the corridor .  when he was halfway  a gong boomed and two metal grids dropped down out of the ceiling .  a few seconds after that guards appeared at the far grille  peering in suspiciously .   dee said a few words to them .  the faces vanished .  after a while  the grilles rose slowly .      the mechanism is complex and quite old but we keep it in good working order     he said  handing vimes his helmet .     if you weigh more going out than going in  the guards will want to know why .  it is unavoidable  it is still accurate to within a few ounces  and does not violate privacy .  the only way to beat it would be to fly .  can thieves fly  your excellency .         depends on which sort     said vimes absently .     who else goes in there .         once every six days the chamber is inspected by myself and two guards .  the last inspection was five days ago .         does anyone else go in there .     said vimes .  he noticed that cheery had picked up a handful of the off white sand that formed the floor of the scone cave and was letting it run between her fingers .      not lately .  when the new king is crowned  of course  the scone will often be brought forth for various ceremonial purposes .         do you only get that white sand in here .         yes .  is that important .      vimes saw cheery nod .      i   m not   sure     he said .     tell me  what intrinsic value has the scone .         intrinsic .  it   s priceless .         i know it   s valuable as a symbol  but what is it   s value in itself .         priceless .         i   m trying to work out why a thief might want to steal it     said vimes  as patiently as he could .   cheery had lifted up the flat round stone and was looking underneath it .  vimes pursed his lips .      what is   she doing .     said dee .  the pronoun dripped with distaste .      constable littlebottom is looking for clues     said vimes .     they are what we call   signs  which may help us .  it   s a skill .         would this letter speed your search .     said dee .     it has writing on it .  that is what we call   signs  which may help you .      vimes looked at the proffered paper .  it was brown  and quite stiff  and covered in runes .      i  er  can   t read those     he said .      it   s a skill     said dee  solemnly .      i can  sir     said cheery .     allow me .      she took the paper and read it .      er   it appears to be a ransom note  sir .  from   the sons of agi hammerthief .  they say they have the scone and will   they say they   ll destroy it  sir .         where   s the money .     said vimes .      no money  sir .  they say rhys must renounce all claim to be low king .         there are no other conditions     said dee .     the note turned up on my desk .  but everyone puts paperwork on my desk these days .         who are the sons of agi hammerthief .     said vimes  looking at dee .     and why didn   t you tell me about this before .         we don   t know .  it is just a made up name .  some   malcontents  we assume .  and i was told you would ask me questions .         but this isn   t a real crime anymore  is it .     said vimes .     this is politics .  why can   t the king just renounce all claim  get the scone back  and then say he had his fingers crossed .  if it   s done under duress           we take our ceremonies seriously  your excellency .  if rhys renounces the throne  he cannot change his mind the next day .  if he allows the scone to be destroyed  then the kingship has no legitimacy and there will              be trouble     said vimes .  and it   ll spread to ankh morpork  he added to himself .  at the moment it   s only riots .      who   ll become king if he abdicates .         albrecht albrechtson  as everyone knows .         and that will be trouble  too     said vimes .     civil war  from what i hear .         the king says     said dee quietly     that he intends to step down nevertheless .  better any king than chaos .  dwarfs do not like chaos .         it   s going to be chaos either way  though     said vimes .      there have been rebellions against kings before .  dwarfdom survives .  the crown continues .  the lore abides .  the stone remains .  there is   a sanity to come back to .      oh  my gods  thought vimes .  thousands of dwarfs die but that   s all right if a lump of rock survives .     i   m not a policeman here .  what can i do .         this hasn   t happened .     shrieked dee  his nerve cracking .     but everyone knows foreigners from ankh morpork do not mind their own business .         ah   you mean   given that you don   t want people to know about this   it would look bad if you appeared to be too excited   but you can   t be blamed if a stupid flatfoot pokes his nose into things    .      dee waved his hands in the air .     this wasn   t my idea .         look  the security you have got here would disgrace a child   s piggy bank .  i can think of two or three ways of getting the scone out of here .  what about the secret passage into this room .         i know of no secret passage into this room .         oh  good .  at least we   ve ruled out something .  go and wait by the boat .  corporal littlebottom and i have to talk about some things .      dee left reluctantly .  vimes waited until the dwarf was visible in the glow of the candles beyond the weighing bridge .      what a mess     he said .     locked room mysteries are even worse when they leave the room unlocked .         you   re thinking that dozy might have worn bags of sand under his robes  aren   t you  sir     said cheery .   no  thought vimes .  i wasn   t .  but now i know how a dwarf would solve this .      possibly     he said aloud .     grubby white sand can   t be uncommon .  you   d add a bit of sand every day  yes .  just enough not to trigger the scales .  finally you   ve got   how much does the scone weigh .         about sixteen pounds  sir .         all right .  dump the sand on the floor  shove the scone under your robes  and   it might just work .         risky  sir .         but no one thinks anyone is really going to try to steal the scone .  would you try to tell me that four guards sitting in that little guardhouse on a twelve hour shift will be alert all the time .  that   s enough for a hand of poker .         i suppose they rely on the fact that they   d know when a boat came up  sir .         right .  big mistake .  and you know what .  i bet that when a boat   s just gone down  that   s the time they   re least alert .  cheery  if a human could get in here  they could get into the scone room .  they   d have to be nimble and a good swimmer  but they could do it .         the guards on the gates were pretty keen  sir .         well  yes .  guards always are  just after a theft .  smart as foxes and sharp as knives  just in case anyone wonders if it was them who dropped off to sleep at the wrong time .  i   m a copper  cheery .  i know how dull guarding can be .  especially when you know that no one is ever going to steal what you   re guarding .      he scuffed the sand with his boot .      they were looking hard at every cart that went in or out this morning .  but that was because the scone had been stolen .  it   s at times like this you get very official  very efficient and very pointless activity .  don   t try to tell me that last week they opened every barrel and prodded every load of hay .  even the stuff coming in .  can you see dee .  is he looking at me .      cheery peered around vimes .      no  sir .         good .      vimes walked over to the tunnel  pressed his back against a wall  took a deep breath  and walked his legs up the opposite wall .  then he eased his way out over the plates of the weigh bridge  inched along with feet and shoulder blades and  wincing at every protest from his knees  eventually dropped down .  he strolled over to dee  who was talking to the guards .      how did           never mind     said vimes .     let   s just say i   m longer than a dwarf  shall we .         have you solved it .         no .  but i have an idea .         really .  already .     said dee .     and what is that .         i   m still working it out     said vimes .     but it   s lucky the king told you to ask me  dee .  one thing i have found out is that no dwarf will give you the right answer .         the opera was just ending as vimes slipped into the seat beside sybil .      have i missed anything .     he said .      it   s very good .  where have you been .         you wouldn   t believe me .      he stared  unseeing  at the stage .  a couple of dwarfs were engaged in a very careful mock battle .   all right  then .  if it was politics it was   well  politics .  there was nothing he could do about politics .  so   think about it as a crime     what was the simple solution .  best to start with the first rule of policing  suspect the victim .  vimes wasn   t quite sure who the victim was here  though .  so   suspect the witness .  that was another good rule .  that meant the late dozy .  he could have walked out with the scone days before he    discovered    the loss .  he could have done just about anything .  the way the thing was guarded was a joke .  nobby and colon could have done it better .  much better  he corrected himself  because they had devious little minds and that was what made them coppers   the guards on the scone were honorable dwarfs  the last people you wanted to entrust with anything .  you wanted sneaky people for a job like this .   but   it made no sense .  he   d be the prime suspect .  vimes wasn   t well up on dwarf law  but he suspected that there was not a huge friendly future in store for a prime suspect  especially if no other solution was forthcoming .   maybe he   d snapped after sixty years of changing candles .  that didn   t sound right .  anyone who could put up with a job like that for ten years would probably run in their groove for the rest of eternity .  anyway  dozy had now gone to the great big gold mine in the sky or deep underground or whatever it was dwarfs believed in .  he wasn   t going to be answering any questions .   he could solve this  vimes told himself .  everything he needed was there  if only he asked the right questions and thought the right way .   but his vimesish instincts were trying to tell him something else .   this was a crime   if holding a piece of property to ransom was technically a crime   but it wasn   t the crime .   there was another crime here .  he knew it in the same way that a fisherman spots the shoal by the ripple on the water .   the fight on stage continued .  it was slowed by the need to stop after every gingerly exchanged ax blow for a song  probably about gold .      er   what   s this all about .     he said .      it   s nearly over     whispered sybil .     they   ve only performed the bit concerning the baking of the scone  really  but at least they   ve included the ransom aria .  ironhammer escapes from prison with the help of skalt  steals the truth that agi has hidden  conceals it by baking it into the scone  and persuades the guards around bloodaxe   s camp to let him pass .  the dwarfs believe that truth was once a  a thing   a sort of ultimate rare metal  really   and the last bit of it is inside the scone .  and the guards can   t resist  because of the sheer power of it .  the song is about how love  like truth  will always reveal itself  just as the grain of truth inside the scone makes the whole thing true .  it is actually one of the finest pieces of music in the world .  gold is hardly mentioned at all .      vimes stared .  he got lost in any song more complex than the sort with titles like    where has all the custard gone  jelly   s just not the same  .         bloodaxe and ironhammer     he muttered  aware that dwarfs around them were giving him annoyed looks     which one was           cheery told you .  they were both dwarfs     said sybil  sharply .      ah     said vimes glumly .   he was always a little out of his depth in these matters .  there were men  and there were women .  he was clear on that .  sam vimes was an uncomplicated man when it came to what poets called    the lists of love .      in some parts of the shades  he knew  people adopted a more pick and mix approach .  vimes looked upon this as he looked upon a distant country  he   d never been there  and it wasn   t his problem .  it just amazed him what people got up to when they had time on their hands .   he just found it hard to imagine a world without a map .  it wasn   t that the dwarfs ignored sex  it really didn   t seem important to them .  if humans thought the same way  his job would be a lot simpler .   there seemed to be a deathbed scene now .  it was a little hard for vimes  with his shaky command of ankh morpork street dwarfish  to follow what was going on .  someone was dying  and someone else was very sorry about it .  both the main singers had beards you could hide a chicken in .  they weren   t bothering to act  apart from infrequently waving an arm in the direction of the other singer .   but there were sobs all around him  and occasionally the trumpeting of a blown nose .  even sybil   s lower lip was trembling .   it   s just a song  he wanted to say .  it   s not real .  crime and streets and chases   they   re real .  a song won   t get you out of a tight corner .  try waving a large bun at an armed guard in ankh morpork and see how far it gets you     he shouldered his way through the throng after the performance  which from the humans present had received the usual warm reception that such things always got from people who hadn   t really understood what was going on but rather felt that they should have .   dee was talking to a black clad  heavily built young man who looked vaguely familiar to vimes .  vimes must have looked familiar to him as well  because he gave him a nod just short of offensiveness .      ah  your grace vimes     he said .     and did you enjoy the opera .         especially the bit about the gold     said vimes .     and you are    .      the man clicked his heels .     wolf von uberwald .      something went bing in vimes   s head .  and his eyes picked up details   the slight lengthening of the incisors  the way the blond hair was so thick around the collar        angua   s brother .     he said .      yes  your grace .         wolf the wolf  eh .         thank you  your grace     said wolf solemnly     that is very funny .  indeed  yes .  it is quite some time since i heard that one .  your ankh morpork sense of humor .         but you   re wearing silver on your   uniform .  those   insignias .  wolf heads biting the lightning        wolf shrugged .     ah  the kind of thing a policeman would notice .  but they are nickel .         i don   t recognize the regiment .         we are more of a   movement     said wolf .   the stance was angua   s  too .  it was the poised  fight or flight look  as if the whole body was a spring eager to unwind and    flight    wasn   t an option .  people in the presence of angua when she was in a bad mood tended to turn up their collars without quite knowing why .  but the eyes were different .  they weren   t like angua   s .  they weren   t even like the eyes of a wolf .   no animal had eyes like that  but vimes saw them occasionally in some of ankh morpork   s less salubrious drinking establishments  where if you were lucky you   d get out the door before the drink turned you blind .   colon called that sort of person a    bottle covey     nobby preferred    soddin    nutter    but whatever the name vimes recognized a head butting  eye gouging  down and dirty bastard when he saw one .  in a fight you   d have no alternative but to lay him out or cut him down  because otherwise he   d do his very best to kill you .  most bar fighters wouldn   t usually go that far  because killing a copper was known to be bad news for the murderer and anyone else who knew him  but your true nutter wouldn   t worry about that because  while he was fighting  his brain was somewhere else .   wolf smiled .      there is a problem  your grace .         what .  no .  just   thinking .  i feel i   ve met you before    .         you called on my father this morning .         ah  yes .         we don   t always change for   visitors  your grace     said wolf .  there was an orange light in his eyes now .  up until then  vimes had thought that    glowing eyes    was just a figure of speech .      if you   ll excuse me  i do need to talk to the ideas taster for a moment     said vimes .     politics .      dee followed him into a quiet spot .      yes .         did dozy go to the scone cave at the same time every day .         i believe so .  it depended on his other duties .         so he didn   t go in at the same time every day .  right .  when does the guard change .         at each three o   clock .         did he go in before the guard change or afterward .         that would depend on           oh dear .  don   t the guards write anything down .      dee stared at vimes .      are you saying he could have gone in twice in one day .         very good .  but i   m saying someone might have .  a dwarf comes up in a boat alone  carrying a couple of candles   would the guards take that much interest .  and if another dwarf carrying a couple of candles came up an hour or so later  when the new guards were there   well  is there any real risk .  even if our faker was noticed  he   d just have to mutter something about   oh  bad candles or something .  damp wicks .  anything .      dee looked distant .      it is still a great risk     he said at last .      if our thief was keeping an eye on the guard changes  and knew where the real dozy was  it   d be worth it  wouldn   t it .  for the scone .      dee shuddered  and then nodded .     in the morning the guards will be closely questioned     he said .      by me .         why .         because i know what kind of questions get answers .  we   ll set up an office here .  we   ll find out the movements of everyone and talk to all the guards  okay .  even the ones on the gates .  we   ll find out who went in and out .         you already think you know something           let   s say some ideas are forming  shall we .         i will   see to matters .      vimes straightened up and walked back to lady sybil  who stood like an island in a sea of dwarfs .  she was talking animatedly to several of them who vimes vaguely recognized as performers in the opera .      what have you been up to  sam .     she said .      politics  i   m afraid     said vimes .     and   trusting my instincts .  can you tell me who   s watching us .         oh  it   s that game  is it .     said sybil .  she smiled happily  and in the tones of someone chatting about inconsequential things  said     practically everyone .  but if i was handing out prizes  i   d choose the rather sad lady in the little group just off to your left .  she   s got fangs  sam .  and pearls  too .  they don   t exactly accessorize .         can you see wolfgang .         er   no  not now you come to mention it .  that   s odd .  he was around a moment ago .  have you been upsetting people .         i think i may let people upset themselves     said vimes .      good for you .  you do that so well .      vimes half turned  like someone just taking in the view .  in among the human guests  the dwarfs moved and clustered .  five or six would come together  and talk animatedly .  then one would drift away and join another group .  he might be replaced .  and sometimes an entire group would spread out like the debris of an explosion  each member heading toward another group .   vimes got the impression that there was kind of structure behind all this  some slow  purposeful dance of information .  mineshaft meetings  he thought .  small groups  because there wouldn   t be room for more .  and you don   t talk too loudly .  and then when the group decides  every member is an ambassador for that decision .  the word spreads out in circles .  it   s like running a society on formal gossip .   it occurred to him that it was also a way in which two plus two could be debated and weighed and considered and discussed until it became four and a bit  or possibly an egg .    occasionally a dwarf would stop and stare at him before hurrying away .      we   re supposed to go in for supper  dear     said sybil  indicating the general drift toward a brightly lit cave .      oh dear .  quaffing  do you think .  rats on sticks .  where   s detritus .         over there  talking to the cultural attach   from genua .  that   s the man with the glazed expression .      as they got closer vimes heard detritus   s voice in full expansive explanation        and den dere   s dis big room wid all seats in it  wid red walls and dem big gold babies climbin    up der pillar only  don   t worry     cos dey   re not real gold babies  dey   re only made of plaster or somethin          there was a pause as detritus considered matters .     an    also i don   t reckon it   s real gold  neither     cos some bugger   d have pinched it if it was   and in front of der stage dere   s dis big pit where all der musicians sits .  and dat   s about it for dat room .  in der next room der   s all dese marble pillars  an    on der floor dey got red carpetting           detritus .     said lady sybil .     i do hope you   re not monopolizing this gentleman .         no  i bin tellin    him all about der culture we got in ankh morpork     said detritus airily .     i know just about every inch of der op   ra house .         yes     said the cultural attach    in a stunned voice .     and i must say i   m particularly interested in visiting the art gallery and seeing       he shuddered          der picture of dis woman  i don   t reckon der artist knew how to do a smile prop   ly  but the frame   s got to be worth a bob or two .     it sounds like the experience of a lifetime .  good evening to you .         you know  i don   t fink he knows a lot of culture     said detritus  as the man strode away .      do you think people will miss us if we slip away .     said vimes  looking around .     it   s been a long day and i want to think about things           sam  you are the ambassador  and ankh morpork is a world power     said sybil .     we can   t just sneak off .  people will comment .      vimes groaned .  so inigo was right  when vimes sneezes  ankh morpork blows its nose .      your excellency .      he looked down at two dwarfs .      the low king will see you now     said one of them .      er           we will have to be officially presented     lady sybil hissed .      what  even detritus .         yes .         but he   s a troll .     it had seemed amusing at the time .   vimes was aware of a drift in the crowds across the floor of the huge cave .  there was a certain movement to them  a flow in the current of people toward one end of the cave .  there was really no option but to join it .   the low king was on a small throne under one of the chandeliers .  there was a metal canopy over it  already encrusted with marvelous stalactites of wax .   around him  watching the crowd  were four dwarfs  tall for dwarfs  and looking rather menacing in their dark glasses .  each one was holding an ax .  they spent all their time staring very hard at people .   the king was talking to the genuan ambassador .  vimes looked sideways at cheery and detritus .  suddenly  bringing them here wasn   t such a good idea .  in his official robes  the king looked a lot more   distant  and a lot harder to please .   hang on  he told himself .  they are ankh morpork citizens .  they   re not doing anything wrong .   and then he argued  they   re not doing anything wrong in ankh morpork .   the line moved along .  their party was almost in the presence .  the armed dwarfs were all watching detritus now  and holding their axes in a slightly less relaxed way .   detritus appeared not to notice .      dis place is even more cult   ral than the op   ra house     he said  gazing around respectfully .     dem chandeliers must weigh a ton .      he reached up and rubbed his head  and then inspected his fingers .   vimes glanced up .  something warm  like a buttered raindrop  hit his cheek .   as he brushed it away  he saw the shadows move     things happened with treacle slowness .  he saw it as if he were watching himself from a little way away .   he saw himself push cheery and sybil roughly  heard himself shout something  and watched himself dive toward the king  snatching the dwarf up as an ax clanged into his backplate .   then he was rolling  with the angry dwarf in his arms  and the chandelier was halfway through its fall  candle flames streaming  and there was detritus  raising his hands with a calculating look on his face     there was a moment of stillness and silence as the troll caught the descending mountain of light .  and then physics returned  in an exploding cloud of dwarfs  debris  molten wax and tumbling  flaring candles .      vimes woke up in utter darkness .  he blinked and touched his eyes to make sure that they were open .   then he sat up and his head thumped against stone  and then there was light  vicious yellow and purple lights  filling his life very suddenly .  he lay back until they went away .   he took a personal itinerary .  his cloak  helmet  sword and armor had all gone .  he was left in his shirt and breeches  and while this place was not freezing  it had a clamminess that was already working its way through to his bones .   right     he wasn   t sure how long it took him to get a feel for the cell  but a feel it was .  he moved by inches  waving his arms ahead of him like a man practicing a very slow martial art against the darkness .   even then  the senses became unreliable in the total black .  he followed the wall carefully  followed another wall  followed a wall which yielded  under his fingertips  the outline of a small door with a handle  and found the wall which had the stone slab against it on which he   d awoken .   what made this all the harder was having to do this with his head sunk against his chest .  vimes wasn   t a very tall man .  if he had been  he   d probably have cracked his skull when he woke up .   without any other aids to rely on  he walked the length of the walls using his copper   s pace .  he knew exactly how long it took him  swinging his legs easily  to walk across the brass bridge back home .  a little bit of muzzy mental arithmetic was needed  but eventually he decided that the room was ten feet square .   one thing that vimes did not do was shout    help .  help .     he was in a cell .  someone had put him in a cell .  it was reasonable to assume  therefore  that whoever had done this wasn   t interested in his opinions .   he groped his way to the stone slab again and lay down .  as he did so  something rattled .   his patted his pockets and brought out what felt and sounded very much like a box of matches .  there were only three left .   so   resources   the clothes he stood up in  and a few matches .   now to work out what the hell was going on .   he remembered seeing the chandelier .  he thought he remembered seeing detritus actually catch the thing .  and there had been a lot of screaming and shouting and running around  while in his arms the king swore at vimes as only a dwarf could swear .  then someone had hit him .   there was also an ache across his back where an ax had been turned aside by his armor .  he felt a twitch of national pride at that thought .  ankh morpork armor had stood up to the blow .  admittedly  it was probably made in ankh morpork by dwarfs from uberwald  using steel smelted from uberwald iron  but it damn well was ankh morpork armor  just the same .   there was a pillow on the slab  made in uberwald .   as vimes turned his head  the pillow went  very faintly  clink .  this was a sound he didn   t associate with feathers .   in the darkness  he picked up the sack and  after resorting to his teeth  managed to rip a hole in the heavy material .   if what he drew up had ever been part of a bird  it wasn   t one vimes would ever like to meet .  it felt very much like inigo   s one shot .  a finger inserted very gingerly into the end told vimes that it was loaded  too .   just one shot  he remembered .  but it was one people didn   t know you had     on the other hand  the tooth fairy probably wasn   t responsible for putting it in the pillow  unless she   d been having to face some particularly difficult children lately .   he slipped it back into the bag when he became aware of a light .  it was the faintest glow  showing that the door contained a barred window and that there were shadowy figures on the other side of it .      are you awake  your grace .  this is very unfortunate .         dee .         yes .         and you   ve come to tell me this has all been some terrible mistake .         alas  no .  i am convinced of your innocence  of course .         really .  me too     growled vimes .     in fact i   m so convinced of my innocence i don   t even know what it is i   m innocent of .  let me out or              or you will stay in  i am afraid     said dee .     it is a very strong door .  you are not in ankh morpork  your grace .  i will of course communicate your predicament to your lord vetinari as soon as possible  but i understand that the message tower has been badly damaged           my predicament is that you   ve locked me up .  why .  i saved your king  didn   t i .         there is   conflict           someone let that chandelier down .         yes  indeed .  a member of your staff  it appears .         you know that can   t be true .  detritus and littlebottom were with me when           mister skimmer was on your staff .         he   yes  but   i   he wouldn   t           i believe you have such a thing in ankh morpork called the guild of assassins .     said dee  calmly .     correct me if i am wrong .         he was up at the tower .         the damaged tower .         it was damaged before he       vimes stopped .     why would he smash up one of the towers .         i did not say he would     said dee .  the flat calm was still there .     and then  your grace  it has been suggested that you gave a signal just before the thing came down           what .         a hand to the cheek  or something .  it has been suggested that you anticipated the event .         the thing was swaying .  look  let me talk to skimmer .         do you have supernatural powers  your grace .      vimes hesitated .      he   s dead .         we believe he became entangled in the winch mechanism in the process of releasing the chandelier .  three dwarfs were dead around him .         he wouldn   t        vimes stopped again .  of course he wouldn   t .  it   s just that he   s a member of this guild we have  and you certainly know that  don   t you     dee must have seen his expression .      quite so  quite so .  everything will be investigated thoroughly .  the innocent have nothing to fear .      the news that they have nothing to fear is guaranteed to strike fear into the hearts of innocents everywhere .      what have you done with sybil .         done  your grace .  why   nothing .  we are not barbarians .  we have heard nothing but good reports of your wife .  she is upset  of course .      vimes groaned .     and detritus and littlebottom .         well  of course they were under your command  your grace .  and one is a troll and the other is   dangerously different .  and that is why  and precisely for that reason  that they are under house arrest in your own embassy .  we do respect the traditions of diplomacy  and we will not have it said that we have acted out of malice .     dee sighed .     and then  of course  there is the other matter           are you going to accuse me of stealing the scone  too .         you laid hands on the king .      vimes stared .     huh .  a ton of candlestick was about to fall on him .         this has been pointed out           and i   m imprisoned for saving him from an assassination attempt i planned .         are you .         no .  look  the thing was coming down  what else should i have done .  tugged at the carpet and try to drag him away .         yes  yes  i understand .  but precedent in this area is very clear .  in       when the king at the time fell into a lake  not one member of his staff dared touch him because of the ruling  and the subsequent finding was that they had acted correctly .  it is forbidden to touch the king .  i have of course explained to the conclave that this is not the ankh morpork way  but   this is not ankh morpork .         i don   t need everyone reminding me about that .         you will remain   our guest while investigations continue .  food and drink will be brought to you .         and light .         of course .  excuse our lack of consideration .  stand back from the door  please .  the guards with me are armed and they are   uncomplicated people .      the grille on the door was swung back .  a glowing wire cage was put on the ledge .      what   s this .  a sick glow worm .         it is a kind of beetle  yes .  you will find that it will very soon seem quite bright .  we are very accustomed to darkness .         look     said vimes  as the grille was shut again     you know this is ridiculous .  i   don   t know what the position is with mister skimmer  but i damn well intend to find out .  and there   s the scone theft  i   m pretty certain i   m close to working that out  too .  if you let me return to the embassy  where else could i go .         we would not wish to find out .  you may just feel that life would be more pleasant in ankh morpork .         really .  and how would we get there .         you may have friends in unexpected places .      vimes thought of the evil little weapon in the pillow .      you will not be badly treated .  this is our way     said dee .     i will return when i have news .         hey        but dee was a retreating shape in the crepid  almost light .   in vimes   s cell  the glow beetle was doing its best .  all it managed to achieve  though  was to turn the darkness into a variety of green shadows .  you could find your way with it without walking into walls  but that was about the extent of it .   one shot  that they didn   t know you had .   that   d probably get him out of the door .  into a corridor .  underground .  full of dwarfs .   on the other hand   it was amazing how the evidence could stack up against you when people wanted it to .   anyway  vimes was an ambassador .  what happened to diplomatic immunity .  but that was hard to argue when you were faced by uncomplicated people with weaponry  there was a risk that they   d experiment to see if it was true .   one shot they didn   t expect     sometime later there was a rattling of keys and the door was pulled open .  vimes could make out the shape of two dwarfs .  one was holding an ax  the other was bearing a tray .   the dwarf with the ax motioned vimes to step back .   an ax wasn   t a good idea  vimes considered .  it was always the weapon of choice amongst dwarfs  but it wasn   t sensible in a confined space .   he raised his hands and  as the other dwarf walked cautiously over to the stone slab  let them move toward the back of his neck .   these dwarfs were nervous of him .  perhaps they didn   t see humans very often .   they   d remember this one .      want to see a trick .     said vimes .      grz   dak .         watch this     said vimes  and brought his hands around and shut his eyes just before the match flared .   he heard the ax drop as its owner tried to cover his face .  that was an unexpected bonus  but there wasn   t time to thank the god of desperate men .  vimes plunged forward  kicked as hard as he could  and heard an    oof    of expelled breath .  then he leapt into the patch of darkness that contained the other dwarf  found a head  spun around and rammed it into an unseen wall .   the other dwarf was trying to get to his feet .  vimes fumbled for him in the gloom  pulled him up by his jerkin  and rasped     someone left me a weapon .  they wanted me to kill you .  remember that .  i could have killed you .      he punched the dwarf in the stomach .  this was no time to play by the marquis of fantailler rules .    then he turned  snatched the little cage containing the light beetle  and headed for the door .   there was a feeling of passageway  stretching off in both directions .  vimes paused for just long enough to sense the draft on his face  and headed that way .   another glow beetle was hanging in a cage a little distance off .  it illuminated  if such a bright word could be used for a light that merely made the darkness less black  a huge circular opening in which a fan turned lazily .   the blades were so slow that vimes was able to step between them  into the velvet cavern beyond .   someone really wants me dead  he thought  as he inched his way along the nearest invisible wall with his face to the draft .  one shot they weren   t expecting   but someone was expecting it  weren   t they .   if you want to get a prisoner out of the clink  then you gave him a key  or a file .  you didn   t give him a weapon .  a key might get him out  a weapon would get him killed .   he stopped  one foot over emptiness .  the glow beetle revealed a hole in the floor .  it had the huge suckingness of depth .   then he gripped the beetle   s basket between his teeth  took a few steps back and completely misjudged the distance .  he hit the other side of the hole with every rib  both arms flat on the floor beyond .   a bit of ankh morpork sense of humor hissed between his teeth .   he scrabbled his way onto the cave floor and got his breath back .  then he took the one shot out of his pocket  fired it into the floor  tossed it into the hole   it clattered and echoed for some time   and moved on  keeping his face toward the cold air .      this wasn   t a tunnel anymore .  it was the bottom of a shaft .  but the green glow lit up something heaped in the middle .   vimes picked up a handful of snow and  when he looked up  a flake melted on his face .   he grinned in the dark .  the beetle light just caught the edge of the spiral stairs fixed to the rock .      stairs    turned out to be a generous description .  when the shaft had been cut  the dwarfs had made holes in the stone and hammered thick balks of timber into them .  he tried one or two .  they seemed sturdy enough .  with care  he   d be able to scramble     he was a long way up before one snapped .  he flung out his hands and caught the next one  his grip slipping on the wet wood .  the glow beetle disappeared downward and vimes  swinging back and forth from his precarious handhold  watched the circle of dim green light dwindle to a dot  and vanish .   then the realization crept over him that there was no way he would be able to pull himself up .  his fingers were numb  but the rest of his entire life consisted of the amount of time they could maintain a grip on the clammy step above him .   call it a minute  perhaps .   there were a lot of things that could profitably be done in a minute  but most of them couldn   t be done with no hands while hanging in darkness over a long drop .   he lost his grip .  a moment later he smacked into the spiral of logs one turn below  which parted company with the wall .   man and timber fell one more turn .  vimes landed with a rib bending thump across one step  while those around it gave way .  rocking gently on the one tough log  he listened to the thuds and booms as the fallen timber continued to the bottom of the shaft .                .     vimes had intended to swear  but the fall had knocked the breath out of him .   he hung like a folded pair of old trousers .   it had been a long time since he   d slept .  whatever he   d been doing on the slab  it hadn   t been sleep .  normal sleep didn   t leave your mouth feeling as though glue had been poured into it .   and only this morning the new ambassador for ankh morpork had strolled out to present his credentials .  only this evening ankh morpork   s commander of police had set out to solve a simple little theft .  and now he was dangling halfway up a freezing shaft  with a few inches of old and unreliable wood between him and a brief trip to the next world .   all he could hope for was that his whole life wasn   t going to pass before his eyes .  there were some bits of it he didn   t want to remember .      ah   sir samuel .  bad luck .  you were doing so well .      he opened his eyes .   a faint purple light just above him illuminated the form of the lady margolotta .  she was sitting on empty space .      can i give you a lift .     she said .   vimes shook his head  muzzily .      if it makes you feel any better  i really don   t like doing this     said the vampire .     it   s so   expected of one .  oh dear .  that rotten old log doesn   t look very        the log snapped .  vimes landed spread eagled on the turn below  but only for a moment .  several stairs broke and dropped him a further flight .  this time  he caught hold of one and was  once again  dangling .   lady margolotta descended regally .   far below  the broken wood boomed .      now  in theory this might be an almost survivable way of getting back down     said the vampire .     unfortunately  i fear that the descending logs have smashed many of the ones below .      vimes shifted .  his handhold seemed secure .  it might just be possible to pull himself up        i knew you were behind this     he muttered  trying to will some life into his shoulder muscles .      no  you didn   t .  you knew that the scone wasn   t stolen  though .      vimes stared at the serenely floating shape .      the dwarfs wouldn   t think that       he began .  the log under him gave the little nasty movement that announces to any luckless passengers that it is about to land .   lady margolotta drifted closer .      i know you hate vampires     she said .     it   s quite usual  for your personality type .  it   s the   penetrative aspect .  but if i vas you  right now  i   d ask myself   do i hate them with all my life .      she held out a hand .      just one bite   ll end all my troubles  eh .     vimes snarled .      one bite would be one too many  sam vimes .      the wood cracked .  she grabbed his wrist .   if he   d thought about it at all  vimes would have expected to be dangling from a vampire now .  instead  he was simply floating .      don   t think of letting go     said margolotta  as they rose gently up the shaft .      one bite would be too many .     said vimes .  he recognized the mangled mantra .     you   re a   a teetotaler .         almost four years now .         no blood at all .         oh yes .  animal .  it   s rather kinder to them than slaughter  don   t you think .  of course  it makes them docile  but frankly a cow is unlikely ever to vin the thinker of the year award .  i   m on a vagon  mister vimes .         the wagon .  we call it the wagon     said vimes weakly .     and   that replaces human blood .         like lemonade replaces vhisky .  believe me .  however  the intelligent mind can find a   substitute .     the sides of the shaft dropped away and they were in clear  freezing air  which knifed through vimes   s shirt .  they drifted sideways a little  and then vimes was dropped into knee deep snow .      one of the better things about our dwarfs is that they don   t often try something new and they never let go of anything old     said the vampire  hovering over the snow .     you weren   t hard to find .         where am i .     vimes looked around at rocks and trees mounded in snow .      in the mountains  quite a long way viddershins of the town  mister vimes .  goodbye .         you   re going to leave me here .         i   m sorry .  you vere the one who escaped .  i am certainly not here .  me  a vampire  interfering in the affairs of the dwarfs .  unthinkable .  but let us just say   i like people to have an even chance .         it   s freezing .  i haven   t even got a coat .  what is it you want .         you have freedom  mister vimes .  isn   t that vhat everyone vants .  isn   t it supposed to give you a lovely varm glow .      lady margolotta disappeared into the snow .   vimes shivered .  he hadn   t realized how warm it had been underground .  or what time it was .  there was a dim  a very dim light .  was this just after sunset .  was it almost dawn .   the flakes were piling up on his damp clothes  driven by the wind .   freedom could get you killed .   shelter   that was essential .  the time of day and a precise location were no use to the dead .  they always knew what time it was and where they were .   he moved away from the open shaft and staggered into the trees  where the snow wasn   t so deep .  it gave off a light  fainter than a sick beetle  as if snow somehow absorbed it from the air as it fell .   vimes wasn   t good at forests .  they were things you saw on the horizon .  if he   d thought about them at all  he   d imagined a lot of trees  standing like poles  brown at the bottom  bushy and green at the top .   here there were humps  and bumps  and dark branches weighted and creaking under the snow .  it fell around him with a hiss .  occasionally lumps of the stuff would slide from somewhere above  and there would be another shower of frigid crystals as a branch sprang back .   there was a track of sorts  or at least a wider  smoother expanse of snow .  vimes followed it  on the basis that there was no more sensible choice .  the warm glow of freedom only lasted so long .   vimes had city eyes .  he   d watched coppers develop them .  a trainee copper who glanced once at a street was just learning  and if he didn   t learn quicker he   d become highly experienced at dying .  one who   d been on the streets for a while paid attention  took in details  noted shadows  saw background and foreground and the people who were trying not to be in either .  angua looked at streets like that .  she worked at it .   the long term coppers  like even nobby when he was on a good day  glanced once at a street and that was enough  because they   d seen everything .   maybe there were   country eyes .  forest eyes .  vimes saw trees  mounds  snow and not much else .   the wind was getting up  and began to howl among the trees .  now the snow stung .   trees .  branches .  snow .   vimes kicked a mound beside the track .  snow slid off dark pine needles .   he dropped to his hands and knees and pushed forward     ah     it was still cold  and there was some snow on the dead needles  but the weighted branches had spread around the trunk like a tent .  he pulled himself in  congratulating himself .  it was windless here and  contrary to all common sense  the blanket of snow above him seemed to make it warmer .  it even smelled warm   sort of   animal     three wolves  lying lazily around the trunk of the tree  were watching him with interest .   vimes added metaphorical freezing to the other sort .  the animals didn   t seem frightened .   wolves .   and that was about it .  it made as much sense to say  snow .  or  wind .  right now  those were more certain killers .   he heard somewhere that wolves wouldn   t attack you if you faced them down .   the trouble was that he was going to sleep soon .  he could feel it creeping over him .  he wasn   t thinking right  and every muscle ached .   outside  the wind moaned .  and his grace the duke of ankh morpork fell asleep .   he awoke with a snort and  to his surprise  all his arms and legs as well .  a drop of chilled water  melted from the roof just above by the heat of his body  ran down his neck .  his muscles didn   t hurt anymore .  he couldn   t feel most of them .   and the wolves had gone .  there was trampled snow at the far end of the makeshift lair  and light so bright that he groaned .   it turned out to be daylight  from a bright sky bluer than any vimes had seen  so blue that it seemed to shade into purple at the zenith .  he stepped out into a sugar frosted world  crunchy and glittering .   wolf tracks led away between the trees .  it occurred to vimes that following them would not be a life enhancing move  perhaps last night had been understood as time out  but today was a new day and probably the search was on for breakfast .   the sun felt warm  the air was cold  his breath hung in front of him .   there should be people around  shouldn   t there .  vimes was hazy on rural issues  but weren   t there supposed to be charcoal burners  woodcutters and   he tried to think   little girls taking goodies to granny .  the stories vimes had learned as a kid suggested that all forests were full of bustle  activity and the occasional scream .  but this place was silent .   he set off in a direction that appeared to head downward  on general principles .  food was the important thing .  he   d still got a couple of matches  and he could probably make a fire if he had to be out here another night  but it was a long time since the canap  s at the reception .   this is ankh morpork  trudging over and through the snow     after half an hour he reached the bottom of a shallow valley  where a stream splashed between encroaching banks of ice .  it steamed .   the water was warm to the touch .   he followed the banks for some way .  they were crisscrossed with animal tracks .  here and there the water pooled in deep hollows that smelled of rotten eggs .  around them the leafless bushes were heavy with ice  where the steam had frozen .   food could wait .  vimes stripped off his clothes and stepped into one of the deeper pools  yelping at the heat  and then lay back .   didn   t they do something like this up in nothingfjord .  he   d heard stories .  they had hot steamy baths and then ran around in the snow hitting one another with birch logs  didn   t they .  or something .  there was nothing really daft that some foreigner wouldn   t do  somewhere .   gods  it felt good .  hot water was civilization .  vimes could feel the stiffness in his muscles melting away in the warmth .   after a moment or two he splashed over to the bank and rummaged through his clothes until he found a flattened packet of cigars  containing a couple of things that  after the events of the past twenty four hours  looked like fossilized twigs .   he had two matches .   well  the hell with it .  anyone could light a fire with one match .   he lay back in the water .  that had been a good decision .  he could feel himself coming back together again  pulled into shape by the heat within and without        ah .  your grace        wolf von uberwald was sitting on the other bank .  he was stark naked .  a little vapor rose off him  as if he   d just been exerting himself .  muscles gleamed as though they   d been oiled .  they probably had been .      a run in the snow is such a thing  is it not .     said wolf pleasantly .     you are certainly learning the ways of uberwald  your grace .  lady sybil is alive and well and free to go back to your city when the passes are cleared .  i know you would wish to hear that .      other figures were approaching through the trees  men and women  all of them as unselfconsciously naked as wolf .   vimes realized he was a dead man bathing .  he could see it in wolf   s eyes .      nothing like a hot dip before breakfast     he said .      ah  yes .  we also have not  as yet  breakfasted     said wolf .  he stood up  stretched  and cleared the pool from a standing start .  vimes   s breeches were picked up and examined .      i threw inigo   s damn thing away     said vimes .     i don   t think a friend put it there .         it is all a great game  your grace     said wolf .     do not reproach yourself .  the strongest survive  which is as it should be .         dee planned this  did he .      wolf laughed .     the dear little dee .  oh  he had a plan .  it was a good little plan  although a touch insane .  happily  it will no longer be required .         you want the dwarfs to go to war .         strength is good     said wolf  folding vimes   s clothes neatly .     but like some other good things  it only remains good if it is not possessed by too many people .     he tossed the clothes as far as he could .      what is it you want me to say  your grace .     said wolf .     something like    you are going to die anyway so i might as well tell you     perhaps .         well  it   d be a help     said vimes .      you are going to die anyway .     wolf smiled .     why don   t you tell me .      talking gained time .  maybe those woodcutters and charcoal burners would be along at any minute .   if they hadn   t brought their axes everyone was going to be in big trouble .      i   m   pretty sure why the replica scone was stolen in ankh morpork     said vimes .     i   ve just got the inkling of an idea that a copy was made of it  which was smuggled here on one of our coaches .  diplomats don   t get searched .         well done .         shame igor came to unload when one of your boys was there  wasn   t it .         oh  it   s hard to hurt an igor .         you don   t care  do you .     said vimes .     a bunch of dwarfs want albrecht on the thro   the scone because they want to hang onto that old time certainty  and you just want dwarfs fighting .  and old albrecht wouldn   t even get the right scone back .         let us say that just now we find our interests converge  shall we .     said wolf .   out of the corner of his eye  vimes saw the other werewolves spreading out around the pool .      and now you   ve set me up     he said .     pretty amateurishly  i   d say .  but impressive  because dee couldn   t have had much time after he thought i was getting close .  it would have worked  too .  people aren   t good eyewitnesses .  i know .  they believe what they want to see and what people told them they saw .  it was a nice touch giving me that damn one shot .  he really must have hoped i   d kill to escape           is it not time you got out of that   pool .     said wolfgang .      you mean bath .     said vimes .  yes  there was a wince .  vimes registered it .  oh  you   re walking upright and talking  my lad  and you look strong as an ox   but something between a human and a wolf has a bit of dog in them  doesn   t it .         we have an ancient custom here     said wolf  looking away .     and it is a good one .  anyone can challenge us .  it   s a little   chase .  the great game .  a competition  if you like .  if they outrun us  they win four hundred crowns .  that is a very good sum .  a man may start a small business with it .  of course  as i can see you realize  if they don   t outrun us   the question of money does not arise .         does anyone ever win .     said vimes .  come on  woodcutters  the people need wood .      sometimes .  if they train well and know the country .  many a successful man in bonk owes his start in life to our little custom .  in your case  we will give you  oh  an hour   s lead .  for the sport of it .     he pointed .     bonk is five miles in that direction .  the lore says that you must not enter a dwelling until you get there .         and if i don   t run .         then it will be a really short event .  we do not like ankh morpork .  we do not want you here .         that   s odd     said vimes .   wolf   s broad brow wrinkled .      your meaning .         oh  it   s just that everywhere i go in ankh morpork i seem to bump into people who came from uberwald  you see .  dwarfs  trolls  humans .  all beavering away quite happily and writing letters home saying  come on  it   s great here   they don   t eat you alive for a dollar .      wolf   s lip curled  revealed a glint of incisor .  vimes had seen that look on angua   s face .  it meant she was having a bad hair day .  and a werewolf can have a bad hair day all over .   he pushed his luck .  it was clearly too weak to move by itself .      angua   s getting on well           vimes .  mister civilized .  ankh morpork .  you will run .      hoping that his legs would support him  vimes climbed out on the snow of the bank  as slowly as he dared .  there was laughter from the werewolves .      you go into the water wearing clothes .      vimes looked down at his streaming legs .      you   ve never seen drawers before .     he said .   wolf   s lip curled again .  he glanced triumphantly at the others .      behold   civilization .     he said .   vimes puffed life into his cigar  and looked around the frozen woodland with as much hauteur as he could muster .      four hundred crowns  did you say .     he said .      yes .      vimes sneered at the forest again .      what is that in ankh morpork dollars  do you know .  about a dollar fifty .         the question will not arise .     wolf bellowed .      well  i don   t want to have to spend it all here           run .         under the circumstances  then  i won   t ask if you have the money on you .      vimes walked away from the werewolves  glad that they couldn   t see his face and very much aware that the skin on his back wanted to crawl around to his front .   he kept moving calmly  his wet drawers beginning to crackle in the frosty air  until he was certain he was out of sight of the pack .   so  let   s see   they   ve got better strength than you  they know the country  and if they   re as good as angua they could track a fart through a skunk   s breakfast  and your legs hurt already .   so what are the plusses here .  well   you   ve made wolf really angry .   vimes broke into a run .   not much of a plus there then  all things considered .   vimes broke into a faster run .   off in the distance  wolves began to howl .      there is a saying  it won   t get better if you picket .   corporal nobbs or  rather  guild president c .  w .  st .  j .  nobbs  reflected on this .  a little early snow was fizzling in the air over the metal drum in which  in approved strike fashion  was glowing red hot in front of the watch house .   a main problem  as he saw it  was that there was something philosophically wrong with picketing a building that no one except a watchman wanted to enter in any case .  it is impossible to keep people out of something that they don   t want to go into .  it can   t be done .   the chant hadn   t worked .  an old lady had given him a penny .      colon  colon  colon .  out .  out .  out .     shouted reg shoe happily  waving his placard .      that doesn   t sound right  reg     said nobby .     sounds like surgery .      he looked at the other placards .  dorfl was holding a large  closely worded text  detailing their grievances in full  with references to watch procedures and citing a number of philosophical texts .  constable visit   s sandwich board  on the other hand  proclaimed  what profiteth it a kingdom if the oxen be deflated .  riddles ii  v   somehow  these cogent arguments did not seem to be bringing the city to its knees .   he turned at the sound of a coach pulling up and looked up at a door which had a crest consisting mainly of a black shield .  and above that  looking out of the window  was the face of lord vetinari .      ah  none other than corporal nobbs     said lord vetinari .   at this point nobby would have given quite a lot to be anyone other than corporal nobbs .   he wasn   t sure whether  as a striker  he should salute .  he saluted anyway  on the basis that a salute was seldom out of place .      i gather you have withdrawn your labor     lord vetinari went on .     in your case  i am sure this presented a good deal of difficulty .      nobby wasn   t certain about that sentence  but the patrician seemed quite amiable .      can   t stand by when the security of the city   s concerned  sir     he said  oozing affronted loyalty from every unblocked pore .   lord vetinari paused long enough for the peaceful  everyday sounds of a city apparently on the brink of catastrophe to filter into nobby   s consciousness .      well  of course i wouldn   t dream of interfering     he said at last .     this is guild business .  i   m sure his grace will understand fully when he returns .     he banged on the side of the coach .     drive on .      and the coach was gone .   a thought that had been nudging nobby for some time chose this moment to besiege his once again .   mr .  vimes is going to go spare .  he   s going to go mental .   lord vetinari sat back in his seat  smiling to himself .      er   did you mean that  sir .     said the clerk drumknott  who was sitting opposite .      certainly .  make a note to have the kitchen send them down cocoa and buns around three o   clock .  anonymously  of course .  it   s been a crime free day  drumknott .  very unusual .  even the thieves    guild is lying low .         yes  my lord .  i can   t imagine why .  when the cat   s away           yes  drumknott  but mice are happily unencumbered by apprehensions of the future .  humans  on the other hand  are .  and they know that vimes is going to be back in a week or so  drumknott .  and vimes will not be happy .  indeed  he will not .  and when a commander of the watch is unhappy  he tends to spread it around with a big shovel .      he smiled again .     this is the time for sensible men to be honest  drumknott .  i only hope colon is stupid enough to let it continue .      the snow fell faster .         how beautiful the snow is  sisters        three women sat at the window of their lonely house  looking out at the white uberwald winter .      and how cold the vind is     said the second sister .   the third sister  who was the youngest  sighed .     why do we always talk about the weather .         vhat else is there .         well  it   s either freezing cold or baking .  i mean  that   s it  really .         that is how things are in mother uberwald     said the oldest sister  slowly and sternly .     the vind and the snow and the boiling heat of summer           you know  i bet if we cut down the cherry orchard  i   m sure we could put in a roller skating rink           no .         how about a conservatory .  we could grow pineapples .         no .         if we moved to bonk we could get a big apartment for the cost of this place           this is our home  irina     said the eldest sister .     ah  a home of lost illusions and thwarted hopes           we could go out dancing and everything .         i remember vhen ve lived in bonk     said the middle sister dreamily .     things vere better then .         things vere alvays better then     said the oldest sister .   the youngest sister sighed  and looked out of the window .  she gasped .      there   s a man running through the cherry orchard .         a man .  vot could he possibly vant .      the youngest sister strained to see .      it   s looks like he wants   a pair a trousers           ah     said the middle sister dreamily .     trousers vere better then .         the hurrying pack stopped in a chilly blue valley when the howling filled the air .   angua loped back to the sledge  lifted out her bag of clothes with her jaws  glanced at carrot  and disappeared among the drifts .  a few moments later she walked back again  doing up her shirt .      wolfgang   s got some poor devil playing the game     she said .     i   m going to put a stop to it .  it was bad enough that father kept the tradition going  but at least he played fair .  wolfgang cheats .  they never win .         is this the game you told me about .         that   s right .  but father played by the rules .  if the runner was bright and nimble he got four hundred crowns and father had him to dinner at the castle .         if he lost  then your father had him for dinner out in the woods .         thank you for reminding me .         i was trying not to be nice .         you may have an undiscovered natural talent     said angua .     but no one had to run  is my point .  i won   t apologize .  i   ve been a copper in ankh morpork  remember .  city motto  you may not get killed .         actually  it   s           carrot .  i know .  and our family motto is homo homini lupus .     a man is a wolf to other men    .  how stupid .  do you think they mean that men are shy and retiring and loyal and kill only to eat .  of course not .  they mean that men act like men toward other men  and the worse they are  the more they think they   re really being like wolves .  humans hate werewolves because they see the wolf in us  but wolves hate us because they see the human inside   and i don   t blame them .         vimes veered away from the farmhouse and sprinted toward the nearby barn .  there had to be something in there .  even a couple of sacks would do .  the chafing qualities of frozen underwear can be seriously underestimated .   he   d been running for half an hour .  well  for twenty five minutes  really .  the other five had been spent limping  wheezing  clutching at his chest and wondering how you knew if you were having a heart attack .   the inside of the barn was   barnlike .  there were stacks of hay  dusty farm implements   and a couple of threadbare sacks  hanging on a nail .  he snatched one  gratefully .   behind him  the door creaked open .  he spun around  clutching the sack to him  and saw three very somberly dressed women watching him carefully .  one of them was holding a kitchen knife in a trembling hand .      have you come here to ravish us .     she said .      madam .  i   m being pursued by werewolves .      the three looked at one another .  to vimes  the sack suddenly seemed far too small .      vill that take you all day .     said one of the women .   vimes held the sack more tightly .      ladies .  please .  i need trousers .         ve can see that .         and a weapon  and boots if you   ve got them .  please .      they went into another huddle .      we have the gloomy and purposeless trousers of uncle vanya     said one  doubtfully .      he seldom vore them     said another .      and i have an ax in my linen cupboard     said the youngest .  she looked guiltily at the other two .     look  just in case i ever needed it  all right .  i wasn   t going to chop anything down .         i would be so grateful     said vimes .  he took in the good but old clothes  the faded gentility  and played the only card in his hand .     i am his grace the duke of ankh morpork  although i appreciate this fact is not evident at the        there was a three fold sigh .      ankh morpork .         you haf a magnificent opera house and many fine galleries .         such vonderful avenues .         a veritable heaven of culture and sophistication and unattached men of quality .         er   i said ankh morpork     said vimes .     with an a and an m .         ve have always dreamed of going there .         i   ll have three coach tickets sent along immediately after i get home     said vimes  his mind   s ear hearing the crunch of speeding paws over snow .     but  dear ladies  if you could fetch me those things        they hurried away  but the youngest lingered by the door .      do you have long  cold winters in ankh morpork .     she said .      just muck and slush  usually .         any cherry orchards .         i don   t think we have any  i   m afraid .      she punched the air .      yesss .      a few minutes later vimes was alone in the barn  wearing a pair of ancient black trousers that he   d tied at the waist with rope  and holding an ax which was surprisingly sharp .   he had five minutes  perhaps .  wolves probably didn   t stop to worry about heart attacks .   there was no point in simply running .  they could run faster .  he needed to stay near civilization and its hallmarks  like trousers .   maybe time was on vimes   s side .  angua was never very talkative about her world  but she had said that  in either shape  a werewolf slowly lost some of the skills of the other shape .  after several hours on two legs her sense of smell dropped from uncanny to merely good .  and after too long as a wolf   it was like being drunk  as far as vimes understood it  a little inner part of you was still trying to give instructions  but the rest of you was acting stupid .  the human part started to lose control     he looked around the barn again .  there was a ladder to an upper gallery .  he climbed it  and looked out of a glassless window across a snowy meadow .  there was a river in the distance  and what looked very much like a boathouse .   now   how would a werewolf think .      the werewolves slowed as they reached the building .  their leader glanced at a lieutenant  and nodded .  he loped off in the direction of the boathouse .  the others followed wolf inside .  the last became human for a moment to pull the doors shut and drop the bar across .   wolf stopped near the center of the barn .  hay had been scattered over the floor in great fluffy piles .   he scraped gently with a paw  and wisps fell away from a rope that was stretched taut .   wolf took a deep breath .  the other werewolves  sensing what was going to happen  looked away .  there was a moment of struggling shapelessness  and then he was rising slowly on two feet  blinking in the dawn of humanity .   that   s interesting  thought vimes  up on the gallery .  for a second or two after changing  they   re not entirely up on current events        oh  your grace     said wolf  looking around .     a trap .  how very   civilized .      he caught site of vimes  who was standing on the higher floor  by the window .      what was it supposed to do  your grace .      vimes reached down to the oil lamp .      it was supposed to be a decoy     he said .   he hurled the lamp down onto the dry hay  and flicked his cigar after it .  then he grabbed the ax and climbed through the window just as the spilled fat oil whump ed .   vimes dropped into the deep snow and ran toward the boathouse .   there were other tracks leading to it  not human .  when he reached the door he swung wildly at the darkness just inside  and his reward was a cut off yelp .   the skiff that was housed in the tumbledown shed was a quarter full of dark water  but he didn   t dare think about bailing yet .  he grabbed the dusty oars and rowed with considered effort and not much speed out onto the river .   he groaned .  wolf was trotting across the snow  with the rest of the pack behind him .  they all seemed to be there .   wolf cupped his hands .      very civilized  your grace .  but  you see  when you set fire to a barn full of wolves  they panic  your grace .  but when they   re werewolves  one of them just opens the door .  you cannot kill werewolves  mister vimes .         tell that to the one in the boathouse .     vimes shouted  as the current took the boat .   wolf looked into the shadows for a moment  and then cupped his hands again .      he will recover  mister vimes .      vimes swore under his breath  because despite all his hopes a couple of werewolves had plunged into the water upstream and were swimming strongly toward the opposite bank .  but that was another doggy thing  wasn   t it .  leap joyfully into any water outdoors  but fight like hell against a tub .   wolfgang had started to trot along the bank .  the ones in the water emerged on the far bank .  now they were keeping pace with the boat on both sides .   the current was carrying him faster now .  vimes started to bail with both hands .      you can   t outrun the river  wolf .     he shouted .      we don   t have to  mister vimes .  that is not the question .  the question is  can you outswim the waterfall .  see you later  civilized .      vimes looked around .  in the distance  the river ahead had a foreshortened look .  when he concentrated  the inner ear of terror could hear a distant roaring .   he snatched the oars again and tried to row upstream and  yes  it was possible to make headway against the current .  but he couldn   t keep rowing faster than wolves could run  and taking on two at once on the shore  when they were ready and waiting for him  was not an option .   if he went over the falls now  he might get to the bottom before they did .   that wasn   t a good sentence  however he tried it .   he took his hands off the oars and pulled in the mooring rope .  if i make a couple of loops  he thought  i can strap the ax onto my back     he had a mental picture of what could happen to a man who plunged into the cauldron below a waterfall with a sharp piece of metal attached to his body     good morning .   vimes blinked .  a tall dark robed figure was now sitting in the boat .      are you death .      it   s the scythe  isn   t it .  people always notice the scythe .      i   m going to die .      possibly .      possibly .  you turn up when people are possibly going to die .      oh yes .  it   s quite the new thing .  it   s because of the uncertainty principle .      what   s that .      i   m not sure .      that   s very helpful .      i think it means people may or may not die .  i have to say it   s playing hob with my schedule  but i try to keep up with modern thought .   the roar was a lot louder now .  vimes lay back in the boat and gripped the sides .   i   m talking to death  he thought  to take my mind off things .      didn   t i see you last month .  i was chasing bigger than small dave dave along peach pie street and i fell off that ledge .      that is correct .      but i landed on that cart .  i didn   t die .      but you might have .      but i thought we all had some kind of hourglass thing that said when we going to die .      now the roar was almost physical .  vimes redoubled his grip on the boat .   oh yes .  you do  said death .      but we might not .      no .  you will .  there is no doubt about that .      but you said        yes  it is a bit hard to understand  isn   t it .  apparently there    s this thing called the trousers of time  which is quite odd  because time certainly doesn   t     the boat went over the waterfall .   vimes had a thunderous sensation of pounding  thudding water  followed by the echoing ringing in his ears as he hit the pool below .  he fought his way to what passed for the surface and felt the current take him  slam him into a rock and then roll him away in the white water .   he flailed blindly and caught another rock  his body swinging around into a pool of comparative calm .  as he fought for breath he saw a gray shape leaping from stone to stone and then another dose of hell was unleashed as it landed  snarling  beside him .   he grabbed it desperately and hung on as it struggled to bite him .  then a paw flailed to gain purchase on the slippery stone and then  in sudden difficulties  responding automatically   it changed     it was as if the wolf shape became small and a man shape became bigger  in the same space  at the same time  with a moment of horrible distortion as the two forms passed through one another .   and then there was that moment he   d noticed before  a second of confusion     it was just long enough to ram the man   s head against the rock with every ounce of strength he could scrape together .  vimes thought he heard a crack .   he pushed himself back out into the current and let it carry him on  while he simply struggled to stay near the surface .  there was blood in the water .   he   d never killed someone with his bare hands before .  truth to tell  he   d never deliberately killed at all .  there had been deaths  because when people are rolling down a roof and trying to strangle one another  it   s sheer luck who is on top when they hit the ground .  but that was different .  he went to bed every night believing that .   his teeth were chattering and the bright sun made his eyes ache  but he felt   good .   he wanted to beat his chest and scream  in fact .   they   d been trying to kill him .   make them stay wolves  said a little inner voice .  the more time they spent on four legs  the less bright they   d become .   a deeper voice  red and raw  from much  much further inside  said  kill    em all .   the rage was boiling up now  fighting against the chill .   his feet touched bottom .   the river was broadening here  into something wide enough to be called a lake .  a wide ledge of ice had crept out from the bank  covered here and there with blown snow .  fog drifted across it  fog with a sulfurous smell .   there were still cliffs on the far side of the river .  one solitary werewolf  companion to the one now drifting on the current  was watching him from the nearest bank .   clouds were sliding across the sun and snow was falling again  in large  raggedy flakes .   vimes waded to the rim of ice and tried to pull himself up out of the water  but it creaked ominously under his weight and cracks zigzagged across its surface .   the wolf came closer  moving with caution .  vimes made another desperate attempt  a slab of ice came free and tipped up  and he disappeared under the water .   the creature waited a few moments and then inched farther out over the ice  growling as fine cracks spread out like stars under its paws .   a shadow moved in the shallow water below it .  there was an explosion of water and breath as vimes broke through the ice under the werewolf  grabbed it around the waist  and fell back .   a claw ripped along vimes   s side  but he gripped as hard as he could with arms and legs as they rolled under the ice .  it was a desperate test of lung capacity  he knew .  but he wasn   t the one who   d just had the air squeezed out of him .  he held on  while the water clanged in his ears and the thing scrabbled and scratched at him and then  when there was nothing else left but to let go or drown  he punched his way up to the air .   nothing lashed at him .  he cracked his way through the ice to the bank  dropped on his hands and knees  and threw up .   howling started  all around the mountains .   vimes looked up .  blood was coursing down his arms .  the air stank of rotten eggs .   and there  high on a hill a mile or so off  was the clacks tower .      with its stone walls and door that could be bolted     he stumbled forward .   the snow underfoot was already giving way to coarse grass and moss .  the air was hotter now  but it was the clammy heat of a fever .  and then he looked around  and realized where he was .   there was bare dirt and rock in front of him  but here and there parts of it were moving and going blup .   everywhere he looked  there were fat geysers .  rings of ancient  congealed  yellow fat  so old and rancid that even sam vimes wouldn   t dip his toast in it unless he was really hungry  encircled sizzling little pools .  there were even black floating bits  which on a second glance turned out to be insects that were slow learners in a hot fat situation .   vimes recalled something igor had said .  sometimes  dwarfs working the high strata  where the fat had congealed into a kind of tallow millennia ago  dwarfs occasionally found strange ancient animals  perfectly preserved but fried to a crisp .   probably   vimes found himself laughing  out of sheer exhaustion   probably battered to death .   mwahahaa .   the snow was heavy now  making the fat pools spit .   he sagged to his knees .  he ached all over .  it wasn   t just that his brain was writing checks that his body couldn   t cash .  it had gone beyond that .  now his feet were borrowing money that his legs hadn   t got  and his back muscles were looking for loose change under the sofa cushions .   and still nothing was coming up behind him .  surely they must   ve crossed the river by now .   then he saw one .  he could have sworn it hadn   t been there a moment ago .  another one trotted out from behind a nearby snowdrift .   they sat watching him .      come on  then .     vimes yelled .     what are you waiting for .      the pools of fat hissed and bubbled around vimes .  it was warm here  though .  if they weren   t going to move  then neither was he .   he focused on a tree on the edge of the fat geysers .  it looked barely alive  with greasy splashes on the end of the longer branches  but it also looked climbable .  he concentrated on it  tried to estimate the distance and whatever speed he might be capable of .   the werewolves turned to look at it  too .   another one had entered the clearing at a different point .  there were three watching him now .   they weren   t going to run until he ran  he realized .  otherwise it wouldn   t be fun .   he shrugged  turned away from the tree   and then turned back and ran .  by the time he was halfway there he was afraid his heart was going to climb up his throat  but he ran on  jumped awkwardly  caught a low branch  slipped  struggled gasping to his feet  grabbed the branch again and managed to pull himself up  expecting at every second the first tiny puncture as teeth broke his skin     he rocked on the greasy wood .  the werewolves hadn   t moved  but they were watching him with interest .      you bastards     vimes growled .   they got up and picked their way carefully toward the tree  without hurrying .  vimes climbed a little farther up the tree .      ankh morpork .  mister civilized .  where are your weapons now  ankh morpork .      it was wolfgang   s voice .  vimes peered around the snowdrifts  which were already filling up with violet shadows as the afternoon died .      i got two of you .     he shouted .      yes  they will have big headaches later on .  we are werewolves  ankh morpork .  quite hard to stop .         you said that you           your mister sleeps could run much faster than you  ankh morpork .         fast enough .         no .  and the man with the little black hat could fight better than you  too .         well enough .         no .     shouted wolfgang cheerfully .   vimes growled .  even assassins didn   t deserve that kind of death .      it   ll be sunset soon .     he shouted .      yes .  i lied about the sunset .         well  wake me up at dawn  then .  i could do with the sleep .         you will freeze to death  civilized man .         good .     vimes looked around at the other trees .  even if he could jump to one  they were all conifers  painful to land in and easy to fall out of .      ah  this must be the famous ankh morpork sense of humor  yes .         no  that was just irony     vimes shouted  still looking for an arboreal escape route .     you   ll know when we   ve got onto the famous ankh morpork sense of humor when i start talking about breasts and farting .      so what were his options .  well  he could stay in the tree  and die  or run for it  and die .  of the two  dying in one piece seemed better .   you   re doing very well for a man of your age .   death was sitting on a higher branch of the tree .      are you following me  or what .      are you familiar with the phrase    death was his constant companion    .      but i don   t usually see you .      possibly you are in a state of heightened awareness caused by lack of food  sleep and blood .      are you going to help me .      well   yes .      when .      er   when the pain is too much to bear .  death hesitated  and then went on  even as i say it i realize that this isn   t the answer you were looking for  however .   the sun was near the horizon now  getting big and red .   racing the sun   that was another uberwald sport  wasn   t it .  be home safe before the sun sets .   half a mile or more  through deep snow in rising ground     someone was climbing up the tree .  he felt it shake .  he looked down .  in the cold blue gloom  a naked man was quietly pulling himself from branch to branch .   vimes was enraged .  they weren   t supposed to do this .   there was a grunt from below as the climber slipped and recovered on the greasy wood .   how are you feeling  in yourself .      shut up .  even if you are a hallucination .      there must be something about werewolves he could use     you have a second   s grace when they were changing shape  but they knew he knew that     no weapons .  that   s what he   d noticed in the castle .  you always got weapons in castles .  spears  battleaxes  ridiculous suits of armor  huge old swords   even the vampire had a few rapiers on the walls .  that was because  sometimes  even vampires had to use a weapon .   werewolves didn   t .  even angua hesitated before reaching for a sword .  to a werewolf  a physical weapon would always be the second choice .   vimes locked his legs together and swung around the branch as the werewolf came up .  he caught it a blow on the ear and  as it looked up  managed another blow right on the nose .   it gave him a ringing slap and that would have ended it  except that it also pulled itself a little farther up the tree and brought itself in the range of the vimes elbow .   it justified the capital letter .  it had triumphed in a number of street fights .  vimes had learned early on in his career that the graveyards were full of people who   d read the marquis of fantailler .  the whole idea of fighting was to stop the other bloke hitting you as soon as possible .  it wasn   t to earn marks .  vimes had often fought in circumstances where being able to use the hands freely was a luxury  but it was amazing how a well placed elbow could make a point  possibly assisted by a knee .   he drove it into the werewolf   s throat  and was rewarded with a horrible noise .  then he grabbed a handful of hair and pulled  let go and slammed the palm of his hand into its face in a mad attempt to prevent it having a second to think .  he couldn   t allow that   he could see the size of the man   s muscles .   the werewolf reacted  instead .   there was that sudden moment of morphological inexactitude .  a nose turned into a muzzle while vimes   s fist was en route  but when the wolf opened its mouth to lunge at him two things occurred to it .   one was that it was high in a tree  not a tenable position for a shape designed for fast paced living on the ground .  the other was gravity .      down there it   s the lore     vimes panted  as its paws scrabbled for purchase on the greasy branch     but up here it   s me .      he reached up  grabbed the branch above him  and kicked down with his feet .   there was a yelp  and another yelp as the wolf slid and hit the next branch down .   about halfway toward the ground it tried to change back again  combining in one falling shape all the qualities of something not good at staying in trees with something not good at landing on the ground .      gotcha .     screamed vimes .   in the forest all around  a howling went up .   the branch he was clinging to   snapped .  for a moment he hung by the gloomy trousers of uncle vanya  caught on a snag  and then their ancient fabric ripped off him and he dropped .   his progress was a little faster  since the falling werewolf had removed a lot of branches on the way down  but the landing was softer because the werewolf was just getting to its feet .   vimes   s flailing hand grabbed a broken branch .   a weapon .   thought more or less stopped when his fingers closed .  whatever replaced it in the pathways of his brain was gushing up from somewhere else  thousands of years old .   the werewolf struggled up and turned on him .  the branch caught it across the side of the head .   steam rose off sir samuel vimes as he lurched forward  snarling incoherently .  he smacked the club down again .  he roared .  there were no words there .  it was a sound from before words .  if there was any meaning in it at all  it was a lament that he couldn   t cause enough pain     the wolf whined  stumbled  rolled over   and changed .   the human extended a bleeding hand toward him in supplication .      ple ease        vimes hesitated  club raised .   the red rage drained away .   in one movement  changing from man to wolf as it moved  the werewolf sprang .   vimes went backward into the snow .  he could feel the breath and the blood  but not the pain     no talons ripped  no teeth tore .   and the weight was lifted .  hands pulled the body off him .      bit of a close one there  sir     said a voice cheerfully .     best not to give them any quarter  really .     there was a spear right through the werewolf .      carrot .         we   ll get a fire going .  it   s easy if you dip the wood in the fat springs first .         carrot .         i shouldn   t think you   ve eaten .  there   s not much game this close to the town  but we   ve still got some           carrot .         er   yes  sir .         what the hell are you doing here .         it   s all a bit complicated  sir .  here  let me help you up        vimes shook him off as he tried to help him to his feet .      i got this far  thank you  i think i   m capable of standing up     he said  and forced his legs to support him .      you seem to have lost your trousers  sir .         yes  it   s the famous ankh morpork sense of humor once again     growled vimes .      only   angua will be back soon  and   and           sergeant angua   s family  captain  are in the habit of running around the woods in the snow stark bol   stark naked .         yes  sir  but   i mean   you know   it   s not really           i   ll give you five minutes to find a clothes shop  shall i .  otherwise   look  where the hell are all the werewolves  eh .  i was expecting to drop into a heap of snarling jaws  and now you   re here  thank you very much  and there   s no werewolves .         gavin   s people chased them away  sir .  you must   ve heard the howl go up .         gavin   s people  eh .  well  that   s good .  that   s very good .  i   m pleased about that .  well done  gavin .  now   who the hell is gavin .      a howl went up from a distant hill .      that   s gavin     said carrot .      a wolf .  gavin   s a wolf .  i   ve been saved from werewolves by wolves .         it   s all right  sir .  when you think about it  it   s not really any different from being saved from werewolves by people .         when i think about it  i think perhaps i was better off lying down     said vimes weakly .      let   s get to the sleigh  sir .  i was trying to say we have got your clothes .  that   s how angua tracked you .      ten minutes later vimes was sitting in front of a fire with a blanket around him  and the world seemed to make a little more sense .  a slice of venison was going down well  and vimes was far too hungry to bother much that the butcher appeared to have used his teeth .      the wolves spy on the werewolves .     he said .      sort of  sir .  gavin keeps an eye on things for angua .  they   re   old friends .      the moment of silence went on just slightly too long .      he sounds like a very bright wolf     said vimes  in the absence of anything more diplomatic to say .      more than that .  angua thinks he might be part werewolf  from way back .         er   can that happen .         she says so .  did i tell you that he came all the way into ankh morpork .  a big city .  can you imagine what that must have been like .      vimes turned at a faint sound behind him .   a large wolf was standing at the edge of the firelight .  it was looking at him intently .  it wasn   t just the look of an animal  sizing him up on the level of food threat thing .  behind that stare  wheels were turning .  and there was a small but rather proud mongrel at his side  scratching furiously .      is that   gaspode .     said vimes .     the dog that   s always hanging around the watch house .         yes  he   helped me get here     said carrot .      i just don   t want to ask     said vimes .     any minute now a door   s going to open in a tree and fred and nobby are going to step out  am i right .         i hope not  sir .      gavin lay down a short distance from the fire  and started watching carrot .      captain .     said vimes .      yes  sir .         you   ll notice i haven   t pressed you on why you   re here as well as angua .         yes  sir .         well .     said vimes .  and now he thought he recognized the look on gavin   s face  even though it was on a face of an unusual shape .  it was the look you got on the face of a gentlemen lounging on a corner by a bank  watching the comings and goings  seeing how the place worked        i was admiring your diplomacy  sir .         hmm .  what .     said vimes  still staring at the wolf .      i appreciated the way you were avoiding asking questions  sir .      angua walked into the firelight .  vimes saw her glance around the circle  and squat down on the snow exactly halfway between carrot and gavin .      they   re miles away now .  oh   hello  mister vimes .      there was some more silence .      is anyone going to tell me something .     said vimes .      my family are trying to upset the coronation     said angua .     they   re working with some dwarfs that don   t want   that want to keep uberwald separate .         i think i   ve worked that one out .  running for your life through a freezing cold forest gives you a bit of an insight .         i have to tell you  sir   my brother killed the clacky signalers .  his scent   s all over the place up there .      gavin made a noise in his throat .      and another man that gavin didn   t recognize  except that he spent a lot of time hiding in the forest and watching our castle .         i think that might have been a man called sleeps .  one of our   agents     said vimes .      he did well .  he managed to get to a boat a few miles downriver .  unfortunately  there was a werewolf waiting in it .         it was a waterfall that did it for me     said vimes .      permission to speak honestly  sir .     said angua .      don   t you always .         they could have got you any time they liked  sir .  really they could .  they wanted you to get as far as the tower before they really attacked .  i expect wolfgang thought that   d be nicely symbolic  or something .         i got three of them .         yes  sir .  but you wouldn   t have been able to get three of them all at once .  wolfgang was having some   fun .  that   s how he   s always played the game .  he   s good at thinking ahead .  he likes ambushes .  he likes some poor soul to get within a few yards of the finish before he leaps out on them .     angua sighed .     look  sir  i don   t want there to be trouble           he   s been killing people .         yes  sir .  but my mother   s just a rather ignorant snob and my father   s half gone now  he spends so much time as a wolf he hardly knows how to act human anymore .  they don   t live in the real world .  they really think uberwald can stay the same .  there isn   t a lot up here  really   but it   s ours .  wolfgang   s a murderous idiot who thinks that werewolves were born to rule .  the trouble is  sir   he hasn   t broken the lore .         oh  ye gods .         i bet he could find plenty of witnesses to say that he gave everyone the start the lore requires .  that   s the rules of the game .         and meddling with the dwarfs    affairs .  he   s stolen the scone or swapped it or   something  i haven   t worked it all out yet  but one poor dwarf   s already dead because of it .  cheery and detritus are under arrest .  inigo is dead .  sybil   s locked up somewhere .  and you   re saying it   s all okay .         things are different here  sir     said carrot .     it wasn   t until ten years ago they replaced trial by ordeal here with trial by lawyer  and that was only because they found that lawyers were nastier .         i   ve got to get back to bonk .  if they   ve harmed sybil i don   t care what the damn lore is .         mister vimes .  you look done in as it is .     said carrot .      i   ll keep going .  come on .  get some of the wolves to pull the sleigh           you don   t get them to  sir .  you ask gavin if they will     said carrot .      oh .  er   can you explain the situation to him .      i   m standing in the cold in the middle of a forest  thought vimes a moment later  watching a quite handsome young woman growling a conversation with a wolf who is watching her .  this does not often happen .  not in ankh morpork  anyway .  it   s probably a daily occurrence up here .   eventually six wolves allowed themselves to be harnessed  and vimes was carried up the hill to the road .      stop .         sir .     said carrot .      i want a weapon .  there   s got to be something i can use in the tower .         sir  you can use my sword .  and there   s the   hunting spears           you know what you can do with the hunting spears .      vimes kicked the door at the base of the tower .  fresh snow had blown in  smoothing the edges of wolf and human tracks .   he felt drunk .  bits of his brain were going on and off .  his eyeballs felt as though they were lined with toweling .  his legs seemed only vaguely under his control .   surely the signalers must   ve had something .   even the sacks and barrels had gone .  well  there were plenty of peasants in the hills  and winter was coming on  and the men who   d been here certainly didn   t have any use for the food anymore .  even vimes wouldn   t call that theft .   he climbed up to the next floor .  the thrifty people of the forest had been up here  too .  but they hadn   t taken the bloodstains off the floor  or inigo   s little round hat which inexplicably was wedged into the wooden wall .   he pulled it out  and saw where the thin felt on the brim had been pushed back to reveal the razor shape edge .   an assassin   s hat  he thought .  and then   no  not an assassin   s hat .  he remembered the street fights he   d seen when he was a kid  among the hard drinking men who thought that even bare knuckle fighting was posh .  some of them would sew a razor blade into the brim of their cap  for a bit of help in a melee .  this was the hat of a man who was always looking for that extra edge .   it hadn   t worked here .   he dropped it on the floor  and his eye caught  in the gloom  the box of mortars .  even that had been ransacked  but the tubes had simply been scattered across the floor .  the gods alone knew what the scavengers thought they were .   he put them back in their box .  inigo was right about them  at least .  a weapon so inaccurate that it probably couldn   t hit a barn wall from inside the barn was no good as a weapon .  but other things had been scattered around  too .  the men who   d been living rough here had left a few personal item .  pictures had been thumbtacked to the wall .  there was a diary  a pipe  someone   s shaving gear   boxes had been tipped out on the floor        we   d better get on  sir     said carrot  from the ladder .   they   d been killed .  they   d been sent racing off into the dark with monsters at their heels  and then some blank faced peasants who   d done nothing to help had come in here and picked over the little things they   d left behind     damn it .  vimes growled and swept everything into the box and dragged it over to the ladder .      we   ll drop this lot off at the embassy     he said .     i   m not leaving any here for scavengers .  don   t think about arguing with me .         wouldn   t dream of it  sir .  wouldn   t dream of it .      vimes paused .      carrot .  that wolf and angua       he stopped .  how the hell did you continue a sentence like that .      they   re old friends  sir .         they are .      there was nothing but the usual completely open honesty anywhere in carrot   s expression .      oh   we   that   s good  then       vimes finished .   a minute later  they were on their way again .  angua was running as a wolf far ahead of the sleigh  alongside gavin .  gaspode had curled up under the blankets .   and here i am again  thought vimes  racing the sunset .  heaven knows why   i   m in the company of a werewolf and a wolf that looks worse  and sitting in a sleigh drawn by wolves which i can   t steer .  try looking that one up in the manual .   he dozed among the blankets  half open eyes watching the disk of the sun flickering between pine trees .   how could you steal the scone from its cave .   he   d said there were dozens of ways and there were  but they were all risky .  they all depended too much on luck and sleepy guards .  and this didn   t feel like a crime that was going to rely on luck .  it had to work .   the scone wasn   t important .  it was important that the dwarfs ended in disarray   no king  violent arguments and fighting in the dark .  and it would stay dark in uberwald  too .  and it seemed to be important that the king was blamed   after all  he was the one who   d lost the scone     whatever the plan was  it had to be done quickly .  well  the clacks would have been useful .  what had wolfgang said .     those clever men in ankh morpork    .  not dwarfs  but men .   rubber sonky  floating in his vat     you dipped in a wooden hand  and out of the vat you got a glove   hand in glove     it wasn   t where you   ve got it  it   s where people think it is .  that   s what matters .  that   s the magic .   he remembered the very first thought he   d had  when he saw cheery staring at the floor of the scone   s cave  and the little policemen in vimes   s head started to clamor .      what  sir .     said carrot .      hmm .     vimes forced his eyes open .      you just shouted  sir .         what did i shout .         you shouted    the bloody thing was never bloody stolen .      sir .         the bastards .  i knew i nearly had it .  it all fits together if you don   t think like a dwarf .  let   s make sure sybil is all right and then  captain  we   re going to           prod buttock  sir .         right .         only one thing  sir           what .         you are an escaped criminal  aren   t you .      for a moment there was only the sound of the runners skimming over the snow     we ell     said vimes     this isn   t ankh morpork  i know .  everyone keeps telling me .  but  captain  wherever you are  wherever you go  watchmen are always watchmen .          a solitary light burned in the window .  captain colon sat by the candle  staring at nothing .   regulations called for the watch house to be manned at all hours  and that   s what he was doing .   the floorboards in the room below creaked into a new position .  for many months now they   d been walked on around the clock  because the main office never had fewer than half a dozen people in it .  chairs  too  accustomed to being warmed continuously by a relay of bottoms  groaned gently as they cooled .   there was only one thought buzzing around fred colon   s head now .   mr .  vimes is going to go completely bursar .  he   s going to go totally librarian poo .   his hand went down to the desk and came back automatically  while he looked straight ahead .   there was the crunch of a sugar lump being eaten .      snow was falling again .  the watchman that vimes had named colonesque was leaning in his box by the hubward gate of bonk .  he   d perfected the art  and it was an art form  of going to sleep upright with his eyes open .  it was one of the things you learned  on endless nights .   a female voice by his ear said     now  there are two ways this could go .      his position didn   t change .  he continued to stare straight ahead .      you haven   t seen anything .  that   s the truth  isn   t it .  just nod .      he nodded  once .      good man .  you didn   t hear me arrive  did you .  just nod .      nod .      so you won   t know when i   ve gone  am i right .  just nod .      nod .      you don   t want any trouble .  just nod .      nod .      they don   t pay you enough for this .  just nod .      this time the nod was quite emphatic .      you get more than your fair share of night watches as it is  anyway .      colonesque   s jaw dropped .  whoever was standing in the shadows was clearly reading his mind .      good man .  you just stand here  then  and make sure no one steals the gate        colonesque took care to continue to stare straight ahead .  he heard the thud and creak of the gate being opened and closed .   it occurred to him that the speaker had not in fact mentioned what the other way was  and he was quite relieved about that .      what was the other way .     said vimes  as they hurried through the snow .      we   d go and look for another way in     said angua .   there were few people on the streets  which were whitening with the new snow again except where wisps of steam escaped from the occasional grating .  in uberwald  it seemed  sunset made its own curfew .  this was just as well  because gavin was growling continuously under his breath .   carrot came back from the next corner .      there   s dwarfs on guard all around the embassy     he said .     they don   t look open to negotiation  sir .      vimes looked down .  they were standing on a grating .      captain tantony of the bonk watch was not happy with this duty .   he   d been at the opera last night  and later on he   d thought he saw things happening in a way which  the burgermaster had instructed him  hadn   t happened .  of course  the thing to do was obey orders .  you were safe if you obeyed orders .  everyone in the watch knew that .  but these didn   t feel like safe orders .   he   d heard they did things differently in ankh morpork .  milord vimes would arrest anyone  they said .   tantony had set up a desk in the embassy   s hall  so that he could keep an eye on the main doors .  he   d taken some pains to position his men around the inside of building  he didn   t trust the dwarfs on guard outside .  they   d said they   d gotten orders to kill vimes on sight  and that didn   t make any sense .  there had to be some sort of a trial  didn   t there .   there was a faint noise from upstairs .  he stood up carefully and reached for his crossbow .      corporal svetlz .      there was another little sound .   tantony went to the bottom of the stairs .   vimes appeared at the top of them .  there was blood on his shirt  and crusted on the side of his face .  to the captain   s horror  he began to walk down the steps .      i will shoot you .         that   s the order  is it .     said vimes .      yes .  stop there .         but i   m going to be shot anyway  there   s no point in stopping  is there .     said vimes .      i don   t think you   re the kind to do that  captain .  you   ve got a brain .     vimes steadied himself on the banister rail .     shouldn   t you have called for the rest of the guards by now  by the way .         i tell you to stop .         you know who i am .  if you   re going to fire that damn thing  do it now .  but first  i suggest it would be a really good career move to tug the bellpull over there .  what   s the worst that would happen .  you   ve still got the bow pointed at me .  there   s something you really ought to know .      tantony gave him a suspicious look  but took a few steps sideways and tugged the rope .   igor stepped out from behind a pillar .      yeth  marthter .         tell this young man where he is  will you .         he   th in ankh morpork  marthter     said igor calmly .      see .     said vimes .     and don   t glare at igor like that .  i missed it when he welcomed me here  but it   s true .  this is an embassy  my son     he went on  walking forward again     and that means it   s officially on the soil of the home country .  welcome to ankh morpork .  there   s thousands of uberwald people living in our city .  you don   t want to go starting a war  do you .         but   but   they said   my orders   you are a criminal .         the word is accused  captain .  we don   t kill people in ankh morpork just because they   re accused .  well  not on purpose .  and not because someone tells us to .      vimes took the crossbow out of his unresisting hands  and fired it into the ceiling .      now send your men away     he said .      i   m in ankh morpork .     said the captain .   even in his current state  vimes thought he recognized the harmonics .      that   s right     he said  putting an arm around him .     a city which  incidentally  always has a job in the watch for a young man of ability        tantony   s body stiffened .  he pushed vimes   s arm away .      you insult me  milord .  this is my country .         ah .     vimes was aware of carrot and angua watching from the landing .      but   i will not see it dishonored  either     said the captain .     this isn   t right .  i saw what happened last night .  you swept up the king and your troll caught the chandelier .  and then they said you   d tried to kill the king and you   d killed dwarfs when you escaped           are you in charge of the watch here .         no .  that   s the job of the burgermaster .         and who gives him his orders .         everyone     said tantony bitterly .  vimes nodded .  been there  he thought .  been there  done that  bought the doublet        are you going to stop me taking my people out of here .         how can you do that .  the dwarfs surround us .         we   re going to use   diplomatic channels .  just show me where everyone is  and we   ll be off .  if it   s any help  i can hit you over the head and tie you up           that will not be required .  the dwarf and the troll are in the cellar .  her ladyship is   i assume she   s wherever the baron took her        vimes felt the little trickle of superheated ice down his spine .      took her .     he said hoarsely .      well   yes .     tantony stepped back from vimes   s expression .     she knew the baroness  sir .  she said they were old friends .  she said they could sort it all out .  and then       tantony   s voice became a mumble  seared into silence by the look on vimes   s face .   when vimes spoke  it was in a monotone as threatening as a spear .      you are standing there in your shiny breastplate and your silly helmet and your sword without a single notch in the blade and your stupid trousers and you are telling me that you let my wife be taken away by werewolves .      tantony took a step backward .      it was the baron           and you don   t argue with barons .  right .  you don   t argue with anyone .  do you know what .  i   m ashamed  ashamed to think that something like you is called a watchman .  now give me those keys .      the man had gone red .      you   ve obeyed many orders     said vimes .     don   t   even   think   about   disobeying   that   one .      carrot reached the bottom of the stairs and put a hand on his shoulder .      steady  mister vimes .      tantony looked from one to the other and made a life decision .      i hope you   find your lady  milord .     he produced a bunch of keys and handed them over .     i really do .      vimes  still fighting for breath  wordlessly passed the keys to carrot .      let them out     he said .      are you going to the werewolves    castle .     tantony panted .      yes .         you won   t stand a chance  milord .  they do as they please .         then they   ve got to be stopped .         you can   t .  the old one understood the rules  but wolfgang   he doesn   t obey anything .         all the more reason to stop him  then .  ah  detritus .     the troll saluted .     you   ve got your bow  i see .  treated you well  did they .         dey called me a ficko troll     said detritus  darkly .     one of dem kicked me inna rocks .         was it this one .         no .         but he is their captain     said vimes  stepping away from tantony .     sergeant  i order you  shoot him down .      in one movement the troll had the crossbow balanced on his shoulder and was sighting along the massive package of arrows .  tantony went pale .      well  go on     said vimes .     it was an order  sergeant .      detritus lowered the bow .      i ain   t dat fick  sir .         i gave you an order .         den you can do wid that order what boulder der lintel did wid his bag of gravel  sir .  wid respect  o   course .      vimes walked across and patted the shaking tantony on his shoulder .      just making a point     he said .      however     said detritus     if you can find der man dat kicked me inna rocks  i should be happy to get him a flick around der earhole .  i know which one it was .  he   s der one walkin    wid der limp .         lady sybil drank her wine carefully .  it didn   t taste very nice .  in fact  quite a lot of things weren   t very nice .   she wasn   t a good cook .  she   d never been taught proper cookery  at her school it had always been assumed that other people would be doing the cookery and that in any case it would be for fifty people using at least four types of fork .  such dishes as she had mastered were dainty things on doilies .   but she cooked for sam because she vaguely felt that a wife ought to and  besides  he was an eater who entirely matched her kitchen skills .  he liked burnt sausages and fried eggs that went boing when you tried to stick a fork in them .  if you gave him caviar  he   d want it in batter .  he was an easy man to feed  if you always kept some lard in the house .   but the food here tasted as though it had been cooked by someone who had never even tried before .  she   d seen the kitchens  when serafine had given her the little tour  and they   d just about do for a cottage .  the game larders  on the other hand  were the size of barns .  she   d never seen so many dead things hanging up .   it was just that she was certain that venison shouldn   t be served boiled  with potatoes that were crunchy .  if they were potatoes  of course .  potatoes weren   t usually gray .  even sam  who liked the black lumpy bits you got in some mashed potatoes  would have commented .  but sybil had been brought up properly  if you can   t find something nice to say about the food  find something to be nice about .      these are   really very interesting plates     she said  dutifully .     er   are you sure there   s been no more news .     she tried to avoid watching the baron .  he was ignoring sybil and his wife and was prodding the meat around on his plate as if he   d forgotten what a knife and fork were for .      wolfgang and his friends are still out searching     said serafine .     but this is terrible weather for a man to be on the run .         he is not on the run .     snapped sybil .     sam is not guilty of anything .         of course  of course .  all the evidence is circumstantial .  of course     said the baroness soothingly .     now  i suggest that as soon as they have the passes clear  you and the  er  the staff get back to the safety of ankh morpork before the real winter hits .  we know the country  my dear .  if your husband is alive  we can soon do something about it .         i will not have him shamed like this .  you saw him save the king .         i   m sure he did  sybil .  i   m afraid i was talking to my husband at the time  but i don   t disbelieve you for a minute .  er   is it true that he killed all those men in the wilinus pass .         what .  but   they were bandits .     at the other end of the table the baron had picked up a lump of meat and was trying to tear it apart with his teeth .      well  of course .  yes .  of course .      sybil pinched the bridge of her nose .  most of her would not have considered sam vimes guilty of murder  actual murder  even on the evidence of three gods and a message written on the sky .  but   stories did get back to her  in a roundabout way .  sam got wound up about things .  sometimes he unwound all at once .  there   d been that   bad business with that little girl and those men over at dolly sisters  and when sam had broken in to the men   s lodging he found one of them had stolen one of her shoes  and she   d heard detritus say that if he hadn   t been there only sam would have walked out of the room alive     she shook her head .      i really would like a bath     she said .  there was a clatter from the other end of the table .      dear  you will have to eat your dinner in the changing room     said the baroness  without looking around .  she flashed lady sybil a brief  brittle smile .     we do not  in fact  have a   have such a  a device in the castle .     a thought occurred to her .     we use the hot springs .  so much more hygienic .         out in the forest .         oh  it   s quite close .  and a quick run around in the snow really tones up the body .         i think perhaps i shall have a lie down instead     said lady sybil  firmly .     but thank you all the same .      she made her way to the musty bedroom  fuming in a ladylike way .   she couldn   t bring herself to like serafine  and this was shocking  because lady sybil even liked nobby nobbs  and that took breeding .  but the werewolf scraped across her nerves like a file .  she remembered that she   d never liked her at school  either .   among the other unwanted baggage that had been heaped on the young sybil to hamper her progress through life was the injunction to be pleasant to people and say helpful things .  people took this to mean that she didn   t think .   she   d hated the way serafine had talked about dwarfs .  she   d called them    subhuman .     well  obviously most of them lived underground  but sybil rather liked dwarfs .  and serafine spoke of trolls as if they were things .  sybil hadn   t met many trolls  but the ones she knew seemed to spend their lives raising their children and looking for the next dollar just like everyone else .   worst of all  serafine simply assumed that sybil would naturally agree with her stupid opinions because she was a lady .  sybil ramkin had not had an education in these things  moral philosophy not having featured much in a curriculum that was heavy on flower arranging  but she had a shrewd idea that in any possible debate the right side was where serafine wasn   t .   she   d only ever written all those letters to her because it was what you did .  you always wrote letters to old friends  even if you weren   t very friendly with them .   she sat on the bed and stared at the wall until the shouting started  and when the shouting started she knew sam was alive and well  because only sam made people that angry .   she heard the key click in the lock .   sybil rebelled .   she was large  and she was kind .  she hadn   t enjoyed school much .  a society of girls is not a good one in which to be large and kind  because people are inclined to interpret that as    stupid    and worse     deaf .      lady sybil looked out of the window .  she was two floors up .   there were bars across the window  but they   d been designed to keep something out  from the inside  they could be lifted out of their slots .  and there were musty but heavy sheets and blankets on the bed .  none of this might have suggested very much to the average person  but life in a rather strict school for well brought up young ladies can give someone a real insight into the tricks of escapology .   five minutes after the key had turned  there was only one bar in the window and it jerked and creaked in the stonework  suggesting that quite a heavy weight was on the sheets that had been neatly knotted around it .      torches streamed all along the castle walls .  the ghastly red and black flag snapped in the wind .  vimes looked over the side of the bridge .  the water was a long way down  and pure white even before it reached the waterfall .  forward and back were the only possible directions here .   he reviewed his troops .  unfortunately  this did not take long .  even a policeman could count up to five .  then there was gavin and his wolves  who were lurking in the trees .  and finally  very definitely finally  there was gaspode  the corporal nobbs of the canine world  who   d attached himself to the group uninvited .   what else was on his side .  well  the enemy preferred not to use weapons .  this bonus evaporated somewhat when you remembered that they had  at will  some very nasty teeth and claws .   he sighed  and turned to angua .      i know this is your family     he said .     i won   t blame you if you hang back .         we   ll see  sir  shall we .         how are we going to get in  sir .     said carrot .      how would you go about it  carrot .         well  i   d start by knocking  sir .         really .  sergeant detritus  forward please .         sir .         blow the bloody doors off .         yessir .      vimes turned back to carrot as the troll gazed thoughtfully at the door and began making extra turns on his crossbow   s winch  grunting as the springs fought back .  their fight was unsuccessful .      this isn   t ankh morpork  see .     said vimes .   detritus hoisted the bow onto his shoulders and took a step forward .   there was a thunk .  vimes didn   t see the bundle of arrows leave the bow .  they were probably already fragments by the time they   d gone about a few feet .  halfway toward the doors the expanding cloud of splinters exploded into flame from the air friction .   what hit the doors was a fireball as angry and unstoppable as the fifth elephant and traveling at an appreciable fraction of local light speed .      my gods  detritus     muttered vimes  as the thunder died away     that   s not a crossbow  that   s a national emergency        a few bits of charred door crashed onto the cobbles .      the wolves won   t come in  mister vimes     said angua .     gavin will follow me  but they won   t come  not even for him .         why not .         because they   re wolves  sir .  they don   t feel at home in houses .      the only sound was the squeak squeak of detritus winding up his bow again .      the hell with it     said vimes  drawing his sword and stepping forward .      lady sybil untucked her dress from her underwear and stepped carefully across the little courtyard .  she was somewhere around the rear of the castle  as far as she could make out .   she flattened herself as best she could against the wall when she heard a sound  and tightened her grip on one of the iron bars that had formerly graced the window .   a large wolf came around the corner  holding a bone in its mouth .  it did not look as it was expecting her  and certainly wasn   t expecting the iron bar .      oh  i   m terribly sorry     said sybil automatically  as it folded up onto the cobbles .   there was an explosion on the other side of the castle .  that sounded like sam .         do you think they heard us  sir .     said carrot .      captain  people in ankh morpork probably heard us .  so where are all the werewolves .      angua pushed forward .     this way     she said .   she led them up a flight of low steps to the door of the keep  and tried one of the doors .  it swung back slowly .   there were torches in the hall  too .      they   ll leave us somewhere to run     she said .     we always leave people somewhere to run        a pair of smaller doors at the far end of the hall were pushed open .  no handles  vimes noted .  paws can   t use handles .   wolfgang stepped in .  a couple dozen werewolves escorted him  fanning out around the room and sitting down   sprawling down and then watching the intruders with keen interest .      ah  civilized .     said wolfgang cheerfully .     you won the game .  would you like another go .  when people have a second game we give them a handicap .  we bite one of their legs off .  good joke  hey .         i think i prefer the ankh morpork sense of humor     said vimes .     where   s my wife  you bastard .     he could still hear the sound of detritus winding .  that was the trouble with the big bow .  it was only a quick fire weapon by geological standards .      and delphine .  look at what the dog dragged in .     said wolfgang  ignoring vimes .  he stepped forward .  vimes heard a growl begin in angua   s throat  a sound which could cause instant obedience in many of ankh morpork   s criminal population when they encountered it in a dark alley .  there was a deeper rumble from gavin .   wolfgang stopped .      you haven   t got the brains for this  wolfie     said angua .     and you couldn   t plot your way out of a wet paper bag .  where   s mother .     she looked around at the lolling werewolves .     hello  uncle ulf   aunt hilda   magwen   nancy   unity   the pack   s all here  then .  except for father  who i expect is off rolling in something .  what a family           i want these disgusting people out of here right away     said the baroness  stepping into the hall .  she glared at detritus .     how dare you bring a troll into this house .         o kay  it   s all wound up     said detritus cheerfully  hoisting the humming bow onto his shoulder .     where should i fire it  mister vimes .         good grief  not in here .  this is an enclosed building .         only up until i pull dis trigger  sir .         how very civilized     said the baroness .     how very ankh morpork .  you think you merely have to threaten and the lesser races back down  eh .         have you seen your gates lately .     said vimes .      we   re werewolves     snapped the baroness   and it was a snap  the words sharp and clipped as though they were barked .     stupid toys like that don   t frighten us .         but it   ll slow you down for a while .  now bring out lady sybil .         lady sybil is resting .  you are in no position to make demands  mister vimes .  we are not the criminals here .      as vimes   s mouth dropped open  she went on     the game is not against the lore .  it has been played for a thousand years .  and what else is it that you think we have done .  stolen the dwarfs    pet rock .  we           you know it wasn   t stolen     said vimes .     and i know           you know nothing .  you suspect everything .  you have that kind of mind .         your son said           my son unfortunately has honed to perfection every muscle in his body except the ones for thinking with     said the baroness .     in civilized ankh morpork i daresay you can barge into people   s houses and stamp around  but here in our barbaric backwater the lore requires something beyond mere assertion .         i can smell the fear     said angua .     it   s pouring off you  mother .         sam .      they looked up .  lady sybil was standing at the top of some stone stairs leading to a lower floor  looking bewildered and angry .  she was holding an iron bar with a bend in it .      sybil .         she told me you were on the run and they were all trying to save you   but that wasn   t right  was it        it   s a terrible thing to admit to yourself  but when the shoulder blades are pressed firmly against the brickwork then any weapon will do  and right now vimes saw sybil loaded and ready to fire .   she got on with people .  practically from the moment she   d been able to talk she   d been taught how to listen .  and when sybil listened to people she made them feel good about themselves .  it was probably something to do with being a   a big girl .  she tried to make herself seem small  and by default that made those around her feel bigger .  she got on with people almost as well as carrot .  no wonder even the dwarfs liked her .   she had pages to herself in twurp   s peerage  huge ancestral anchors biting into the past  and dwarfs also respected someone who knew their great great great grandfather   s full name .  and sybil couldn   t lie  you could see her redden when she tried it .  sybil was a rock .  she made detritus look like a sponge .      we   ve been having a lovely run in the woods  dear     he said .     now please come here  because i think we   re going to see the king .  and i   m going to tell him everything .  i   ve worked it out at last           the dwarfs will kill you     said the baroness .      i can probably outrun a dwarf     said vimes .     and now we   re leaving .  angua .      angua hadn   t moved .  her eyes were still fixed on her mother  and she was still growling .   vimes recognized the signs .  you spotted them in the bars of ankh morpork every saturday night .  hackles rose  and people climbed up them  and then all that was needed was for someone to break a bottle .  or blink .      we are leaving  angua     he repeated .  the other werewolves were standing up and stretching .   carrot reached out and took her arm .  she turned  snarling .  it was over in a fraction of a second  and in reality her head had hardly moved before she got a grip on herself .      sor thiz iz therr boy .     said the baroness  her voice slurring .     you betrrray yourrr people for thizz .      her ears were lengthening  vimes was sure .  the muscles in her face were moving strangely  too .      and what else hass anrk morrporrk taught you .      angua shuddered .      self control     she muttered .     let   s go  mister vimes .      the werewolves closed in as they backed toward the steps .      don   t turn your back     said angua levelly .     don   t run .         don   t need telling     said vimes .  he was watching wolfgang  who was moving obliquely across the floor  his eyes fixed on the retreating party .   they   ll have to bunch up to follow us through the doorway  he thought .  he glanced at detritus .  the giant crossbow was weaving back and forth as the troll tried to keep all the wolves in the field of fire .      fire it     said angua .      but they   re your family .     said sybil .      they   ll heal soon enough  believe me .         detritus  don   t shoot unless you have to     vimes ordered  as they headed toward the drawbridge .      he has to now     said angua .     sooner or later wolfgang will leap  and the others will take           there   s something you ought to know  sir     said cheery .     you really ought to know it  sir .  it   s really important .      vimes looked across the drawbridge .  figures massed in the dark .  torchlight glinted off armor and weaponry  blocking the way .      well  things couldn   t get any worse     he said .      oh  they could if there were snakes in here with us     said lady sybil .   carrot turned at the sound of vimes   s snort of laughter .      sir .         oh  nothing  captain .  keep your eyes on the bastards  will you .  we can deal with the soldiers later .         just say the word  sir     said detritus .      you arrre trrapped now     snarled the baroness .     watchman .  do yourr duty .      a figure was walking across the bridge  carrying a torch .   captain tantony reached vimes  and glared at him .      stand aside  sir     he said .     stand aside  or by gods  ambassador or not  i   ll arrest you .      their eyes met .   then vimes looked away .      let   s let him through     he said .     the man   s decided he   s got a duty to do .      tantony nodded slightly  and then marched on across to the bridge until he was a few feet from the baroness .  he saluted .      take these people away .     she said .      lady serafine von uberwald .     said tantony woodenly .      you know who i am  man .         i wish to talk to you concerning certain charges made in my presence .      vimes closed his eyes .  oh  you poor dumb idiot   i didn   t mean you to actually        you what .     said the baroness .      it has been alleged  my lady  that a member or members of your family have been involved in a conspiracy to           how darrre you .     screamed serafine .   and wolfgang leapt  and the future became a series of flickering images .   in midair he changed into the wolf .   vimes grabbed the bottom of detritus   s bow and forced it upward at the same time as the troll pulled the trigger .   carrot was running before wolfgang landed on captain tantony   s chest .   the sound of the bow echoed around the castle  above the noise of a thousand whirring fragments scything through the sky .   carrot reached wolfgang in a flat dive .  he hit the wolf with his shoulder  and the two of them were bowled over .   then  like some moving magic lantern show coming back up to speed  the scene exploded .   carrot got to his feet and     it must be because we   re abroad  thought vimes .  he   s trying to do things properly .   he   d squared up to the werewolf  fists balled  a stance taken straight from fig .    of the noble art of fisticuffs  which looked impressive right up to the point when your opponent broke your nose with a quart mug .   carrot had a punch like an iron bar  and landed a couple of heavy blows on wolfgang as he got up .  the werewolf seemed more puzzled than hurt .   then he changed shape  caught a fist in both hands and gripped it hard .  to vimes   s horror he stepped forward  without apparent effort  forcing carrot back .      do not try anything  angua     said wolf  grinning happily .     or else i will break his arm .  oh  perhaps i will break his arm anyway .  yes .      vimes even heard the crack .  carrot went white .  someone holding a broken arm has all the control they need .  another idiot  thought vimes .  when they   re down you don   t let them get back up .  damn the marquis of fantailler .  policing by consent was a good theory  but you had to get your opponent to lie still first .      ah .  and he has other bones .     said wolfgang  pushing carrot away .  he glanced toward angua .     get back  get back .  or i   ll hurt him some more .  no  i shall hurt him some more anyway .      then carrot kicked him in the stomach .   wolfgang went over backward  but turned this into a backflip and a midair spin .  he landed lightly  leapt back at the astonished carrot  and punched him twice in the chest .   the blows sounded like shovels hitting wet concrete .   he grabbed the falling man  lifted him over his head with one hand and hurled him down onto the bridge in front of angua .      civilized man .     he shouted .     here he is  sister .      vimes heard a sound down beside him .  gavin was watching intently  making urgent little noises in his throat .  a tiny part of vimes  the little rock hard core of cynicism  thought  all right for you  then .   steam was rising off wolfgang .  he shone in the torchlight .  the blond hair across his shoulders gleamed like a slipped halo .   angua knelt down by the body  face impassive .  vimes had been expecting a scream of rage .   he heard her crying .   beside vimes  gavin whined .  vimes stared down at the wolf .  he looked at angua  trying to lift carrot  and then he looked at wolfgang .  and then back again .      anyone else .     said wolfgang  dancing back and forth on the boards .     how about you  civilized .         sam .     hissed sybil .     you can   t        vimes drew his sword .  it wouldn   t make any difference  now .  wolfgang wasn   t playing now  he wasn   t punching and running away .  those arms could push a fist through vimes   s rib cage and out the other side     a blur went past at shoulder height .  gavin struck wolfgang in the throat  knocking him over .  they rolled across the bridge  wolfgang changing back to wolf shape to lock jaw against jaw .  they broke  circled  and went for one another again .   dreamlike  vimes heard a small voice say     he wouldn   t last five minutes back home fightin    like that .  the silly bugger   s gonna get creamed  fightin    like that .  stuff the marquis of flamin    fantailler .      gaspode was sitting bolt upright  stubby tail vibrating .      the daftie .  this is how you win a dogfight .      as the wolves rolled over and over  wolfgang tearing at gavin   s belly  gaspode arrived growling and yapping and launched himself in the general direction of the werewolf   s hindquarters .   there was a yip .  gaspode   s growling was suddenly muffled .  wolfgang leapt vertically .  gavin sprang .  the three hit the parapet of the bridge together  knocked the crumbling stones aside  hung for a moment in a snarling ball  and then dropped down into the roaring whiteness of the river .   the whole of it  from the moment tantony had crossed the bridge  had taken much less than a minute .   the baroness was staring down into the gorge .  keeping his eye on her  vimes spoke to detritus .      are you sure you   re werewolf proof  sergeant .         pretty much  sir .  anyway  i got the bow wound up again .         go into the castle and fetch the resident igor  then     said vimes calmly .     if anyone even tries to stop you  shoot them .  and shoot anyone standing near them .         no problem about dat  sir .         we   re not at home to mister reasonable  sergeant .         i do not hear him knockin     sir .         go to it  then .  sergeant angua .      she did not look up .      sergeant angua .      now she looked up .      how can you be so   so cool .     she snarled .     he   s hurt           i know .  go and talk to those watchmen hanging around on the other end of the bridge .  they look scared .  i don   t want any accidents .  we   re going to need them .  cheery  cover carrot and tantony with something .  keep them warm .      i wish there was something to keep me warm  he thought .  the thoughts came slowly  like drips of freezing water .  he felt that ice would crackle off him if he moved  that frost would sparkle in his footsteps  that his mind was full of crisp snow .      and now  madam     he said  turning back to the baroness     you will give me the scone of stone .         he   ll be back .     hissed the baroness .     that fall was nothing .  and he   ll find you .         for the last time   the stone of the dwarfs .  the wolves are waiting out there .  the dwarfs are waiting down in the city .  give me the stone  and we all might survive .  this is diplomacy .  don   t let me try anything else .         i have only to say the word        angua began to growl .  sybil strode toward and grabbed the baroness .      you never answered a single letter .  all those years i wrote to you .      the baroness stared at her in amazement  as people so often did when struck with sybil   s sharp non sequiturs .      if you know we   ve got the scone     she said to vimes     then you know it   s not the real one .  and much good may it do the dwarfs .         yes  you had it made in ankh morpork .  made in ankh morpork .  they should have stamped it on the bottom .  but someone killed the man who did it .  that   s murder .  it   s against the law .     vimes nodded at the baroness .     it   s a thing we have .         gaspode dragged himself out of the water and stood  shivering  on the shingle .  every single part of him felt bruised .  there was a nasty ringing noise in his ears .  blood dripped down one leg .   the last few minutes had been a little hazy  but he did recall they   d involved a lot of water that had hit him like hammers .   he shook himself .  his coat jangled where the water was already freezing .   out of habit  he walked over to the nearest tree and  wincing  raised a leg .   excuse me .   a busy  reflective silence followed .      that was not a good thing you just did     said gaspode .   i   m sorry .  perhaps this is not the right moment .      not for me  no .  you may have caused some physical damage here .      it   s hard to know what to say .      trees don   t normally talk back  is my point .     gaspode sighed .     so   what happens now .      i beg your pardon .      i   m dead  right .      no .  no one is more surprised than me  i may say  but your time does not appear to be now .   death pulled out an hourglass  held it up against the cold stars for a moment  and stalked away along the riverbank .         scuse me  there   s no chance of a lift  is there .     said gaspode  struggling after him .   none whatsoever .      only  being a short dog in deep snow is not good for the ol    wossnames  if you get my        death had stopped at a little bay .  an indistinct shape lay in a few inches of water .      oh     said gaspode .   death leaned down .  there was a flash of blue  and then he vanished .   gaspode shivered .  he paddled into the water  and nudged gavin   s sodden fur with his nose .      shouldn   t be like this     he whined .     if you was a human  they   d put you in a big boat on the tide and set fire to it  an    everyone   d see .  shouldn   t just be you an    me down here in the cold .      there was something that had to be done  too .  he knew it in his bones .  he crawled back to the bank and pulled himself up onto the trunk of a fallen willow .   he cleared his throat .   then he howled .   it started badly  hesitantly  but it picked up and got stronger  richer   and when he paused for breath the howl went on and on  passing from throat to throat across the forest .   the sound wrapped him as he slid off the log and struggled on toward higher ground .  it lifted him over the deeper snow .  it wound around the trees  a plaiting of many voices becoming something with a life of its own .  he remembered thinking  maybe it   ll even get as far as ankh morpork .   maybe it   ll get much farther than that .      vimes was impressed by the baroness .  she fought back in a corner .      i know nothing about any deaths        a howl came up from the forest .  how many wolves were there .  you never saw them   and then  when they cried out  it sounded as though there was one behind every tree .  this one went on and on   it sounded like a cry thrown into a lake of air  the ripples spreading out across the mountains .   angua threw her head back and screamed .  then  breath hissing between her teeth  she advanced on the baroness  fingers flexing .      give him   the damn stone     she hissed .     will any   of   you   face me .  now .  then   give him the stone .         what theems to be the throuble .      igor lurched through the stricken gates  trailed by detritus .  he caught sight of the two bodies and hurried over like a very large spider .      fetch the stone     growled angua .     and then   we   will leave .  i can smell it .  or do you   want me to take it .      serafine glared at her  then turned on her heel and ran back into the ruins of the castle .  the other werewolves shrank back from angua as if her stare were a whip .      if you can   t help these men     said vimes to the kneeling igor     your future does not look good .      igor nodded .     thith one     he said  indicating tantony     fleth woundth  i can thitch him up a treat  no problem .  thith one     he tapped carrot        nasty break on the arm .     he glanced up .     marthter wolfgang been playing again .         can you make him well .     snapped vimes .      no  it   th hith lucky day     said igor .     i can make him better .  i   ve got some kidneyth jutht in  a lovely little pair  belonged to young mr .  crapanthy  hardly touched a drop of thtrong licker  shame about the avalanchthe           does he need them .     said angua .      no  but you thould never mith an opportunity to improve yourthelf  i alwayth thay .      igor grinned .  it was a strange sight .  the scars crawled around his face like caterpillars .      just see to the arm     said vimes  firmly .   the baroness reappeared  flanked by several werewolves .  they also backed away as angua spun around .      take it     said serafine .     take the wretched thing .  it is a fake .  no crime has been committed .         i   m a policeman     said vimes .     i can always find a crime .         the sleigh slid under its own weight down the track toward bonk  the town   s watchmen running alongside it and giving it the occasional push .  with their captain down they were lost and bewildered and in no mood to take orders from vimes  but they did what angua commanded because angua was of the class that traditionally gave them orders     the two casualties were bedded down on blankets .      angua .     said vimes .      yes  sir .         there   s wolves keeping pace with us .  i can see them running between the trees .         i know .         are they on our side .         let   s just say   they   re not on anyone else   s side yet  shall we .  they don   t like me much but they know   gavin did  and right now that is what   s important .  some of them are out looking for my brother .         would he have survived that .  it was a long way down .         well  it wasn   t fire or silver .  there   s nothing but white water for miles .  it probably hurt a lot  but we heal amazingly well  sir .         look  i   m sorry that           no  mister vimes  you   re not .  you shouldn   t be .  carrot just didn   t understand what wolfgang is like .  you can   t beat something like him in a fair fight .  look  i know he   s family  but   personal is not the same as important .  carrot always said that .         says that     said lady sybil sharply .      yes .      carrot opened his eyes .      what   happened back there .     he said .      wolfgang hit you     said angua .  she wiped his brow .      what with .     carrot tried to push himself upward  winced  and fell back .      what have i always told you about the marquis of fantailler .     said vimes .      sorry  sir .      something bright rose from the distant forests .  it vanished  and then a green light expanded into existence .  a moment later came the pop of the flare .      the signalers have got to the tower     said vimes .      can   t this damn thing go any faster .     said angua .      i mean  we can contact ankh morpork     said vimes .  after everything  he felt curiously cheered by this .  it was as if a special human howl had gone up .  he wasn   t floundering around loose now .  he was floundering on the end of a very long line .  that made all the difference .      it was a small public room over a shop in bonk and  since it belonged to everybody  it looked as though it didn   t belong to anyone .  there was dust in the corners  and the chairs that were currently arranged in a ragged circle had been chosen for their ability to be stacked neatly rather than sat on comfortably .   lady margolotta smiled at the assembled vampires .  she liked these meetings .   the rest of the group were a pretty mixed bunch  and she wondered what their motives were .  but perhaps they at least shared one conviction   that what you were made as  wasn   t what you had to be or what you might become     and the trick was to start small .  suck  but don   t impale .  little steps .  and then you found that what you really wanted was power  and there were much politer ways of getting it .  and then you realized that power was a bauble .  any thug had power .  the true prize was control .  lord vetinari knew that .  when heavy weights were balanced on the scales  the trick was to know where to place your thumb .   and all control started with the self .   she stood up .  they watched her with slightly worried yet friendly faces .      my name  in the short form  is lady margolotta amaya katerina assumpta crassina von uberwald  and i am a vampire        they chorused     hello  lady margolotta amaya katerina assumpta crassina von uberwald .         it has been five years now     said lady margolotta .     and i am still taking one night at a time .  one neck would always be one too many .  but   there are compensations           there were no guards on the gate of bonk  but there was a cluster of dwarfs outside the embassy as the cart slid to a halt .  the wolves in the traces jerked nervously and whined at angua .      i   ll have to let them go     she said  getting out .     they   ve only come this far because they   re frightened of me        vimes wasn   t surprised .  at the moment  anything would be frightened of angua .   even so  a squad of dwarfs was hurrying to the sledge .   it   d take them a few seconds to get a grip on things  vimes realized .  there were uptown guards here  and an igor  and a werewolf .  they   d be puzzled as well as suspicious .  that should give him a tiny crack to lever open .  and  ashamed as he was to say it  an arrogant bastard always had the edge .   he glared at the lead dwarf .     what is your name .     he demanded .      you are under           you know the scone of stone was stolen .         you   what .      vimes reached around and pulled a sack out of the sleigh .      bring those torches closer .     he shouted  and because he delivered the command in a tone that said there was no doubt that it   d be obeyed  it was obeyed .  i   ve got twenty seconds  he thought  and then the magic goes away .      now look at this     he said  lifting the thing out of the sack .   several dwarfs fell to their knees .  the murmuring spread out .  another howl  another rumor   in his current state he could see  in his mind   s bloodshot eye  the towers in the night  clicking and clacking  delivering to genua exactly the message that had been sent from ankh morpork .      i want to take this to the king     he said  in the hushed silence .      we will take it       the dwarf began  moving forward .   vimes stepped aside .      good evenin     boys     said detritus  standing up in the sleigh .   the tortured noises the bow   s springs were making under their preternatural stress sounded like some metal animal in extreme pain .  the dwarf was a couple of feet away from several dozen arrow points .      on the other hand     said vimes     we could continue talking .  you look like a dwarf who likes to talk .      the dwarf nodded .      first of all  is there any reason why the two wounded men i have here couldn   t be taken inside before they die of their wounds .      the bow twitched in detritus   s hands .   the dwarf nodded .      they can go inside and be treated .     said vimes .   the dwarf nodded again  still looking into a bundle of arrows bigger than his head .      capital .  see how we get on when we simply talk .  and now i suggest that you arrest me .         you want me to arrest you .         yes .  and lady sybil .  we place ourselves under your personal jurisdiction .         that   s right     said sybil .     i demand to be arrested .     she drew herself up and out  righteous indignation radiating like a bonfire  causing the dwarfs to back away from what was clearly an unexploded bosom .      and since the arrest of its ambassador will certainly cause   difficulties with ankh morpork     vimes went on     i strongly suggest you take us directly to the king .      by blessed chance  the distant tower sent up another flare .  green light illuminated the snows for a moment .      what   s that mean .     said the dwarf captain .      it means that ankh morpork knows what   s going on     said vimes  praying that it did .     and i don   t reckon you want to be the dwarf who started the war .      the dwarf spoke to the dwarf beside him .  a third dwarf joined them .  vimes couldn   t follow the hurried conversation  but right behind him cheery whispered     it   s a bit beyond him .  he doesn   t want anything to happen to the stone .         good .      the dwarf turned back to vimes .      what about the troll .         oh  detritus will stay in the embassy     said vimes .   this seemed to lighten the tone of the debate somewhat  but it still appeared to be heavy going .      what   s happening now .     whispered vimes .      there   s no precedent for anything like this     muttered cheery .     you   re supposed to be an assassin  but you   ve come back to see the king and you   ve got the scone           no precedent .     said sybil .     yes there bloody well is  pardon my klatchian        she took a deep breath  and began to sing .      oh     said cheery  shocked .      what .     said vimes .   the dwarfs were staring at lady sybil as she changed up through the gears into full  operatic voice .  for an amateur soprano she had an impressive delivery and range  a touch too wobbly for the professional stage but exactly the kind of high coloratura to impress the dwarfs .   snow slid off roofs .  icicles vibrated .  good grief  thought vimes  impressed  with a spiky corset and a hat with wings on it she could be ferrying dead warriors off a battlefield        it   s ironhammer   s    ransom    song     said cheery .     every dwarf knows it .  er  it doesn   t translate well  but      i come now to ransom my love  i bring a gift of great wealth  none but the king can have power over me now  standing in my way is against all the laws of the world  the value of truth is greater than gold      er  there   s always been some debate about that last line  sir  but generally considered acceptable if it   s a really big truth        vimes looked at the dwarfs .  they were fascinated  and one or two of them were mouthing along to the words .      is it going to work .     he whispered .      it   s hard to think of a bigger precedent than this  sir .  i mean   it   s the song of songs .  the ultimate appeal .  it   s built into dwarf law  almost .  they can   t refuse .  it   d be   not being a dwarf  sir .      as vimes watched  one dwarf pulled a fine chain mail handkerchief out of his pocket and blew his nose with a wet  jingling noise .  several others were in tears .   when the last note died away there was silence  and then the sudden thunder of axes banging on shields .      it   s all right .     said cheery .     they   re clapping .      sybil  panting with the effort  turned to her husband .  she gleamed in the torchlight .      do you think that was all right .     she said .      by the sound of it  you   re an honorary dwarf     said vimes .  he held out his arm .     shall we go .         news was going on ahead .  dwarfs were pouring out of the entrance to downtown when the duke and duchess arrived .   there were dwarfs behind them now .  they were being swept along .  and all the time  hands would reach out to touch the scone as it passed .   dwarfs crowded into the elevator with them .  down below the roar of conversation stopped abruptly as vimes stepped out and raised the scone above his head .  then the rock echoed and re echoed to one enormous cheer .   they can   t even see it  said vimes .  to most of them  it   s a tiny white dot .  and that was what the plotters had known  wasn   t it .  you don   t have to steal something to hold it hostage        they are to be arrested .      dee was hurrying forward  with more guards behind him .      again .     said vimes .  he kept the stone aloft .      you attempted to kill the king .  you escaped from your cell .         that   s something about which we could hear more evidence     said vimes  as calmly as he could .  the scone was getting heavier .     you can   t keep people in the dark all the time  dee .         you shall certainly not see the king .         then i will drop the scone .         do so .  it won   t        vimes heard the gasp of the dwarfs behind him .      it won   t what .     he said  quietly .     it won   t matter .  but this is the scone .      one of the dwarfs that had accompanied them from the embassy shouted something  and several others took it up .      precedent is on your side     cheery translated .     they say they can always kill you after you   ve seen the king .         well  not exactly what i was hoping but it   ll have to do .     vimes looked at dee again .     you said you wanted me to find the thing  didn   t you .  and now  how fitting that i return it to its rightful owner           you   the king is   you may give it to me     said dee  pulling himself up to the height of vimes   s chest .      absolutely not .     snapped lady sybil .     when ironhammer returned the scone to bloodaxe  would he have given it to slogram .      there was a general chorus of dissent .      of course not     said dee     slogram was a trait        he stopped .      i think     said vimes     that we had better see the king  don   t you think .         you can   t demand that .      vimes indicated the press of dwarfs behind them .      you   re going to be amazed at how difficult it   s going to be for you  explaining that to them     he said .      it took half an hour to see the king .  he had to be roused .  he had to dress .  kings don   t hurry .   in the meantime  vimes and sybil sat in an anteroom on chairs too small for them  surrounded by dwarfs who weren   t themselves sure if they were a prisoner escort or an honor guard .  other dwarfs were peering around the doorway  vimes could hear the buzz of excited conversation .   they weren   t wasting much time looking at him .  their gaze always fell on the scone that he held in his lap .  it was clear that most of them hadn   t even seen it before .   you poor little sods  he thought .  this is what you all believe in  and before the day   s out you   re going to be told it   s just a bad fake .  you   ll see it   s a forgery .  and that about wraps it up for your little world  doesn   t it .  i set out to solve a crime and i   m going to end up committing a bigger one .   i   m going to be lucky to get out of here alive  aren   t i .   a door was rolled open .  a couple of what vimes thought of as the heavy dwarfs stepped through and gave everyone the official  professional look which said that for your comfort and convenience we have decided not to kill you right at this very moment .   the king entered  rubbing his hands .      ah  your excellency     he said  pronouncing the word as a statement of fact rather than a welcome .     i see you have something that belongs to us .      dee detached himself from the crowd at the door .      i must make a serious accusation  sire .     he said .      really .  bring these people into the law room .  under guard  of course .      he swept away .  vimes looked at sybil  and shrugged .  they followed the king  leaving the hubbub of the main cavern behind .   once again  vimes was in the room with too many shelves and too few candles .  the king sat down .      is the scone heavy  your excellency .         yes .         it is weighted with history  see .  put it down on the table with extreme care  please .  and   dee .         that   thing     said dee  pointing a finger     that thing is   a fake  a copy .  a forgery .  made in ankh morpork .  part of a plot which  i am sure can be proven  involves milord vimes .  it is not the scone .      the king lifted a candle a little closer to the scone and gave it a critical look from several angles .      i have seen the scone many times before     he said at last     and i would say that this appears to be the true thing and the whole of the thing .         sire  i demand   that is  i advise you to demand a closer inspection  sire .         really .     said the king mildly .     well  i am not an expert  see .  but we are fortunate  are we not  that albrecht albrechtson is here for the coronation .  all of dwarfdom knows  i think  that he is the authority on the scone and its history .  have him summoned .  i daresay he is close at hand .  i should say just about everyone is on the other side of that door now .         indeed  sire .     the look of triumph on dee   s face as he swept past vimes was almost obscene .      i think we   re going to need another song to get us out of this one  dear     murmured vimes .      i   m afraid i can only remember that one  sam .  the others were mainly about gold .      dee returned  with albrecht and a following of other senior and somewhat magisterial dwarfs .      ah  albrecht     said the king .     do you see this on the table .  it is claimed that this is not the true thing and the whole of the thing .  your opinion is sought  please .     the king nodded at vimes .     my friend understands morporkian  your excellency .  he just chooses not to pollute the air by speaking it .  just his way  see .      albrecht glared at vimes and then stepped up to the table .   he looked at the scone from several angles .  he moved the candles  and leaned down so that he could inspect the crust closely .   he took a knife from his belt  tapped the scone with it  and listened with ferocious care to the note produced .  he turned the scone over .  he sniffed at it .   he stood back  his face screwed up in a scowl  and then said    h   gradz .      the dwarfs muttered among themselves  and then  one by one  nodded .   to vimes   s horror  albrecht chipped a tiny piece from the scone and put it in his mouth .   plaster  thought vimes .  fresh plaster from ankh morpork .  and dee will talk his way out of it     albrecht spat the piece out into his hand  and looked up at the ceiling for a moment  while he chewed .   then he and the king exchanged a long  thoughtful stare .      p   akga     said albrecht  at last     a p   akaga ad        behind the outbreak of murmuring  vimes heard cheery translate        it is the thing  and the whole of              yes  yes     said vimes .  and he thought  by gods  we   re good .  ankh morpork  i   m proud of you .  when we make a forgery  it   s better than the real damn thing .   unless   unless i   ve missed something        thank you  gentlemen     said the king .  he waved a hand .  the dwarfs filed out  reluctantly  with many backward glances at vimes .      dee .  please fetch my ax from my chamber  will you .     the king said .     yourself  please .  i don   t want anyone else to handle it .  your excellency  you and your lady will remain here .  your   dwarf must leave  however .  the guards are to be posted on the door .  dee .      the ideas taster hadn   t moved .      dee .         wh      yes  sire .         you do what i tell you .         sire  this man   s ancestor once killed a king .         i daresay the family have got it out of their system .  now do as i say .      the dwarf hurried away  turning to stare at vimes for a moment as he left the cave .   the king sat back .      sit down  your monitorship .  and your lady  too .     he put one elbow on the arm of the chair and cupped his chin on his hand .     and now  mister vimes  tell me the truth .  tell me everything .  tell me the truth that is more valuable than small amounts of gold .         i   m not sure i know it anymore     said vimes .      ah .  a good start     said the king .     tell me what you suspect  then .         sire  i   d swear that thing is as fake as a tin shilling .         oh .  really .         the real scone wasn   t stolen  it was destroyed .  i reckon it was smashed and ground up and mixed with the sand in its cave .  you see  sire  if people see that something   s gone  and then you turn up with something that looks like it  they   ll think    this must be it  it must be  because it isn   t where we thought it was .     people are like that .  something disappears and something very much like it turns up somewhere else and they think it must somehow have got from one place to the other       vimes pinched his nose .     i   m sorry  i haven   t had much sleep           you are doing very well for a sleepwalking man .         the   thief was working with the werewolves  i think .  they were behind the    sons of agi hammerthief    business .  they were going to blackmail you off the throne   well  you know that .  to keep uberwald in the dark .  if you didn   t step down there   d be a war  and if you did albrecht would get the fake scone .         what else do you think you know .         well  the fake was made in ankh morpork .  we   re good at making things .  i think someone had the maker killed  but i can   t find out more until i get back .  i will find out .         you make things very well in your city  then  to fool albrecht .  how do you think that was done .         you want the truth  sire .         by all means .         is it possible that albrecht was involved .  find out where the money is  my old sergeant used to say .         hah .  who was it said    where there are policemen  you find crimes    .         er   me  sir  but           let us find out .  dee should have had time to think .  ah        the door opened .  the ideas taster stepped through  carrying a dwarfish ax .  it was a mining ax  with a pick point on one side  in order to go prospecting  and a real ax blade on the other  in case anyone tried to stop you .      call the guards in  dee     said the king .     and his excellency   s young dwarf .  these things should be seen  see .      oh  good grief  thought vimes  watching dee   s face as the others shuffled in  there must be a manual .  every copper knows how this goes .  you let    em know you know they   ve done something wrong  but you don   t tell    em what it is and you certainly don   t tell    em how much you know  and you keep    em off balance  and you just talk quietly and        place your hands upon the scone  dee .      dee spun around .     sire .         place your hands upon the scone .  do as i say .  do it now .         you keep the threat in view but you never refer to it  oh no .  because there   s nothing you can do to them that their imagination isn   t already doing to themselves .  and you keep it up until they break  or in the case of my old dame school  until they feel their boots get damp .   and it doesn   t even leave a mark .      tell me about the death of longfinger  the candle captain     said the king  after dee  with a look of hollow apprehension  had touched the scone .   the words rushed out .     oh  as i told you  sire  he           if you do not keep your hands pressed upon the scone  dee  i will see to it that they are fixed there .  tell me again .         i   he   took his own life  sire .  out of shame .      the king picked up his ax and turned it so that the long point faced outward .      tell me again .      now vimes could hear dee   s breathing  short and fast .      he took his own life  sire .      the king smiled at vimes .     there   s an old superstition  your excellency  that since the scone contains a grain of truth it will glow red hot if a lie is told by anyone touching it .  of course  in these more modern times  i shouldn   t think anyone believes it .     he turned to dee .      tell me again     he whispered .   as the ax moved slightly  the reflected light of the candles flashed along the blade .      he took his own life .  he did .         oh yes .  you said .  thank you     said the king .     and do you recall  dee  when slogram sent false word of bloodaxe   s death in battle to ironhammer  causing ironhammer to take his own life in grief  where was the guilt .         it was slogram   s  sir     said dee promptly .  vimes suspected the answer had come straight from some rote remembered teaching .      yes .      the king let the word hang in the air for a while  and then went on     and who gave the order to kill the craftsman in ankh morpork .         sire .     said dee .      who gave the order to kill the craftsman in ankh morpork .     the king   s tone did not change .  it was the same comfortable  singsong voice .  he sounded as though he would carry on asking the question forever .      i know nothing about           guards  press his hands firmly against the scone .      they stepped forward .  each one took an arm .      again  dee .  who gave the order .      dee writhed as if his hands were burning .      i   i        vimes could see the skin whiten on the dwarf   s hands as he strained to lift them from the stone .   but it   s a fake .  i   d swear he destroyed the real one  so he knows it   s a fake  surely .  it   s just a lump of plaster  probably still damp in the middle .  vimes tried to think .  the original scone had been in the cave  hadn   t it .  was it .  if it wasn   t  where had it been .  the werewolves thought they had a fake  and it certainly hadn   t left his sight since .  he tried to think through the fog of fatigue .   he   d half wondered  once  whether the original scone had been the one in the dwarf bread museum .  that would have been the way to keep it safe .  no one would try to steal something that everyone knew was a fake   the whole thing was the fifth elephant  nothing was what it seemed  it was all a fog     which one was real .      who gave the order  dee .     said the king .      not me .  i said they must take all necessary steps to preserve secrecy .         to whom did you say this .         i can give you names .         later  you will .  i promise you  boyo     said the king .     and the werewolves .         the baroness suggested it .  that is true .         uberwald for the werewolves .  ah  yes      joy through strength .     i expect they promised you all sorts of things   you may take your hands off the scone .  i do not wish to distress you further .  but   why .  my predecessors spoke highly of you  you are a dwarf of power and influence   and then you let yourself become a pawn of the werewolves .  why .         why should they be allowed to get away with it .     dee snapped  his voice breaking with the strain .   the king looked across at vimes .      oh  i suspect the werewolves will regret that they       he began .      not them .  the   ones in ankh morpork .  wearing   makeup and dresses and   and abominable things .     dee pointed a finger at cheery .     ha   ak .  how can you even look at it .  you let her     and vimes had seldom heard a word sprayed with so much venom     her flaunt herself  here .  and it   s happening everywhere because people have not been firm  not obeyed  have let the old ways slide .  everywhere there are reports   they   re eating away at everything dwarfish with their   their soft clothes and paint and beastly ways .  how can you be king and allow this .  everywhere they are doing it and you do nothing .  why should they be allowed to do this .     now dee was sobbing .     i can   t .  and i work so hard   so hard        vimes saw that cheery  to his amazement  was blinking back tears .      i see     said the king .     well  i suppose that is an explanation .      he nodded to the guards .     take   her away .  some things must wait a day or two .      cheery saluted  suddenly .      permission to go with her  sire .         what on earth for  young   young dwarf .         i expect she   d like someone to talk to  sir .  i know i would .         indeed .  well  if your commander has no objection   off you go  then .      the king leaned back when the guards had left with their prisoner and the prisoner   s new counselor .      well  your excellency .         this is the real scone .         you are not certain .         dee was .         dee   is in a difficult state of mind .     the king looked at the ceiling .     i think i will tell you this because  your excellency  i really do not want you going through the rest of your time here asking silly questions .  yes  this is the true scone .         but how could           wait .  so was the one that is  yes  ground to dust in the cave by dee in her   madness     the king went on .     so were the   let me see   five before that .  still untouched by time after fifteen hundred years .  what romantics we dwarfs are .  even the very best dwarf bread crumbles after a few hundred .         fakes .     said vimes .     they were all fakes .      suddenly the king was holding his mining ax again .     this  milord  is my family   s ax .  we have owned it for almost nine hundred years  see .  of course  sometimes it needed a new blade .  and sometimes it has required a new handle  new designs on the metalwork  a little refreshing of the ornamentation   but is this not the nine hundred year old ax of my family .  and because it has changed gently over time  it is still a pretty good ax  y   know .  pretty good .  will you tell me if this is a fake  too .      he sat back again .   vimes remembered the look on albrecht   s face .      he knew .         oh yes .  a number of   more senior dwarfs know .  the knowledge runs in families .  the first scone crumbled after three hundred years when the king of the time touched it .  my ancestor was a guard who witnessed it  see .  he   got accelerated promotion  you could say .  i   m sure you understand me .  after that  we were a little more prepared .  we should have been looking for a new one in fifty years or so in any case .  i   m glad this one was made in the large dwarf city of ankh morpork  and i wouldn   t be at all surprised if it turns out to be an excellent keeper .  look  they   ve even got the currants right  see .         but albrecht could have exposed you .         expose what .  he is not king  but i will be very surprised if one of his family is not king again  in the fullness of time .  what goes around comes around  as the igors say .     the king leaned forward .      you have been laboring under a misapprehension  i reckon .  you think that because albrecht dislikes ankh morpork and has   old fashioned ideas  he is a bad dwarf .  but i have known him for two hundred years .  he is honest and honorable   more so than me  that i   m sure of .  five hundred years ago he would have made a fine king .  today  perhaps not .  perhaps   hah   the ax of my ancestors needs a different handle .  but now i am king and he accepts that with all his heart because if he did not  he   d think he wasn   t a dwarf  see .  of course he will now oppose me at every turn .  being low king was never an easy job .  but  to use one of your metaphors  we are all floating in the same boat .  we may certainly try to push one another over the side  but only a maniac like dee would make a hole in the bottom .         corporal littlebottom thought there   d be a war       said vimes  weakly .      well  there are always hotheads .  but while we argue who steers the boat  we don   t deny that it   s an important voyage   i see you are tired .  let your good lady take you home .  but   as a nightcap   what is it  your excellency  that ankh morpork wants .         ankh morpork wants the names of the murderers     mumbled vimes .      no  that is what commander vimes wants .  what it is that ankh morpork wants .  gold .  so often it is gold .  or iron  perhaps .  you use a lot of iron .      vimes blinked .  his brain had finally given up .  there was nothing left anymore .  he wasn   t certain he could even stand up .   he remembered a word .      fat     he said blankly .      aha .  the fifth elephant .  are you sure .  there   s some good iron now .  iron makes you strong .  fat only makes you slippery .         fat     parroted vimes  feeling the darkness closing in .     lots of fat .         well  certainly .  the price is ten ankh morpork cents a barrel but  your excellency  since i have come to know you  i feel that perhaps           five cents a barrel for grade one high rendered  three cents for grade two  ten cents per barrel for heavy tallow  safe and delivered to ankh morpork     said sybil .     and all from the shmaltzberg bend levels and measured on the ironcrust scale .  i have some doubt about the long term quality of the big tusk wells .      vimes tried to focus on his wife .  she seemed  inexplicably  a long way away .      wha    .         er   i caught up with some reading when i was in the embassy  sam .  the  er  notebooks .  sorry .         would you beggar us  madam .     said the king  throwing up his hands .      we may be flexible on delivery     said lady sybil .      klatch would pay at least nine for grade one     said the king .      but the klatchian ambassador isn   t sitting here     said sybil .   the king smiled .     or married to you  my lady  much to his loss .  six  five and fifteen .         six dropping to five after twenty thousand  three and half across the board for grade two  i can give you thirteen on tallow .         acceptable  but give me fourteen on white tallow and i   ll allow seven on the new pale suets we are finding .  they are making an acceptable candle  look you .         six  i   m afraid .  you haven   t plumbed the full extent of those deposits  and i think it may be reasonable to expect high levels of scrattle and bcbs in the lower layers .  besides  i think your forecasts about the amount of those deposits are erring on the optimistic side .         wha    bcbs .     murmured vimes .      burnt crunchy bits     said sybil .     mostly unbelievably huge and ancient animals  deep fried .         you astonish me  lady sybil     said the king .     i did not know you were trained in fat extraction .         cooking sam   s breakfasts is an education in itself  your majesty .         oh well  far be if for a mere king to argue .  six  then .  price to remain stable for two years       the king saw sybil   s mouth open .     all right  all right  three years .  i   m not an unreasonable king .         prices on the dock .         how can i refuse .         agreed  then .         the paperwork will be with you in the morning .  and now we really must go our separate ways     said the king .     i can see his excellency has had a long day .  ankh morpork will be swimming in fat .  i can   t imagine what you   ll use it all for           make light     said vimes  and  as darkness fell at last  fell forward gently into the welcoming arms of sleep .      sam vimes woke up to the smell of hot fat .   softness enveloped him .  it practically imprisoned him .   for a moment he thought it was snow  except that snow wasn   t usually this warm .  finally  he identified it as the cloudlike softness of the mattress on the ambassadorial bed .   he let his attention drift back to the fat smell .  it had   overtones .  there was a definite burnt component .  since sam vimes   s range of gastronomic delight mainly ranged from    well fried    to    caramelized     it was definitely promising .   he shifted position and regretted it immediately .  every muscle in his body squealed in protest .  he lay still and waited for the fire in his back to die down .   bits and pieces of the last two days assembled themselves in his head .  once or twice he winced .  had he really gone through the ice like that .  was it sam vimes who   d stepped up to fight the werewolf  despite the fact that the thing was strong enough to bend a sword in a circle .  and had sybil won a lot of fat off the king .  and     well  here he was in a nice warm bed and by the smell of it there was breakfast on the way .   another piece of recollection floated into place .   vimes groaned  and forced his legs out of the bed .  no  wolfgang couldn   t have survived that  surely     naked  he staggered into the bathroom and spun the huge taps .  hot pungent water gushed out .   a minute later  he was lying full length again .  it was rather too hot  but he could remember the snows  and maybe from now on he could never be hot enough .   some of the pain washed away .   someone rapped on the door .      it   s me  sam .         sybil .      she came in  carrying a couple of very large towels and some fresh clothes .      good to see you up again .  igor   s frying sausages .  he doesn   t like doing it .  he thinks they should be boiled .  and he   s doing slumpie and fikkun haddock and distressed pudding .  i didn   t want the food to go to waste  you see .  i don   t think i want to stay for the rest of the celebrations .         i know what you mean .  how   s carrot .         well  he says he doesn   t want sausages .         what .  he   s al   he   s up .         sitting up  at least .  igor   s a marvel .  angua said it was a bad break  but he   s just got some sort of device that   well  carrot   s not even got a sling on now .         sounds a useful man to have around     said vimes  pulling on his civilized trousers .      angua says igor   s got an icehouse in the cellars and there   s frozen jars of  of   well  let   s just say he suggested that you might like liver and onions for breakfast and i said no .         i like liver and onions     said vimes .  he thought about it .     up until now  anyway .         i think the king wants us to go  as well .  in a polite way .  a lot of very respectful dwarfs came round here with paperwork first thing this morning .      vimes nodded grimly .  it made sense .  if he were king he   d want vimes out of here  too .  here   s some grateful thanks  a nice trading agreement  terribly sorry to see you go  do call again  only not too soon     breakfast was everything he   d dreamed of .  then he went to see the invalid .   carrot was pale  gray under the eyes  but smiling .  he was sitting up in bed  drinking fatsup .      hello  mister vimes .  we won  then .         didn   t angua tell you .         she went off with the wolves when i was asleep  lady sybil said .      vimes recounted the events of the night as best he could .   afterward  carrot said     gavin was a very noble creature .  i am sorry he is dead .  i   m sure we would have got on well .      you mean every word of it  vimes thought .  i know you do .  but it works out all right for you  doesn   t it .  it always does .  if it had been the other way about  if it had been gavin that attacked wolf first  then i know it would have been you that went over the falls with the bastard .  but it wasn   t you  was it .  if you were dice  you   d always roll sixes .   and the dice don   t roll themselves .  if it wasn   t against everything he wanted to be true about the world  vimes might just then have believed in some huge destiny controlling people .  and gods help the other people who were around when a big destiny was alive in the world  bending every poor bugger around itself     he wondered  not for the first time  but perhaps for the first time so articulately that his lips almost moved  if he might ever  one day  have to stand in its way     out loud  he said     poor old gaspode went over  too .         how .  what was he doing .         er   you could say he had our lad   s full attention     said vimes  coming back to the present .     a real streetfighter .         poor little soul .  he was a good dog at heart .      and once again words that would have sounded trite and wrong on anyone else   s lips were redeemed by the way carrot said them .      and what about tantony .     said vimes .      left this morning  lady sybil said .         good grief .  and wolfgang played tic tac toe on his chest .         igor   s a dab hand with a needle  sir .      afterward  a thoughtful sam vimes stepped out into the coach yard .  an igor was already loading the luggage .      er   which one are you .     said vimes .      i   m igor  marthter .         ah .  right .  and  er   are you happy here  igor .  we could do with a   man of your talents in the watch  and no mistake .      igor looked down from the top of the coach .      in ankh morpork  marthter .  my word .  everyone wanth to go to ankh morpork  marthter .  it   th a very tempting offer .  but i know where my duty lieth  your exthelenthy .  i must get the plathe ready for the next exthelenthy .         oh  surely           however  fortuitouthly my nephew igor ith looking for a pothition  marthter .  he thould do well in ankh morpork .  he   th rather too modern for uberwald  to tell you the truth .         good lad  is he .         hith heart   th in the right place .  i know that for thertain  thir .         er   good .  well  get a message to him  then .  we   re leaving as soon as we can .         he will be tho exthited  thir .  i   ve heard that in ankh morpork bodieth just lie around in the thtreeth for anyone to take away .         it   s not quite as bad as that  igor .         ithn   t it .  oh well  you can   t have everything .  i   ll tell him directly .      igor lurched off in a sort of high speed totter .   i wonder why they all walk like that  thought vimes .  they must have one leg shorter than the other .  either that or they   re not good at choosing boots .   he sat down on the steps to the house  and fished out a cigar .   so that was it  then .  bloody politics again .  it was always bloody politics  or bloody diplomatics .  bloody lies in smart clothing .  once you got off the streets criminals just flowed through your fingers .  the king and lady margolotta and vetinari   they always looked at some sort of big picture .  vimes knew he was  and always would be  a little picture man .  big picture people ran the world  and they said what was a crime and what wasn   t .  and dee was useful  so she   d probably get  oh  a few days breaking bread or whatever it was they gave you here for being naughty .  after all  all she   d destroyed was a fake  wasn   t it .   was it .   but she   d thought she was committing a much bigger crime .  that ought to mean something  in sam vimes   s personal gallery of little pictures .   and the baroness was as guilty as hell .  people had died .  as for wolfgang   well  some people were just built guilty .  it was as simple as that .  anything they did became a crime  simply because it was them doing it .   he blew out a stream of smoke .   people like that shouldn   t be allowed to simply die their way out of things .   but   he hadn   t  had he .   the wolves had gone a long way down the river  sybil had said  on both banks .  there wasn   t a sniff of him .  farther down was a mass of rapids and falls  miles of them     if he   d gone downstream     but upstream there was nothing but wild water  too  right up to the town     no  he couldn   t   surely no one could swim up a waterfall     a chilly little feeling began at the back of vimes   s neck .  ice formed in his muscles .   any sensible person would get right out of the country  wouldn   t they .  he tried hard to believe this .  the wolves were out hunting  tantony wouldn   t remember wolfgang fondly and if vimes judged the king correctly then the dwarfs would have some dark little revenge in store  too .   the trouble was that  if you formed a picture in your mind of a sensible person  and tried to superimpose it on a picture of wolfgang  you couldn   t get them to meet anywhere .   there was an old saying  wasn   t there .  as a dog returneth to his vomit  so a fool returneth to his folly .  well  that got wolfgang coming and going .   vimes stood up  and turned around carefully .  there was no one there .  sounds came in from the street gateway   people laughing  the sound of harness  the clank of a shovel clearing up last night   s snow .   he sidled into the embassy  keeping his back to the wall .  he groped his way toward the stairs  peering into every doorway .  he ran across the expanse of the hallway  did a tumbling roll  and ended up against the far wall .      is there anything wrong  sir .     said cheery .  she was watching him from the top of the stairs .      er   have you seen anything odd .     said vimes  dusting himself off self consciously     and i do realize that we   re talking about a house with igor in it .         could you give me a hint  sir .         wolfgang  godsdammit .         but he   s dead  sir .  isn   t he .         not dead enough .         er   what do you want me to do .         where   s detritus .         polishing his helmet  sir .     said cheery  on the point of panic .      what the hell is he wasting time with that for .         er   er   because we   re supposed to leave for the coronation in ten minutes  sir .         oh   yes           lady sybil told me to come and find you .  in a very distinct tone of voice  sir .      at that point lady sybil   s voice boomed along the corridor .      sam vimes .  you come here .         that one  sir     cheery added helpfully .   vimes trailed into the bedroom .  sybil was wearing another blue dress  a tiara and a firm expression .      is it a posh do .     said vimes .     i thought if i put on a clean shirt           your official dress uniform is in the dressing room     said sybil .      it was rather a long day yesterday           this is a coronation  samuel vimes .  it is not a come as you are .  go and get dressed  quickly .  including  and i don   t want to have to say this twice  the helmet with the feathers .         but not the red tights     said vimes  hoping against hope .     please .         the red tights  sam  go without saying .         they go at the knees     said vimes  but it was the grumble of the defeated .      i   ll ring for igor to come and help you .         things will have come to a pretty pass when i can   t put my own tights on  dear  thank you .      vimes dressed hurriedly  listening for   anything .  some creak in the wrong place  perhaps .   at least this was a watch uniform  even if it did have buckled shoes .  it included a sword .  the duking outfit didn   t allow for one  which had always struck vimes as amazingly stupid .  you got made a duke for being a fighter  and then they gave you nothing to fight with .   there was a tinkle of glass  back in the bedroom  and lady sybil was astonished to see her husband enter at a run with his sword raised .      i dropped the top of a scent bottle  sam .     she said .     what   s up with you .  even angua says he   s probably miles away and in no shape to cause trouble .  why   re you so nervy .      vimes sheathed the sword  and tried to relax .      because our wolfgang   s a damn bottle covey  dear .  any normal person  they crawl off if they get a beating .  or they have the sense to stay down  at least .  but sometimes you get one who just won   t let go .  eight stone weaklings who   ll try to head butt detritus .  evil little bantamweight bastards who   ll bust a bottle on the bar and try to attack five watchmen all at once .  you know what i mean .  idiots who   ll go on fighting long after they should stop .  the only way to put    em down is to put    em out .         i think i recognize the type  yes     said lady sybil  with an irony that failed to register with sam vimes until some days later .  she picked some lint off his cloak .      he   s going to be back .  i can feel it in my water     mumbled vimes .      sam .         yes .         can i have your attention for a couple of minutes .  wolfgang is not your problem now .  and i really need to talk to you very quietly for a little while without you running off after werewolves .     she said it as if this was a minor character flaw  like a tendency to leave his boots where people could trip over them .      er   they run after me     he pointed out .      but there   s always people being found dead or trying to kill you           i don   t ask them to  dear .         sam  i   m going to have a baby .      vimes   s head was full of werewolves and his automatic husbandry circuitry cut in to respond with    yes  dear     or    choose any color you like    or    i   ll get someone to sort it out .     fortunately his brain itself had its own sense of self preservation and  not wishing to be inside a skull that was stoved in by a bedside lamp  rewrote sybil   s words in white hot fire across his inner eyeball and then went and hid .   that   s why the response came out as a weak    what .  how .         the normal way  i hope .      vimes sat down on the bed .     and   not right now .         i very much doubt it .  but mrs .  content says it   s definite  and she   s been a midwife for fifty years .         oh .     some more brain functions crept back .     good .  that   s   good .         it   ll probably take a while to sink in .         yes .     another neuron lit up .     er   everything will be all right  will it .         what do you mean .         er  you   re rather  you   re not as   you           sam  my family have bred for breeding .  it   s an aristocratic tradition .  it   s practically what being an aristocrat means .  of course everything will be all right .         oh .  good .      vimes sat and stared .  his head felt like some vast sea that had just been parted by a prophet .  where there should have been activity  there was just bare sand and the occasional floundering fish .  but huge steep waves were tottering on either side  and in a minute they would crash down and cause cities to flood  a hundred miles away .   more glass tinkled  somewhere downstairs .      sam  igor   s probably just dropped something     said sybil  seeing his expression .     that   s all .  probably just knocked a glass over .      there was a snarl  and a scream  abruptly cut off .   vimes leapt off the bed .     lock the door after me and push the bed against it .     he paused for a moment in the doorway .     without straining yourself .     he added  and ran for the stairs .   wolfgang was trotting across the hall .   he was different this time .  wolf ears sprouted from a head that was still human .  his hair had grown around him like a mane .  patches of fur were tufted on his skin  and were mostly streaked with blood .   the rest of him   was having trouble deciding what it was .  one arm was trying to be a paw .   vimes reached for his sword  and remembered that it was back on the bed .  he rummaged in his pockets .   he knew the other thing was here  he remembered picking it up off the dressing table     his fingers closed on his badge .  he held it out .      stop .  in the name of the law .      wolfgang looked up at him  one eye glowing yellow .  the other was a mess .      hello  civilized     he growled .     you wait for me  hey .      he ducked into the corridor that led to the room where carrot lay .  vimes tried to catch him up  saw claw tipped fingers curl around the door and haul it out of its frame .   carrot was reaching for his sword     and then wolfgang was flying backward under the full weight of angua .  they landed back in the hall  a rolling ball of fur  claws and teeth .   when werewolf fights werewolf  there are advantages to either shape .  it   s an eternal struggle to get a position where hands beat claws .  and body shapes have lives of their own  a dangerous attribute if it is allowed to act unchecked .  a cat   s instinct is to jump on something that moves  but this is not a correct action if what is moving has a fizzing fuse .  the mind has to fight its own body for control and the other body for survival .  mix this together  and the noise suggests that there are four creatures in the whirling ball of rage .  and each one of them has brought several friends .  and none of them like any of the others .   a shadow made vimes spin around .  detritus  in shining armor  was aiming the piecemaker over the banisters .      sergeant .  no .  you   ll hit angua  too .         not a problem  sir     said detritus .        cos it won   t kill    em  so all we have to do  see  is sort out der bits that are wolfgang an    belt him over der head when he gets himself back together           if you fire that in here his bits will be mixed up with our bits and they won   t be big bits .  put the damn thing down .      wolfgang couldn   t control his shape well  vimes saw .  he couldn   t quite manage to be full wolf or full human  and angua was making the most of that .  she was ducking  weaving   biting .   but even if you put him down you couldn   t put him out .      mister vimes .     now it was cheery  beckoning urgently from the passage that led to the kitchen .     you ought to come here right now .      she was white faced .  vimes nudged detritus .     if they separate  just grab him  right .  just try to hold him still .      igor was lying in the kitchen  surrounded by broken glass .  wolfgang must have landed on him  and then took out his perpetual anger on a soft target .  the patchwork man was bleeding heavily and lay like a doll that had been flung hard against a wall .      marthter     he groaned .      can you do anything for him  cheery .         i wouldn   t know where to start  sir .         marthter  you got to remember thith  right .     igor groaned .      er   yes   what .         you got to get me into the icehouthe downthtairth and let igor know  underthtand .         which igor .     said vimes desperately .      any igor .     igor clutched at vimes   s sleeve .     me heart   th had it  but me liver   th right ath ninepence  tell him .  nothing wrong with my brain that a good bolt of lightnin    won   t sort out .  then igor can have me right hand  he   th got a cuthtomer waiting .  there   s yearth of good thervice left in my lower intethtine .  left eye not up to much  but i darethay thome poor thoul can find a uthe for it .  the right knee ith nearly new .  old m   th prodzky down the road would value my hip jointh  tell him .  got all that .         yes   yes  i think so .         right .  remember   what goeth around  cometh around        igor sank down .      he   s gone  sir     said cheery .   but he   ll soon be up and on someone else   s feet  vimes thought .  he didn   t say it aloud .  cheery was softhearted .  instead he said     can you get him into his icehouse .  by the sound of it angua   s winning        he ran back into the hall .  it was a wreck .  as he arrived angua managed to get a headlock on wolfgang and ran him into a wooden pillar .  he staggered  and she spun and scythed his legs from under him with a kick .   i taught her that  vimes thought  as her brother landed heavily .  some of that dirty fighting   that   s ankh morpork fighting  that is .   but wolfgang was up again like a rubber ball and somersaulting over her head .  that brought him to the front door .  he smashed it open with a blow and leapt out into the street .   and   that was it .  a room full of debris  snowflakes blowing in  and angua sobbing on the floor .   he picked her up .  she was bleeding in a dozen places .  that was as much of a diagnosis as sam vimes  not used these days to surveying naked young women at close quarters  thought he could decently attempt .      it   s all right  he   s gone     he said  because he had to say something .      it   s not all right .  he   ll lie low for a while and then he   ll be back .  i know him .  it won   t matter where we go .  you   ve seen him .  he   ll just track us down and follow us and then he   ll kill carrot .         why .         because carrot   s mine .      sybil advanced down the stairs  carrying vimes   s crossbow .      oh  you poor thing       she said .     come here  let   s find something to cover you up .  sam  isn   t there something you can do .      vimes stared at her .  built into sybil   s expression was the unquestioning assumption that he could do something .   an hour ago he   d been having breakfast .  ten minutes ago he   d been putting on this stupid uniform .  in a real room  with his wife .  and it had been a real world  with a real future .  and suddenly the dark was back  spattered with red rage .   and if he gave in to it  he   d lose .  that was the beast screaming  inside  and wolfgang was a better beast .  vimes knew he didn   t have the knack  the mindless  driving nastiness  sooner or later his brain would start operating  and kill him .   perhaps  said his brain  you start by using me        ye es     he said .     yes   i think there is something i can do        fire and silver  thought vimes .  well  silver   s in pretty short supply in uberwald .      you want i should come .     said detritus  who could pick up signals .      no  i think   i think i want to make an arrest .  i don   t want to start a war .  anyway  you need to wait here in case he doubles back .  but you could lend me your penknife        vimes found a sheet in one of the broken boxes  and tore off a long strip .  then he took his crossbow from his wife .      you see  now he   s committed a crime in ankh morpork     he said .     that makes him mine .         sam  we   re not           you know  everyone kept telling me i wasn   t in ankh morpork so often that i believed it .  but this embassy is ankh morpork and  right now     he hefted the bow     i am the law .         sam .         yes  dear .         i know that look .  don   t hurt anyone else  will you .         don   t worry  dear .  i   m going to be civilized about it .         there was a cluster of dwarfs in the street outside  surrounding one lying on the snow and in a pool of blood .      which way .     said vimes  and if they didn   t understand his words they understood the question .  several of them pointed along the street .   as he walked vimes cradled the crossbow and lit a thin cigar .   now this he understood .  it wasn   t damn politics  where good and bad were just  apparently  two ways of looking at the same thing or  at least  were described like that by the people who were on the side vimes thought of as    bad .      it was all too complicated and  where it was complicated  it meant that someone was trying to fool you .  but on the street  in hot pursuit  it was all so clear .  someone was going to be still standing at the end of the chase  and all you had to concentrate on was making sure it was you .   on a street corner a cart had overturned and its driver was kneeling by a horse that had been ripped open .      which way .      the man pointed .   the new street was wider  busier  and there were a number of elegant coaches  moving slowly through the crowds .  of course   the coronation .   but that belonged to the world of the duke of ankh morpork and  right now  he wasn   t here .  there was only sam vimes  who didn   t much like coronations .   there were screams up ahead  and the flow of people suddenly turned against vimes  so that he appeared to be heading upstream  like a salmon .   the street opened into a large square .  people were running now  which suggested to vimes that he was still going in the right direction .  it was pretty clear that you   d find wolfgang somewhere no one else wanted to be .   a flurry of movement on one side of him became a squad of the town guard  at the trot .  they halted .  one of them walked back .  it was tantony .   he looked vimes up and down .      i have you to thank for last night .     he said .  there were fresh scars on his face  but they were already healing .  we   ve got to get an igor  vimes told himself .      yes     said vimes .     the good bits and the bad bits .         and you see what happens when you stand up to a werewolf .      vimes opened his mouth to say    is that a uniform you   re wearing  captain  or is it just fancy dress .     but stopped himself in time .      no  it   s what happens when you   re fool enough to stand up to a werewolf with no backup and no firepower     he said .     i   m sorry  but we all have to learn that lesson .  integrity makes very poor armor .      the man reddened .      what is your business here .     he said .      our hairy friend just murdered someone in the embassy  which is           yes  yes  ankh morpork territory .  but this isn   t .  i am the watchman here .         i   m in hot pursuit  captain .  you know the term .         i   i   that doesn   t apply .     tantony snapped .      really .     vimes raised an eyebrow .     surely every copper knows about the rule of hot pursuit .  you can chase the suspect over your legal boundary if you   re in hot pursuit .  of course  there may be a bit of legal argy bargy once he   s caught  but we can save that for later .         i intend to arrest him myself for crimes committed today .         you   re too young to die .  besides  i saw him first .  tell you what   after he   s killed me  you can have a go .  fair enough .     he looked tantony in the eye .     now get out of the way .         you know i could have you arrested .         probably  but up until now i   d got you down as an intelligent man .      tantony nodded  and proved vimes right .      and is there nothing you would have us do .         well  yes .  you could scrape up my remains if this doesn   t work .      vimes felt the man   s stare on the back of his neck as he set off again .   there was a statue in the middle of the square .  it was of the fifth elephant .  some ancient craftsman had tried to achieve in bronze and stone the moment when the allegorical animal had thundered down out of the sky and gifted the country its incredible mineral wealth .  around it were idealized and rather heavyset figures of dwarfs and men  holding hammers and swords  and striking noble attitudes  they probably represented truth  industry  justice and mother   s home made fat pancakes  for all vimes knew  but he felt truly far from home in a country where  apparently  no one wrote graffiti on public statues .   a man was sprawled on the cobbles  with a woman kneeling beside him .  she looked tearfully at vimes and said something in uberwaldean .  all he could do was nod .   wolfgang jumped down from a perch on top of the statue to bad sculpting and landed a few yards away  grinning .      mister civilized .  you want another game .         you see this badge i am holding up .     said vimes .      it is a very small one .         but you see it .         yes  i see your little badge .     wolfgang started to move sideways  arms hanging loosely by his sides .      and i   m armed .  did you hear me tell you i   m armed .         with that silly bow .         but you just heard me say i   m armed  yes .     said vimes  loudly  turning to face the moving werewolf .  he puffed on his cigar  letting a glow build up .      yes .  is this what you call civilized .      vimes grinned .     yes  this is how we do it .         my way is better .         and now you   re under arrest     said vimes .     come along and make no fuss and we   ll tie you securely and hand you over to whatever passes for justice around here .  i realize this may be difficult .         hah .  your ankh morpork sense of humor .         yes  any minute now i   ll drop my trousers .  so   you   re resisting arrest .         why these stupid questions .     now wolfgang was almost dancing .      are you resisting arrest .         yes indeed .  oh yes .  good joke .         look at me laughing .      vimes tossed the crossbow aside and swung a tube out from under his cloak .  it was made of cardboard  and a red cone protruded from one end .      a stupid silly firework .     shouted wolfgang  and charged .      could be     said vimes .   he didn   t bother to aim .  these things were never designed for accuracy .  he simply removed his cigar from his mouth and  as wolfgang ran toward him  pressed it into the fuse hole .   the mortar jerked as the charge went off and its payload came out tumbling slowly and trailing smoke in a lazy spiral .  it looked like the stupidest weapon since the toffee spear .   wolfgang danced back and forth under it  grinning  and as it passed several feet over his head he leapt up gracefully and caught it in his mouth .   and then it exploded .   the flares were made to be seen twenty miles away .  even with his eyes tightly shut  vimes saw the glare through the lids .   when the body had stopped rolling  vimes looked around the square .  people were watching from the coaches .  the crowds were silent .   there were a lot of things he could say .     son of a bitch .     would have been a good one .  or he could say    welcome to civilization .     he could have said    laugh this one off .     he might have said    fetch .      but he didn   t  because if he had said any of those things  then he   d know that what he had just done was murder .   he turned away  tossed the empty mortar over his shoulder  and muttered     the hell with it .      at times like this  teetotalism bit down hard .   tantony was watching .      don   t say a word out of place     said vimes  without altering his stride .     just don   t .         i thought   those things shot very fast           i cut the charge down     said vimes  tossing detritus   s penknife in the air and catching it again .     i didn   t want to hurt anyone .         i heard you warn him that you were armed .  i heard him twice resist arrest .  i heard everything .  i heard everything you wanted me to hear .         yes .         of course  he might not have known that law .         oh  really .  well  i didn   t know it was legal in these parts to chase some poor sod across the country and maul him to death and  do you know  that didn   t stop anyone .      the crowds parted ahead of vimes .  he could hear whispers around him .      on the other hand     said tantony     you did only fire that thing to warn him           huh .         clearly you were not to know that he would automatically try to catch the   explosive     said tantony  and it seemed to vimes that he was rehearsing the line .     the   doglike qualities of a werewolf would hardly have occurred to a man from the big city .      vimes held his gaze for a moment  and then patted him on the shoulder .      hold on to that thought     he said .   a coach pulled to a halt beside him as he continued on his way .  it slid to a stop so silently  not a jingle of harness  not a clop of horseshoe  that vimes jumped sideways out of shock .   the horses were black  with black plumes on their heads .  the coach was a hearse  the traditional long glass windows now filled with smoked black glass .  there was no driver  the reins were simply loosely knotted on a brass railing .   a door swung open .  a veiled figure leaned out .      your excellency .  do let me give you a lift back to the embassy .  you look so tired .         no  thank you     said vimes grimly .      i apologize for the emphasis on black     said lady margolotta .     it is rather expected of one on these occasions  i   m afraid        vimes swung himself up and into the carriage with furious speed .      you tell me     he growled  waving a finger under her nose     how anyone can swim up a vertical waterfall .  i was prepared to believe anything about that bastard  but even he couldn   t have managed that           certainly that is a puzzle     said the vampire calmly  as the driverless coach moved on .     superhuman strength  possibly .         and now he   s gone and that   s one up for the vampires  eh .         i would like to think that it   s going to be a blessing for the whole country .     lady margolotta leaned back .  her rat with the bow around its neck watched vimes suspiciously from its pink cushion .     wolfgang was a sadistic murderer  a throwback who frightened even his own family .  delphine   sorry  angua   will have some peace of mind .  an intelligent young lady  i   ve always thought .  leaving here was the best thing she ever did .  the darkness will be a little less frightening .  the world will be a better place .         and i   ve handed you uberwald .         don   t be stupid .  uberwald is huge .  this is one small part of it .  and now it   s going to change .  you have been a breath of fresh air .      lady margolotta drew a long holder from her bag and inserted a black cigarette .  it lit itself .      like you  i have found consolation in a   different vice     she said .     black scopani .  they grow the tobacco in total darkness .  do try some .  you could waterproof roofs with it .  i believe igor makes cigars by rolling the leaves between his thighs .     she blew out a stream of smoke .     or someone   s thighs  anyway .  of course  i am sorry for the baroness .  it must be so hard for a werewolf  realizing that she   s raised a monster .  as for the baron  give him a bone and he   s happy for hours .     another stream of smoke .     do look after angua .  happy families is not a popular game among the undead .         you helped him come back .  just like you did for me .         oh  he   d have come back anyway  in time .  some time when you weren   t expecting him .  he   d track angua like a wolverine .  best that things ended today .     she gave him an appraising look through the smoke .     you   re good at anger  your grace .  you save it up for when you need it .         you couldn   t have known i   d beat him .  you left me in the snow .  i wasn   t even armed .         havelock vetinari would not have sent a fool to uberwald .     more smoke  which writhed in the air .     at least  not a stupid fool .      vimes   s eyes narrowed .     you   ve met him  haven   t you .         yes .         and taught him all he knows  right .      she blew smoke down her nostrils  and gave him a radiant smile .      i   m sorry .  you think i taught him .  my dear sir   as for what i   ve got out of all this   well  a little breathing space .  a little influence .  politics is more interesting than blood  your grace .  and much more fun .  beware the reformed vampire  sir   the craving for blood is only a craving  and with care it can be diverted along different channels .  ah  i believe we are here     she added  although vimes could have sworn that she hadn   t so much as glanced out of the window .   the door opened .      if my igor   s still there  do tell him i will see him downtown .  so nice to have met you .  i   m sure we shall meet again .  and do please present my fondest regards to lord vetinari .      the door shut behind vimes .  the coach moved off .   he swore  under his breath .   the hall was full of igors .  several of them touched their forelocks  or at least the approximate line of stitch marks  when they saw him .  all of them were carrying heavy metal containers of varying sizes  on which frost crystals were forming .      what   s this .     he said .     igor   s funeral .     then it sunk in .     oh  my gods   with party loot bags .  everyone gets something to take home .         you could say that  thir  you could put it that way     said an igor  as the rest filed past .     it may theem odd to you  but we think that putting bodieth in the ground ith rather gruethome .  all thothe wormth and thingth .     he tapped the tin box under his arm .     thith way  he   ll be mothtly up and about again in no time     he added brightly .      reincarnation on the installment plan  eh .     said vimes weakly .      motht amuthing  thir     said the igor gravely .     but it   th amathing what people need .  heartth  liverth  handth   we keep a litht  thir  of detherving catheth .  by tonight there will be thome very lucky people in thethe parth           and these parts in some very lucky people .         well done  thur .  i can thee you are a wit .  and i   m sure one day thome poor thoul will have a really nathty brain injury  and     he tapped the chilly box again     what goeth around  cometh around .      he nodded at cheery  and at vimes .   he limped off  but suddenly a very similar voice was behind vimes .  another igor came out of the kitchens  carrying a dusty black suit on a hanger and  in his other hand  a pair of boots .      a bit worn  but i darethay some poor thoul will be grateful     he said .     thorry we   re all ruthing off  thir .  tho much to do  you know how it ith .         i can imagine     said vimes  and unfortunately he could .  but  then  he thought  the ax of my grandfather  the king called it .  you change things around  you replace every bit  but the ax survives .  there will always be an igor .      they   re really rather selfless people  sir     said cheery  when the last igor had lurched off .     they do a lot of good work for people .         i know  i know .  but           yes  sir .  i know what you mean  sir .  everyone   s in the drawing room .  lady sybil said you   d be back .  she said anyone with that look in their eye comes back .         we   re all going to the coronation .  might as well see this through .  is that what you   ll be wearing  cheery .         yes  sir .         but it   s just   ordinary dwarf clothes .  trousers and everything .         yes  sir .         but sybil said you   d got a fetching little green number and a helmet with a feather in it .         yes  sir .         you   re free to wear whatever you want  you know that .         yes  sir .  and then i thought about dee .  and i watched the king when he was talking to you  and   well  i can wear what i like  sir .  that   s the point .  i don   t have to wear that dress .  i can wear what i like .  i don   t have to wear something just because other people don   t want me to .  anyway  it made me look a rather stupid lettuce .         that   s all a bit complicated for me  cheery .         it   s probably a dwarf thing  sir .         and a female thing     said vimes .      well  sir   yes .  a dwarf thing and a female thing     said cheery .     and they don   t come much more complicated than that .      vimes pushed open the doors to the drawing room .      it   s over     he said  as they turned to look at him .      did you hurt anyone else .     said sybil .      only wolfgang .         he   ll be back     said angua  flatly .      no .         you killed him .         no .  i put him down .  i see you   re up  captain .      carrot got to his feet  awkwardly  and saluted .      sorry i haven   t been much use  sir .         you just chose the wrong time to fight fair .  are you well enough to come .         er   angua and i want to stay here  if it   s all right with you  sir .  we   ve got things to talk about .     carrot looked down .     and   er   do     he added .      it was the first coronation vimes had attended .  he   d expected it to be   stranger  touched somehow by glory .   instead it was dull  but at least it was big dull  dullness distilled and honed and cultivated over thousands of years until it had developed an impressive shine  as even grime will if you polish it long enough .  it was dullness hammered into the shape and form of ceremony .   it had also been timed to test the capacity of the average bladder .   a number of dwarfs read passages from ancient scrolls .  there were what sounded like excerpts from the koboldean saga  and vimes wondered desperately if they were in for another opera  but these were over after a mere hour .  there were more readings by different dwarfs .  at one point the king  who had been standing alone in the center of a circle of candlelight  was presented with a leather bag  a small mining ax  and a ruby .  vimes didn   t catch the meaning of any of this  but by the sounds behind him it was clear that each item was of huge and satisfying significance to the thousands who were standing behind him .  thousands .  no  there must be tens of thousands  he thought .  the bowl of the cavern was full of tier upon tier of dwarfs .  maybe a hundred thousand        and he was in the front row .  no one had said anything .  the four of them had simply been led there and left  although the murmurings suggested that the presence of detritus was causing considerable comment .  senior  long bearded and richly clothed dwarfs were all around them  and the troll stood out like a tower .   someone was being taught something .  vimes wondered who the lesson was directed at .   finally  the scone was brought in  small and dull and yet carried by twenty four dwarfs on a large bier .  it was laid  reverentially  on a stool .   he could sense the change in the air of the huge cavern  and once again he thought  there   s no magic  you poor devils  there   s no history .  i   ll bet my wages the damn thing was molded with rubber from a vat that had last been used in the preparation of sonky   s eversure dependables  and there   s your holy relic for you     there were still more readings  much shorter this time .   then the dwarfs who had been participating in the endless and baffling hours withdrew from the center of the cavern  leaving the king looking as small and alone as the scone itself .   he stared around him and  although it was surely impossible for him to have seen vimes among the thousands in the gloom  it did seem that his gaze rested on the ankh morpork party for a fraction of a second .   the king sat down .   a sigh began .  it grew louder and louder  a hurricane made up of the breath of a nation .  it echoed back and forth among the rocks until it drowned out all other sounds .   vimes had half expected the scone to explode  or crumble  or flash red hot .  which was stupid  said a dwindling part of himself   it was a fake  a nonsense  something made in ankh morpork for money  something that had already cost lives .  it was not  it could not be real .   but in the roaring air he knew that it was  in the minds of all who needed to believe  and in a belief so strong that fact was not the same as truth   he knew that for now  and yesterday  and tomorrow  it was both the thing  and the whole of the thing .      angua noticed that carrot was walking better even as they reached the forest below the falls  and the shovel over his shoulder hardly burdened him at all .   there were wolf prints all over the snow .      they won   t have stayed     she said  as they walked between the trees .     they felt things keenly when he died but   wolves look to the future .  they don   t try to remember things .         they   re lucky     said carrot .      they   re realistic  it   s just that the future contains the next meal and the next danger .  is your arm all right .         it feels as good as new .      they found the freezing mass of fur lying at the water   s edge .  carrot pulled it out of the water  scraped off the snow higher up the shingle  and started to dig .   after a while he took off his shirt .  the bruises were already fading .   angua sat and looked over the water  listening to the thud of the spade and the occasional grunt when carrot hit a tree root .  then she heard the soft slither of something being pulled over snow  a pause  and then the sound of sand and stones being shoveled into a hole .      do you want to say a few words .     said carrot .      you heard the howl last night .  that   s how wolves do it     said angua  still looking out across the water .     there aren   t any other words .         perhaps just a moment   s silence  then        she spun round .     carrot .  don   t you remember last night .  didn   t you wonder what i might become .  didn   t you worry about the future .         no .         why the hell not .         it hasn   t happened yet .  shall we get back .  it   ll be dark soon .         and tomorrow .         i   d like you to come back to ankh morpork .         why .  there   s nothing for me there .      carrot patted the soil over the grave .      is there anything left for you here .     he said .     besides  i        don   t you dare say the words  angua thought .  not at a time like this .   and then they both became aware of the wolves .  they were creeping through the trees  darker shadows in the evening light .      they   re hunting     said angua  grabbing carrot   s arm .      oh  don   t worry .  they don   t attack human beings for no reason .         carrot .         yes .     the wolves were closing in .      i   m not human .         but last night           that was different .  they remembered gavin .  now i   m just a werewolf to them        she watched him turn to look at the advancing wolves .  the hairs were up on their backs .  they were growling .  they moved with the strange sidle of those whose hatred could just manage to overcome their fear .  and at any moment that balance in one of them was going to tip all the way  and then it would be all over .   there was a leap  and it was carrot who made it .  he grabbed the lead wolf by its neck and tail and held on as it struggled and snapped .  its frantic efforts to escape resulted only in it running in a circle with carrot in the middle  the other wolves back away from the whirl of gray .  then  as it stumbled  he bit it on the back of the neck .  it screamed .   carrot let go  and stood up .  he looked at the circle of wolves .  they shied away from his gaze .      hmmm .     he said .   the wolf on the ground whined  and got to its feet awkwardly .      hmmm .      it tucked its tail between its legs and backed off  but it still seemed to be attached to carrot by an invisible lead .      angua .     said carrot  still watching it carefully .      yes .         can you speak wolf .  i mean  in this shape .         a bit .  look  how did you know what to do .         oh  i   ve watched animals     said carrot  as if that was an explanation .     please tell them   tell them if they go away now  i won   t harm them .      she managed to bark out the words .  it had all changed  in such a tiny handful of seconds .  now carrot wrote the script .      and now tell them that although i   m going away  i may be back .  what   s the name of this one .     he nodded at the cowering wolf .      that   s eats wrong meat     angua whispered .     he was   he   s the leader now that gavin   s gone .         then tell them that i   m quite happy that he should go on leading .  tell them all that .      they watched her intently .  she knew what they were thinking .  he   d beaten the leader .  it was all sorted out .  wolves did not have a lot of mental space for uncertainty .  doubt was a luxury for species that did not live one meal away from starvation .  they still had a gavin shaped hole in their minds and carrot had stepped into it .  of course  it wouldn   t last long .  but it didn   t need to .   he always  always finds a way in  she thought .  he doesn   t think about it  he doesn   t plot  he simply slides in .  i saved him because he couldn   t save himself  and gavin saved him because   because   because he had some reason   and i   m almost  almost certain that carrot doesn   t know how he manages to wrap the world around him .  almost certain .  he   s good and kind and born to be a king of the ancient sort that wore oak leaves and ruled from a seat under a tree  and though he tries hard he never has a cynical thought .   i   m almost certain .      let   s go now     said carrot .     the coronation will be over soon  and i don   t want mister vimes to worry .         carrot .  i   ve got to know something           yes .         that might happen to me .  have you ever thought about that .  he was my brother  after all .  being two things at the same time  and never quite being one   we   re not the most stable of creatures           gold and muck come out of the same shaft     said carrot .      that   s just a dwarf saying .         it   s true  though .  you   re not him .         well   if it happened   if it did   would you do what vimes did .  carrot .  would it be you who picked up a weapon and came after me .  i know you won   t lie .  i   ve got to know .  would it be you .      a little snow slid down from the trees .  the wolves watched .  carrot looked up for a moment  at the gray sky  and then nodded .      yes .      she sighed .      promise .     she said .      vimes was surprised at how quickly the coronation became a working day .  there was a flourish of echoing horns  a general flow of the crowd and  gradually  a queue in front of the king .      they haven   t even given him time to get comfy .     said lady sybil  as they headed toward the exit .      our kings are   working kings     said cheery  and vimes detected a dash of pride in her voice .     but now is the time when the king awards favors .      a dwarf caught up with vimes and tugged his cloak respectfully .      the king wishes to see you now  your excellency     he said .      there   s an almighty queue .         nevertheless     the dwarf gave a polite cough     the king wishes to see you now .  all of you .      they were led to the front of the queue .  vimes felt many eyes boring into the small of his back .   the king dismissed the previous supplicant with a regal nod as the ankh morpork party was deftly inserted at the top of the line  supplanting a dwarf whose beard went down to his knees .   he looked at them for a moment  and then the internal filing system threw up a card .      ah  it   s yourselves  good as new     he said .     now  what was it i was going to do .  oh  i remember   lady sybil .      she curtsied .      classically  we give rings at this time     said the king .     between ourselves  many dwarfs consider this a bit   well  bath salts  see .  but i believe they are still welcome and so this  lady sybil  is  perhaps  a token of things to come .      it was a thin silver ring .  vimes was taken aback at this parsimony  but sybil could graciously accept a bunch of rats .      oh  how wond           we normally give gold     the king went on .     very popular  and of course you can sing about it .  but this has   rarity value  see .  it is the first silver that had been mined in uberwald in hundreds of years .         i thought there was a rule that       vimes began .      i ordered the mines reopened last night     said the king  pleasantly .     it seemed   an auspicious time .  we shall soon have silver for sale  your excellency  but if lady sybil doesn   t get involved in the negotiations and bankrupt us  i for one shall be very grateful     the king added .     miss littlebottom  i see  has not graced us with a sartorial extravaganza today .      cheery stared .      you   re not wearing a dress     prompted the king .      no  sire .         although i do notice a few unobtrusive touches of mascara and lipstick .         yes  sire     squeaked cheery  on the point of death through shock .      there   s nice .  do be sure to let me know the name of your dressmaker     the king went on pleasantly .     i may have some custom for her in the fullness of time .  i   ve thought long and hard        vimes blinked .  cheery had gone pale .  had anyone else heard that .  had he .   sybil nudged him in the ribs .      your mouth   s open  sam     she whispered .   so he had heard it     he heard the king   s voice again .         and a bag of gold is always acceptable .      cheery was still staring .   vimes shook her gently by the shoulder .      th   thank you  sire .      the king held out his hand .  vimes wobbled cheery again .  completely hypnotized  she extended her hand .  the king took it and shook it .   shocked whispers were spreading  behind vimes .  the king had shaken the hand of a self declared female        and that leaves   detritus     said the king .     what a dwarf should give a troll is of course a bit of a puzzle  but it occurs to me that what i should give you is what i would give a dwarf .  a bag of gold  then  for whatever purpose you choose to put it  and        he stood up .  he held out his hand .   dwarfs and trolls were still fighting in the farther regions of uberwald  vimes knew .  elsewhere  there was at best the sort of peace you got when both sides were busy rearming .   the whispering stopped .  silence spread out in a widening circle  all across the floor of the cave .   detritus blinked .  then he took the hand very carefully  trying not to crush it .   the whispering started again .  and this time  vimes knew  it   d go for miles .   it occurred to him that in two handshakes the white bearded  elderly dwarf had done more than a dozen devious plots could have achieved .  by the time those ripples reached the edge of uberwald  they would be tidal waves .  thirty men and a dog would be nothing by comparison .      hmm .         i said  what can a king give a vimes .     said the king .      er   nothing  i think     said vimes absently .  two handshakes .  and very quietly  smiling  the king had turned the customs of the dwarfs upside down .  and so gently  too  that they   d spend years arguing about it .      sam .     snapped sybil .      well  then  i shall give something to your descendants     said the king  apparently unperturbed .  a long flat box was brought to him .  he opened it to reveal a dwarf ax  the new metal glinting on its nest of black cloth .      this will become  in time  the ax of someone   s grandfather     said the king  lifting it out .     and no doubt over the years it will need a new handle or a new blade and over the centuries the shape will change in line with fashion  but it will always be  in every detail and respect  the ax i give you today .  and because it   ll change with the times  it   ll always be sharp .  there   s a grain of truth in that  see .  so nice to have met you .  do enjoy your journey home  your excellency .         the four were silent in the coach back to the embassy .  then cheery said     the king said           i heard     said vimes .      that was as good as saying that he is a sh           things are going to change     said lady sybil .     that   s what the king was saying .         i never shook hands with no king before     said detritus .     no dwarf  either  come to that .         you shook hands with me once     said cheery .      watchmen don   t count     said detritus firmly .     watchmen is watchmen .         i wonder if it   ll change anything .     said lady sybil .   vimes stared out of the window .  it   d probably make people feel good  he thought .  but trolls and dwarfs had been fighting for centuries .  ending that sort of thing took more than a handshake .  it was just a symbol .   on the other hand   the world wasn   t moved by heroes or villains or even by policemen .  it might as well be moved by symbols .  all he knew was that you couldn   t hope to try for the big stuff  like world peace and happiness  but you might just about be able to achieve some tiny deed that   d make the world  in a small way  a better place .   like shooting someone .      i forgot to say that i thought it was very kind of you  cheery     said lady sybil     yesterday  when you comforted dee .         she would have had me killed by the werewolves     said vimes .  he felt this was a point worth making .      yes  of course .  but   it was kind  anyway     said sybil .   cheery looked at her feet  avoiding lady sybil   s gaze .  then she coughed nervously and pulled a small piece of paper out of her sleeve  which she handed wordlessly to vimes .   he unfolded it  and read it .  it was a list of names and addresses .      she gave you these .     he said .     some of these are very senior dwarfs in ankh morpork           yes  sir     said cheery  she coughed again .     i knew she wanted someone to talk to  and   er   i suggested a few things she might like to talk about .  sorry  lady sybil .  it   s very hard to stop being a copper .         i worked that one out a long time ago     said sybil .      you know     said vimes  to break the silence     if we leave at first light tomorrow  we could be through the pass before sundown        and it was a comfortable night  somewhere in the depths of the feather mattress .  vimes awoke a couple of times  and thought he could hear voices .  then he   d sink back into the softness  and dream of warm snow .   he was shaken awake by detritus .      it   s gettin    light  sir .         mm .         and dere   s a igor an    a   a young man out in der hall     said detritus .     he got a big jar full of noses and a rabbit covered in ears .      vimes tried to get back to sleep  then he sat bolt upright .      what .         it   s all covered in ears  sir .         you mean one of those rabbits with big floppy ears .         you better come and see dis rabbit     sniffed the troll .   vimes left sybil wallowing in sleep  pulled on his dressing gown  and pattered barefoot down to the freezing hall .   an igor was waiting anxiously in the middle of the floor .  vimes was getting the hang of igor recognition   and this was a new one .  he was with a much younger   er   man  probably barely out of his teens  at least in places  but already the scars and stitching indicated that relentless urge toward self improvement that was the hallmark of a good igor .  they just never seemed to be able to get the eyes level .      your exthelenthy .         you   re   igor  right .         amathing guethth  thir .  we haven   t met before  but i work for dr .  thaumic on the other thide of the mountain  and thith is my thon  igor .     he smacked the young man around the back of his head .     thay hello to hith grathe  igor .         i don   t believe in the peerage     said young igor  sulkily .     nor shall i call any man marthter .         thee .     said his father .     thorry about this  your grathe  but thith is the younger generation for you .  i hope you can find a job for him in the big thity     coth he   th totally unemployable in uberwald .  but he   th a very good thurgeon  even if he doeth have funny ideaths .  he   th got his grandfather   s handth  you know .         i can see the scars     said vimes .      lucky little devil  they thould have been mine by rightth  but he wath old enough to go into the lottery .         you want to join the watch  igor .     said vimes .      yes  sir .  i believe ankh morpork is where the future lies  thir .      his father leaned closer to vimes .     we don   t menthion hith thlight thpeech impedient  marthter     he whispered .     of courthe  it counth againtht him here  you know  in the igor buthinethth  but i   m thure people will be kind to him in ankh morpork .         yes  indeed     said vimes  removing his handkerchief and absentmindedly dabbing his ear .     and   er   this rabbit .         he   s eerie  thir     said young igor .      good name .  good name .  er   is that why he   s got human ears all over his back .         early experiment  thir .         and   er   the noses .      there were about a dozen of them  in a large screw top pickle jar .  and they were   just noses .  not cut off of anyone  as far as vimes could see .  they had little legs  and were jumping hopefully up and down against the glass  like puppies in a pet shop window .  he thought he would hear faint    whee .     noises .      the wave of the future  thir     said young igor .     i grow them in special vats .  i can do eyes and fingers  too .         but they   ve got little legs .         oh  they wither off in a few hours after they   re attached  thir .  and they want to be useful  my little noses .  bio artificing for the nexth century  thir .  none of that outmoded cutting up of old bodies        his father smacked his head again .     you thee .  you thee .  where   th the point in that .  wathtrel .  i hope you can do thomething with him  marthter  becauthe i   ve justht about given up .  not worth breaking down for thpareth  ath we thay .      vimes sighed .  still  losing small extremities was a daily hazard in the watch and the lad was  after all  an igor .  it wasn   t as if there were any normal people in the watch .  he could afford to put up with a nose breeder in exchange for surgery that didn   t involve screaming and buckets of boiling pitch .   he indicated a box beside the young man .  it was growling  and rocking from side to side .      you haven   t got a dog too  have you .     he said  trying to make it sound like a joke .      that   s my tomatoes     said young igor .     a triumph of modern igoring .  they grow enormously .         only becauthe they vithiouthly attack all other vegetableth .     said his father .     but i   ll thay thith for the lad  marthter  i   ve never known anyone like him for really tiny stitching .         all right  all right  he sounds like the man i   m looking for     said vimes .     or close  at least .  take a seat  young man .  i just hope there   s going to be room in the coaches        the door to the yard swung open  blowing in a few snowflakes and carrot  who stamped his feet .      a bit of snow overnight  but the road looks open     he said .     they says there   s a really big one due tonight  though  so we   oh  good morning  sir .         you   re fit enough to travel .     said vimes .      we both are     said angua .  she crossed the hall and stood next to carrot .   once again  vimes was aware of a lot of words that he hadn   t heard .  a wise man didn   t make inquiries at a time like this .  besides  vimes could feel the cold coming up through his feet .   he reached a decision .      give me your notebook  captain     he said .   they watched him scribble a few lines .      stop at the clacks tower and send a message on to the yard     he said  handing it back to carrot .     tell them you   re on the way .  take young igor here with you and get him settled in  okay .  and make a report to his lordship .         er   you   re not coming .     said carrot .      her ladyship and i will take the other coach     said vimes .     or buy a sleigh .  very comfy things  sleighs .  and we   ll   we   ll just take it a little easier .  we   ll see the sights .  we   ll dawdle along the way .  understand .      he saw angua smile  and wondered if sybil had confided in her .      absolutely  sir     said carrot .      oh  and   er   go along to burleigh and stronginthearm   s  order a couple of dozen of everything off the top of their small arms catalogue  and get them onto the next mailcoach due to bonk for the personal attention of captain tantony .         the mail coach rate will be very expensive  sir       carrot began .      i didn   t want you to tell me that  captain .  i wanted you to say    yes  sir .            yes  sir .         and ask at the gate about   three gloomy biddies who live in a big house near here .  it   s got a cherry orchard .  find out the address and when you get back send them three coach tickets to ankh morpork .         right  sir .         well done .  travel safely .  i   ll see you in a week .  or two .  three at the outside .  all right .      a few minutes later he stood shivering on the steps  watching the coach disappear into the crisp morning .   he felt a pang of guilt  but it was only a little pang .  he gave every day to the watch and it was time  he thought  for it to give him a week .  or two .  three at the outside .   in fact  he realized  as pangs went it was barely a ping which was  he recalled  a dialect word for watermeadow .  right now he could see a future  which was more than he   d ever had before .   he locked the door and went back to bed .      on a clear day  from the right vantage point on the ramtops  a watcher could see a very long way across the plains .   the dwarfs had harnessed mountain streams and built a staircase of locks that rose a mile up from the rolling grasslands  for the use of which they charged not just a pretty penny but a very handsome dollar .  barges were always ascending or descending  making their way down to the river smarl and the cities of the plain .  they carried coal  iron  fireclay  pig treacle  and fat  the dull ingredients of the pudding of civilization .   in the sharp  thin air they took several days to get out of sight .  on a clear day  you could see next wednesday .   the captain of one of the barges waiting for the top lock went to tip the dregs of his teapot over the side and saw a small dog sitting on the snowy bank .  it sat up and begged  hopefully .   he turned to go back into the cabin when he thought  what a nice little doggie .   it was such a clear thought that it almost seemed to him that he was hearing it  but he looked around and there was no one else near him .  and dogs certainly couldn   t talk .   he heard himself think     this little doggie would be very useful keepin    down rats that might attack the cargo  sort of fing .      it must have been him that thought it  he decided .  there was no one else nearby  and everyone knew dogs didn   t talk .   he said aloud     but rats don   t eat coal  do they .      he thought  clear as day     ah  well  you never know when they might try  right .  anyway  it   s such a sweet looking little doggie that   s been strugglin    for days through deep snow  huh  not that anyone cares .      the bargeman gave up .  there   s only so long you can argue with yourself .   ten minutes later the barge was on the long drop to the plains  with a small dog sitting at the prow  enjoying the breeze .   on the whole  thought gaspode  it was always best to look to the future .      nobby nobbs had made himself a shelter up against the wall of the watch house  and was gloomily warming his hands when a shadow loomed over him .      what are you doing  nobby .     said carrot .      huh .  captain .         there   s no one on the gates  there   s no one on patrol   didn   t anyone get my message .  what   s happening .      nobby licked his lips .      we ell     he said .     there isn   t   well  there isn   t a watch at the moment .  not per say .     he flinched .  he saw angua behind carrot .     er   mister vimes with you  at all .         what is happening  nobby .         well   you see   fred kind of   and then he got all sort of   then next thing you know he was setting for to   and then we   and then he wouldn   t come out   and then we   and he nailed up the door   and mrs .  fred came and shouted at him through the letter box   and most of the lads have gone off and got other jobs   and now there   s just me and dorfl and reg and washpot  and we come here turn and turn about and we shove food through the letter box for him   and   that   s it  really           can we have that again with the gaps filled in .     said carrot .   this took considerably longer .  there were still gaps .  carrot forced them open .      i see     he said at last .      mister vimes is going to go spare  isn   t he     said nobby miserably .      i wouldn   t worry about mister vimes     said angua .     not at the moment .      carrot was looking up at the front door .  it was thick oak .  there were bars at all the windows .      go and fetch constable dorfl  nobby     he said .   ten minutes later the watch house had a new doorway .  carrot stepped over the wreckage and led the way upstairs .   fred colon was hunched in the chair  staring fixedly at one solitary sugar lump .      be careful     whispered angua .     he might be in a rather fragile mental state .         that   s very likely     said carrot .  he leaned down and whispered     fred .         mm .     murmured colon .      on your feet  sergeant .  am i    urtin    you .  i ought to be  i   m standing    on your beard .  you   ve got five minutes to wash and shave and be back here with shinin    mornin    face .  on your feet .  to the washroom .  abou ut turn .  at the double .  one two one two .      it seemed to angua that no part of fred colon above the neck  except maybe for his ears  was involved in what happened next .  fred colon rose at attention  executed a thudding about turn and doubled out of the door .   carrot spun around toward nobby .      you too  corporal .      nobby  trembling with shock  saluted with both hands at once and ran after colon .   carrot went over to the fireplace and poked at the ashes .      oh dear     he said .      all burnt .     said angua .      i   m afraid so .         some of those heaps were like old friends .         well  we   ll find out if we   ve missed anything important when it starts to smell     said carrot .   nobby and colon appeared again  breathless and pink .  there were a few bits of tissue stuck on colon   s face where the shaving had been too enthusiastic  but he was nevertheless looking better .  he was a sergeant again .  someone was giving him orders .  his brain was moving .  the world was the right side up once again .      fred .     said carrot .      yessir .         you   ve got a bit of bird doings on your shoulder .         i   ll see to that right now  sir .     said nobby  leaping sideways .  he dragged a handkerchief from his pocket  spat on it  and rubbed hurriedly at colon   s temporary pip .     all gone now  fred .     he said .      well done     said carrot .   he got up and went over to the window .  it did not  in fact  offer much in a way of a view .  but he looked out of it as if he could see to the end of the world .   colon and nobby shifted uneasily .  right now  they did not like the sound of silence .  when carrot did speak  they blinked as if struck in the face by a cold flannel .      what i believe there has been here     he said     is a confused situation .         that   s right  that   s right     said nobby quickly .     we was very confused .  fred .      he jabbed fred colon with his elbow  waking him from a reverie of terror .      uh .  oh .  right .  oh yeah .  confusion     he mumbled .      and i   m afraid i know where the blame ultimately lies     carrot went on  still apparently engrossed in the spectacle of a man sweeping the opera house steps .   in the silence  nobby   s lips moved in prayer .  only the whites of fred colon   s eyes could be seen .      it was my fault     said carrot .     i blame myself .  mister vimes left me in charge  and i rushed off with no thought of my duty and put everyone in an impossible position .      fred and nobby were both wearing the same expression .  it was the face of a man who has seen the light at the end of the tunnel and it has turned out to be the twinkle of the fairy of hope .      i feel almost embarrassed to ask you two to get me out of this pit i have dug for myself     said carrot .     i can   t imagine what mister vimes is going to say .      the light at the end of the tunnel winked out for fred and nobby .  they could imagine what mr .  vimes would say .      however     said carrot .  he returned to the desk and pulled open the bottom drawer  extracting a few grubby pages that were clipped together .   they waited .      however  each of these men took the king   s shilling and swore an oath to defend the king   s peace     said carrot  tapping the paper .     an oath  in fact  to the king .         yeah  but that was only   aargh .     said fred colon .      sorry  sir     said nobby .     i inadvertently trod heavily on fred   s toe while standing to attention .      there was a long drawn out silken sound .  carrot was drawing his sword from its sheath .  he laid it on the desk .  nobby and colon leaned away from its accusatory point .      they are all good lads     said carrot softly .     i   m sure if the two of you call on each and every one of them and explain the situation  they will see where their duty lies .  tell them   tell them there is always an easy way  if you know where to look .  and then we can get on with our jobs  and when mister vimes returns from his well earned holiday the somewhat confused events of the past will be merely           confusin    .     suggested nobby  hopefully .      exactly     said carrot .     but i   m glad to see you made so much headway with the paperwork  fred .      colon stood nailed to the spot until nobby  saluting desperately with the other hand  dragged him out of the office .   angua could hear them arguing all the way down the stairs .   carrot stood up  dusted off the chair  and placed it carefully under the desk .      well  we   re home     he said .      yes     said angua  and she thought  you do know how to do nasty  don   t you .  but you use it like a claw  it slides out when you need it  and when you don   t there   s no sign that it   s there .   he reached over and took her hand .      wolves never look back     he whispered .      not rock and iron in their dead form  as they are now  but living rock and iron .  the dwarfs have quite an inventive mythology about minerals .      vampires evolve long names .  it   s something to do to pass the long years .      at least  of the sort she normally wore .        and  just lately  corporal nobbs .      they couldn   t bring themselves to utter the word    her .         at least  by proper explorers .  just living there doesn   t count .      at least  if you hit them hard enough .      especially if it was green  and bubbled .      except that the ones around it were not good stones to tread on if it was a tuesday .      as a member of the dead community  reg shoes naturally thought of himself as an ethnic majority .      miles and miles of bloody uberwald .      one that no other creature in the world would ever adopt .      after all  this made it so much harder for the hand to feed you tomorrow .      detritus   s silicon based brain was  as with most trolls  highly sensitive to changes in temperature .  when the thermometer was very low he could be dangerously intellectual .      whatever the name vimes rec       buckwheat dumplings stuffed with stuff .        bread made from parsnips  and widely considered to be much tastier than the dull wheat kind .      he   d noticed that sex bore some resemblance to cookery  it fascinated people  they sometimes bought books full of complicated recipes and interesting pictures  and sometimes when they were really hungry they created vast banquets in their imagination   but at the end of the day they   d settle quite happily for egg and chips  if it was well done and maybe had a slice of tomato .      vimes had once discussed the ephebian idea of    democracy    with carrot  and had been rather interested in the idea that everyone    had a vote until he found out that while he  vimes  would have a vote  there was no way in the rules that anyone could prevent nobby nobbs from having one as well .  vimes could see the flaw there straightaway .        apart from women  children  slaves  idiots and people who weren   t really our kind of people .      the marquis of fantailler got into many fights in his youth  most of them as a result of being known as the marquis of fantailler  and wrote a set of rules for which he termed    the noble art of fisticuffs    which mostly consisted of a list of places where people weren   t allowed to hit him .  many people were impressed with his work and later stood with noble chest outthrust and fists balled in a spirit of manly aggression against people who hadn   t read the marquis   s book but did know how to knock people senseless with a chair .  the last words of a surprisingly large number of people were    stuff the bloody marquis of fantailler           the key was in the pattern of scars .      the treacle mines below ankh morpork had long been exhausted  leaving only a street name to remember them by .  but the collision with the fifth elephant had buried thousands of acres of prehistoric sugar cane around the borders of uberwald and the resulting dense crystalline sugar was the foundation of a large mining  confectionery and dentistry industry .       about the author   terry pratchett   s novels have sold more than forty five million  give or take a few million  copies
