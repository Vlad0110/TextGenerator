unseen academicals   a novel of discworld         terry pratchett      this book is dedicated to rob wilkins  who typed  most of it and had the good sense to laugh occasionally .   and to colin smythe for his encouragement .     the chant of the goddess pedestriana is a parody of  the wonderful poem    brahma    by ralph waldo emerson   but of course you knew that anyway .       contents    begin reading    about the author    other books by terry pratchett    credits    copyright    about the publisher      it was midnight in ankh morpork   s royal art museum .    it occurred to new employee rudolph scattering about once every minute that on the whole it might have been a good idea to tell the curator about his nyctophobia  his fear of strange noises and  he now knew  his fear of absolutely every thing he could see  and  come to that  not see   hear  smell and feel crawling up his back during the endless hours on guard during the night .  it was no use telling himself that everything in here was dead .  that didn   t help at all .  it meant that he stood out .   and then he heard the sob .  a scream might have been better .  at least you are certain when you   ve heard a scream .  a faint sob is something you have to wait to hear again  because you can   t be sure .   he raised his lantern in a shaking hand .  there shouldn   t be anyone in here .  the place was securely locked  no one could get in .  or  now he came to think about it  out .  he wished he hadn   t thought about it .   he was in the basement  which was not among the most scary places on his round .  it was mostly just old shelves and drawers  full of the things that were almost  but very definitely not entirely  thrown away .  museums don   t like things to be thrown away  in case they turn out to be very important later on .   another sob  and a sound like the scraping of   pottery .   a rat  then  somewhere on the rear shelves .  rats didn   t sob  did they .      look  i don   t want to have to come in there and get you .     said scattering with heartfelt accuracy .   and the shelves exploded .  it seemed to him to happen in slow motion  bits of pottery and statues spreading out as they drifted towards him .  he went over backwards and the expanding cloud passing overhead crashed into the shelves on the other side of the room  which were demolished .   scattering lay on the floor in the dark  unable to move  expecting at any moment to be torn apart by the phantoms bubbling up from his imagination     the day staff found him there in the morning  deeply asleep and covered in dust .  they listened to his garbled explanation  treated him kindly  and agreed that a different career might suit his temperament .  they wondered for a while about what he had been up to  night watchmen being rather puzzling people at the best of times  but put it out of their heads   because of the find .   mr scattering then got a job in a pet shop in pellicool steps  but left after three days because the way the kittens stared at him gave him nightmares .  the world can be very cruel to some people .  but he never told anyone about the gloriously glittering lady holding a large ball over her head who smiled at him before she vanished .  he did not want people to think he was strange .     but perhaps it is time to talk about beds .   lectrology  the study of the bed and its associated surroundings  can be extremely useful and tell you a great deal about the owner  even if it   s only that they are a very knowing and savvy installations artist .   the bed of archchancellor ridcully of unseen university  for example  is at the very least a bed and a half  being an eight poster .  it encompasses a small library and a bar  and artfully includes a shut away privy  of mahogany and brass throughout  to save those long cold nocturnal excursions with their concomitant risk of tripping over slippers  empty bottles  shoes and all the other barriers presented to a man in the dark who is praying that the next thing that stubs his toe will be porcelain  or at least easy to clean .   the bed of trevor likely is anywhere  a friend   s floor  in the hayloft of any stable that has been left unlocked  which is usually a much more fragrant option   or in a room of an empty house  though there are precious few of those these days   or he sleeps at work  but he is always careful about that  because old man smeems never seems to sleep at all and might catch him at any time  .  trev can sleep anywhere  and does .   glenda sleeps in an ancient iron bed   whose springs and mattress have gently and kindly shaped themselves around her over the years  leaving a generous depression .  the bottom of this catenary couch is held off the floor by a mulch of very cheap  yellowing romantic novels of the kind to which the word    bodice    comes naturally .  she would die if anyone found out  or possibly they will die if she finds out that they have found out .  usually there is  on the pillow  a very elderly teddy bear called mr wobble .   traditionally  in the lexicon of pathos  such a bear should have only one eye  but as the result of a childhood error in glenda   s sewing  he has three  and is more enlightened than the average bear .   juliet stollop   s bed was marketed to her mother as fit for a princess  and is more or less like the archchancellor   s bed  although almost all less  since it consists of some gauze curtains surrounding a very narrow  very cheap bed .  her mother is now dead .  this can be inferred from the fact that when the bed collapsed under the weight of a growing girl  someone raised it up on beer crates .  a mother would have made sure that at least they were  like everything else in the room  painted pink with little crowns on .   mr nutt was seven years old before he found out that sleeping  for some people  involved a special piece of furniture .     now it was two o   clock in the morning .  a cloying silence reigned along the ancient corridors and cloisters of unseen university .  there was silence in the library  there was silence in the halls .  there was so much silence you could hear it .  everywhere it went  it stuffed the ears with invisible fluff .   gloing .   the tiny sound flew past  a moment of liquid gold in the stygian silence .   silence ruled again above stairs  until it was interrupted by the shuffling of the official thick soled carpet slippers of smeems  the candle knave  as he made his rounds throughout the long night from one candlestick to another  refilling them from his official basket .  he was assisted tonight  although  to judge from his occasional grumbling  not assisted enough  by a dribbler .   he was called the candle knave because that was how the post had been described in the university records when it was created  almost two thousand years before .  keeping the candlesticks  sconces and  not least  the candelabra of the university filled was a never ending job .  it was  in fact  the most important job in the place  in the mind of the candle knave .  oh  smeems would admit under pressure that there were men in pointy hats around  but they came and went and mostly just got in the way .  unseen university was not rich in windows  and without the candle knave it would be in darkness within a day .  that the wizards would simply step outside and from the teeming crowds hire another man capable of climbing ladders with pockets full of candles had never featured in his thoughts .  he was irreplaceable  just like every other candle knave before him .   and now  behind him  there was a clatter as the official folding stepladder unfolded .   he spun around .     hold the damn thing right .     he hissed .      sorry  master .     said his temporary apprentice  trying to control the sliding  finger crushing monster that every stepladder becomes at the first opportunity  and often without any opportunity at all .      and keep the noise down .     smeems bellowed .     do you want to be a dribbler for the rest of your life .         actually  i quite like being a dribbler  sir           ha .  want of ambition is the curse of the labouring class .  here  give me that thing .      the candle knave snatched at the ladder just as his luckless assistant closed it .      sorry about that  sir           there   s always room for one more on the wick dipping tank  you know     said smeems  blowing on his knuckles .      fair enough  sir .      the candle knave stared at the grey  round  guileless face .  there was an unshakeably amiable look about it that was very disconcerting  especially when you knew what it was you were looking at .  and he knew what it was  oh yes  but not what it was called .      what   s your name again .  i can   t remember everybody   s name .         nutt  mister smeems .  with two t   s .         do you think the second one helps matters  nutt .         not really  sir .         where is trev .  he should be on tonight .         been very ill  sir .  asked me to do it .      the candle knave grunted .     you have to look smart to work above stairs  nutts .         nutt  sir .  sorry  sir .  was born not looking smart  sir .         well  at least there   s no one to see you now     smeems conceded .     all right  follow me  and try to look less   well  just try not to look .         yes  master  but i think           you are not paid to think  young   man .         will try not to do so  master .      two minutes later smeems was standing in front of the emperor  watched by a suitably amazed nutt .   a mountain of silvery grey tallow almost filled the isolated junction of stone corridors .  the flame of this candle  which could just be made out to be a mega candle aggregated from the stubs of many  many thousands of candles that had gone before  all dribbled and runnelled into one great whole  was a glow near the ceiling  too high to illuminate anything very much .   smeems   s chest swelled .  he was in the presence of history .      behold  nutts .         yes  sir .  beholding  sir .  it   s nutt  sir .         two thousand years look down on us from the top of this candle  nutts .  of course  they look further down on you than on me .         absolutely  sir .  well done  sir .      smeems glared at the round  amiable face  and saw nothing there but a slicked down keenness that was very nearly frightening .   he grunted  then unfolded his ladder without much more than a pinched thumb  and climbed it carefully until it would take him no further .  from this base camp generations of candle knaves had carved and maintained steps up the hubward face of the giant .      feast your eyes on this  lad     he called down  his ground state bad temper somewhat moderated by this contact with greatness .     one day you might be the   man to climb this hallowed tallow .      for a moment  nutt looked like someone trying hard to disguise the expression of a person who seriously hopes that his future holds more than a big candle .  nutt was young and as such did not have that reverence for age that is had by  mostly  the aged .  but the cheerful not quite smile came back .  it never went away for long .      yessir     he said  on the basis that this generally worked .   some people claimed that the emperor had been lit on the very night that uu was founded  and had never gone out since .  certainly the emperor was huge  and was what you got when  every night for maybe two thousand years  you lit a new fat candle from the guttering remains of the last one and pressed it firmly into the warm wax .  there was no visible candlestick now  of course .  that was somewhere in the vast accumulation of waxy dribbles on the next floor down .   around a thousand years ago  the university had had a large hole made in the ceiling of the corridor below  and already the emperor was seventeen feet high up here .  there was thirty eight feet in total of pure  natural  dribbled candle .  it made smeems proud .  he was keeper of the candle that never went out .  it was an example to everyone  a light that never failed  a flame in the dark  a beacon of tradition .  and unseen university took tradition very seriously  at least when it remembered to .   as now  in fact     from somewhere in the distance came a sound like a large duck being trodden on  followed by a cry of    ho  the megapode .     and then all hell eventuated .   a   creature plunged out of the gloom .   there is a phrase    neither flesh nor fowl nor good red herring    .  this thing was all of them  plus some other bits of beasts unknown to science or nightmare or even kebab .  there was certainly some red  and a lot of flapping  and nutt was sure he caught a glimpse of an enormous sandal  but there were the mad  rolling  bouncing eyes  the huge yellow and red beak and then the thing disappeared down another gloomy corridor  incessantly making that flat honking noise of the sort duck hunters make just before they are shot by other duck hunters .      aho .  the megapode .     it wasn   t clear where the cry came from .  it seemed to be coming from everywhere .     there she bumps .  ho  the megapode .      the cry was taken up on every side  and from the dark shadows of every corridor  bar the one down which the beast had fled  galloped curious shapes  which turned out to be  by the flickering light of the emperor  the senior faculty of the university .  each wizard was being carried piggy back by a stout bowler hatted university porter  whom he was urging onward by means of a bottle of beer on a string held  as tradition demanded  ahead of the porter   s grasp on a long stick .   the doleful quack rang out again  some distance away  and a wizard waved his staff in the air and yelled     bird is flown .  ho  the megapode .      the colliding wizardry  who   d already crushed smeems   s rickety ladder under the hobnailed boots of their steeds  set off at once  butting and barging for position .   for a little while    aho .  the megapode .     echoed in the distance .  when he was certain they had gone  nutt crept out from his refuge behind the emperor  picked up what remained of the ladder  and looked around .      master .     he ventured .   there was a grunt from above .  he looked up .     are you all right  master .         i have been better  nutts .  can you see my feet .      nutt raised his lantern .     yes  master .  i   m sorry to say the ladder is broken .         well  do something about it .  i   m having to concentrate on my handholds here .         i thought i wasn   t paid to think  master .         don   t you try to be smart .         can i try to be smart enough to get you down safely  master .      no answer was the stern reply .  nutt sighed  and opened up the big canvas tool bag .   smeems clung to the vertiginous candle as he heard  down below  mysterious scrapings and clinking noises .  then  with a silence and suddenness that made him gasp  a spiky shape rose up beside him  swaying slightly .      i   ve screwed together three of the big snuffer poles  master     said nutt from below .     and you   ll see there   s a chandelier hook stuck in the top  yes .  and there   s a rope .  can you see it .  i think that if you can make a loop around the emperor it won   t slip much and you ought to be able to let yourself down slowly .  oh  and there   s a box of matches  too .         what for .     said smeems  reaching out for the hook .      can   t help noticing that the emperor has gone out  sir     said the voice from below  cheerfully .      no it hasn   t .         i think you   ll find it has  sir  because i can   t see the           there is no room in this university   s most important department for people with bad eyesight  nutts .         i beg your pardon  master .  i don   t know what came over me .  suddenly i can see the flame .      from above came the sound of a match being struck  and a circle of yellow light expanded on the ceiling as the candle that never went out was lit .  shortly afterwards smeems very gingerly lowered himself to the floor .      well done  sir     said nutt .   the candle knave flicked a length of congealed candle dribble off his equally greasy shirt .      very well     he said .     but you   ll have to come back in the morning to recover the       but nutt was already going up the rope like a spider .  there was a clanging on the other side of the great candle as the lengths of snuffer pole were dropped  and then the boy abseiled back down to his master with the hook under his arm .  and now he stood there all eagerness and scrubbed  if somewhat badly dressed  efficiency .  there was something almost offensive about it .  and the candle knave wasn   t used to this .  he felt obliged to take the lad down a peg  for his own good .      all candles in this university must be lit by long taper from a candle that still burns  boy     he said sternly .     where did you get those matches .         i wouldn   t like to say  sir .         i dare say you wouldn   t  indeed .  now tell me  boy .         i don   t want to get anyone into trouble  master .         your reluctance does you credit  but i insist     said the candle knave .      er  they fell out of your jacket when you were climbing up  master .      off in the distance was one last cry     the megapode is catched .     but around the emperor silence listened with its mouth open .      you are mistaken  nutts     said smeems slowly .     i think you will find that one of the gentlemen must have dropped them .         ah  yes  that   s certainly what must have happened  sir .  i must learn not to jump to conclusions .      once again  the candle knave had that off balance feeling .     well  then  we will say no more about it     was all he managed .      what was it that happened just then  sir .     said nutt .      oh  that .  that was all part of one of the gentlemen   s magically essential magical activities  lad .  it was vital to the proper running of the world  i   ll be bound  oh yes .  could be they was setting the stars in their courses  even .  it   s one of them things we have to do  you know     he added  carefully insinuating himself into the company of wizardry .      only it looked like a skinny man with a big wooden duck strapped to his head .         ah  well  it may have looked like that  come to think of it  but that was because that   s how it looks to people like us  what are not gifted with the ocular sight .         you mean it was some sort of metaphor .      smeems handled this quite well in the circumstances  which included being so deeply at sea with that sentence that barnacles would be attracted to his underwear .     that   s right     he said .     it could be a meta for something that didn   t look so stupid .         exactly  master .      smeems looked down at the boy .  it   s not his fault  he thought  he can   t help what he is .  an uncharacteristic moment of warmth overtook him .      you   re a bright lad     he said .     there   s no reason why you shouldn   t be head dribbler one day .         thank you  sir     said nutt     but if you don   t mind i was rather hoping for something a bit more in the fresh air  so to speak .         ah     said smeems     that could be a bit   tricky  as you might say .         yes  sir .  i know .         it   s just that there   s a lot of   well  look  it   s not me  it   s   it   s   well  you know .  it   s people .  you know what people are like .         yes .  i know what people are like .      looks like a scarecrow  talks posh like one of the gentlemen  smeems thought .  bright as a button  grubby as a turd .  he felt moved to pat the little   fellow on his curiously spherical head  but desisted .      best if you stay down in the vats     he said .     it   s nice and warm  you   ve got your own bedroll  and it   s all snug and safe  eh .      to his relief the boy was silent as they walked down the passages  but then nutt said  in a thoughtful tone of voice     i was just wondering  sir   how often has the candle that never goes out   not gone out .      smeems bit back the stinging retort .  for some reason he knew it could only build up trouble in the long run .      the candle that never goes out has failed to go out three times since i   ve been candle knave  lad     he said .     it   s a record .         an enviable achievement  sir .         damn right .  and that   s even with all the strangeness there   s been happening lately .         really  sir .     said nutt .     have stranger than usual things been happening .         young   man  stranger than usual things happen all the time .         one of the scullery boys told me that all the toilets on the tesseractical floor turned into sheep yesterday     said nutt .     i should like to see that .         i shouldn   t go further than the sculleries  if i was you     said smeems  quickly .     and don   t worry about what the gentlemen do .  they are the finest minds in the world  let me tell you .  if you was to ask    em       he paused  trying to think of something really difficult  like     what is     times        .                     said nutt  not quite under his breath .      what .     said smeems  derailed .      just thinking aloud  master     said nutt .      oh .  right .  er   well that   s it  see .  they   d have an answer for you in a brace of shakes .  finest minds in the world     said smeems  who believed in truth via repetition .     finest minds .  engaged in the business of the universe .  finest minds .           well  that was fun     said mustrum ridcully  archchancellor of the university  throwing himself into a huge armchair in the faculty   s uncommon room with such force that it nearly threw him out again .     we must do it again some time .         yes  sir .  we will .  in one hundred years     said the new master of the traditions smugly  turning over the pages in his huge book .  he reached the crackling leaf headed hunting the megapode  wrote down the date and the amount of time it had taken to find the aforesaid megapode  and signed his name with a flourish  ponder stibbons .      what is a megapode  anyway .     said the chair of indefinite studies  helping himself to the port .      a type of bird  i believe     said the archchancellor  waving a hand towards the drinks trolley .     after me .         the original megapode was found in the under butler   s pantry     said the master of the traditions .     it escaped in the middle of dinner and caused what my predecessor eleven hundred years ago called       he referred to the book        a veritable heyhoe rumbelow as all the fellows pursued it through the college buildings with much mirth and good spirits    .         why .     said the head of the department of post mortem communications  deftly snatching the decanter full of good spirits as it went past .      oh  you can   t have a megapode running around loose  doctor hix     said ridcully .     anyone   ll tell you that .         no  i meant why do we do it again every hundred years .     said the head of the department of post mortem communications .    the senior wrangler turned his face away and murmured     oh  good gods           it   s a tradition     the chair of indefinite studies explained  rolling a cigarette .     we have to have traditions .         they   re traditional     said ridcully .  he beckoned to one of the servants .     and i don   t mind saying that this one has made me somewhat peckish .  can you fetch the cheeseboards one to five  please .  and  um  some of that cold roast beef  some ham  a few biscuits and  of course  the pickle carts .     he looked up .     anyone want to add anything .         i could toy fitfully with a little fruit     said the professor of recondite phenomena .     how about you  librarian .         ook     growled the figure hogging the fire .      yes  of course     said the archchancellor .  he waved a hand at the hovering waiter .     the fruit trolley as well .  see to it  please  downbody .  and   perhaps that new girl could bring it up .  she ought to get used to the uncommon room .      it was as if he had just spoken a magic spell .  the room  its ceiling hazy with blue smoke  was suddenly awash with a sort of heavy  curiously preoccupied silence mostly due to dreamy speculation  but in a few rare cases owing to distant memory .   the new girl   at the mere thought  elderly hearts beat dangerously .   very seldom did beauty intrude into the daily life of uu  which was as masculine as the smell of old socks and pipe smoke and  given the faculty   s general laxness when it came to knocking out their pipes  the smell of smoking socks as well .  mrs whitlow  the housekeeper  she of the clanking chatelaine and huge creaking corset that caused the chair of indefinite studies to swoon when he heard it  generally took great care to select staff who  while being female  were not excessively so  and tended to be industrious  clean in their habits  rosy cheeked and  in short  the kind of ladies who are never too far from gingham and an apple pie .  this suited the wizards  who liked to be not far away from an apple pie themselves  although they could take gingham or leave it alone .   why  then  had the housekeeper employed juliet .  what could she have been thinking of .  the girl had come into the place like a new world in a solar system  and the balance of the heavens was subtly wobbling .  and  indeed  as she advanced  so was juliet .   by custom and practice  wizards were celibate  in theory because women were distracting and bad for the magical organs  but after a week of juliet   s presence many of the faculty were subject to  mostly  unfamiliar longings and strange dreams  and were finding things rather hard  but you couldn   t really put your finger on it  what she had went beyond beauty .  it was a sort of distillation of beauty that travelled around with her  uncoiling itself into the surrounding ether .  when she walked past  the wizards felt the urge to write poetry and buy flowers .      you may be interested to know  gentlemen     said the new master of the traditions     that tonight   s was the longest chase ever recorded in the history of the tradition .  i suggest we owe a vote of thanks to tonight   s megapode        he realized the statement had plummeted on to deaf ears .     er  gentlemen .     he said .   he looked up .  the wizards were staring  in a soulful sort of way  at whatever was going on inside their heads .      gentlemen .     he said again  and this time there was a collective sigh as they woke up from their sudden attack of daydreaming .      what say .     said the archchancellor .      i was just remarking that tonight   s megapode was undoubtedly the finest on record  archchancellor .  it was rincewind .  the official megapode headdress suited him very well  all things considered .  i think he   s gone for a lie down .         what .  oh  that .  well  yes .  indeed .  well done  that man     said ridcully  and the wizards commenced that slow handclapping and table thumping which is the mark of appreciation amongst men of a certain age  class and girth  accompanied by cries of    ver     ver    well done  that man .     and    jolly good .     but eyes stayed firmly fixed on the doorway  and ears strained for the rattle of the trolley  which would herald the arrival of the new girl and  of course  one hundred and seven types of cheese  and more than seventy different varieties of pickles  chutneys and other tracklements .  the new girl might be the very paradigm of beauty  but uu was not the place for a man who could forget his cheeses .   well  she was a distraction at least  ponder thought as he snapped the book shut  and the university needed a few of them right now .  it had been tricky since the dean had left  very tricky indeed .  whoever heard of a man resigning from uu .  it was something that simply did not happen .  sometimes people left in disgrace  in a box or  in a few cases  in bits  but there was no tradition of resigning at all .  tenure at unseen university was for life  and often a long way beyond .   the office of master of the traditions had fallen inevitably on ponder stibbons  who tended to get all the jobs that required someone who thought that things should happen on time and that numbers should add up .   regrettably  when he   d gone to check on things with the previous master of the traditions  who  everyone agreed  had not been seen around and about lately  he   d found that the man had been dead for two hundred years .  this wasn   t a wholly unusual circumstance .  ponder  after years at unseen  still didn   t know the full size of the faculty .  how could you keep track of them in a place like this these days  where hundreds of studies all shared one window  but only on the outside  or rooms drifted away from their doorways during the night  travelled intangibly through the slumbering halls and ended up docking quite elsewhere .   a wizard could do what he liked in his own study  and in the old days that had largely meant smoking anything he fancied and farting hugely without apologizing .  these days it meant building out into a congruent set of dimensions .  even the archchancellor was doing it  which made it hard for ponder to protest  he had half a mile of trout stream in his bathroom  and claimed that messin    about in his study was what kept a wizard out of mischief .  and  as everyone knew  it did .  it generally got him into trouble instead .   ponder had let that go  because he now saw it as his mission in life to stoke the fires that kept mustrum ridcully bubbling and made the university a happy place .  as a dog reflects the mood of its owner  so a university reflects its archchancellor .  all he could do now  as the university   s sole self confessed entirely sensible person  was to steer things as best he could  keep away from squalls involving the person previously known as the dean  and find ways of keeping the archchancellor too occupied to get under ponder   s feet .   ponder was about to put the book of traditions away when the heavy pages flopped over .      that   s odd .         oh  those old book bindings get very stiff     said ridcully .     they have a life of their own  sometimes .         has anyone heard of professor h .  f .  pullunder  or doctor erratamus .      the faculty stopped watching the door and looked at one another .      ring a bell  anyone .     said ridcully .      not a tinkle     said the lecturer in recent runes  cheerfully .   the archchancellor turned to his left .     what about you  dean .  you know all the old        ponder groaned .  the rest of the wizards shut their eyes and braced themselves .  this might be bad .   ridcully stared down at two empty chairs  with the imprint of a buttock in each one .  one or two of the faculty pulled their hats down over their faces .  it had been two weeks now  and it had not got any better .   he took a deep breath and roared     traitor .       which was a terrible thing to say to two dimples in leather .   the chair of indefinite studies gave ponder stibbons a nudge  indicating that he was the chosen sacrifice for today  again .   again .      just for a handful of silver he left us .     said ridcully  to the universe in general .   ponder cleared his throat .  he   d really hoped the megapode hunt would take the archchancellor   s mind off the subject  but ridcully   s mind kept on swinging back to the absent dean the way a tongue plunges back to the site of a missing tooth .      er  in point of fact  i believe his remuneration is at least       he began  but in ridcully   s current mood no answer would be the right one .      remuneration .  since when did a wizard work for wages .  we are pure academics  mister stibbons .  we do not care for mere money .      unfortunately  ponder was a clear logical thinker who  in times of mental confusion  fell back on reason and honesty  which  when dealing with an angry archchancellor  were  to use the proper academic term  unhelpful .  and he neglected to think strategically  always a mistake when talking to fellow academics  and as a result made the mistake of employing  as at this point  common sense .      that   s because we never actually pay for anything very much     he said     and if anyone needs any petty cash they just help themselves from the big jar           we are part of the very fabric of the university  mister stibbons .  we take only what we require .  we do not seek wealth .  and most certainly we do not accept a    post of vital importance which includes an attractive package of remuneration     whatever the hells that means     and other benefits including a generous pension    .  a pension  mark you .  when ever has a wizard retired .         well .  doctor earwig       ponder began  unable to stop himself .      he left to get married .     snapped ridcully .     that   s not retirin     that   s the same as dyin    .         what about doctor housemartin .     ponder went on .   the lecturer in recent runes kicked him on the ankle  but ponder merely said     ouch .     and continued .     he left with a bad case of work related frogs  sir .         if you can   t stand the heat  get off the pot     muttered ridcully .  things were subsiding a bit now  and the pointy hats were tentatively raised .  the archchancellor   s little moments only lasted a few minutes .  this would have been more comforting were it not for the fact that at approximately five minute intervals something suddenly reminded him of what he considered to be the dean   s totally treasonable activity  to wit  applying for and getting a job at another university via a common advertisement in a newspaper .  that was not how a prince of magic behaved .  he didn   t sit in front of a panel of drapers  greengrocers and bootmakers  wonderful people though they may be  salt of the earth  no doubt  but even so     to be judged and assessed like some champion terrier  had his teeth counted  no doubt .   .  he   d let down the entire brotherhood of wizardry  that   s what he   d done     there was a squeaking of wheels out in the corridor  and every wizard stiffened in anticipation .  the door swung open and the first overloaded trolley was pushed in .   there was a series of sighs as every eye focused on the maid who was pushing it  and then some rather louder sighs when they realized that she was not  as it were  the intended .   she wasn   t ugly .  she might be called homely  perhaps  but it was quite a nice home  clean and decent and with roses round the door and a welcome on the mat and an apple pie in the oven .  but the thoughts of the wizards were  astonishingly  not on food at this point  although some of them were still a bit hazy as to why not .   she was  in fact  quite a pleasant looking girl  even if her bosom had clearly been intended for a girl two feet taller  but she was not her .    the faculty was crestfallen  but it brightened up considerably as the caravan of trolleys wound its way into the room .  there was nothing like a   a . m .  snack to raise the spirits  everyone knew that .   well  ponder thought  at least we   ve got through the evening without anything breaking .  better than tuesday  at least .   it is a well known fact in any organization that  if you want a job done  you should give it to someone who is already very busy .  it has been the cause of a number of homicides  and in one case the death of a senior director from having his head shut repeatedly in quite a small filing cabinet .   in uu  ponder stibbons was that busy man .  he had come to enjoy it .  for one thing  most of the jobs he was asked to do did not need doing  and most of the senior wizards did not care if they were not done  provided they were not not done by themselves .  besides  ponder was very good at thinking up efficient little systems to save time  and was  in particular  very proud of his system for writing the minutes of meetings  which he had devised with the help of hex  the university   s increasingly useful thinking engine .  a detailed analysis of past minutes  coupled with hex   s enormous predictive abilities  meant that for a simple range of easily accessible givens  such as the agenda  which ponder controlled in any case   the committee members  the time since breakfast  the time to dinner  and so on  in most cases the minutes could be written beforehand .   all in all  he considered that he was doing his bit in maintaining uu in its self chosen course of amiable  dynamic stagnation .  it was always a rewarding effort  knowing the alternative  to keep things that way .   but a page that turns itself was  to ponder  an anomaly .  now  while the sound of the pre breakfast supper grew around him  he smoothed out the page and read  carefully .     glenda would have cheerfully broken a plate over juliet   s sweet  empty head when the girl finally turned up in the night kitchen .  at least  she would cheerfully have thought about it  in quite a deliberate way  but there was no point in losing her temper  because its target was not really much good at noticing what other people were thinking .  there wasn   t a nasty bone in juliet   s body  it   s just that she had a great deal of trouble homing in on the idea that someone was trying to be unpleasant to her .   so glenda made do with    where have you been .  i told mrs whitlow you   d gone home ill .  your dad   ll be worried sick .  and it looks bad to the other girls .      juliet slumped into a chair  with a movement so graceful that it seemed to sing .      went to the football  didn   t i .  you know  we were playing those buggers in dimwell .         until three in the morning .         that   s the rules  innit .  play until full time  first dead man or first score .         who won .         dunno .         you don   t know .         when we left it was being decided on head wounds .  anyway  i went with rotten johnny  didn   t i .         i thought you   d broken up with him .         he bought me supper  didn   t    e .         you shouldn   t have gone .  that   s not the sort of thing you should do .         like you know .     said juliet  who sometimes thought that questions were answers .      just do the washing up  will you .     said glenda .  and i   ll have to do it again after you  she thought  as her best friend drifted over to the line of big stone sinks .  juliet didn   t exactly wash dishes  she gave them a light baptism .  wizards weren   t the type of people who noticed yesterday   s dried egg on the plate  but mrs whitlow could see it from two rooms away .   glenda liked juliet  she really did  although sometimes she wondered why .  of course  they   d grown up together  but it had always amazed her that juliet  who was so beautiful that boys went nervous and occasionally fainted as she passed  could be so  well  dumb about everything .  in fact it was glenda who had grown up .  she wasn   t sure about juliet  sometimes it seemed to glenda that she had done the growing up for both of them .      look  you just have to scrub a bit  that   s all     she snapped after a few seconds of listless dipping  and took the brush out of juliet   s perfect hand  and then  as the grease was sent down the drain  she thought  i   ve done it again .  actually  i   ve done it again again .  how many times is that .  i even used to play with her dolls for her .   plate after plate sparkled under glenda   s hands .  nothing cleans stubborn stains like suppressed anger .   rotten johnny  she thought .  ye gods  he smells of cat wee .  he   s the only boy stupid enough to think he   s got a chance .  good grief  she   s got a figure like that and all she ever dates are total knobheads .  what would she do without me .   after this brief excitement  the night kitchen settled into its routine and those who had been referred to as    the other girls    got on with their familiar tasks .  it has to be said that girlhood for most of them had ended a long time previously  but they were good workers and glenda was proud of them .  mrs hedges ran the cheeseboards like a champion .  mildred and rachel  known officially on the payroll as the vegetable women  were good and reliable  and indeed it was mildred who had come up with the famous recipe for beetroot and cream cheese sandwiches .   everybody knew their job .  everybody did their job .  the night kitchen was reliable and glenda liked reliable .   she had a home to go to and made sure she went to it at least once a day  but the night kitchen was where she lived .  it was her fortress .     ponder stibbons stared at the page in front of him .  his mind filled up with nasty questions  the biggest and nastiest of which was simply  is there any way at all in which people can make out that this is my fault .  no .  good .      er  there is one tradition here that regrettably we don   t appear to have honoured for some considerable time  archchancellor     he said  managing to keep the concern out of his voice .      well  does that matter .     said ridcully  stretching .      it is traditional  archchancellor     said ponder reproachfully .     although i might go so far as to say that not observing it has now  alas  become the tradition .         well  that   s fine  isn   t it .     said ridcully .     if we can make a tradition of not observing another tradition  then that   s doubly traditional  eh .  what   s the problem .         it   s archchancellor preserved bigger   s bequest     said the master of the traditions .     the university does very well out of the bigger estates .  they were a very rich family .         hmm  yes .  name rings a faint bell .  decent of him .  so .         er  i would have been happier had my predecessor paid a little more attention to some of the traditions     said ponder  who believed in drip feeding bad news .      well  he was dead .         yes  of course .  perhaps  sir  we should  ahem  start a tradition of checking on the health of the master of the traditions .         oh  he was quite healthy     said the archchancellor .     just dead .  quite healthy for a dead man .         he was a pile of dust  archchancellor .         that   s not the same as being ill  exactly     said ridcully  who believed in never giving in .     broadly speaking  it   s stable .      ponder said     there is a condition attached to the bequest .  it   s in the small print  sir .         oh  i never bother with small print  stibbons .         i do  sir .  it says        and thys shall follow as long as the university shall enter a team in the game of foot the ball or poore boys    funne    .         porree boy   s funny .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      that   s ridiculous .     said ridcully .      ridiculous or not  archchancellor  that is the condition of the bequest .         but we stopped taking part in that years ago     said ridcully .     mobs in the streets  kicking and punching and yelling   and they were the players .  mark you  the spectators were nearly as bad .  there were hundreds of men in a team .  a game could go on for days .  that   s why it was stopped .         actually  it has never been stopped as such  archchancellor     said the senior wrangler .     we stopped  yes  and so did the guilds .  it was no longer a game for gentlemen .         nevertheless     said the master of the traditions  running a finger down the page     such are the terms .  there are all sorts of other conditions .  oh  dear .  oh  calamity .  oh  surely not        his lips moved silently as he read on .  the room craned as one neck .      well  out with it  man .     roared ridcully .      i think i   d like to check a few things     said the master of the traditions .     i would not wish to worry you unduly .     he glanced down .     oh  hells    bells .         what are you talking about  man .         well  it looks as though   no  it would be unfair to spoil your evening  archchancellor     ponder protested .     i must be reading this wrongly .  he surely can   t mean   oh  good heavens           in a nutshell  please  stibbons     growled ridcully .     i believe i am the archchancellor of this university .  i   m sure it says so on my door .         of course  archchancellor  but it would be quite wrong of me to           i appreciate that you do not wish to spoil my evening  sir     said ridcully .     but i would not hesitate to spoil your day tomorrow .  with that in mind  what the hells are you talking about .         er  it would appear  archchancellor  that  er   when was the last game we took part in  do you know .         anyone .     said ridcully to the room in general .  a mumbled discussion produced a consensus on the theme of    around twenty years  give or take .         give or take what  exactly .     said ponder  who hated this kind of thing .      oh  you know .  something of that order .  in the general vicinity of  so to speak .  round about then .  you know .         about .     said ponder .     can we be more precise .         why .         because if the university hasn   t played in the poor boys    fun for a period of twenty years or more  the bequest reverts to any surviving relatives of archchancellor bigger .         but it   s banned  man .     the archchancellor insisted .      er  not as such .  it   s common knowledge that lord vetinari doesn   t like it  but i understand that if the games are outside the city centre and confined to the back streets  the watch turns a blind eye .  since i would imagine that the supporters and players easily outnumber the entire watch payroll  i suppose it is better than having to turn a broken nose .         that   s quite a neat turn of phrase there  mister stibbons     said ridcully .     i   m quite surprised at you .         thank you  archchancellor     said ponder .  he had in fact got it from a leader in the times  which the wizards did not like much because it either did not print what they said or printed what they said with embarrassing accuracy .   emboldened  he added     i should point out  though  that under uu law  archchancellor  a ban doesn   t matter .  wizards are not supposed to take notice of such a ban .  we are not subject to mundane law .         of course .  but nevertheless it is generally convenient to acknowledge the civil power     said ridcully  speaking like a man choosing his words with such care that he was metaphorically taking some of them outside to look at them more closely in daylight .   the wizards nodded .  what they had heard was     vetinari may have his little foibles  but he   s the sanest man we   ve had on the throne in centuries  he leaves us alone  and you never know what he   s got up his sleeve .     you couldn   t argue with that .      all right  stibbons  what do you suggest .     said ridcully .     these days you only ever tell me about a problem when you   ve thought up a solution .  i respect this  although i find it a bit creepy .  got a way to wriggle us out of this  have you .         i suppose so  sir .  i thought we might  well  put up a team .  it doesn   t say anything about winning  sir .  we just have to play  that   s all .        it was always beautifully warm in the candle vats .  regrettably  it was also extremely humid and rather noisy in an erratic and unexpected way .  this was because the giant pipes of unseen university   s central heating and hot water system passed overhead  slung from the ceiling on a series of metal straps with a greater or lesser coefficient of linear expansion .  that was only the start  however .  there were also the huge pipes for balancing the slood differential across the university  the pipe for the anthropic particle flux suppressor  which did not work properly these days  the pipes for the air circulation  which had not worked either since the donkey had been ill  and the very ancient tubes that were all that remained of the ill fated attempt by a previous archchancellor to operate a university communication system by means of trained marmosets .  at certain times of the day all this piping broke into a subterranean symphony of gurgles  twangs  upsetting organic trickling sounds and  occasionally  an inexplicable boinging noise that would reverberate through the cellar levels .   the general ad hoc nature of the system   s construction was enhanced by the fact that  as an economy measure  the big iron hot water pipes were lagged with old clothing held on by string .  since some of these items had once been wizards    apparel  and however hard you scrubbed you could never get all of the spells out  there were sporadic showers of multicoloured sparks and the occasional ping pong ball .   despite everything  nutt felt at home down among the vats .  it was worrying  in the high country  people in the street had jeered at him that he   d been made in a vat .  although brother oats had told him that this was silly  the gently bubbling tallow called to him .  he felt at peace here .   he ran the vats now .  smeems didn   t know  because he hardly ever troubled to come down here .  trev knew  of course  but since nutt doing his job for him meant that he could spend more time kicking a tin can around on some bit of wasteground he was happy .  the opinion of the other dribblers and dippers didn   t really count  if you worked in the vats it meant that  as far as the job market was concerned  you had been still accelerating when you   d hit the bottom of the barrel and had been drilled into the bedrock .  it meant that you no longer had enough charisma to be a beggar .  it meant that you were on the run from something  possibly the gods themselves  or the demons inside you .  it meant that if you dared to look up you would see  high above you  the dregs of society .  best  then  to stay down here in the warm gloom  with enough to eat and no inconvenient encounters and  nutt added in his head  no beatings .   no  the dippers were no problem .  he did his best for them when he could .  life itself had beaten them so hard that they had no strength left to beat up anyone else .  that was helpful .  when people found out that you were a goblin  all you could expect was trouble .   he remembered what the people in the villages had shouted at him when he was small and the word would be followed by a stone .   goblin .  it was a word with an ox train load of baggage .  it didn   t matter what you said or did  or made  the train ran right over you .  he   d shown them the things he   d built  and the stones had smashed them while the villagers screamed at him like hunting hawks and shouted more words .   that had stopped on the day pastor oats rode gently into town  if a bunch of hovels and one street of stamped mud could be called a town  and he had brought   forgiveness .  but on that day  no one had wanted to be forgiven .   in the darkness  concrete the troll  who was so gooned out on slab  slice  sleek and slump  and who would even snort iron filings if nutt didn   t stop him  whimpered on his mattress .   nutt lit a fresh candle and wound up his home made dribbling aid .  it whirred away happily  and made the flame go horizontal .  he paid attention to his work .  a good dribbler never turned the candle when he dribbled  candles in the wild  as it were  almost never dripped in more than one direction  which was away from the draught .  no wonder the wizards liked the ones he made  there was something disconcerting about a candle that appeared to have dribbled in every direction at once .  it could put a man off his stroke .    he worked fast  and was putting the nineteenth well dribbled candle in the delivery basket when he heard the clank of a tin can being bowled along the stone floor of the passage .      good morning  mister trev     he said  without looking up .  a moment later an empty tin can landed in front of him  on end  with no more ceremony than a jigsaw piece falling into place .      how did you know it was me  gobbo .         your leitmotif  mister trev .  and i   d prefer nutt  thank you .         what   s one o    them motifs .     said the voice behind him .      it is a repeated theme or chord associated with a particular person or place  mister trev     said nutt  carefully placing two more warm candles in the basket .     i was referring to your love of kicking a tin can about .  you seem in good spirits  sir .  how went the day .         you what .         did fortune favour dimwell last night .         what are you on about .      nutt pulled back further .  it could be dangerous not to fit in  not to be helpful  not to be careful .     did you win  sir .         nah .  another no score draw .  waste of time  really .  but it was only a friendly .  nobody died .     trev looked at the full baskets of realistically dribbled candles .      that   s a shitload you   ve done there  kid     he said kindly .   nutt hesitated again  and then said  very carefully     despite the scatological reference  you approve of the large but unspecified number of candles that i have dribbled for you .         blimey  what was that all about  gobbo .      frantically  nutt sought for an acceptable translation .     i done okay .     he ventured .   trev slapped him on the back .     yeah .  good job .  respect .  but you gotta learn to speak more proper  you know .  you wu   nt last five minutes down our way .  you   d probably get a half brick heaved at yer .         that has  i mean    as been known to      appen     said nutt  concentrating .      i never seen why people make such a to do     said trev generously .     so there were all those big battles .  so what .  it was a long time ago and a long way away  right  an    it   s not like the trolls and dwarfs weren   t as bad as you lot  ain   t i right .  i mean  goblins .  what was that all about .  you lot jus    cut throats and nicked stuff  right .  that   s practically civilized in some streets round here .      probably  nutt thought .  no one could have been neutral when the dark war had engulfed far uberwald .  maybe there had been true evil there  but apparently the evil was  oddly enough  always on the other side .  perhaps it was contagious .  somehow  in all the confusing histories that had been sung or written  the goblins were down as nasty cowardly little bastards who collected their own earwax and were always on the other side .  alas  when the time came to write their story down  his people hadn   t even had a pencil .   smile at people .  like them .  be helpful .  accumulate worth .  he liked trev .  he was good at liking people .  when you clearly liked people  they were slightly more inclined to like you .  every little helped .   trev  though  seemed genuinely unfussed about history  and had recognized that having someone in the vats who not only did not try to eat the tallow but also did most of his work for him and  at that  did it better than he could be bothered to do it himself  was an asset worth protecting .  besides  he was congenially lazy  except when it came to foot the ball  and bigotry took too much effort .  trev never made too much effort .  trev went through life on primrose paths .      master smeems came looking for you     said nutt .     i sorted it all out .         ta     said trev  and that was that .  no questions .  he liked trev .   but the boy was standing there  just staring at him  as if trying to work him out .      tell you what     trev said .     come on up to the night kitchen and we   ll scrounge breakfast  okay .         oh no  mister trev     said nutt  almost dropping a candle .     i don   t think  sorry  fink  i ought to .         come on  who   s going to know .  and there   s a fat girl up there who cooks great stuff .  best food you ever tasted .      nutt hesitated .  always agree  always be helpful  always be becoming  never frighten anyone .      i fink i will come with you     he said .     there   s a lot to be said for scrubbing a frying pan until you can see your face in it  especially if you   ve been entertaining ideas of gently tapping someone on the head with it .  glenda was not in the mood for trev when he came up the stone steps  kissed her on the back of the neck and said cheerfully         ullo  darlin     what   s hot tonight .         nothing for the likes of you  trevor likely     she said  batting him away with the pan     and you can keep your hands to yourself  thank you .         not bin keeping somethin    warm for your best man .      glenda sighed .     there   s bubble and squeak in the warming oven and don   t say a word if anyone catches you     she said .      just the job for a man who   s bin workin    like a slave all night .     said trev  patting her far too familiarly and heading for the ovens .      you   ve been at the football .     snapped glenda .     you   re always at the football .  and what kind of working do you call that .      the boy laughed  and she glared at his companion  who backed away quickly as though from armour piercing eyes .      and you boys ought to wash before you come up here     she went on  glad of a target that didn   t grin and blow kisses at her .     this is a food preparation area .      nutt swallowed .  this was the longest conversation he   d ever had with a female apart from ladyship and miss healstether and he hadn   t even said anything .      i assure you  i bath regularly     he protested .      but you   re grey .         well  some people are black and some people are white     said nutt  almost in tears .  oh  why had he  why had he left the vats .  it was nice and uncomplicated down there  and quiet  too  when concrete hadn   t been on the ferrous oxide .      it doesn   t work like that .  you   re not a zombie  are you .  i know they do their best  and none of us can help how we die  but i   m not having all that trouble again .  anyone might get their finger in the soup  but rolling around in the bottom of the bowl .  that   s not right .         i am alive  miss     said nutt helplessly .      yes  but a live what  that   s what i   d like to know .         i   m a goblin  miss .     he hesitated as he said it .  it sounded like a lie .      i thought goblins had horns     said glenda .      only the grown up ones  miss .     well  that was true  for some goblins .      you lot don   t do anything nasty  do you .     said glenda  glaring at nutt .   but he recognized it as a kind of residual glare  she   d said her piece  and now it was just a bit of play acting  to show she was the boss here .  and bosses can afford to be generous  especially when you look a little fearful and suitably impressed .  it worked .   glenda said     trev  fetch mister    .         nutt     said nutt .      fetch mister nutt some bubble and squeak  will you .  he looks half starved .         i have a very fast metabolism     said nutt .      i don   t mind about that     said glenda     so long as you don   t go showing it to people .  i have enough        there was a crash from behind her .   trev had dropped the tray of bubble and squeak .  he was stock still  staring at juliet  who was returning the stare with a look of deep disgust .  finally  she said  in a voice like pearls         ad your bleedin    eyeful .  you got a nerve  largin    it in here wiv that rag round your neck .  everyone knows dimwell are well pants .  beasly couldn   t carry the ball in a sack .         oh yeah right .  well  i hear that the lobbins walked all over you last week .  lobbin clout .  everyone knows they   re a bunch o    grannies .         oh yeah  that   s all you know .  staple upwright was let out of the tanty the day before .  see if you dimmers like him stamping all over you .         old staple .  ha .  he   ll clog away  yeah  but he can   t run above a canter .  we   ll run rings around        glenda   s frying pan clanged loudly on top of the iron range .     enough of that  the pair of you .  i   ve got to clean up for the day  and i don   t want football dirtying up my nice surfaces  you hear me .  you wait here  my girl  and you  trevor likely  you get back to your cellar  and i shall want that dish cleaned and back here by tomorrow night or you can try begging your meals off some other girl  right .  take your little friend with you .  nice to meet you  mister nutt  but i wish i could find you in better company .      she paused .  nutt looked so lost and bewildered .  gods help me  she thought  i   m turning into my mum again .     no  wait .     she reached down  opened one of the warming ovens and came back again with another large dish .  the scent of cooked apples filled the kitchen .     this is for you  mister nutt  with my compliments .  you need fattening up before you blow away .  don   t bother to share it with this scallywag     cos he   s a greedy beggar  ask anyone .  now  i   ve got to clean up  and if you boys don   t want to help  get out of my kitchen .  oh  and i   ll want that dish back as well .      trev grabbed nutt   s shoulder .     come on  you heard what she said .         yes  and i don   t mind helping           come on .         thank you very much  miss     nutt managed  as he was dragged down the stairs .   glenda folded her oven cloth neatly as she watched them go .      goblins     she said thoughtfully .     have you ever seen a goblin before  jools .         what .         have you ever seen a goblin .         dunno .         do you think he   s a goblin .         what .         mr nutt .  is he a goblin  do you think .     said glenda  as patiently as possible .      he   s a posh one  then .  i mean  he sounded like he reads books and stuff .      this was a discrimination that was  in glenda   s view  at practically forensic standards of observation for juliet .  she turned around and found to her surprise that juliet had gone back to reading something  or at least staring intently at the words .     what have you got there .     she asked .      it   s called bu bubble .  it   s like  what important people are doing .      glenda looked over her friend   s shoulder as she leafed through the pages .  as far as she could tell all the important people shared one smile and were wearing unsuitable clothes for this time of year .     so what is it that makes them important .     she asked .     just being in a magazine .         there   s fashion tips too     said juliet defensively .     look  it says here chrome and copper micromail is the look for the season .         that   s the page for dwarfs     sighed glenda .     come on  get your things and i   ll take you home .      juliet was still reading as they waited for the horse bus .  such sudden devotion to a printed page worried glenda .  the last thing she wanted was to see her friend getting ideas in her head .  there was such a lot of room in there for them to bounce around and do damage .  glenda herself was reading one of her cheap novels wrapped in a page of the times .  she read the way a cat eats  furtively  daring anyone to notice .   while the horses plodded up towards dolly sisters  she took her scarf out of her bag and absent mindedly wrapped it around her wrist .  personally  she hated the violence of the football  but it was important to belong .  not belonging  especially after a big game  could be dangerous to your health .  it was important to show the right colours on your home turf .  it was important to fit in .   for some reason  that thought immediately turned her mind to nutt .  how strange he was .  kind of ugly  but very clean .  he had stunk of soap and seemed so nervous .  there was something about him       the air in the uncommon room had gone as cold as meltwater .      are you telling us  mister stibbons  that we should be seen to enter a game for bullies  louts and roughs .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     that would be impossible .         unlikely  yes .  impossible .  no     said ponder wearily .      most certainly not possible .     said the senior wrangler  nodding at the chair .     we would be trading kicks with people from the gutters .         my grandfather scored two goals in a match against dimwell     said ridcully  in a quiet  matter of fact voice .     most people never managed one in their lives  in those days .  i think the most number of goals scored by one man in his whole life is four .  that was dave likely  of course .      there was a ripple of hurried rethinking and retrenchment .      ah  well  of course  those were different times     said the senior wrangler  suddenly all syrup .     i   m sure that even skilled workmen occasionally took part in a spirit of fun .         it wasn   t much fun if they ran into granddad     said ridcully  with a faint little grin .     he was a prizefighter .  he knocked people down for money and pubs sent for him if there was a really dangerous brawl .  of course  in a sense  this made it even more dangerous  but by then most of it was out in the street .         he threw people out of the buildings .         oh yes .  in fairness  it was usually from the ground floor and he always opened the window first .  he was a very gentle man  i understand .  made musical boxes for a living  very delicate  won awards for them .  teetotal  you know  and quite religious as well .  the punching was just a job of casual work .  i know for a fact he never tore off anything that couldn   t be stitched on again .  a decent chap  by all accounts .  never met him  unfortunately .  i   ve always wished i had something to remember the old boy by .      as one wizard  the faculty looked down at ridcully   s huge hands .  they were the size of frying pans .  he cracked his knuckles .  there was an echo .      mister stibbons  all we need to do is engage another team and lose .     he said .      that   s right  archchancellor     said ponder .     you simply forfeit the game .         but losing means being seen not to win  am i right .         that would be so  yes .         then i rather think we ought to win  don   t you .         really  mustrum  this is going too far     said the senior wrangler .      excuse me .     said ridcully  raising his eyebrows .     may i remind you that the archchancellor of this university is  by college statute  the first among equals .         of course .         good .  well  i am he .  the word first is  i think  germane here .  i see you scribbling in your little notebook  mister stibbons .         yes  archchancellor .  i   m looking to see if we could manage without the bequest .         good man     said the senior wrangler  glaring at ridcully .     i knew there was no reason to panic .         in fact i   m pleased to say that i think we could rub along quite well with only a minimal cut in expenditure     ponder went on .      there     said the senior wrangler  looking triumphantly at the first among equals     you see what happens if you don   t simply panic .         indeed     said ridcully calmly .  with his gaze still fixed on the senior wrangler he added     mister stibbons  would you be so kind as to enlighten the rest of us  to what  in reality  does a    minimal cut in expenditure    equate .         the bequest is a trust     said ponder  still scribbling .     we have the use of the significant income from the very wise investments of the bigger trustees  but we cannot touch the capital .  nevertheless  the income is enough to cover i   m sorry to be imprecise about eighty seven point four per cent of the university   s food bill .      he waited patiently until the uproar had died away .  it was amazing  he thought  how people would argue against figures on no better basis than    they must be wrong    .      i   m sure the bursar would not agree with those figures     said the senior wrangler sourly .      that is so     said ponder     but i   m afraid that is because he regards the decimal point as a nuisance .      the faculty looked at one another .      then who is dealing with our financial affairs .     said ridcully .      since last month .  me     said ponder     but i would be happy to hand the responsibility over to the first volunteer .      this worked .  regrettably  it always did .     in that case     he said  in the sudden silence     i have worked out  with reference to calorific tables  a regime that will give every man here a nourishing three meals a day        the senior wrangler frowned .     three meals .  three meals .  what kind of person has three meals a day .         someone who can   t afford nine     said ponder flatly .     we could eke out the money if we concentrate on a healthy diet of grains and fresh vegetables .  that would allow us to keep the cheeseboard with a choice of  say  three types of cheese .         three cheeses isn   t a choice  it   s a penance .     said the lecturer in recent runes .      or we could play a game of football  gentlemen     said ridcully  clapping his hands together cheerfully .     one game .  that   s all .  how hard would that be .         as hard as a face full of hobnails  perhaps .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     people get trodden into the cobbles .         if all else fails  we will find volunteers from the student body     said ridcully .      corpse might be a better word .      the archchancellor leaned back in his chair .     what makes a wizard  gentlemen .  a facility with magic .  yes  of course  but around this table we know this is not  for the right kind of mind  hard to obtain .  it does not  as it were  happen like magic .  good heavens  witches manage it .  but what makes a magic user is a certain cast of mind which looks a little deeper into the world and the way it works  the way its currents twist the fortunes of mankind  et cetera  et cetera .  in short  they should be the kind of person who might calculate that a guaranteed double first is worth the occasional inconvenience of sliding down the street on their teeth .         are you seriously suggesting that we give out degrees for mere physical prowess .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      no  of course not .  i am seriously suggesting that we give out degrees for extreme physical prowess .  may i remind you that i rowed for this university for five years and got a brown .         and what good did that do  pray .         well  it does say    archchancellor    on my door .  do you remember why .  the university council at the time took the very decent view that it might be the moment for a leader who was not stupid  mad or dead .  admittedly  most of these are not exactly qualifications in the normal sense  but i like to think that the skill of leadership  tactics and creative cheating that i learned on the river also stood me in good stead .  and thus for my sins  which i don   t actually remember committing but must have been quite crimson  i was at the top of a shortlist of one .  was that a choice of three cheeses  mister stibbons .         yes  archchancellor .         i was just checking .     ridcully leaned forward .     gentlemen  in the morning  correction  later this morning  i propose to tell vetinari firmly that this university intends to once again play football .  and the task falls to me because i am the first among equals .  if any of you would like to try your luck in the oblong office  you have only to say .         he   ll suspect something  you know     said the chair of indefinite studies .      he suspects everything .  that is why he is still patrician .     ridcully stood up .     i declare this meet   this overly extended snack   over .  mister stibbons  come with me .      ponder hurried after him  books clutched to his chest  happy for the excuse to get out of there before they turned on him .  the bringer of bad news is never popular  especially when it   s on an empty plate .      archchancellor  i       he began  but ridcully held his finger to his lips .   after a moment of cloying silence  there was a sudden festival of scuffling  as of men fighting in silence .      good for them     ridcully said  heading off down the corridor .     i wondered how long it would take them to realize that they might be seeing the last overloaded snack trolley for some time .  i   m almost tempted to wait and see them waddle out with their robes sagging .      ponder stared at him .     are you enjoying this  archchancellor .         good heavens no     said ridcully  his eyes sparkling .     how could you suggest such a thing .  besides  in a few hours i have to tell havelock vetinari that we are intending to become a personal affront .  the unschooled mob hacking at one another   s legs is one thing .  i don   t believe he will be happy with the prospect of our joining in .         of course  sir .  er  there is a minor matter  sir  a small conundrum  if you will   who is nutt .      there seemed to ponder to be a rather longer pause than necessary before ridcully said     nutt would be    .         he works in the candle vats  sir .         how do you know that  stibbons .         i do the wages  sir .  the candle knave says nutt just turned up one night with a chitty saying he was to be employed and paid minimal wage .         well .         that   s all i know  sir  and i only found that out because i asked smeems .  smeems says he   s a good lad but sort of odd .         then he should fit right in  don   t you think  stibbons .  in fact  we are seeing how he fits in .         well yes  sir  no problem there  but he   s a goblin  apparently  and generally  you know  it   s a sort of odd tradition  but when the first people from other races first come to the city they start out in the watch        ridcully cleared his throat  loudly .     the trouble with the watch  stibbons  is that they ask too many questions .  we should not emulate them  i suggest .     he looked at ponder and appeared to reach a decision .     you know that you have a glowing future here at uu  stibbons .         yes  sir     said ponder gloomily .      i would advise you  with this in mind  to forget all about mister nutt .         excuse me  archchancellor  but that simply will not do .      ridcully swayed backwards  like a man subjected to an attack by a hitherto comatose sheep .   ponder plunged on  because when you have dived off a cliff your only hope is to press for the abolition of gravity .      i have twelve jobs in this university     he said .     i do all the paperwork .  i do all the adding up .  in fact  i do everything that requires even a modicum of effort and responsibility .  and i go on doing it even though brazeneck have offered me the post of bursar .  with a staff .  i mean real people  not a stick with a knob on the end .  now   will   you   trust   me .  what is it about nutt that is so important .         the bastard tried to lure you away .     said ridcully .     how sharper than a serpent   s tooth it is to have a thankless dean .  is there nothing he will not stoop to .  how much did           i didn   t ask     said ponder quietly .   there was a moment of silence and then ridcully patted him a couple of times on the shoulder .      the problem with mister nutt is that people want to kill him .         what people .      ridcully stared into ponder   s eyes .  his lips moved .  he squinted up and down like a man engaged in complex calculation .  he shrugged .      probably everybody     he said .        please have some more of my wonderful apple pie     said nutt .      but she gave it to you     said trev  grinning .     i   d never    ear the end of it if i ate your pie .         but you are my friend  mister trev     said nutt .     and since it is my pie i can decide what to do with it .         nah     said trev  waving it away .     but there is a little errand you can do for me  me being a kind and understanding boss what lets you work all the hours you want .         yes  mister trev .     said nutt .      glenda will come in around midday .  to be honest  she hardly ever leaves the place .  i would like you to go and ask her the name of that girl who was up there tonight .         the one who shouted at you  mister trev .         the very same     said trev .      of course i will do that     said nutt .     but why don   t you ask miss glenda yourself .  she knows you .      trev grinned again .     yes  she does and that   s why i know she won   t tell me .  if i am any judge  and i   m pretty sound  she would like to know you better .  i   ve never met a lady so good at feelin    sorry for people .         there   s not much of me to know     said nutt .   trev gave him a long  thoughtful glance .  nutt had not taken his eyes off his work .  trev had never seen anyone who could be so easily engrossed .  other people who ended up working in the vats were a bit weird  it was almost a requirement  but the little dark grey fellow was somehow weird in the opposite direction .     you know  you ought to get out more  mister nutts     he said .      oh  i don   t think i should like that at all     said nutt     and may i kindly remind you my name is not plural  thank you .            ave you ever seen a game of football .         no  mister trev .         then i   ll take you to the match tomorrow .  i don   t play  o   course  but i never miss a game if i can    elp it     said trev .     no edged weapons  prob   ly .  the season starts soon  everyone   s warming up .         well  that is very kind of you  but i           tell you what  i   ll pick you up down    ere at one o   clock .         but people will look at me .     said nutt .  and in his head he could hear ladyship   s voice  calm and cool as ever  do not stand out .  be part of the crowd .      no  they won   t .  trust me on that     said trev .     i can sort that out .  enjoy your pie .  i   m off .      he pulled a tin can out of his coat pocket  dropped it on to his foot  flicked it into the air  toed it a few times so it spun and twinkled like some celestial object and then kicked it very hard so it sailed off down the huge gloomy room a few feet above the vats  rattling slightly .  against all probability it stopped in its flight a few feet from the far wall  spun for a moment and then started to come back with  it seemed to the amazed nutt  a greater speed than before .   trev caught it effortlessly and dropped it back into his pocket .      how can you do that  mister trev .     said nutt  astonished .      never thought about it     said trev .     but i always wonder why everyone else can   t .  it   s just about the spinning .  it   s not hard .  see yer tomorrow  okay .  and don   t forget that name .        the horse buses were not much faster than walking  but it wasn   t you doing the walking  and there were seats and a roof and a guard with a battle axe and all in all it was  in the damp grey hours before dawn  good value for tuppence .  glenda and juliet sat side by side  rocking gently to the sway  lost in their thoughts .  at least glenda was  juliet could get lost in half a thought  if that .   but glenda had become an expert at knowing when juliet was going to speak .  it was rather like the sense a sailor has that the wind is going to change .  there were little signs  as if a thought had to get the beautiful brain warmed up and spinning before anything could happen .      who was that boy what come up for his bubble and squeak .     she asked nonchalantly  or what she probably thought was nonchalantly  or again  what she might have thought was nonchalantly had she known that there was a word like nonchalantly .      that   s trevor likely     said glenda .     and you don   t want anything to do with him .         why not .         he   s a dimmer .  fancies himself as a face  too .  and his dad was big dave likely .  your dad would go mad if he heard you   d even talked to him .         he   s got a lovely smile     said juliet  with a wistfulness that rang all kinds of alarms for glenda .      he   s a scallywag     she said firmly .     he   ll try on anything .  can   t keep his hands to himself  too .         how come you knows that .     said juliet .   that was another worrying thing about juliet .  nothing much seemed to be going on between those perfect ears for hours on end and then a question like that would come spinning towards you with edges on it .      you know  you should try to speak better     glenda said  to change the subject .     with your looks you could snag a man who thinks about more than beer and footie .  just speak with a little more class  eh .  you don   t have to sound like           my fare  lady .      they looked up at the guard  who was holding his axe in a way that was very nearly not threatening .  and when it came to looking up  this was not a long way .  the axe   s owner was very short .   glenda gently pushed the weapon out of the way .     don   t wave it about  roger     she sighed .     it doesn   t impress .         oh  sorry  miss glenda     said the dwarf  what was visible of his face behind the beard colouring with embarrassment .     it   s been a long shift .  that will be fourpence  ladies .  sorry about the axe  but we   ve been getting people jumping off without paying .         he ought to be sent back to where he came from     muttered juliet  as the guard moved on along the bus .  glenda chose not to rise to this .  as far as she had been able to tell  up until today  at least  her friend had no opinions of her own  and simply echoed anything other people said to her .  but then she couldn   t resist .     that would be treacle mine road  then .  he was born in the city .         he   s a miners fan  then .  i suppose it could be worse .         i don   t think dwarfs bother much about football     said glenda .      i don   t fink you can be a real morporkian an    not shout for your team     was the next piece of worn out folk wisdom from juliet .  glenda let this one pass .  sometimes  arguing with her friend was like punching mist .  besides  the plodding horses were laboriously passing their street .  they got off without missing a step .   the door to juliet   s house was covered in the ancient remnants of multiple layers of paint  or  rather  multiple layers of paint that had bubbled up into tiny little mountains over the years .  it was always the cheapest paint possible .  after all  you could afford to buy beer or you could afford to buy paint and you couldn   t drink paint unless you were mr johnson at number fourteen  who apparently drank it all the time .      now  i won   t tell your dad that you were late     said glenda  opening the door for her .     but i want you in early tomorrow  all right .         yes  glenda     said juliet meekly .      and no thinking about that trevor likely .         yes  glenda .     it was a meek reply  but glenda recognized the sparkle .  she   d seen it in the mirror once .   but now she cooked an early breakfast for widow crowdy  who occupied the house on the other side and couldn   t get about much these days  made her comfortable  did the chores in the rising light  and finally went to bed .   her last thought as she plummeted into sleep was  don   t goblins steal chickens .  funny  he doesn   t look the type     at half past eight  a neighbour woke her up by throwing gravel at her window .  he wanted her to come and look at his father  described as    poorly     and the day began .  she had never needed to buy an alarm clock .     why did other people need so much sleep .  it was a permanent puzzle for nutt .  it got boring by himself .   back in the castle in uberwald there had always been someone around to talk to .  ladyship liked the night time and wouldn   t go out in bright sunshine at all  so a lot of visitors came then .  he had to stay out of sight  of course  but he knew all the passages in the walls and all the secret spy holes .  he saw the fine gentlemen  always in black  and the dwarfs with iron armour that gleamed like gold  later  down in his cellar that smelled of salt and thunderstorms  igor showed him how it was made  .  there were trolls  too  looking a bit more polished than the ones he   d learned to run away from in the forests .  he especially remembered the troll that shone like a jewel  igor said his skin was made of living diamond  .  that alone would have been enough to glue him into nutt   s memory  but there had been that moment  one day when the diamond troll was seated at the big table with other trolls and dwarfs  when the diamond eyes had looked up and had seen nutt  looking through a tiny  hidden spy hole at the other end of the room .  nutt was convinced of it .  he   d jerked away from the hole so quickly that he   d banged his head on the wall opposite .   he   d grown to know his way around all the cellars and workshops in ladyship   s castle .  go anywhere you wish  talk to everyone .  ask any questions  you will be given answers .  when you want to learn  you will be taught .  use the library .  open any book .   those had been good days .  everywhere he went  men stopped work to show him how to plane and carve and mould and fettle and smelt iron and make horseshoes   but not how to fit them  because any horse went mad when he entered the stables .  one once kicked the boards out of the rear wall .   that particular afternoon he went up to the library  where miss healstether found him a book on scent .  he read it so fast that his eyes should have left trails on the paper .  he certainly left a trail in the library  the twenty two volumes of brakefast   s compendium of odours were soon stacked on the long lectern  followed by spout   s trumpet of equestrianism  and then  via a detour through the history section  nutt plunged into the folklore section  with miss healstether pedalling after him on the mobile library steps .   she watched him with a kind of gratified awe .  he   d been barely able to read when he   d arrived  but the goblin boy had set out to improve his reading as a boxer trains for a fight .  and he was fighting something  but she wasn   t sure in her own mind what it was and  of course  ladyship never explained .  he would sit all night under the lamp  book of the moment in front of him  dictionary and thesaurus on either side  wringing the meaning out of every word  punching ceaselessly at his own ignorance .   when she came in the next morning there was a dictionary of dwarfish and a copy of postalume   s the speech of trolls on the lectern too .   surely it   s not right to learn like this  she told herself .  it can   t be settling properly .  you can   t just fork it into your head .  learning has to be digested .  you don   t just have to know  you have to comprehend .   she mentioned this to fassel  the smith  who said     look  miss  he came up to me the other day and said he   d watched a smith before  and could he have a go .  well  you know her ladyship   s orders  so i gave him a bit of bar stock and showed him the hammer and tongs and next minute he was going at it like   well  hammer and tongs .  turned out a nice little knife  very nice indeed .  he thinks about things .  you can see his ugly little mush working it all out .  have you ever met a goblin before .         strange you should ask     she told him .     our catalogue says we   ve got one of the very few copies of j .  p .  bunderbell   s five hours and sixteen minutes among the goblins of far uberwald  but i can   t find it anywhere .  it   s priceless .         five hours and sixteen minutes doesn   t sound very long     said the smith .      you   d think so  wouldn   t you .  but according to a lecture mr blunderbell gave to the ankh morpork trespassers    society      said miss healstether     it was about five hours too long .  he said they ranged in size from unpleasantly large to disgustingly small  had about the same level of culture as yogurt and spent their time picking their own noses and missing .  a complete waste of space  he said .  it caused quite a stir .  anthropologists are not supposed to write that sort of thing .         and young nutt is one of them .         yes  that puzzled me  too .  did you see him yesterday .  there   s something about him that frightens horses  so he came to the library and found some old book about the horseman   s word .  they were a kind of secret society  which knew how to make special oils that would make horses obey them .  then he spent the afternoon down in igor   s crypt  brewing up gods know what  and this morning he was riding a horse around the yard .  it wasn   t happy  mind you  but he was winning .         i   m surprised his ugly little head doesn   t explode     said fassel .      ha .     miss healstether sounded bitter .     stand by  then  because he   s discovered the bonk school .         what   s that .         not that  them .  philosophers .  well  i say philosophers  but  well           oh  the mucky ones     said fassel cheerfully .      i wouldn   t say mucky     said miss healstether  and this was true .  a ladylike librarian would not employ that word in the presence of a smith  especially one who was grinning .     let   s say    indelicate     shall we .      there is not a lot of call for delicacy on an anvil  so the smith continued unabashed     they are the ones who go on about what happens if ladies don   t get enough mutton  and they say cigars are           that is a fallacy .         that   s right  that   s what i read .     the smith was clearly enjoying this .     and ladyship lets him read this stuff .         indeed  she very nearly insists .  i can   t imagine what she   s thinking .     or him  come to that  she thought to herself .     there was a limit to how many candles he should make  trev had told nutt .  it looked bad if he made too many  trev explained .  the pointy hats might decide that they didn   t need all the people .  that made sense to nutt .  what would no face and concrete and weepy mukko do .  they would have nowhere else to go .  they had to live in a simple world  they too easily got knocked down by life in this one .   he   d tried wandering around the other cellars  but there was nothing much happening at night  and people gave him funny looks .  ladyship did not rule here .  but wizards are a messy lot and nobody tidied up much and lived to tell the tale  so all sorts of old storerooms and junk filled workshops became his for the use of .  and there was so much for a lad with keen night vision to find .  he had already seen some luminous spoon ants carrying a fork  and  to his surprise  the forgotten mazes were home to that very rare indoorovore  the uncommon sock eater .  there were some things living up in the pipes  too  which periodically murmured     awk .  awk .     who knew what strange monsters made their home here .   he cleaned the pie plates very carefully indeed .  glenda had been kind to him .  he must show that he was kind  too .  it was important to be kind .  and he knew where to find some acid .     lord vetinari   s personal secretary stepped into the oblong office with barely a disturbance in the air .  his lordship glanced up .     ah  drumknott .  i think i shall have to write to the times again .  i am certain that one down  six across and nine down appeared in that same combination three months ago .  on a friday  i believe .     he dropped the crossword page on to the desk with a look of disdain .     so much for a free press .         well done  my lord .  the archchancellor has just entered the palace .      vetinari smiled .     he must have looked at the calendar at last .  thank goodness they have ponder stibbons .  show him straight in after the customary wait .      five minutes later  mustrum ridcully was ushered in .      archchancellor .  to what urgent matter do i owe this visit .  our usual meeting is not until the day after tomorrow  i believe .         er  yes     said ridcully .  as he sat down  a very large sherry was placed in front of him .      well  havelock  the fact of the matter is           but it is in fact quite providential that you have arrived just now     vetinari went on  ignoring him     because a problem has arisen on which i would like your advice .         oh .  really .         yes  indeed .  it concerns this wretched game called foot the ball           it does .      the glass  now in ridcully   s hand  trembled not a fraction .  he   d held his job for a long time  right back to the days when a wizard who blinked died .      one has to move with the times  of course     said the patrician  shaking his head .      we tend not to  over the road     said ridcully .     it only encourages them .         people do not understand the limits of tyranny     said vetinari  as if talking to himself .     they think that because i can do what i like i can do what i like .  a moment   s thought reveals  of course  that this cannot be so .         oh  it is the same with magic     said the archchancellor .     if you flash spells around like there   s no tomorrow  there   s a good chance that there won   t be .         in short     vetinari continued  still talking to the air     i am intending to give my blessing to the game of football  in the hope that its excesses can be more carefully controlled .         well  it worked with the thieves    guild     ridcully observed  amazed at his own calmness .     if there has to be crime  then it should be organized  i think that   s what you said .         exactly .  i have to admit to the view that all exercise for any purpose other than bodily health  the defence of the realm and the proper action of the bowels is barbaric .         really .  what about agriculture .         defence of the realm against starvation .  but i see no point in people just   running about .  did you catch your megapode  by the way .      how the hells does he do it .  ridcully wondered .  i mean  how .  aloud  he said     indeed we did  but surely you are not suggesting that we were merely    running about    .         of course not .  all three exceptions apply .  tradition is at least as important as bowels  if not quite so useful .  and  indeed  the poor boys    fun has some remarkable traditions of its own  which some might find it worthwhile exploring .  let me be frank  mustrum .  i cannot enforce a mere personal dislike against public pressure .  well  i can  strictly speaking  but not without going to ridiculous and indeed tyrannical lengths .  over a game .  i think not .  so   as things stand  we find teams of burly men pushing and shoving and kicking and biting in the faint hope  it seems to me  of propelling some wretched object at some distant goal .  i have no problem with them trying to kill one another  which has little in the way of a downside  but it has now become so popular once more that property is being damaged  and that cannot be tolerated .  there have been comments in the times .  no  what the wise man cannot change he must channel .         and how do you intend to do that .         by giving the job to you .  unseen university has always had a fine sporting tradition .            had    is the right word     sighed ridcully .     in my day we were all so   so relentlessly physical .  but if i was to suggest so much as an egg and spoon race these days they   d use the spoon to eat the egg .         alas  i did not know your day was over  mustrum     said lord vetinari  with a smile .   the room  never normally noisy  sank into deeper silence .      now look here       ridcully began .      this afternoon i shall be speaking to the editor of the times     said vetinari  gently surfing his voice over that of the wizard with all the skill of a born committee manipulator     who is  as we know  a very civic minded person .  i   m sure he will welcome the fact that i am asking the university to tame the demon foot the ball  and that you have  after careful thought  agreed to the task .      i don   t have to do this  ridcully thought carefully .  on the other hand  since it is what i want  and thereby don   t have to ask for  this may be unwise .  damn .  this is so like him .      you would not object if we raise our own team .     he managed .      indeed  i positively demand that you do so .  but no magic  mustrum .  i must make that clear .  magic is not sporting  unless you are playing against other wizards  of course .         oh  i am a very sporting man  havelock .         capital .  how is the dean settling in at brazeneck  by the way .      if it had been anyone else asking  ridcully thought  that would simply be a polite enquiry .  but this is vetinari  isn   t it        i   ve been too busy to find out     he said loftily     but i   m sure he will be fine when he finds his feet .     or manages to see them without a mirror  he added to himself .      i   m sure you must be pleased to see your old friend and colleague making his way in the world     said vetinari  innocently .     and so is pseudopolis itself  of course .  i must say  i admire the sturdy burghers of that city for embarking on their noble experiment in this   this democracy     he went on .     it is always good to see it attempted again .  and sometimes amusing  too .         there is something to be said for it  you know     grunted ridcully .      yes  i believe you practise it at the university     said the patrician  with a little smile .     however  on the matter of football we are in accord .  capital .  i will tell mister de worde what you are doing .  i   m sure that the keen players of foot the ball will be interested  when someone explains the longer words to them .  well done .  do try the sherry .  i am told it is highly palatable .      vetinari stood up  a signal that  in theory at least  the business of the meeting was concluded  and strolled over to a polished stone slab  set into a square wooden table .     on a different note  mustrum   how is your young visitor .         my visit   oh  you mean the   uh           that   s right .     vetinari smiled at the slab as if sharing a joke with it .     the  as you put it  uh .         i note the sarcasm .  as a wizard  i must tell you that words have power .         as a politician  i must tell you i already know .  how is he getting along .  concerned minds would like to know .      ridcully glanced at the little carved men on the playing slab as if they were listening to him .  in a roundabout way  they probably were .  certainly it was well known now that the hands that guided half the pieces lived in a big castle in uberwald  and were female and belonged to a lady who was mostly rumour .      smeems says he keeps himself to himself .  he says he thinks the boy is cunning .         oh  good     said vetinari  still seeming to find something totally engrossing in the layout of playing pieces .      good .         we need cunning people in ankh morpork .  we have a street of cunning artificers  do we not .         well  yes  but           ah  then it is context that has power     said vetinari  turning around with a look of unmasked delight .     did i say that i am a politician .  cunning  artful  sly  deceptive  shrewd  astute  cute  on the ball and  indeed  arch .  a word for any praise and every prejudice .  cunning   is a cunning word .         you don   t think that maybe this   experiment of yours might be a step too far .     said ridcully .      people said that about the vampires  did they not .  it   s alleged that they have no proper language  but i am told he speaks several languages fluently .         smeems did say he talked la di da     ridcully admitted .      mustrum  compared with natchbull smeems  trolls speak la di da .         the   boy was brought up by a priest of some sort  i know that     said ridcully .     but what will he become when he grows up .         by the sound of him  a professor of linguistics .         you know what i mean  havelock .         possibly  although i wonder if you do .  but he is  i suggest  unlikely to become a ravening horde all by himself .      ridcully sighed .  he glanced towards the game again  and vetinari noticed .      look at them .  ranks  files     he said  waving a hand over the little stone figures     locked in everlasting conflict at the whim of the player .  they fight  they fall  and they cannot turn back because the whips drive them on  and all they know is whips  kill or be killed .  darkness in front of them  darkness behind them  darkness and whips in their heads .  but what if you could take one out of this game  get him before the whips do  take him to a place without whips   what might he become .  one creature .  one singular being .  would you deny them that chance .         you had three men hanged last week     said ridcully  without quite understanding why .      they had their chances .  they used them to kill  and worse .  all we get is a chance .  we don   t get a benison .  he was chained to an anvil for seven years .  he should get his chance  don   t you think .      suddenly vetinari was smiling again .      let us not get sombre  however .  i look forward to your ushering in a new era of lively  healthy activity in the best sporting tradition .  indeed  tradition will be your friend here  i am sure .  please don   t let me trespass any further on your time .      ridcully drained the sherry .  that at least was palatable .     it   s a short walk from the palace to unseen university  positions of power like to keep an eye on one another .   ridcully walked back through the crowds  occasionally nodding at people he knew  which  in this part of the city  was practically everyone .   trolls  he thought  we get along with trolls  now that they remember to look where they   re putting their feet .  got    em in the watch and everything .  jolly decent types  bar a few bad apples  and gods know we have enough of those of our own .  dwarfs .  been here for ages .  can be a bit tricky  can be as tight as a duck   s arse   here he paused to think and edited that thought to    drive a hard bargain    .  you always know where you are with them  anyway  and of course they are short  which is always a comfort provided you know what they are doing down there .  vampires .  well  the uberwald league of temperance seemed to be working .  word on the street   or in the vault or whatever   was that they policed their own .  any unreformed bloodsucker who tried to make a killing in the city would be hunted down by people who knew exactly how they thought and where they hung out .   lady margolotta was behind all that .  she was the person who  by diplomacy  and probably more direct means  had got things moving again in uberwald  and she had some sort of   relationship with vetinari .  everyone knew it  and that was all everyone knew .  a dot dot dot relationship .  one of those .  and nobody had been able to join up the dots .   she had been to the city on diplomatic visits  and not even the well practised dowagers of ankh morpork had been able to detect a whisper of anything other than a businesslike amiability and international cooperation between the two of them .   and he played endless and complex games with her  via the clacks system  and apart from that  that was  well  that   until now .   and she   d sent him this nutt to keep safe .  who knew why  apart from them .  politics  probably .   ridcully sighed .  one of the monsters  all alone .  it was hard to think of it .  they came in thousands  like lice  killing everything and eating the dead  including theirs .  the evil empire had bred them in huge cellars  grey demons without a hell .   the gods alone knew what had happened to them when the empire collapsed .  but there was convincing evidence now that some still lived up in the far hills .  what might they do .  and one  right now  was making candles in ridcully   s cellars .  what might he become .      a bloody nuisance .     said ridcully aloud .         ere     oo are you calling a nuisance  mister .  it   s my road  same as yours .      the wizard looked down at a young man who appeared to have stolen his clothes only from the best washing lines  though the tattered black and red scarf around his neck was probably his own .  there was an edginess to him  a continual shifting of weight  as though he might at any moment run off in a previously unguessable direction .  and he was throwing a tin can up in the air and catching it again .  for ridcully it brought back memories so sharp that they stung  but he pulled himself together .      i am mustrum ridcully  archchancellor and master of unseen university  young man  and i see you are sporting colours .  for some game .  a game of football  i suggest .         as it happens  yes .  so what .     said the urchin  then realized that his hand was empty when it should now  under normal gravitational rules  be full again .  the tin had not fallen back from its last ascent  and was in fact turning gently twenty feet up in the air .      childish of me  i know     said ridcully     but i did want your full attention .  i want to witness a game of football .         witness .  look  i never saw nuffin           ridcully sighed .     i mean i want to watch a game  okay .  today  if possible .         you .  are you sure .  it   s your funeral  mister .  got a shilling .      there was a clink  high above .      the tin will come back down with a sixpence in it .  time and place  please .            ow do i know i can trust you .     said the urchin .      i don   t know     said ridcully .     the subtle workings of the brain are a mystery to me  too .  but i   m glad that is your belief .         what .     with a shrug  the boy decided to gamble  what with having had no breakfast .      loop alley off the scours     arp arsed one  an    i   ve never seen you before in my life  got it .         that is quite probable     said ridcully  and snapped his fingers .   the tin dropped into the urchin   s waiting hand .  he shook out the silver coin and grinned .     best o    luck to you  guv .         is there anything to eat at these affairs .     said ridcully  for whom lunchtime was a sacrament .      there   s pies  guv  pease pudding  jellied eel pies  pie and mash  lobster   pies  but mostly they are just pies .  just pies  sir .  made of pie .         what kind .      his informant looked shocked .     they   re pies  guv .  you don   t ask .      ridcully nodded .     and as a final transaction  i   ll pay you one penny for a kick of your can .         tuppence     said the boy promptly .      you little scamp  we have a deal .      ridcully dropped the can on the toe of his boot  balanced it for a moment  then flicked it into the air and  as it came down  hit it with a roundhouse kick that sent it spinning over the crowd .      not bad  granddad     said the kid  grinning .  in the distance there was a yell and the sound of someone bent on retribution .   ridcully plunged a hand into his pocket and looked down .     two dollars to start running  kid .  you won   t get a better deal today .     the boy laughed  grabbed the coins and ran .  ridcully walked on sedately  while the years fell back on him like snow .     he found ponder stibbons pinning up a notice on the board just outside the great hall .  he did this quite a lot .  ridcully assumed it made him feel better in some way .   he slapped ponder on the back  causing him to spill drawing pins all over the flagstones .      it is a bulletin from the ankh committee on safety  archchancellor     said ponder  scrabbling for the spinning  wayward pins .      this is a university of magic  stibbons .  we have no business with safety .  just being a wizard is unsafe  and so it should be .         yes  archchancellor .         but i should pick up all those pins if i were you  you can   t be too careful .  tell me didn   t we use to have a sports master here .         yes  sir .  evans the striped .  he vanished about forty years ago  i believe .         killed .  it was dead men   s shoes in those days  you know .         i can   t imagine who would want his job .  apparently he evaporated while doing press ups in the great hall one day .         evaporated .  what kind of death is that for a wizard .  any wizard would die of shame if he just evaporated .  we always leave something behind  even if it   s only smoke .  oh  well .  cometh the hour  cometh the   whatever .  general comethness  perhaps .  what is that thinking engine of yours doing these days .      ponder brightened .     as a matter of fact  archchancellor  hex has just discovered a new particle .  it travels faster than light in two directions at once .         can we make it do anything interesting .         well yes .  it totally explodes spolwhittle   s trans congruency theory .         good     said ridcully cheerfully .     just so long as something explodes .  since it   s finished exploding  set it to finding either evans or a decent substitute .  sports masters are pretty elementary particles  it shouldn   t be difficult .  and call a meeting of the council in ten minutes .  we are going to play football .        truth is female  since truth is beauty rather than handsomeness  this  ridcully reflected as the council grumbled in  would certainly explain the saying that a lie could run around the world before truth has got its  correction  her boots on  since she would have to choose which pair   the idea that any woman in a position to choose would have just one pair of boots being beyond rational belief .  indeed  as a goddess she would have lots of shoes  and thus many choices  comfy shoes for home truths  hobnail boots for unpleasant truths  simple clogs for universal truths and possibly some kind of slipper for self evident truth .  more important right now was what kind of truth he was going to have to impart to his colleagues  and he decided not on the whole truth  but instead on nothing but the truth  which dispensed with the need for honesty .      well  go on  then  what did he say .         he responded to reasoned argument .         he did .  where   s the catch .         none .  but he wants the rules to be more traditional .         surely not .  gather they are practically prehistoric as it is .         and he wants the university to take the lead in all this  and quickly .  gentlemen  there is a game going to be played in about three hours    time .  i suggest we observe it .  and to this end  i will require you to wear   trousers .      after a while ridcully took out his watch  which was one of the old fashioned imp driven ones and was reliably inaccurate .  he flipped up the gold lid and stared patiently as the little creature pedalled the hands around .  when the expostulating had not stopped after a minute and a half  he snapped the lid shut .  the click had an effect that no amount of extra shouting could have achieved .      gentlemen     he said gravely .     we must partake of the game of the people   from whom  i might add  we derive .  has any of us  in the last few decades  even seen the game being played .  i thought not .  we should get outside more .  now  i   m not asking you to do this for me  or even for the hundreds of people who work to provide us with a life in which discomfort so seldom rears its head .  yes  many other ugly heads have reared  it is true  but dinner has always beckoned .  we are  fellow wizards  the city   s last line of defence against all the horrors that can be thrown against it .  however  none of them are as potentially dangerous as us .  yes  indeed .  i don   t know what might happen if wizards were really hungry .  so do this  i implore you on this one occasion  for the sake of the cheeseboard .      there had been some nobler calls to arms in history  ridcully would be the first to admit  but this one was well tailored to its target audience .  there was some grumbling  but that was the same as saying that the sky was blue .      what about lunch .     said the lecturer in recent runes suspiciously .      we   ll eat early     said ridcully     and i am told that the pies at the game are just   amazing .      truth  in front of her huge walk in wardrobe  selected black leather boots with stiletto heels for such a barefaced truth .     nutt was already waiting with a proud but worried look on his face when glenda got in to the night kitchen .  she didn   t notice him at first  but she turned back from hanging her coat on its peg and there he was  holding a couple of dishes in front of him like shields .   she almost had to shade her eyes because they gleamed so brightly .      i hope this is all right     said nutt nervously .      what have you done .         i plated them with silver  miss .         how did you do that .         oh  there   s all kinds of old stuff in the cellars and  well  i know how to do things .  it won   t cause trouble for anyone  will it .     nutt added  looking suddenly anxious .   glenda wondered if it would .  it shouldn   t  but you could never be sure with mrs whitlow .  well  she could solve that problem by hiding them somewhere until they tarnished .      it   s kind of you to take the trouble .  i generally have to chase people to get plates back .  you are a real gentleman     she said  and his face lit up like a sunrise .      you are very kind     he beamed     and a very handsome lady with your two enormous chests that indicate bountifulness and fecundity        the morning air froze in one enormous block .  he could tell he   d said something wrong  but he had no idea what it was .   glenda looked around to see if anyone had heard  but the huge gloomy room was otherwise empty .  she was always the first one in and the last one out .  then she said     stay right there .  don   t you dare move an inch .  not an inch .  and don   t steal any chickens .     she commanded as an afterthought .   she should have trailed steam as she headed out of the room  her boots echoing on the flagstones .  what a thing to come out with .  who did he think he was .  come to that  who did she think he was .  and what did she think he was .   the cellars and undercrofts of the university were a small city in themselves  and bakers and butchers turned to look as she clattered past .  she didn   t dare stop now  it would be too embarrassing .   if you knew all the passages and stairs  and if they stayed still for five minutes  it was possible to get to just about anywhere in the university without going above ground .  probably none of the wizards knew the maze .  not many of them cared to know the dull details of domestic management .  hah  they thought the dinners turned up by magic .   a small set of stone steps led up to the little door .  hardly anyone used it these days .  the other girls wouldn   t go in there .  but glenda would .  even after the very first time that she had  in response to the bell  delivered the midnight banana  or rather had failed to deliver it on account of running away screaming  she knew she   d have to face it again .  after all  we can   t help how we   re made  her mother had said  and nor can we help what a magical accident might turn us into through no fault of our own  as mrs whitlow had explained slightly more recently  when the screaming had stopped .  and so glenda had picked up the banana and had headed right back there .   now  of course  she was surprised that anyone might find it odd that the custodian of all the knowledge that could be was a reddish brown and generally hung several feet above his desk  and she was pretty certain that she knew at least fourteen meanings of the word    ook    .   as it was daytime  the huge building beyond the little door was bustling  insofar as the word can be applied to a library .  she headed towards the nearest lesser librarian  who failed to look the other way in time  and demanded     i need to see a dictionary of embarrassing words beginning with f .      his haughty glance softened somewhat when he realized she was a cook .  wizards always had a place in their hearts for cooks  because it was near their stomach .      ah  then i think birdcatcher   s discomforting misusage will be our friend here     he said cheerfully  and led her to a lectern  where she spent several enlightening minutes before heading back the way she had come  a little wiser and a great deal more embarrassed .   nutt was still standing where she   d told him to stand  and looked terrified .      i   m sorry  i didn   t know what you meant     she said  and thought  abundant  productive and fruitful .  well  yes  i can see how he got there  worse luck  but that   s not me  not really me .  i think .  i hope .      um  it was kind of you to say that about me     she said     but you should have used more appropriate language .         ah  yes  i   m so sorry     said nutt .     mister trev told me about this .  i should not talk posh .  i should have said that you have enormous t           just stop there  will you .  trevor likely is teaching you elocution .         don   t tell me  i know this one   you mean talkin    proper .     said nutt .     yes  and he   s promised to take me to the football     he added proudly .   this led to some explanation  which only made glenda gloomy .  trev was right  of course .  people who didn   t know long words tended to be edgy around people who did .  that   s why her male neighbours  like mr stollop and his mates  distrusted nearly everybody .  their wives  on the other hand  shared a much larger if somewhat specialized vocabulary owing to the cheap romantic novels that passed like contraband from scullery to washhouse  in every street .  that   s why glenda knew    elocution        torrid        boudoir    and    reticule     although she wasn   t too certain about    reticule    and    boudoir     and avoided using them  which in the general scheme of things was not hard .  she was deeply suspicious about what a lady   s boudoir might be  and certainly wasn   t going to ask anybody  even in the library  just in case they laughed .      and he   s going to take you to the football  is he .  mister nutt  you will stand out like a diamond in a sweep   s earhole .      do not stand out from the crowd .  there were so many things to remember .      he says he will look after me     said nutt  hanging his head .     er  i was wondering who that nice young lady was who was in here last night     he added desperately  as transparent as air .      he asked you to ask me  right .      lie .  stay safe .  but ladyship wasn   t here .  and the nice apple pie lady was right here in front of him .  it was too complicated .      yes     he said meekly .   and glenda surprised herself .     her name is juliet  and she lives bang next door to me so he   d better not come round  okay .  juliet stollop  see if he likes that .         you fear he will press his suit .         her dad will press a lot more than that if he sees he   s a dimmer supporter .      nutt looked blank  so she went on     don   t you know anything .  dimwell old pals .  the football team .  the dollies are dolly sisters football club .  dollies hate the dimmers  the dimmers hate the dollies .  it   s always been like that .         what could have caused such a difference between them .         what .  there is no difference between them  not when you   ve got past the colours .  they   re two teams  alike in villainy .  dolly sisters wears white and black  dimwell wears pink and green .  it   s all about football .  bloody  bloody  clogging  hacking  punching  gouging  silly football .     the bitterness in glenda   s voice would have soured cream .      but you have a dolly sisters scarf .         when you live there  it   s safer that way .  anyway  you have to support your own .         but is it not a game  like spillikins or halma or thud .         no .  it   s more like war  but without the kindness and consideration .         oh  dear .  but war is not kind  is it .     said nutt  bewilderment clouding his face .      no .         oh  i see .  you were being ironic .      she gave him a sideways look .     i might have been     she conceded .     you are an odd one  mister nutt .  where are you from  really .      the old panic contained again .  be harmless .  be helpful .  make friends .  lie .  but how did you lie to friends .      i must go     he said  scurrying down the stone steps .     mister trev will be waiting .      nice but odd  glenda thought  watching him leap down the steps .  clever  too .  to spot my scarf on a hook ten yards away .     the sound of a rattling tin can alerted nutt to his boss   s presence before he had even hurried through the old archway to the vats .  the other habitu  s had paused in their work  which  frankly  given its usual snaillike progress  meant hardly any change at all  and were watching him listlessly .  but they were watching  at least .  even concrete looked vaguely alert  but nutt saw a little dribble of brown in the corner of his mouth .  someone had been giving him iron filings again .   the can shot up as trev caught it with his boot  flew over his head  and then came back obliquely  as if rolling down an invisible slope  and landed in his waiting hand .  there was a murmur of appreciation from the watchers and concrete banged his hand on the table  which generally meant approval .      what kept you  gobbo .  chatting up glenda  were you .  you   ve got no chance there  take it from me .  been there  tried that  oh yes .  no chance  mate .     he threw a grubby bag towards nutt .     get these on quick  else you   ll stand out like a diamond in           a sweep   s earhole .     nutt suggested .      yeah .  you   re gettin    it .  now don   t hang about or we   ll be late .      nutt looked doubtfully at a long  a very long scarf in pink and green and a large yellow woolly hat with a pink bobble on it .      pull it down hard so it covers your ears     trev commanded .     get a move on .         er   pink .     said nutt doubtfully  holding up the scarf .      what about it .         well  isn   t football a rough man   s game .  whereas pink  if you will excuse me  is rather a   female colour .      trev grinned .     yeah  that   s right .  think about it .  you are the clever one around here .  and you can walk and think at the same time  i know that .  makes you stand out from the crowd in these parts .         ah  i think i have it .  the pink proclaims an almost belligerent masculinity  saying as it does  i am so masculine i can afford to tempt you to question it  giving me the opportunity to proclaim it anew by doing violence to you in response .  i don   t know if you have ever read ofleberger   s die wesentlichen ungewissheiten zugeh  rig der offenkundigen m  nnlichkeit .      trev grabbed his shoulder and spun him round .     wot do you fink  gobbo .     he said  his red face a couple of inches from nutt   s .     wot is your problem .  wot are you all about .  you come out with ten dollar words an    you lay    em down like a man doin    a jigsaw .  so how come you   re down in the vats  eh  workin    for someone like me .  it don   t make sense .  are you on the run from the old sam .  no problem  there  unless you did up an old lady or somethin     but you got to tell me .      too dangerous  thought nutt desperately .  change the subject .     she   s called juliet .     he gasped .     the girl you asked about .  she lives next door to glenda .  honestly .      trev looked suspicious .     glenda told you that .         yes .         she was windin    you up .  she knew you   d tell me .         i don   t think she would lie to me  mister trev .  she is my friend .         i kept thinkin    about her all last night     said trev .      well  she is a wonderful cook     nutt agreed .      i meant juliet .         um  and glenda said to tell you that juliet   s other name is stollop     said nutt  hating to be the bearer of worse news .      what .  that girl is a stollop .         yes .  glenda said i was to see how you liked that  but i know the meaning of irony .         but it   s like findin    a strawberry in a dogmeat stew  yeah .  i mean  the stollops are buggers  the lot of    em  biters and cloggers to a man  the kind of bastards who   ll kick your family jewels up into your throat .         but you don   t play football  do you .  you just watch .             damn right .  but i   m a face  right .  i   m known in all the boroughs .  you can ask anyone .  everyone knows trev likely .  i   m dave likely   s lad .  every supporter in the city knows about him .  four goals .  no one else scored that much in a lifetime .  and gave as good as he got  did dad .  one game he picked up the dolly bastard holding the ball and threw    im over the line .  he gave as good as    e got  my dad  and then some .         so  he was a bugger and a clogger and a biter too  was he .         what .  are you pulling my tonker .         i would not wish to do so initially  mister trev     said nutt  so solemnly that trev had to grin     but  you see  if he fought the opposing team with even more force than they used  does that not mean that he           he was my dad     said trev .     that means you don   t try any fancy maths  okay .         okay indeed .  and you never wanted to follow in his footsteps .         what  and get brung home on a stretcher .  i got my brains from my ol    mum  not from dad .  he was a good bloke and loved his football  but he wasn   t flush with brains to start with an    on that day some of    em were leakin    out of his ear .  the dollies got    im in the melee and sorted    im out good and proper .  that   s not for me  gobbo .  i   m smart .         yes  mister trev  i can see that .         get the gear on and let   s go  okay .  we don   t want to miss anything .         fing     said nutt automatically  as he started to wind the huge scarf around his neck .      what .     said trev  frowning .      wot .     said nutt  his voice a little muffled .  there was a lot of scarf .  it was almost covering his mouth .      are you pulling my chuff  gobbo .     said trev  handing him an ancient sweater  faded and saggy with age .      please  mister trev  i don   t know .  there appears to be so much i might inadvertently pull .     he tugged on the big woolly hat with the pink pompom on it .     they are so very pink  mister trev .  we must be bursting with machismo .         i don   t know what you person   ly are bursting with  gobbo  but here   s somethin    to learn .     come on if you think you   re hard enough .     now you say it .         come on if you think you   re hard enough     said nutt obediently .      well  okay     said trev  inspecting him .     just remember  if anyone starts pushing you around during the game  and givin    you grief  just you say that to    em and they   ll see you   re wearing the dimmer colours and they   ll think twice .  got it .      nutt  somewhere in the space between the big bobbly hat and the boa constrictor of a scarf  nodded .      wow  there you are  gobbo  a complete   fan .  your own mother wouldn   t recognize you .      there was a pause before a voice emerged from inside the mound of ancient woollens  which looked very much like a nursery layette made by a couple of giants who weren   t sure what to expect .      i believe you are accurate .         yeah .  well  that   s good  innit .  now let   s go and meet the lads .  move fast  stay close .           now remember  this is a pre season friendly between the angels and the whoppers  right .     said trev  as they stepped out into a fine rain which  because of ankh morpork   s standing cloud of pollution  was morphing gently into smog .     they   re both pretty crap  they   ll never amount to anythin     but the dimmers shout for the angels  right .      it took some explaining  but the core of it  as far as nutt could understand it  was this  all football teams in the city were rated by dimwell in proportion to their closeness  physical  psychological or general gut feeling  to the hated dolly sisters .  it had just evolved that way .  if you went to a match between two other teams  you automatically  according to some complex and ever changing ready reckoner of love and hate  cheered the team most nearly allied to your native turf or  more accurately  cobbles .      do you see what i mean .     trev finished .      i have committed what you said to memory  mister trev .         oh brutha  an    i   ll bet you    ave  at that .  and it   s just trev when we   re not at work  right .  we shout together  right .     he punched nutt playfully on the arm .      why did you do that  mister trev .     said nutt .  his eyes  almost the only part of him visible  looked hurt .     you struck me .         that wasn   t me hitting you  gobbo .  that was just a friendly punch .  big difference .  don   t you know that .  it   s a little tap on the arm  to show we   re mates .  go on  do it to me .  go on .     trev winked .      you will be polite and  most of all  you will never raise your hand in anger to anyone     but this wasn   t like that  was it .  nutt asked himself .  trev was his friend .  this was friendly .  a friend thing .  he punched the friendly arm .      that was a punch .     said trev .     you call that a punch .  a girl could punch better   n that .  how come you   re still alive with a weedy punch like that .  go on  try a proper punch .      nutt did .     be one of the crowd .  it went against everything a wizard stood for  and a wizard would not stand for anything if he could sit down for it  but even sitting down  you had to stand out .  there were  of course  times when a robe got in the way  especially when a wizard was working in his forge  creating a magic metal or mobiloid glass or any of those other little exercises in practical magic where not setting fire to yourself is a happy bonus  so every wizard had some leather trousers and a stained  rotted by acid shirt .  it was the shared dirty little secret  not very secret  but ingrained with deep down dirt .   ridcully sighed .  his colleagues had aimed for the look of the common man  but had only a hazy grasp of what the common man looked like these days  and now they were sniggering and looking at one another and saying things like    cor blimey  don   t you scrub down well  as it were  my ol    mate .     beside them  and looking extremely embarrassed  were two of the university   s bledlows  not knowing what to do with their feet and wishing that they were having a quiet smoke somewhere in the warm .      gentlemen     ridcully began  and then with a gleam in his eye added     or should i say  fellow workers by hand and brain  this afternoon we   yes  senior wrangler .         are we  in point of fact  workers .  this is a university  after all     said the senior wrangler .      i agree with the senior wrangler     said the lecturer in recent runes .     under university statute we are specifically forbidden to engage  other than within college precincts  in any magic above level four  unless specifically asked to do so by the civil power or  under clause three  we really want to .  we are acting as place holders  and as such  forbidden from working .         would you accept    slackers by hand and brain    .     said ridcully  always happy to see how far he could go .      slackers by hand and brain by statute     said the senior wrangler primly .   ridcully gave up .  he could do this all day  but life couldn   t be all fun .      that being settled  then  i must tell you that i have asked the stalwart mister frankly ottomy and mister alf nobbs to join us in this little escapade .  mister nobbs says that since we are not wearing football favours we should not attract unwanted attention .      the wizards nodded nervously at the bledlows .  they were  of course  merely employees of the university  while the wizards were  well  were the university  weren   t they .  after all  a university was not just about bricks and mortar  it was about people  specifically wizards .  but to a man  the bledlows scared them .   they were all hefty men with a look of having been carved out of bacon .  and they were all descendants of  and practically identical to  those men who had chased those wizards   younger and more limber  and it was amazing how fast you could run with a couple of bledlows behind you   through the foggy night time streets .  if caught  said bledlows  who took enormous pleasure in the prosecution of the university   s private laws and idiosyncratic rules  would then drag you before the archchancellor on a charge of attempting to become rascally drunk .  that was preferable to fighting back  when the bledlows were widely believed to take the opportunity for a little class warfare .  that was years ago  but even now the unexpected sight of a bledlow caused sullen  shameful terror to flow down the spines of men who had acquired more letters after their names than a game of scrabble .   mr ottomy  recognizing this  leered and touched the brim of his uniform cap .     afternoon  gents     he said .     don   t you worry about a thing .  me and alf here will see you right .  we   d better get movin     though  they bully off in half an hour .      the senior wrangler would not have been the senior wrangler if he did not hate the sound of silence .  as they shuffled out of the back door  wincing at the unfamiliar chafing of trouser upon knee  he turned to mr nobbs and said     nobbs   that   s not a common name .  tell me  alf  are you by any chance related to the famous corporal nobby nobbs of the watch .      mr nobbs took it well  ridcully thought  given the clumsy lack of protocol .      nosir .         ah  a distant branch of the name  then           nosir .  different tree .        in the greyness of her front room  glenda looked at the suitcase  and despaired .  she   d done her best with brown boot polish  week after week  but it had been bought from a shonky shop and the cardboard under the leather ish exterior was beginning to show through .  her customers never seemed to notice  but she did  even when it was out of sight .   it was a secret part of a secret life that she lived for an hour or two on her half day off once a week  and maybe a little longer if today   s cold calls worked out .   she looked at her face in the mirror  and said in a voice that was full of jaunt     we all know the problem of underarm defoliation .  it is so hard  isn   t it  to keep the lichens healthy   but     she flourished a green and blue container with a golden stopper     one spray with verdant spring will keep those crevices moist and forest fresh all day long        she faltered  because it really wasn   t her .  she couldn   t do jaunty .  the stuff was a dollar a bottle .  who could afford that .  well  a lot of troll ladies  that   s who  but mr stronginthearm said it was okay because they had the money  and anyway it did let the moss grow .  she   d said all right  but a dollar for a fancy bottle of water with some plant food in it was a bit steep .  and he   d said you are selling the dream .   and they bought it .  that was the worrying part .  they bought it and recommended it to their friends .  the city had discovered the heavy dollar now .  she   d read about it in the paper .  there had always been trolls around  doing the heavy lifting and generally being there in the background if not being the actual background itself .  but now they were raising families and running businesses  moving on and up and buying things  and that made them people at last .  and so you got other people like mr stronginthearm  a dwarf  selling beauty products to miss and mrs troll  via ladies like glenda  a human  because although dwarfs and trolls were officially great chums these days  because of something called the koom valley accord  that sort of thing only meant much to the sort of people who signed treaties .  even the most well intentioned dwarf would not walk down some of the roads along which glenda  every week  dragged her nasty  semi cardboard case  selling the dream .  it got her out of the house and paid for the little treats .  there was money to put away for a rainy day .  mr stronginthearm had the knack of coming up with new ideas  too .  who would have thought that lady trolls would go for fake tan lotion .  it sold .  everything sold .  the dream sold  and it was shallow and expensive and made her feel cheap .  it     her ever straining ears caught the sound of next door   s front door opening very slowly .  ha .  juliet jumped as glenda suddenly loomed beside her .      off somewhere .         gonna watch the game  ain   t i .      glenda glanced up the street .  a figure was disappearing rapidly around the corner .  she grinned a grim grin .      oh yes .  good idea .  i wasn   t doing anything .  just wait while i fetch my scarf  will you .     to herself she added  you just keep walking  johnny .     with a thump that caused pigeons to explode away like a detonating daisy  the librarian landed on his chosen rooftop .   he liked football .  something about the shouting and the fighting appealed to his ancestral memories .  and this was fascinating  because  strictly speaking  his ancestors had been blamelessly engaged for centuries as upstanding corn and feed merchants and  moreover  were allergic to heights .   he sat down on the parapet with his feet over the edge  and his nostrils flared as he snuffed up the scents rising from below .   it is said that the onlooker sees most of the game .  but the librarian could smell as well  and the game  seen from outside  was humanity .  not a day went past without his thanking the magical accident that had moved him a few little genes away from it .  apes had it worked out .  no ape would philosophize     the mountain is  and is not .     they would think     the banana is .  i will eat the banana .  there is no banana .  i want another banana .      he peeled one now  in a preoccupied way  while watching the evolving tableau below .  not only does said onlooker see most of the game  he might even see more than one game .   this street was indeed a crescent  which would probably have an effect on tactics if the players had any truck with such high flown concepts .   people were pouring in from either end and also from a couple of alleyways .  mostly they were male extremely so .  the women fell into two categories  those who had been tugged there by the ties of blood or prospective matrimony  after which they could stop pretending that this bloody mess was in any way engrossing   and a number of elderly women of a    sweet old lady    construction  who bawled indiscriminately  in a rising cloud of lavender and peppermint  screams of    get    im dahn an    kick    im inna nuts .     and similar exhortations .   and there was another smell now  one he   d learned to recognize but could not quite fathom .  it was the smell of nutt .  tangled with it were the smells of tallow  cheap soap and shonky shop clothing that the ape part of him categorized as belonging to    tin flinging man    .  he had been just another servant in the maze of the university  but now he was a friend of nutt  and nutt was important .  he was also wrong .  he had no place in the world  but he was in it  and the world was becoming aware of him soon enough .   the librarian knew all about this sort of thing .  there had been no space in the fabric of reality marked    simian librarian    until he   d been dropped into one  and the ripples had made his life a very strange one .   ah  another scent was riding the gentle updraught .  it was easy  screaming banana pie woman .  the librarian liked her .  oh  she had screamed and run away the first time she   d seen him .  they all did .  but she had come back  and she   d smelled ashamed .  she also respected the primacy of words  and  as a primate  so did he .  and sometimes she baked him a banana pie  which was a kind act .  the librarian was not very familiar with love  which had always struck him as a bit ethereal and soppy  but kindness  on the other hand  was practical .  you knew where you were with kindness  especially if you were holding a pie it had just given you .  she was a friend of nutt  too .  nutt made friends easily for someone who had come from nowhere .  interesting     the librarian  despite appearances  liked order .  books about cabbages went on the brassica shelves   blit  uussfy            antiblit  .     although obviously mr cauliflower   s big adventure would be better placed in uuss j  .     blit     while the tau of cabbage would certainly be a candidate for uuss  blit      sp   o  hl  blit  .  to anyone familiar with a seven dimensional library system in blit dimensional space it was as clear as daylight  if you remembered to keep your eye on the blit .   ah  and here came his fellow wizards  walking awkwardly in the chafing trousers and trying so hard not to stand out in a crowd that they would have stood out even more if the rest of the crowd had been the least bit interested .     nobody noticed .  it was enthralling and exciting at the same time  ridcully concluded .  normally the pointy hat  robe and staff cleared the way faster than a troll with an axe .   they were being pushed .  and shoved .  but it was not as unpleasant as the words suggested .  there were moderate pressures on all sides as people poured in behind  as though the wizards were standing chest deep in the sea  and were swaying and shifting to the slow rhythm of the tide .      my goodness     said the chair of indefinite studies .     is this football .  it   s a bit dull  isn   t it .         pies were mentioned     said the lecturer in recent runes  craning his neck .      people are still coming in  guv     said ottomy .      but however do we see things .         depends on the shove  guv .  usually people near the action shout out .         ah  i see a pie seller     said the chair of indefinite studies .  he took a couple of steps forward  there was a random shift and sway in the crowd  and he vanished .        how is it now  mister trev .     said nutt  as people surged around them .      hurts like buggery  excuse my klatchian     muttered trev  clutching his injured arm to his coat .     are you sure you weren   t holding a hammer .         no hammer  mister trev .  i   m sorry  but you did ask me           i know  i know .  where did you learn to punch like that .         never learned  mister trev .  i must never raise my hand to another person .  but you went on so  and           i mean  you   re so skinny .         long bones  mister trev  long muscles .  i really am very sorry .         my fault  gobbo  i didn   t know your own strength       suddenly trev shot forward  cannoning into nutt .      where   ve you been  my man .     said the person who had just slapped him hard on the back .     we said to meet at the eel pie stall .      now the speaker looked at nutt and his eyes narrowed .     and who   s this stranger who thinks he   s one of us .      he did not exactly glare at nutt  but there was a definite sense of a weighing in the balance  and on unfriendly scales .   trev brushed himself off  looking uncharacteristically embarrassed .     hi  andy .  er  this is nutt .  he works for me .         what as .  a bog brush .     said andy .  there was laughter from the group behind him .  andy always got a laugh .  it was the first thing you noticed  after the glint in his eye .      andy   s dad is captain of dimwell  gobbo .         pleased to meet you  sir     said nutt  extending a hand .      ooo  pleased to meet you  sir     andy mimicked  and trev grimaced as a calloused hand the size of a plate grasped nutt   s cheese straw fingers .      he   s got hands like a girl     andy observed  taking a grip .      mister trev has been telling me wonderful things about the dimmers  sir     said nutt .  andy grunted .  trev saw his knuckles whiten with effort while nutt chattered .     the camaraderie of the sport must be a wonderful thing .         yeah  right     andy grunted  finally managing to pull his hand away  his face full of angry puzzlement .      and this is my mate  maxie     said trev quickly     and this is carter the farter           it   s fartmeister now     said carter .      yeah  right .  and this is jumbo .  you want to watch out for him .  he   s a thief .  jumbo can pick a lock faster than you can pick your nose .      the said jumbo held up a small bronze badge .     guild  of course     he said .     they nail your ears to the door else .         you mean you break the law for a living .     said nutt  horrified .      ain   t you ever heard of the thieves    guild .     said andy .      gobbo   s new     said trev protectively .     hasn   t got out much .  he   s a goblin  from the high country .         coming down here  taking our jobs  yeah .     said carter .      like  how often do you do a hand   s turn .     said trev .      well  i might want to one day .         milking the cows when they come home .     said andy .  this got another laugh  on cue .  and that was the introductions sorted out  to nutt   s surprise .  he   d been expecting chicken theft to be mentioned .  instead  carter pulled a couple of tin cans out of a pocket and tossed them to nutt and trev .      did a few hours    unloading down the docks  didn   t i .     he said defensively  as though a bit of casual labour was some kind of offence .     this come off a boat from fourecks .      jumbo fished in his pocket again and pulled out someone else   s watch .      game on in five minutes     he declared .     let   s shove   er  if that   s all right with you  andy .      andy nodded .  jumbo looked relieved .  it was always important that things were all right with andy .  and andy was still watching nutt as a cat watches an unexpectedly cheeky mouse  while massaging his hand .     mr ottomy cleared his throat  causing his red adam   s apple to bob up and down like an indecisive sunset .  shouting in public  yes  he liked that  he was good at that .  speaking in public  now  that was a different kettle of humiliation .      well  er  gents  what we will have here is your actual football  what is basically about the shove  which is what you gentlemen will be doing soon           i thought we watched two groups of players vie with one another to get the ball in the opponents    goal .         could be  sir  could very much be     the bledlow conceded     but in the streets  see  your actual supporters on both sides try and endeavour to shorten the length of the field  as it were  depending on the flow of play  so to speak .         like living walls  d   y   mean .     said ridcully .      that style of thing  sir  yes  sir     said ottomy loyally .      what about the goals .         oh  they   re allowed to move the goals  too .         sorry .     said ponder .     the spectators can move the goals .         you have put your finger firmly on it  sir .         but that   s sheer anarchy .  it   s a mess .         some of the old boys do say the game has gone downhill  sir  that is true .         downhill  into and out through the bottom of the world  i   d say .         good one to play with magic  though     said dr hix .     well worth a try .         a word to the wise  sir     said ottomy with unwitting accuracy     but you   d be wearing your guts for garters if you tried it with some of the types who play these days .  they take it seriously .         mister ottomy  i   m sure none of my blokes wear garters       ridcully stopped and listened to ponder stibbons   s whispered interjection and continued     well  possibly one  two at most  and it would be a very dull world if we were all the same  that   s what i say .     he looked around and shrugged .     so  this is football  is it .  rather a wizened shell of a game  yes .  i  for one  don   t want to stand around all day in the rain while other people have all the fun .  let   s go and find the ball  gentlemen .  we are wizards .  that must count for something .         i thought we were blokes now     said the lecturer in recent runes .      same thing     said ridcully  straining to see over the heads of the crowd .      surely not .         well     said ridcully     isn   t a bloke someone who likes drinking with his mates and without the company of women .  anyway  i   m fed up with this .  form up behind me  nevertheless .  we   re going to see some football .      the progress of the wizards astonished ottomy and nobbs  who had hitherto seen them as fluffy plump creatures quite divorced from real life .  but to get to be a senior wizard and stay there called for deep reserves of determination  viciousness and the sugared arrogance that is the mark of every true gentleman  as in    oh  was that your foot .  i   m so terribly sorry .      and  of course  there was dr hix  a good man to have in a tight spot because he was  by college statute  an officially bad person  in accordance with uu   s happy grasp of the inevitable .    a less mature organization than uu might have taken the view that the way forward would be to hunt such renegades down  at great risk and expense .  uu  on the other hand  had given hix and his team a department and a budget and a career structure  and also the chance to go out into dark caves occasionally and throw fireballs at unofficial evil wizards  it all worked rather well so long as nobody pointed out that the department of post mortem communications was really  when you got right down to it  just a politer form of n e c r o m a n c y  wasn   t it .   and so dr hix was now tolerated as a useful  if slightly irritating member of the council largely because he was allowed  by statute  to say some of the naughty things that the other wizards would really have liked to say themselves .  someone with a widow   s peak  a skull ring  a sinister staff and a black robe was expected to spread a little evil around the place  although university statute had redefined acceptable evil in this case as being inconveniences on a par with shoelaces tied together or a brief attack of groinal itch .  it wasn   t the most satisfactory of arrangements  but it was in the best uu tradition  hix occupied  amiably  a niche that might otherwise be occupied by someone who really got off on the whole mouldering corpses and peeled skulls thing .  admittedly  he was always giving fellow wizards free tickets to the various amateur dramatic productions he was obsessively involved with  but  on balance  they agreed  taking one thing with another  this was still better than peeled skulls .   for hix  a crowd like this was too good to waste .  not only was there a plethora of bootlaces to be expertly tied together  but there were an awful lot of pockets as well .  he always had some flyers for the next production in his robe   and it wasn   t the same as picking pockets .  quite the reverse .  he stuffed them into any he could find .     the day was all a mystery to nutt  and it stayed a mystery  becoming a little more mysterious with every passing minute .  in the distance a whistle was blown and somewhere in this moving  jostling  crushing and in most cases drinking mob of people there was a game going on  apparently .  he had to take trev   s word for it .  there were oos and aahs in the distance and the crowd ebbed and flowed in response .  trev and his chums  who called themselves  as far as nutt could make out over the din  the dimwell massive pussy  took advantage of every temporary space to move nearer and nearer to the mysterious game  holding their ground when the press went against them and pushing hard when an eddy went their way .  push  sway  shove   and something in this spoke to nutt .  it came up through the soles of his feet and the palms of his hands  and slid into his brain with a beguiling subtlety  warming him  stripping him away from himself and leaving him no more than a beating part of the living  moving thing around him .   a chant came past .  it had started somewhere at the other end of the game and  whatever it had been once  it was now just four syllables of roar  from hundreds of people and many gallons of beer .  as it faded  it took the warm  belonging feeling away with it  leaving a hole .   nutt looked into the eyes of trev .      happened to you  did it .     trev said .     that was quick .         it was       nutt began .      i know .  we don   t talk about it     said trev flatly .      but it spoke to me without           we don   t talk about it  okay .  not that sort of thing .  look .  they   re being pushed back .  it   s opening up .  let   s shove .      and nutt was good at shoving   very good .  under his inexorable pressure people slid or gently spun out of the way  their hobnailed boots scraping on the stones as  short of an alternative  the owners were rolled and squeezed alongside nutt and trev and deposited behind them  somewhat dizzy  bewildered and angry .   now  though  there was a frantic tugging at nutt   s belt .      stop pushing .     trev shouted .     we   ve left the others behind .         in fact my progress is now hindered by a pease pudding and chowder stand .  i have been doing my best  mister trev  but it has really been slowing me down     said nutt over his shoulder     and also miss glenda .  hello  miss glenda .      trev glanced behind him .  there was a fight going on back there  and he could hear andy   s battle cry .  there was generally a fight going on around andy  and if there wasn   t  he started one .  but you had to like andy  because   well  you just had to .  he   glenda was up ahead .  surely that meant that she would be there too .      there was a commotion further on and a vaguely oblong thing  wrapped now in tatters of cloth  rose up in the air and fell back  to cheers and catcalls from the crowd .  trev had been right up to the game face many times before .  it was no big deal .  he   d seen the ball dozens of times .   but how long had nutt been pushing a pudding stall in front of him like a snowplough .  oh my  trev thought  i   ve found a player .  how can    e do it .  he looks half starved all the time .   in the absence of any way round in the press of people  trev scrambled between nutt   s legs  and for a moment looked down an avenue of coat hems  boots and  right in front of him  a pair of legs that were considerably more attractive than those of nutt .  he surfaced a few inches away from the milky blue eyes of juliet .  she did not look surprised  surprise is an instant thing  and by the time juliet could register surprise  she generally wasn   t .  glenda  on the other hand  was the kind of person who instantly whacks surprise on the meat slab of indignation and hammers it into fury  and as their gazes locked and metaphorical bluebirds cleared their throats for the big number  she appeared between them and demanded     what the hells were you doing down there  trevor likely .      the bluebirds evaporated .      what are you doin    up front here .     said trev .  it wasn   t repartee  but it was the best he could do now  with his heart pounding .      we got shoved     growled glenda .     you lot were shoving us .         me .  i never did .     said trev indignantly .     it was       he hesitated .  nutt .  look at him standing there all nervous and skinny  like he   s never had a good meal in his life .  i wouldn   t believe me  and i am me .     it was them behind     he said lamely .      trolls with big boots on  were they .     said glenda  her voice all vinegar .     we   d be in the game if it wasn   t for mister nutt here  holding you all back .      the unfairness of this took trev aback  but he decided to stay there rather than argue with glenda .  nutt could do no wrong in her eyes  and trev could do no right  which he couldn   t contest  but rather felt should be amended to    never did any serious wrong    .   but there was juliet  smiling at him .  when glenda looked away to talk to nutt she slipped something into his hand and then turned her back on him as if nothing had happened .   trev opened his hand  heart pounding  and there was a little enamel badge in black and white  the colours of the hated enemy .  it was still warm from her hand .   he closed his hand quickly and looked around to see if anyone had spotted this betrayal of all that was good and true  i . e .  the good name of dimwell .  supposing he got knocked down by a troll and one of the lads found it on him .  supposing andy found it on him .   but it was a gift from her .  he put it into his pocket and rammed it down to the bottom .  this was going to be really difficult  and trev was not a man who liked problems in his life .   the owner of the pudding stand  having enterprisingly sold a number of portions to passing trade during its journey  strolled up to trev and offered him a bag of hot pease .      tough mate you got there     he said .     some kind of troll  is he .         not troll .  goblin     said trev  as the sounds of the strife drew nearer .      i thought they were little buggers    .         this one isn   t     said trev  wishing the man would go away .   there was a sudden  localized silence .  the kind of noise made by people who are holding their breath .  he looked up and saw the ball  for the second time in the game .   there was a core of ash wood in there somewhere  then a leather skin and finally dozens of layers of cloth for grip  and it was dropping with pinpoint inevitability towards the beautiful  dreamy head of juliet .  trev dived at her without a moment   s thought  dragging her under the cart as the ball thumped on to the cobbles where she had been gracing the world with her presence .   many things went through trev   s mind as the ball hit the ground .  she was in his arms  even if she was complaining about getting mud on her coat .  he had probably saved her life  which from a romantic point of view was money in the bank  and   oh  yes .  dimmer or dolly  if one of the hardcore posses found out about this the next thing to go through his head would be a boot .   she giggled .      shush .     he managed .     not a good idea if you   d rather not know how you would look with that beautiful hair shaved off .      trev peeped out from under the stall  and attracted no attention at all .   this is because nutt had picked up the ball and was turning it over and over in his hands with a frown on what was visible of  if you were kind  his face .      is this all it is .     he said to a bewildered glenda .     a most inappropriate ending to a pleasant social gathering with interesting canap  s .  where is this wretched thing supposed to be  then .      glenda  hypnotized by the sight  pointed a wavering finger in the general direction of down the street .      there   s a big pole .  painted white   well  spattered with red at the bottom           oh yes  i see it .  well  in that case  i   ll   look  will you men please stop pushing .     nutt added to the crowd  who were craning to see .      but there   s no way you   ll ever get it there .     glenda yelled .     just put it down and come away .      trev heard a grunt from nutt and absolute silence from the rest of the world .  oh  no  he thought .  really no .  it must be more than  what  a hundred and fifty yards to that goal  and those things fly like a bucket .  there is no way that he could     a distant pock broke the breathless silence  which healed itself instantly .   trev peered over a shoulder as the sixty foot goal post gave up its battle with termites  rot  weather  gravity and nutt  and fell into its own base in a cloud of dust .  he was so astonished that he hardly noticed juliet standing up next to him .       is that a kind of  like  sign .     said juliet  who believed in such things .   at that moment  trev believed in pointing a finger towards the other side of the street and shouting     he went that way .     and then hauling juliet upright and butting nutt in the stomach .     let   s go .     he added .  he couldn   t do anything about glenda  but that would not matter  while he held juliet   s hand glenda would follow him like a homing vulture .  people were trying to run towards the hidden goal  others were making for the apparent location of the long distance scorer .  trev pointed in a random direction and yelled     he went down there .  big man with a black hat .     confusion always helped  when it wasn   t yours  when it was time for a hue and cry  make sure who was hue .   they halted a few alleys away .  there was still a commotion far off  but a city crowd is easier to get lost in than a forest .      look  perhaps i should go back and apologize     nutt began .     i could make a new pole quite easily .         i hate to tell you this  gobbo  but i think you might have upset the kind of people who don   t listen to apologies     said trev .     keep moving  everyone .         why might they be upset .         well  mister nutt  first  you are not supposed to score a goal when it is not your game  and anyway you are a watcher  not a player     said glenda .     and second  a shot like that gets right up people   s noses .  you could have killed someone .         no  miss glenda  i assure you i could not .  i deliberately aimed at the pole .         so .  that doesn   t mean you were sure to hit it .         er  i have to say it does  miss glenda     he mumbled .      how did you do it .  you took the pole to bits .  they don   t grow on trees .  you   ll get us all into trouble .         why can   t he be a player .     said juliet  staring at her reflection in a window .      what .     said glenda .      bloody hell     said trev .     with him on the team you wouldn   t need a team .         that   d save a lot of trouble  then     said juliet .      so you say     said glenda     and where would be the fun in that .  that wouldn   t be football any more           we are being watched     said nutt .     i am sorry to interrupt you .      trev glanced around .  the street was busy  but mostly with its own affairs .     there   s no one interested  gobbo .  we   re well away .         i can feel it on my skin     nutt insisted .      what  through all that wool .     said glenda .   he turned round  soulful eyes on her .     yes     he said  and remembered ladyship testing him on that .  it had seemed like a game at the time .   he glanced up and a large head drew back quickly from a parapet .  there was a very faint smell of bananas .  ah  that one .  he was nice .  nutt saw him sometimes  going hand over hand along the pipes .      you ought to get    er home     said trev to glenda .   glenda shuddered .     not a good idea .  old stollop   ll ask her what she saw at the game .         well .         she   ll tell him .  and who she saw           can   t she lie .         not in the way you can  trev .  she   s just no good at making stuff up .  look  let   s get back to the university .  we all work there  and i often go in to catch up .  we   ll go directly now and you two go back the long way .  we never saw one another  right .  and for heavens    sake don   t let him do anything silly .         excuse me  miss glenda     said nutt meekly .      yes  what .         which of us were you addressing .           i have let you down     said nutt  as they strolled through the post match crowds .  at least  trev ambled  nutt moved with a strange gait that suggested there was something wrong with his pelvis .      nah  it   s fixable     said trev .     everything is fixable .  i   m a fixer  me .  what did anybody really see .  just a bloke in dimmer kit .  there   s thousands of us .  don   t worry .  er  how come you   re so tough  gobbo .  you spent your life lifting weights  or what .         you are correct in your surmise  mister trev .  before i was born i did indeed use to lift weights .  i was only a child then  of course .      they strolled on and after a while trev said     could you say that again .  it   s got stuck in my head .  actually  i think part of it   s stickin    out of my ear .         ah  yes .  perhaps i have confused you .  there was a time when my mind was full of darkness .  then brother oats helped me to the light  and i was born .         oh  religion stuff .         but here i am .  you asked why i am strong .  when i lived in the dark of the forge  i used to lift weights .  the tongs at first  and then the little hammer and then the biggest hammer  and then one day i could lift the anvil .  that was a good day .  it was a little freedom .         why was it so important to lift the anvil .         i was chained to the anvil .      they walked on in silence again until trev  picking each word with care  said     i guess things must be sort of tough in the high country .         it is not so bad now  i think .         makes you count your blessin   s  that sort of thing .         the presence of a certain lady  mister trev .         yes  since you ask .  i think about    er all the time .  i really like    er .  but she   s a dolly .     a small group of supporters turned to glance at them  and he lowered his voice to a hiss .     she   s got brothers with fists the size of a bull   s arse .         i have read  mister trev  that love laughs at locksmiths .         really .  and what does it do when it   s been smacked in the face by a bull   s arse .         the poets are not forthcoming in that respect  mister trev .         besides     said trev     locksmiths tend to be quiet blokes  you know .  careful and patient and that .  like you .  i reckon you could get away with a bit of a joke .  you must    ave met girls .  i mean  you   re no oil painting  that   s a fact  but they like a posh voice .  i bet you    ad them eatin    out of your    and   well  after you   d washed it  obviously .      nutt hesitated .  there had been ladyship  of course  and miss healstether  neither of whom fitted easily into the category of    girl    .  of course  there were the little sisters  who were certainly young and apparently female but it had to be said looked rather like intelligent chickens  and certainly weren   t seen at their best when you watched them feeding   but once again     girls    did not seem the right word .      i have not met many girls     he volunteered .      there   s glenda .  she   s taken a real shine to you .  watch out  though  she   ll run your life for you if you let her .  it   s what she does .  she does it to everyone .         you two have a history  i think     said nutt .      you are a sharp one  aren   t you .  quiet and sharp .  like a knife .  yeah  i suppose it was a history .  i wanted it to be more of a geography  but she kept slappin    my hand .     trev paused to search for any flicker in nutt   s face .     that was a joke     he added  without much hope .      thank you for telling me  mister trev .  i will decipher it later .      trev sighed .     but i ain   t like that any more  and juliet   well  i   d crawl a mile over broken glass just to hold    er    and  no funny business .         writing a poem is often the way to the intended   s heart     said nutt .   trev brightened .     ah  i   m good with words .  if i wrote    er a letter  you could give it to    er  right .  if i write it on posh paper  something like  let   s see      i think you are really fit .  how about a date .  no hanky panky  promise .  luv  trev .     how does that sound .         the soul of it is pure and noble  mister trev .  but  ah  if i could assist in some way    .         it needs longer words  right .  and more sort of curly language .     said trev .   but nutt was not paying attention .      sounds lovely to me     said a voice above trev   s head .     who do you know what can read  smart boy .      there was this to be said about the stollop brothers  they weren   t andy .  it was  in the great scheme of things  not a huge difference when you couldn   t see for blood but  in short  stollops knew that force had always worked  and so had never bothered to try anything else  whereas andy was a stone cold psychopath who had a following only because it was safer than being in front of him .  he could be quite charming when the frantically oscillating mood swing took him  that was the best time to run .  as for the stollops  it would not take long for a researcher to realize that juliet was the brains of the family outfit .  one advantage from trev   s viewpoint was that they thought they were clever  because no one had ever told them otherwise .      ha  mister so called trev     said billy stollop  prodding trev with a finger like a hippopotamus sausage .     you full o    smarts  you tell us who broke the goal  right .         i was in the shove  billy .  didn   t see a thing .         he gonna play for the dimmers .     billy persisted .      billy  not even your dad at his best could throw the ball half as far as everyone is saying .  you know it  right .  you couldn   t do it .  i   m hearing that the angels    post just fell apart and someone made up a story .  would i lie to you  billy .     trev could make up lies that were very nearly truths .      yeah     cos you   re a dimmer .         all right  you got me  i   ll come clean     said trev  holding out his hands .     respect and all that  billy   it was nutt here that threw that ball .  that   s my last offer .         i ought to smack your    ead off for that     said billy  sneering at nutt .     that kid don   t look like he could even lift the ball .      and then a voice behind trev said     why  billy  have they let you out without your collar on .      nutt heard trev mutter     oh gods  and i was doing so well     under his breath  and then his friend turned and said     it   s a free street  andy .  no    arm in passin    the time  eh .         the dollies killed your ol    man  trev .  ain   t you got no shame .      the rest of the massive posse was standing behind andy  their expressions a mix of defiance and the realization that  once again  they were going to be dragged into something .  they were out in the main streets now .  the watch was not inclined to get involved in alley scuffles  but out in the open they had to do something in case the taxpayers complained  and since tired coppers didn   t like having to do something  they did it good and hard  so with any luck they wouldn   t have to do it again any time soon .      what do you know about all this they   re saying about a dimmer man and a dolly tart holding hands in the shove .     andy demanded .  he put a heavy hand on trev   s shoulder .     come on  you   re smart  you always know everything before anyone else .         tart .     that was billy  it was a long way from his ears to his brain .     there   s not a girl in dolly sisters who   d look at you poxy lot .         ah  so that   s where we got it from .     said carter the farter .  this struck nutt as inflammatory in the circumstances .  perhaps  he thought  the ritual is that childish insults shall be exchanged until both sides feel fully justified in attacking  just as dr vonmausberger noted in ritual aggression in pubescent rats .   but andy had fished his short cutlass out of his shirt .  it was a nasty little weapon  alien to the true spirit of foot the ball  which generally smiled indulgently on things that bruised  scared  fractured and  okay  worst case  heat of the moment and so on  blinded .   but then came andy  who had issues .  and once you had someone like andy around you  you got other andys around too  and every kid who might otherwise have gone to a match with a pair of brass knuckles for bravado noticeably clanked when he walked  and needed to be helped up if he fell over .   now  weapons were being loosened here  too .      careful now  everyone     trev cautioned  stepping back and waving his empty hands in a conciliatory way .     this is a busy street  okay .  if the old sam catch you fightin     they   ll be down on you with big  big truncheons and they   ll beat you until you    onk your breakfast     cos for why .     cos they hate you     cos you   re making paperwork for    em and keepin       em out of the doughnut shop .      he stepped back a little further .     and then on account of you damagin    their weapons with your    eads they   ll run you down to the tanty for a nice night in the tank .  been there .  was it so much fun you want to go back again .      he noted with satisfaction the looks of dismayed recollection on the faces of all except nutt  who couldn   t have any idea  and andy  who was brother to the tank .  but even andy was not inclined to go up against the sam .  kill just one of them  and vetinari would give you one chance to see if you could stand on air .   they relaxed a little  but not too much .  all it took in these sphincter taut circumstances was one idiot     as it happened  one very clever person was able to do the job  when nutt turned to algernon  the youngest stollop  and said cheerfully     do you know  sir  that your situation here is very similar to that described by vonmausberger in his treatise on his experiment with rats .      at this point  algernon  after one second of what passed for algernon as thought  whacked him hard with his club .  algernon was a big boy .   trev managed to grab his friend before he hit the cobbles .  the club had hit nutt square in the chest and torn the ancient sweater open .  blood was soaking through the stitches .      what did you    ave to go and    it him for  you bloody fool .     trev said to algernon  agreed even by his brothers to be as thick as elephant soup .     he wasn   t doin    a thing .  what was that all about  eh .     he sprang to his feet and before algernon could move trev had ripped his own shirt off and was ministering to nutt  trying to staunch the wound .  he came back up again after half a minute and flung the sodden shirt at algernon .     there   s no heartbeat  you moron .  what did he ever do to you .      even andy was frozen .  no one had ever seen trev like it  not old trev .  even the dollies knew trev was smart .  trev was slick .  trev wasn   t the sort to commit suicide by yelling at a bunch of men who were already tensed for a fight .   the luckless algernon  with trev   s rage baking his face  managed     but  like   he   s a dimmer           who are yer .  you   re a bloody fool  that   s what you are .     screamed trev .   he rounded on the others  finger shaking .     who are yer .  who are yer .  nuffin .  you   re rubbish .  you   re all shite .      he jabbed the finger at nutt .     and him .  he made stuff .  he knew things .  and he   d never seen a game before today .  he was only wearing the strip to fit in .         don   t you worry  trev  mate     andy hissed and raised his cutlass menacingly .     there   s going to be a bloody war about this .     but trev was suddenly in his face like a wasp .      you what .  you are mental .  you just don   t get it  do you .         i can see helmets  andy     said jumbo urgently .      me .  what did i do .         as much as the stupid stollops .  dimmers and dollies .  i hope the gods shit thin shit on both of you .         they   re getting really close  andy .      the stollop boys  who were not altogether dumb  were already leaving .  people in football strip were criss crossing the city .  the watch couldn   t chase everyone .  but  well  belting some bloke who then bled a lot and stopped breathing  well  that was tantamount to murder  and the old sam could develop quite a turn of speed in those circumstances .   andy shook a furious finger at trev .     it   s a hard life in the shove when you   re a dumb chuff with no mates .         this ain   t the shove .         better wake up  kid .  it   s all shove .      the posse left at speed  although jumbo turned for a moment to mouth    sorry    .  they weren   t the only ones hurrying off .  the street people were all for a free cabaret  but this one might have associated difficulties  for example the asking of dangerous metaphysical questions such as    did you see anything .     and similar .  it was all very well for the watch to say    the innocent have nothing to fear     but what was that all about .  who cared about the innocent and their problems when the watch were on their way .   trev knelt by the cooling body of the late nutt .   and now for the first time in a minute  it seemed to trev  he started to breathe again .  he had stopped when he had raged at andy    cos if you talked like that to andy you were dead anyway  so why waste your breath .   there were things you had to do  weren   t there .  weren   t you supposed to keep banging on the chest to  like  show the broken heart how to beat again .  but he didn   t know how  and you didn   t need much smarts to know that it was not a good idea to try to learn with the watch on the way .  it would not give a good first impression .   that was why  when two watchmen turned up at speed  trev was walking unsteadily towards them with nutt in his arms .  he was relieved to see that in charge was constable haddock  at least he was one of the ones who asked questions first .  behind him  and eclipsing most of the scenery  was troll officer bluejohn  who could clear a whole street just by walking down the centre of it .      can you help me get him to the lady sybil  mister haddock .  he   s very heavy     said trev .   constable haddock pulled the sodden shirt aside  and made a sad little clicking sound .  with experience comes familiarity .      morgue   s closer  lad .         no .      haddock nodded .     you   re dave likely   s son  aren   t you .         i don   t have to tell you .         no     cos i   m right     said constable haddock evenly .     okay  trev .  bluejohn here will take this man  who i expect you have never seen before in your life  and we   ll both run to keep up .  there was a decent thunderstorm the night before last .  he might be lucky .  and so might you .         i never did it .             course not .  and now   let   s see who   s fastest at running  shall we .  the hospital first .         i want to stay with him     said trev  as bluejohn   s huge hand gently cradled nutt .      no  lad     said haddock .     you stay with me .        it didn   t stop with constable haddock .  it never did .  everyone called him kipper  and his calm unspoken message that since we   re all in this together  why make it hard for one another often worked  but sooner or later you   d be handed over to a senior copper who manufactured hard  in a little room with another copper at the door .  and this one had been working double shifts  by the look of her .      i   m sergeant angua  sir  and i hope you are not in trouble .     she opened a notebook and smoothed down the page .      shall we go through the motions .  you told constable haddock that you saw a fight going on and when you got there all the big boys had run away and  amazingly  you found your workmate  mister nutts  bleeding to death .  well  i bet i can name all the big boys  every last one of them .  i wonder why can   t you .  and what  trevor likely  is this about .     she flicked a black and white enamel token across the table  and by luck or judgement its pin stuck in the wood a few inches from trev   s hand .     the unofficial motto of the lady sybil free hospital was    not everybody dies    .  it was true that  subsequent to the founding of the lady sybil  the chances of death from at least some causes in the city were quite amazingly reduced .  its surgeons were even known to wash their hands before operating as well as after .  but moving through its white corridors now was a figure who knew  from personal experience  that the unofficial motto was  in reality  entirely mistaken .   death stood by the well scrubbed slab and looked down .  mister nutt .  well  this is a surprise  said death  reaching into his robe .  let me see what i have here .   you know  he said  i used to wonder why people scrabbled so .  after all  compared with the length of infinity  people do not live any time at all .  even you  mister nutt .  although i can see that scrabbling would work a little magic in your case .      i can   t see you     said nutt .   just as well  said death .  you will not remember me  in any case  later on .      i   m dying  then     said nutt .      yes .  dying and then again living .  he fished out a life timer from his robe and watched as the sand fell upwards .  see you later  mister nutt .  i fear that you will have an interesting life .        a dolly favour on a good dimmer boy .  gods bless my soul  i say  what can this be about .  and you know what .  i will find out .  it   s all a matter of shoving .      trev said nothing .  he was out of options .  besides  he had seen the sergeant before  and she always seemed to be looking at his throat .      constable haddock tells me the igor   s on duty down at the lady sybil .  i hope he   s got a heart in his vats that   ll fit your friend  i really do     she said .     but it   ll still be a murder case  even if he comes walking in here tomorrow .  lord vetinari   s rules  if it takes an igor to bring you back  you were dead .  briefly dead  it   s true  which is why the murderer will be briefly hanged .  a quarter of a second usually does it .         i didn   t touch    im .         i know .  but you have to keep solid with your mates  right .  jumbo and  of course  carter  and  oh yes  andy shank  your mates  who aren   t here .  look  you are not under arrest   yet   you are helping the watch with their inquiries .  that means you can use the privy  if you   re feeling brave .  if you   re feeling suicidal  use the canteen .  but if you try to run off i will hunt you down .     she sniffed and added     like a dog .  understand .         can   t i go and see how nutt is gettin    on .         no .  kipper   s still down there now .  that   s constable haddock to you .         everyone calls him kipper .         maybe  but not when it   s you talking to me .     the sergeant twirled the favour around on the table in an absent minded way .     has mister nutt got any next of kin .  that means relatives .         i know what it means .  he talks about people in uberwald .  that   s all i know     trev lied instinctively .  saying that someone had spent his youth chained to an anvil was not going to help here .     he gets on all right with the other guys in the vats .         how come he   s in there .         we never ask .  there   s usually some bad story .         anyone ever ask you .      he stared at her .  that was coppers for you .  they came over all friendly  and just when you dropped your guard they stuck a pickaxe in your brain .      was that an official copper question  or were you just bein    nosy .         coppers are never nosy  mister likely .  however  sometimes we ask tangential questions .         so it wasn   t official .         not really           then shove it where the sun does not shine .      sergant angua smiled a copper   s smile .     you   ve got no card in your hand that you dare play  and you come out with something like that .  from andy  yes  i   d expect it  but kipper says you   re smart .  how smart does someone have to be to be as stupid as you .      there was a tentative knock at the door and then a watchman put his head around it .  someone was shouting in the background in a large  authoritative voice .        i mean  you deal with this sort of thing all the time  don   t you .  for heavens    sake  it   s not that hard           yes  nobby .         we   ve got a bit of a situation  sarge .  that stiff that went to the lady sibyl .  doctor lawn   s here and he says the man   s got up and gone home .         did they get an igor to look at him .         yes .  sort of   er        the watchman was elbowed out of the way by an expansive man in a long green rubber robe who was clearly trying to balance angry and friendly at the same time .  he was tailed by constable haddock  who was clearly trying to mollify him  and definitely failing .      look  we try to help  all right .     said doctor lawn .     you people say you   ve got a murder case and i   ll pull old igor off his slab and hang the overtime .  but you tell sam vimes from me that i   d like him to send his boys down when they   re not busy for a bit of first aid tuition  to wit  the difference between dead and sleeping .  it   s a fine line sometimes  but it   s generally possible to spot the clues .  the profession has always tended to consider walking about to be among the more reliable  although in this city we   ve learned to look on that as just a very good start .  but when we pulled back the sheet he sat up and asked igor if he had a sandwich  which is generally conclusive .  apart from a fever  he was fine .  strong heartbeat  which suggests he   s got one .  not a scratch on him  but he could certainly do with a good dinner .  he must have been hungry because he ate the sandwich igor made for him .  on the subject of dinners  frankly i could do with mine .         you let him go .     said sergeant angua  horrified .      of course .  i can   t keep a man in hospital for being inconveniently alive .      she turned to constable haddock .     and you let him go  kipper .         it looked like a case of doctor   s orders  sarge     said haddock  giving trev a wretched look .      he was covered in blood .  he was really messed up .     trev exploded .      a prank  then .     angua tried .      i   d have sworn there wasn   t a heartbeat  sergeant     haddock volunteered .     maybe he   s one of those monks from the hub that do the hocus pocus stuff .         then someone has been wasting watch time     said angua  glaring at trev .   he spotted that one for the desperate throw it was .     what would be in it for me .     he said .     do you think i want to be here .      constable haddock cleared his throat .     it   s match night  sarge .  the desk is heaving and there are supporters roaming around all over the place and someone   s been feeding them a lot of rumours .  we   re stretched  that   s all i   m saying .  we   ve had a couple of big shouts already .  and he did walk away  after all .         not a problem for me     said the doctor .     came in horizontal  went out upright .  it   s the preferred way .  and i   ve got to get back  sergeant .  we   re going to have a busy night  too .      the sergeant looked for someone to shout at  and there was trev .      you .  trev likely .  this one   s down to you .  go and find your chum .  and if there   s any more trouble  there   ll be   trouble .  is that clear .         twice  sarge .     he couldn   t resist it  he just couldn   t  not even with the cold sweat rolling down his spine .  but he felt light   uplifted   released .  but some people just can   t respect an epiphany when you   re having one .  it   s not a cop skill .      it   s sergeant to you  likely .  here .      trev managed to catch the favour as it was skimmed across the room .      thanks  sarge .         get out .      he got out  and was half expecting the shadowy shape that stepped up to him when he was clear of the building .  there was a faint odour in the grey air .  well  at least it wasn   t andy .  he could do without andy right now .      yes  carter .     he said to the fog .      how did you know it was me .      trev sighed .     i guessed .     he started to walk fast .      andy   ll want to know what you said .         don   t worry  it   s sorted .         sorted .  how .     carter  always a bit overweight  had to scurry to keep up .      not going to tell you .     oh  the joy of the moment .      but can i tell him we   re in the clear .         it   s all sorted .  done and dusted .  i blew it out .  it   s fixed .  all gone away .  it never happened .         are you sure .     said carter .     he was pretty busted up .         hey  what can i tell you .     trev flung out his arms and twirled a pirouette .     i   m trev likely .         well  that   s firm  then .  hey  i bet andy   ll let you back in the posse now .  that would be great  eh .         do you know what nutt thought the posse was called  carter .         no .  what .      trev told him .      well  that   s       carter began  but trev interrupted .      it   s funny  carter .  it   s funny  and sort of sad and hopeless .  it really is .     trev stopped walking so abruptly that carter collided with him .     and here   s a tip  carter the farter isn   t gonna take you anywhere .  and that goes for the fartmeister  too .  trust me .         but everybody calls me carter the farter     the fartmeister wailed .      punch the next one who does .  see a doctor .  cut down on carbohydrates .  keep out of confined spaces .  use aftershave     said trev  speeding up again .      where are you going  trev .         i   m gettin    out of the shove .     trev called over his shoulder .   carter looked around desperately .     what shove .         haven   t you heard .  it   s all shove .        trev wondered if he glowed as he trotted through the fog .  things were going to be different .  as soon as smeems got in  he   d go and see him about a better job or something     a figure appeared out of the mist ahead of him .  this was something of an achievement since the figure was a head shorter than him .      mithter likely .     it said .      who   s askin    .     said trev and added     what   s askin    .      the figure sighed .     i underthtand that you are a friend of the gentleman rethently admitted to the hothpital     it said .      what   s that to you .         quite a lot     said the figure .     may i athk if you know very much about the gentleman .         i don   t have to talk to you     said trev .     everything   s been fixed  okay .         would that thith wath the cathe     said the figure .     i have to talk to you .  my name ith igor .         you know  i had a feelin    about that .  are you the one who made the sandwich for nutt .     asked trev .      yeth .  tuna  thpaghetti and jam  with thprinkleth .  my thignature dith .  do you know anything about hith background .         not a thing  mister .         really .         look .  in the vats you stir up tallow  not the past  okay .  you just don   t  right .  i know he   s had some bad times  an    that   s all i   m telling you .         i thought tho     said igor .     i believe he cometh from uberwald .  thome thtrange and dangerouth thingth come from uberwald .         this might sound a stupid question  but do you come from uberwald  by any chance .     said trev .      thinth you athk  yeth     said igor .   trev hesitated .  you saw igors around occasionally .  the only thing most people knew was that they could stitch you up even better than the watch and did strange things in cellars and only tended to come out much when there were thunderstorms .      i think your friend may be very dangerouth     said igor .   trev tried to picture nutt as dangerous .  it was quite hard until you remembered a throw that knocked down a whole goal post half a street away .  he wished he didn   t .      why should i listen to you .  how do i know you are not dangerous .     he said .      oh  i am     said igor     believe me .  and uberwald containth thingth that i would not want to meet .         i am not gonna listen to you     said trev .     and you are pretty hard to understand in any case .         ith he thubject to thtrange moodth .     igor ploughed on .     doth he get into a rage .  do you know anything about hith eating habitth .         yes  he likes apple pies     said trev .     what   re you on about .         i can thee you are great friendth     said igor .     i am thorry that i have trethpathed on your time .        trethpathed    hanging in the air considerably added to the water drops hanging in the fog .     i will give you thome advith .  when you need me  jutht thcream .  i regret that you will find it very eathy to thcream .     the figure turned and instantly vanished into the mist .   and igors moved about oddly  trev remembered .  and you never saw one at a football game     he noticed that last thought go past .  what had he tried to tell himself .  that someone who did not watch football was not a real person .  he couldn   t think of a proper answer .  he was amazed that he had even asked the question .  things were changing .     glenda arrived in the night kitchen with juliet sworn to silence  and beneficently gave mildred and mrs hedges the rest of the night off .  that suited them both very well  as it always does  and a little favour had been done there that she could call upon when necessary .   she took her coat off and rolled up her sleeves .  she felt at home in the night kitchen  in charge  in control .  behind black iron ranges she could defy the world .      all right     she said to the subdued juliet .     we weren   t there today .  today did not happen .  you were here helping me clean the ovens .  i   ll see you get some overtime so your dad won   t suspect .  okay .  have you got that .         yes  glenda .         and while we   re here we   ll make a start on the pies for tomorrow night .  it   ll be nice to get ahead of ourselves  right .      juliet said nothing .      say    yes  glenda        glenda prompted .      yes  glenda .         go and chop some pork  then .  being busy takes your mind off things  that   s what i always say .         yes  glenda  that   s what you always say     said juliet .   an inflection caught glenda   s ear  and worried her a little .     do i always say that .  when .         every day when you come in and put your apron on  glenda .         mother used to say that     said glenda  and tried to shake the thought out of her head .     and she was right  of course .  hard work never hurt anybody .     and she tried to unthink the treacherous thought  except her .  pies  she thought .  you can rely on pies .  pies don   t give you grief .      i fink that trev likes me     juliet muttered .     he don   t give me funny looks like the other boys .  he looks like a little puppy .         you want to watch out for that look  my girl .         i fink i luvim  glendy .      wild boar  thought glenda  and apricots .  there   s some left in the cool room .  and we   ve got mutton pies with a choice of tracklements   always popular .  so   pork pies  i think  and there   s some decent oysters in the pump room  so they   ll do for the wet pie .  i   ll do sea pie and the anchovies look good  so there   s always room for a stargazey or two  even though i feel sorry for the little fishes  but right now i   ll bake some blind pastries so that      what did you say .         i luvim .         you can   t .         he saved my life .         that   s no basis for a relationship .  a polite thank you would have sufficed .         i   ve got a feelin    about him .         that   s just silly .         well .  silly   s not bad  is it .         now you listen to me  young   oh  hello  mister ottomy .      it is in the way of the ottomies all around the worlds to look as if they have been built out of the worst parts of two men and to be annoyingly hushen footed on thick red rubber soles  all the better to peep and pry .  and they always assume that a free cup of tea is theirs by right .      what a day  miss  what a day .  were you at the match .     he enquired  glancing from glenda to juliet .      been cleaning the ovens     said glenda briskly .      yes  today didn   t happen     juliet added  and giggled .  glenda hated giggling .   ottomy looked around slowly and without embarrassment  noting the absence of dirt  discarded gloves  cloths        and we   ve only just finished getting everything all neat and tidy     glenda snarled .     would you like a cup of tea  mister ottomy .  and then you can tell us all about the game .      it has been said that crowds are stupid  but mostly they are simply confused  since as an eyewitness the average person is as reliable as a meringue lifejacket .  it became obvious  as ottomy went on  that nobody had any clear idea about anything other than that some bloke threw a goal from halfway down the street  and even then only maybe .      but  funny thing     ottomy went on  as glenda metaphorically let out a breath     while we was in the shove  i could   ve sworn i saw your lovely assistant here chatting to a lad in the dimmer strip           no law against that .     glenda said .     anyway  she was here  cleaning the ovens .     it was clumsy  but she hated people like him  who lived for the exercise of third hand authority and loved every little bit of power they could grab .  he   d seen more than he   d told her  that was certain  and wanted her to wriggle .  and out of the corner of her mind  she could feel him looking at their coats .  their wet coats .      i thought you didn   t go to the football  mister ottomy .         ah  well  there you have it .  the pointies wanted to go and watch a game  and me and mister nobbs had to go with them in case they got breathed on by ordinary people .  blimey  you wouldn   t believe it .  tutting and complaining and taking notes  like they owned the street .  they   re up to something  you mark my words .      glenda didn   t like the word    pointies     although it was a good description .  coming from ottomy  though  it was an invitation to greasy conspiracy .  but however you baked it  wizards were nobs  people who mattered  the movers and the shakers  and when people like that got interested in the doings of people who by definition did not matter  little people were about to be shaken  and shook .      vetinari doesn   t like football     she said .      well  o   course  they   re all in it together     said ottomy  tapping his nose .  this caused a small lump of dried matter to shoot from his other nostril into his tea .  glenda had a brief struggle with her conscience over whether to point this out  but won .      i thought you should know this  on account of how people up in the sisters look up to you     said ottomy .     i remember your mum .  she was a saint  that woman .  always had a helping hand for everyone .     yes  and didn   t they grab  said glenda to herself .  she was lucky to die with all her fingers .   ottomy drained his mug and plonked it on the table with a sigh .     can   t stand around here all day  eh .         yes  i   m sure you   ve got lots of other places to stand .      ottomy paused at the entrance arch  and turned to grin at juliet .      a girl the spit and image of you  i   d swear it .  with a dimmer boy .  amazing .  you must have one of those double gangers .  well  it   ll have to remain a mystery  as the man said when he found something that would have to remain a mystery .  toodle oo        he stopped dead rather than walk into the silvery knife that glenda was holding in a not totally threatening way quite close to his throat .  she had the satisfaction of seeing his adam   s apple pop back up and down again like a sick yoyo .      sorry about that     she said  lowering it .     i   ve always got a knife in my hand these days .  we   ve been doing the pork .  very much like human flesh  pork  or so they say .     she put her spare hand across his shoulders and said     probably not a good idea  spreading silly rumours  mister ottomy .  you know how people can be so funny about that sort of thing .  nice of you to drop by and if you happen to be going past tomorrow i   ll see that you get a pie .  do excuse us .  i have a lot of chopping up to do .      he left at speed .  glenda  her heart pounding  looked at juliet  her mouth made a perfect o .      what .  what .         i fort you was goin    to stab    im .         i just happened to be holding a knife .  you are holding a knife .  we hold knives .  this is a kitchen .         d   you fink he   s goin    to tell .         he doesn   t really know anything .     eight inches  she thought .  that   s as big as you can make a pie without a dish .  how many pies could i make out of a weasel like ottomy .  the big mincer would make it easy .  ribcages and skulls must be a problem  though .  probably better  on the whole  to stick to pork .   but the thought blazed away at the back of her mind  never to become action but unfamiliar  exciting and oddly liberating .   what were the wizards doing at the game .  making notes about what .  a puzzle to think about .   in the meantime  they were in a world of pies .  juliet could work quite well at repetitive jobs when she put her mind to it  and she had a meticulousness often found in people who were not very clever .  occasionally she sniffed  not a good thing when you are making pie filling .  she was probably thinking about trev  and pasting him  in her beautiful and not very overcrowded head  into one of those glittery dreams sold by bu bubble and other junk  where all you had to do to be famous was just    be yourself    .  ha .  while glenda had always known what she wanted .  she worked long  poorly paid hours to get it  and here it was  her own kitchen  and power  more or less   over pies .  a moment ago you were daydreaming of turning a man into pies .   why are you so angry all the time .  what went wrong .  i   ll tell you what went wrong .  when you got there  there was no there there .  you wanted to see quirm from an open carriage while a nice young man drank champagne out of your slipper  but you never did  because they were a funny lot in quirm  and you couldn   t trust the water  and how did that champagne thing work  anyway .  didn   t it drip out .  what would happen if your toe trouble played up again    .  so you never did .  never will .      i never said trev   s a bad lad     she said aloud .     not a gentleman  needs a slap to teach him manners and he takes life a good deal too easily  but he could make something of himself if he had reason to put his mind to it .      juliet did not seem to be listening  but you never could tell .      it   s just the football .  you   re on different sides .  it won   t work     glenda finished .      s   posing i went and supported the dimmers .      a day ago that would have sounded like some kind of sacrilege  now it just presented a huge problem .      for a start  your dad wouldn   t speak to you ever again .  or your brothers .         they don   t now  much  anyway  except to ask when their grub is goin    to be ready .  d   you know  today was the first time i ever saw the ball up close .  and you know what .  it weren   t worth it .  hey  and they   re goin    to have a fashion show on at shatta tomorrow .  why don   t we go .         never heard of it     glenda snorted .      it   s a dwarf store .         that sounds right .  i can   t imagine humans naming anything like that .  you   d be hostage to the first misprint .         we could go .  might be fun .     juliet waved a tattered copy of bu bubble .     and the new micromails are going to be really good and soft  and don   t chafe  it says here  plus  horned helmets are making a return after too long in obs   curi   tea .  where   s that .  and there   s this mat   in   a tomorrow .         yes  but we   re not the kind of women who go to fashion shows  jules .         you   re not .  why am i not .         well  because   well  i wouldn   t know what to wear .     glenda was getting desperate now .      that   s why you should go to fashion shows     said juliet smugly .   glenda opened her mouth to snap a reply  and thought  it   s not about boys and it   s not about football .  it   s safe .      all right .  i suppose it might be fun .  look  we   ve done a woman   s job this evening .  i   ll take you home now and do my chores and come back .  your dad might be worrying .         he   ll be in the pub     said juliet accurately .      well  he would be worrying if he wasn   t     said glenda .   she wanted some time to herself with her feet up .  it hadn   t just been a long day  it had been a long and deep one as well .  she needed some time for things to settle .      and we   ll take a chair  how about that .         they   re very expensive .         well  you   re only young once  that   s what i say .         i never heard you say that before .      several troll chairs were waiting outside the university .  they were expensive at fivepence for the ride  but the seats in panniers round the carrier   s neck were much more comfy than the slats on the buses .  of course  it was posh  and curtains twitched and lips pursed .  that was the strange thing about the street  if you were born there  people didn   t like it if you started not to fit in .  granny had called it    getting ideas above your station    .  it was letting the side up .   she opened juliet   s door for her because the girl always fumbled with the lock  and watched it shut .   only then did she open her own front door  which was as patched and peeling as the other one .  she   d hardly taken her coat off when there was a hammering on the weatherbeaten woodwork .  she flung it open to find mr stollop  juliet   s father  one fist still raised and a little cloud of powdered paint flecks settling around him .      heard you come in  glendy     he said .     what   s this all about .      his other huge hand rose  holding a crisp off white envelope .  you didn   t see many of these in dolly sisters .      it   s called a letter     said glenda .   the man held it out imploringly and now she noticed the large letter v on the dreaded government stamp  guaranteed to spread fear and despondency among those with taxes yet to pay .      it   s his lordship writing to me .     said mr stollop in distress .     why   d he want to go and write to me .  i haven   t done nothing .         have you thought about opening it .     said glenda .     that   s generally how we find out what   s in letters .      there was another of those imploring looks .  in dolly sisters reading and writing was soft indoor work that was best left to the women .  real work required broad backs  strong arms and calloused hands .  mr stollop absolutely fitted the bill .  he was captain of the dollies and in one match had bitten an ear off three men .  she sighed and took the letter from a hand which she noticed was slightly trembling and slit it open with her thumbnail .      it says here  mister stollop     she said  and the man winced .     yes .  that would be you     glenda added .      is there anything about taxes or anything .     he said .      not that i can see .  he writes that    i would greatly appreciate your company at a dinner i am proposing to hold at unseen university at eight o   clock wednesday evening to discuss the future of the famous game foot the ball .  i will be pleased to welcome you as the captain of the dolly sisters team .            why has he picked on me .     stollop demanded .      he says     said glenda     because you   re the captain .         yes  but why me .         maybe he   s invited all the team captains     glenda volunteered .     you could send a lad round with a white scarf and check  couldn   t you .         yeah  but supposing it   s just me     said stollop again  determined to plumb the horror to its depths .   glenda had a bright idea .     well then  mister stollop  it would look like the captain of the dolly sisters is the only one important enough to discuss the future of football with the ruler himself .      stollop didn   t square his shoulders because he wore them permanently squared  but with a muscular nudge he managed to achieve the effect of cubed .     hah  he   s got that one right .     he roared .   glenda sighed inwardly .  the man was strong  but his muscles were melting into fat .  she knew his knees hurt .  she knew he got out of breath rather quickly these days and in the presence of something he couldn   t bully  punch or kick  mr stollop was entirely at a loss .  down by his sides his hands flexed and unflexed themselves as they tried to do his thinking for him .      what   s this all about .         i don   t know  mister stollop .      he shifted his weight .     er  would it be about that dimmer boy that got himself hurt today  d   you think .      could be anyone  thought glenda as cold dread blossomed .  it   s not as though it doesn   t happen every week .  it doesn   t have to be either of them .  it will be  of course  i know it  but i don   t know it  can   t possibly know it  and if i repeat that long enough it might all never have happened .   got himself hurt  thought glenda in the roar of panic .  that quite likely means he happened to be standing in the wrong place in the wrong strip  which is tantamount to a self inflicted wound .  he got himself killed .      my lads came in and said it was out in the street .  that   s what they just heard .  he got killed  that   s what they heard .         they didn   t see anything .         that   s right  they didn   t see a thing .         but they were doing a lot of listening .      that one went over stollop   s head without even bothering to climb .      and it was a dimmer boy .         yes     he said .     they heard he died  but you know how those dimwell buggers lie .         where are your boys now .      for a moment the old man   s eyes blazed .     they   re stoppin    indoors or i   ll thrash    em .  you get some nasty gangs out when something like that   s been happening .         one less now  then     said glenda .   stollop   s face was painted in pigments of misery and dread .     they   re not bad boys  you know .  not at heart .  people pick on them .      yes  down at the watch house  she said to herself  where people say     that   s them .  the big ones .  i   d know them anywhere .      she left him shaking his head and ran down the road .  the troll would never expect to get a fare up here and there was no sense in hanging around and getting covered in paint .  she might just about be able to catch up with it on its way down town .  after a minute or two she realized that someone was following her .  chasing her in the gloom .  if only she   d remembered to bring the knife .  she stepped into a patch of deeper shadow and  as the knife wielding maniac drew level  stepped out and shouted     stop following me .      juliet gave a little scream .     they   ve got trev     she sobbed  as glenda held her .     i know they have .         don   t be silly     said glenda .     there   s fighting all the time after a big match .  no sense in getting too worried .         so why were you running .     said juliet sharply .  and there was no answer to that .     the bledlow nodded him through the staff door with a grunt and he headed straight away for the vats .  a couple of the lads were dribbling in their meticulous and very slow way  but there was no sign of nutt until trev risked his sanity and nasal passages by checking the communal sleeping area  where he found nutt sleeping on his bedroll  clutching his stomach .  it was an extremely large stomach .  given the usual neat shape of nutt  it made him look a little like a snake that had swallowed an extremely large goat .  the curious face of the igor and his worried voice came back to him .  he looked down beside the bedroll and saw a small piece of piecrust and some crumbs .  it smelled like a very good pie .  in fact  he could think of only one person who could ever make a pie quite so beguiling .  whatever it was that had been filling trev  the invisible illumination that had made him almost dance here from the watch house  drained out through his feet .   he headed through the stone corridors to the night kitchen .  any optimism he might have retained was dashed one hope at a time by the trail of pie crumbs  but the illumination rose again as he saw juliet and  oh yes  glenda  standing in what was left of the night kitchen  which was a mess of torn open cupboards and pieces of piecrust .      oh  mister trevor likely     said glenda  folding her arms .     just one question  who ate all the pies .      the illumination swelled until it filled trev with a kind of silvery light .  it had been three nights since he had slept in an actual bed and it had not been your normal sort of day .  he smiled broadly at nothing at all and was caught by juliet as he hit the ground .     trev woke up half an hour later  when glenda brought him a cup of tea .     i thought we   d better let you sleep     she said .     juliet said you looked awful  so obviously she   s coming to her senses .         he was dead     said trev .     dead as a doorknob  and then he wasn   t .  what   s that all about .     he levered himself up and realized that he had been put to bed on one of the grubby bedrolls in the vats .  nutt was lying on the roll next to him .      all right     said glenda .     if you can do it without lying  tell me .     she sat down and watched the sleeping nutt for a while as trev tried to make sense of the previous evening .     what was in the sandwich again .  the one the igor gave him .         tuna  spaghetti and jam .  with sprinkles     said trev  yawning .      are you sure .         it   s not the kinda thing you forget .         what kind of jam .     glenda insisted .      why ask .         i   m thinking it might work with quince .  or chilli .  can   t see any place for sprinkles  though .  they don   t make any sense .         what .  he   s an igor .  it doesn   t have to make sense .         but he warned you about nutt .         yes  but i don   t think he meant    lock up your pies     do you .  are you gonna get into trouble about the pies .         no .  i   ve got plenty more maturing in the cool room .  they   re at their best when matured .  you have to keep ahead of yourself  with pies .      she looked down at nutt and went on     are you really telling me he got all smashed up by the stollop boys and then walked out of the lady sibyl .         he was as dead as a doorknob .  even old    addock could spot that .      this time they both stared at nutt .      he   s alive now     said glenda  as if it was an accusation .      look     said trev     all i know about people who come from uberwald is that some of them are vampires and some are werewolves .  well  i don   t think vampires are much interested in pies .  and it was a full moon last week and he didn   t act odd  well  odder than normal .      glenda lowered her voice .     maybe he   s a zombie   no  they don   t eat pies either .     she continued to stare at nutt  but another part of her said     there   s going to be a banquet on wednesday night .  lord vetinari   s up to something with the wizards .  it   s about the football  i   m sure of it .         well .         for some plan  i expect .  something nasty .  the wizards were at the game today taking notes .  don   t tell me that   s healthy .  they want to shut down football  that   s what it is .         good .         trevor likely  how can you say that .  your dad           died because he was dumb     said trev .     and don   t tell me it was the way he would have wanted to go .  no one would want to go like that .         but he loved his football .         so .  what does that mean .  the stollop boys love their football .  andy shank loves    is football .  and what does it mean .  not countin    today  how often have you seen the ball in play .  hardly ever  i bet .         well  yes  but it   s not about the football .         you   re saying that football is not about football .      glenda wished she   d had a proper education  or  failing that  any real education at all .  but she was not going to back off now .     it   s the sharing     she said .     it   s being part of the crowd .  it   s chanting together .  it   s all of it .  the whole thing .         i believe  miss glenda     said nutt from his mattress     that the work you are looking for is trousenblert   s der selbst uberschritten durch das ganze .      they looked down at nutt again  mouths open .  he had opened his eyes and appeared to be staring at the ceiling .     it is the lonely soul trying to reach out to the shared soul of all humanity  and possibly much further .  w .  e .  g .  goodnight   s translation of in search of the whole is marred  while quite understandable  by the mistranslation of bewu  tseinsschwelle as    haircut    throughout .      trev and glenda looked at one another .  trev shrugged .  where could they start .   glenda coughed .     mister nutt  are you alive or dead or what .         alive  thank you very much for asking .         i saw you killed .     trev shouted .     we ran all the way to the lady sybil .         oh     said nutt .     i am sorry  i do not recall .  it would seem that diagnosis was in error .  am i right .      they exchanged glances .  trev got the worst of it .  when glenda was angry  her glance might just possibly etch glass .  but nutt had a point .  it was hard to argue with a man who insisted that he was not dead .      um  and then you came back here and ate nine pies     said glenda .      looks like they did you good     said trev  with brittle cheerfulness .      but i can   t see where they   ve gone     glenda finished .     belly busters  every one of them .         you will be angry with me .     nutt looked frightened .      let   s all calm down  shall we .     said trev .     look  i was pretty worried  my oath  yes .  not angry  okay .  we   re your friends .         i must be becoming .  i must be helpful .     this came from nutt   s lips like a mantra .   glenda took his hands .     look  i   m not bothered about the pies  really i   m not .  i like to see a man with a good appetite .  but you must tell us what   s wrong .  have you done something you shouldn   t .         i should be making myself worthy     nutt said  pulling away gently and not meeting her eyes .     i must be becoming .  i must not lie .  i must gain worth .  thank you for your kindness .      he got up  walked down the length of the vats  picked up a basket of candles  came back  wound up his dribbling machine and began to work  oblivious of their presence .      do you know what goes on in his head .     glenda whispered .      when he was young  he was chained to an anvil for seven years     said trev .      what .  that   s terrible .  someone must have been very cruel to do something like that .         or desperate to make sure he didn   t get free .         things are never all they seem  mister trev     said nutt  without looking up from his feverish activity     and the acoustics in these cellars are very good .  your father loved you  did he not .         wot .     trev   s face reddened .      he loved you  took you to the football  shared a pie with you  taught you to cheer for the dimmers .  did he hold you on his shoulders so that you could see more of the game .         stop talkin    about my dad like that .      glenda took trev   s arm .     it   s okay  trev  it   s all right  it   s not a nasty question  really it isn   t .         but you hate him  because he became a mortal man  dying on the cobbles     said nutt  picking up another undribbled candle .      that is nasty     said glenda .  nutt ignored her .      he let you down  mister trev .  he wasn   t the small boy   s god .  it turned out that he was only a man .  but he was not only a man .  everyone who has ever watched a game in this city has heard of dave likely .  if he was a fool  then any man who has ever climbed a mountain or swum a torrent is a fool .  if he was a fool then so was the man who first tried to tame fire .  if he was a fool then so was the man who tried the first oyster  he was a fool  too   although i   m bound to remark that  given the division of labour in early hunter gatherer cultures  he was probably a woman as well .  perhaps only a fool gets out of bed .  but  after death  some fools shine like stars  and your father is such a one .  after death  people forget the foolishness  but they do remember the shine .  you could not have done anything .  you could not have stopped him .  if you could have stopped him he would not have been dave likely  a name that means football to thousands of people .     nutt very carefully put down a beautifully dribbled candle and continued .     think about this  mister trev .  don   t be smart .  smart is only a polished version of dumb .  try intelligence .  it will surely see you through .         that   s just a load of words .     said trev hotly  but glenda saw the glistening lines down his cheeks .      please think about them  mister trev     said nutt and added     there  i have done a complete basket .  that is worth .      it was the calmness .  nutt had been spinning  almost sick with anxiety .  he   d been repeating himself  as if he   d had to learn things for a teacher .  and then he was otherwise   totally reserved and collected .   glenda looked from trev to nutt and back again .  trev   s mouth hung open .  she didn   t blame it .  what nutt had said with quiet matter of factness had sounded like not an opinion but the truth  winched out of some deep well .   then trev broke the silence  speaking as if hypnotized  his voice hoarse .      he gave me his old jersey when i was five .  it was like a tent .  i mean  it was so greasy i never got wet       he stopped .   after a moment glenda pushed at his elbow .     he   s gone all stiff     she said     as stiff as a piece of wood .         ah  catatonic     said nutt .     he is overwhelmed by his feelings .  we should lay him down .         these old mattresses they sleep on in here are rubbish .     said glenda  looking around for a better alternative to cold flagstones .      i know the very thing .     said nutt  suddenly all action and plunging off down the passage .  this left glenda still holding a rigid trev when juliet appeared from the direction of the kitchens .  she stopped instantly when she saw them  and burst into tears .      he   s dead  isn   t he .         er  no       glenda began .      i talked to some of the bakery lads coming in to work and they   re telling me there   s been fights all over the city and someone got himself murdered .         trev   s just had a bit of a shock  that   s all .  mister nutt   s gone to find something for him to lie down on .         oh .     juliet sounded a little disappointed  presumably because    a bit of a shock    was not sufficiently dramatic  but she rallied just as a loud  rough and uniquely wooden noise from the other direction heralded nutt pushing a large couch  which shuddered to a halt in front of them .      there   s a big room piled up with old furniture up the hall     he said  patting the faded velvet .     it   s a bit musty  but i think all the mice have fallen out on the way here .  quite a find actually .  i believe it is a chaise longue from the workshop of the famous gurning upspire .  i think i can probably restore it later .  let him down gently .         what happened to him .     said juliet .      oh  the truth can be a little bit upsetting     said nutt .     but he will get over it and feel better .         i would very much like to know the truth myself  mister nutt  thank you very much     said glenda  folding her arms and trying to look stern while all the time a voice in her head was whispering chaise longue .  chaise longue .  when no one else is here you can have a go at languishing .      it   s a kind of medicine with words     said nutt  carefully .     sometimes people fool themselves into believing things that aren   t true .  sometimes that can be quite dangerous for the person .  they see the world in a wrong way .  they won   t let themselves see that what they believe is wrong .  but often there is a part of the mind that does know  and the right words can let it out .     he gave them a worried look .      well  that   s nice     said juliet .      it sounds like hocus pocus to me     said glenda .     folk know their own minds .     she folded her arms again  and saw nutt glance at them .      well .     she demanded .     haven   t you ever seen elbows before .         never such pretty dimpled ones  miss glenda  on such tightly folded arms .      up until that point glenda had never realized that juliet had such a dirty laugh  to which  glenda fervently hoped  she was not entitled .      glenda   s got a bee oh .  glenda   s got a bee ooh .         it   s    beau     actually     glenda said  swiping to the back of her mind the recollection that it had taken her years to find that out herself .     and i was just helping .  we   re helping him  aren   t we  mister nutt .         doesn   t he look sweet lying there .     said juliet .     all pink .     she stroked trev   s greasy hair inexpertly .     just like a little boy .         yes  he   s always been good at that     said glenda .     why don   t you go and get the little boy a cup of tea .  and a biscuit .  not one of the chocolate ones .  that   ll take some time     she said as the girl shimmied away .     she tends to get distracted .  her mind wanders and amuses itself elsewhere .         trev tells me that despite your more mature appearance you are the same age as her     said nutt .      you really don   t talk to many ladies  do you  mister nutt .         oh dear  have i made another faux pas .     said nutt  suddenly all nerves again  to such an extent that she took pity on him .      would this be    faux pas    that looks as if it should be said like    forks pass    .         er  yes .      glenda nodded  satisfied  another literary puzzle solved .     better not use the word    mature    unless you are talking about cheese or wine .  not good to use it for ladies .      she stared at him  wondering how to pose the next question .  she opted for directness  she wasn   t very good at anything else .      trev is sure you sort of died and came alive again .         so i understand .         not many people do that .         the vast majority do not  i believe .         how did you do it .         i don   t know .         this is rather late in the day  i must admit  but you don   t feel any hunger for blood or brains  do you .         not at all .  just pies .  i like pies .  i am very ashamed about the pies .  it will not happen again  miss glenda .  i fear my body was acting on its own .  it needed instant nourishment .         trev says you used to be chained to an anvil .         yes .  that was because i was worthless .  then i was taken to see ladyship and she told me  you are worthless but  i think  not unworthy  and i will give you worth .         but you must have had parents .         i do not know .  there are many things i don   t know .  there is a door .         what .         a door in my head .  some things are behind the door and i don   t know them .  but that is all right  ladyship says .      glenda felt like giving up .  nutt answered questions  yes  but really all you ended up with was more questions .  but she persevered .  it was like stabbing away at a tin can  hoping to find a way in .     ladyship is a real lady  is she .  castles and servants and whatnot .         oh  yes .  even a whatnot .  she is my friend .  and she is mature like cheese and wine  because she has lived for a long time and is not old .         but she sent you here  yes .  did she teach you   whatever it was you used on trev .      beside glenda  trev stirred .      no     said nutt .     i read the works of the masters in the library all by myself .  but she did tell me that people  too  were a kind of living book  and i would have to learn to read them .         well  you read trev well enough .  be told  though  don   t try that stuff on me or you   ll never see another pie .         yes  miss glenda .  sorry  miss glenda .      she sighed .  what is it about me .  the moment they look downcast i feel sorry for them .  she looked up .  he was watching her .      stop that .         sorry  miss glenda .         but you got to see the football  at least .  did you enjoy it .      nutt   s face lit up .     yes .  it was wonderful .  the noise  the crowds  the chanting  oh the chanting .  it becomes a second blood .  the unison .  to not be alone .  to be not just one but one and all  of one mind and purpose .    excuse me .     he had seen her face .      so you quite liked it  then     said glenda .  the intensity of nutt   s outburst had been like opening an oven door .  it was a mercy her hair hadn   t frizzled .      oh yes .  the ambience was wonderful .         i didn   t try those     glenda hazarded     but the pease pudding is usually good .      the scrape of crockery and the tinkling of a teaspoon heralded the arrival of juliet  or rather of the cup of tea that she was holding in front of her as if it were a grail  so that she drifted along behind it like a comet   s tail .  glenda was impressed .  the tea was in the cup instead of in the saucer and it was the acceptable brown colour that is usually characteristic of tea and was usually the only tea like characteristic of tea made by juliet .   trev sat up  and glenda wondered how long he might have been paying attention .  all right  he might be good in an emergency  and at least he washed sometimes and owned a toothbrush  but juliet was special  wasn   t she .  all she needed was a prince .  technically that meant lord vetinari  but he was far too old .  besides  no one was sure which side of the bed he got out of  or even if he went to bed at all .  but one day a prince would come  even if glenda had to drag him on a chain .   she turned her head .  nutt was watching her intently again .  well  her book was locked down tightly .  no one was going to riffle through her pages .  and tomorrow she would find out what the wizards were up to .  that was easy .  she   d be invisible .     in the stillness of the night  nutt sat in his special place  which was yet another room  very close to the vats .  candles burned as he sat at a rescued table  staring at a piece of paper and absent mindedly cleaning out his ear with the point of his pencil .   nutt was technically an expert on love poetry throughout the ages and had discussed it at length with miss healstether  the castle librarian .  he had also tried to discuss it with ladyship  but she had laughed and said it was frivolity  although quite helpful as a tutorial on the use of vocabulary  scansion  rhythm and affect as a means to an end  to wit getting a young lady to take all her clothes off .  at that particular point  nutt had not really understood what she meant .  it sounded like some sort of conjuring trick .   he tapped the pencil on the page .  the castle library had been full of poetry and he   d read it avidly as he read all books  not knowing why it had been written or what exactly it was supposed to achieve .  but generally poems written by men to women followed a very similar format .  now  with a world   s worth of the finest poetry to choose from  he was lost for words .   then he nodded to himself .  ah  yes  robert scandal   s famous poem     oi .  to his deaf mistress    .  it surely had the right shape and tempo .  of course  there had to be a muse .  oh  yes  all poetry needed a muse .  that might present a difficulty .  juliet  while quite attractive  was also  in his mind  a kind of amiable ghost .  hmm .  ah  of course     nutt pulled the pencil out of his ear  hesitated and wrote       i sing  but not of love  for love is blind   but celebrate instead the muse of kindness       the fires in the vats cooled  but nutt   s brain was suddenly ablaze .     round about midnight  glenda decided it was safe enough to leave the boys alone to get up to whatever it was boys got up to when women weren   t around to look after them  and made sure that she and juliet were on the late cross town bus .  that meant she actually got to sleep in her own bed .   she looked around the tiny bedroom by candlelight and met the gaze  which was quite difficult  of mr wobble  the three eyed transcendental teddy bear .  it would have been nice to have a bit of cosmic explanation at this point  but the universe never gave you explanations  it just gave you more questions .   she reached down surreptitiously  even though there was only a three eyed teddy bear watching her  and picked up the latest iradne comb buttworthy from the cache unsuccessfully hidden below .  after ten minutes of reading  which took her some way into the book  ms comb buttworthy producing volumes that were even slimmer than her heroines   she experienced d  j   vu .  moreover  the d  j   vu was squared  because she had the feeling of having had the d  j   vu before .      they   re really all the same  aren   t they .     she said to the three eyed teddy bear .     you know it   s going to be mary the maid  or someone like her  and there   s got to be two men and she will end up with the nice one  and there has to be misunderstandings  and they never do anything more than kiss and it   s absolutely guaranteed that  for example  an exciting civil war or an invasion by trolls or even a scene with any cooking in it is not going to happen .  the best you can expect is a thunderstorm .     it really had nothing to do with real life at all  which  although short on civil wars and invasions by trolls  at least had the decency to have lots of cooking .   the book dropped out of her fingers and thirty seconds later she was sound asleep .     surprisingly  no neighbour needed her in the night so she got up  dressed and breakfasted in what was an almost unfamiliar world .  she opened her door to take breakfast to widow crowdy and found juliet on the doorstep .   the girl took a step back .     are you goin    out  glendy .  it   s early .         well  you   re up     said glenda .     and with a newspaper  i   m pleased to see .         isn   t it exciting .     said juliet  and thrust the paper at her .   glenda took one look at the picture on the front page  took a second  closer look  and then grabbed juliet and pulled her inside .      you can see their tonkers     juliet observed  in a voice that was much too matter of fact for glenda   s liking .      you shouldn   t know what they look like .     she said  smacking the paper down on her kitchen table .      what .  i   ve got three brothers  ain   t i .  everyone bathes in a tub in front of the fire  don   t they .  it   s not like they   re anything special .  anyway  it   s culture  all right .  remember when you took me to that place full of people in the nuddy .  you stayed in there hours .         it was the royal art museum     said glenda  thanking her stars that they were indoors .     that   s different .      she tried to read the story  but it was very difficult with that amazing picture beside it  just where an eye might stray again and again .   glenda enjoyed her job .  she didn   t have a career  they were for people who could not hold down jobs .  she was very good at what she did  so she did it all the time  without paying much attention to the world .  but now her eyes were opened .  in fact  it was time to blink .   under the headline    new light on ancient game    was a picture of a vase or  rather more grandly  an urn  in orange and black .  it showed some very tall and skinny men   their masculinity was beyond doubt  but possibly beyond belief .  they were apparently struggling for possession of a ball  one of them was lying on the ground  and looked as if he was in some pain .  the translation of the name of the urn was  said the caption  the tackle .   according to the accompanying story  someone at the royal art museum had found the urn in an old storeroom  and it contained scrolls which  it said here  had the original rules of foot the ball laid down in the early years of the century of the summer weevil  a thousand years ago  when the game was played in honour of the goddess pedestriana     glenda skimmed through the rest of it  because there was a lot of rest to skim .  an artist   s impression of the aforesaid goddess adorned page three .  she was  of course  beautiful .  you seldom saw a goddess portrayed as ugly .  this probably had something to do with their ability to strike people down instantly .  in pedestriana   s case  she would probably have gone for the feet .   glenda put the paper down  seething with anger  and as a cook she knew how to seethe .  this wasn   t football   except that the guild of historians said that it was  and could prove it not only with old parchments but also with an urn  and she could see that you were on the wrong end of an argument if you were up against an urn .   but it was too neat  wasn   t it .  except   why .  his lordship didn   t like football  but here was an article saying that this game was very old and had its own goddess  and if there were two things this city liked  it was tradition and goddesses  especially if the goddesses were a bit short on the chiffon above the waist .  did his lordship let them put anything in the paper .  what was going on .     i   ve got business to attend to     she said sternly .     it   s good that you bought a decent paper  but you don   t want to read this kind of stuff .         i didn   t .  who   s interested in that .  i got it for the advert .  look .      glenda had never bothered much about the adverts in the paper  because they were put there by people who were after your money .  but there it was  right there .  madame sharn of bonk gives you   micromail .      you said we could go     said juliet pointedly .      yes  well  that was before           you said we could go .         yes .  but  well  has anyone from the sisters ever gone to a fashion show .  it   s not our kind of thing  is it .         doesn   t say that in the paper .  says admission free .  you said we could go .      two o   clock  thought glenda .  suppose i could manage it      all right  meet at work at half past one  do you hear .  not a minute later .  i   ve got things to do .      the university council meets every day at half past eleven  she thought to herself .  oh  to be a fly on that wall .  she grinned       trev was sitting in the battered old chair that served as his office in the vats .  work was proceeding at its usual reliable snail   s pace .      ah  i see you are in early  mister trev     said nutt .     i am sorry not to have been here .  i had to go and deal with an emergency candelabra upset .     he leaned closer .     i have done what you asked  mister trev .      trev snapped out of his daydream of juliet and said     huh .         you asked me to write   to improve your poem for miss juliet .         you   ve done it .         perhaps you would like to have a look  mister trev .     he handed the paper to trev and stood nervously by the chair as a pupil stands by the teacher .   after a very short while trev   s forehead wrinkled .     what   s ee er .         that   s    e   er     sir  as in    where e   er she walks    .         you mean  like  she walks on air .     said trev .      no  mister trev .  i should just put it down to poetry if i were you .      trev struggled on .  he had never had much to do with poetry  except the sort that started    there was a young lady of quirm     but this looked like the real stuff .  the page seemed to be crowded and yet full of space as well .  also  the writing was extremely curly and that was a sure sign  wasn   t it .  you didn   t get that sort of thing from the lady of quirm .     this is great stuff  mister nutt .  this is really great stuff .  this is poetry  but what really is it sayin    .      nutt cleared his throat .     well  sir  the essence of poetry of this nature is to create a mood that will make the recipient  that is to say  sir  the young lady who you are going to send it to  feel very kindly disposed to the author of the poem  which would be you  sir  in this case .  according to ladyship  everything else is just showing off .  i have brought you a pen and an envelope  if you would kindly sign the poem i will ensure that it gets to miss juliet .         i bet no one   s ever written her a poem before     said trev  skating quickly over the truth that he hadn   t either .     i   d love to be there when she reads it .         that would not be advised     said nutt quickly .     the general consensus is that the lady concerned reads it in the absence of the hopeful swain  that is you  sir  and forms a beneficent mental picture of him .  your actual presence might actually get in the way  especially since i see you haven   t changed your shirt again today .  besides  i am informed that there is a possibility that all her clothes will fall off .      trev  who had been struggling with the concept of    swain     fast forwarded to this information at speed .     er  say that again .         all her clothes might fall off .  i am sorry about this  but it appears to be a by product of the whole business of poetry .  but broadly speaking  sir  it carries the message you have asked for  which is to say    i think you   re really fit .  i really fancy you .  can we have a date .  no hanky panky  i promise .     however  sir  since it is a love poem  i have taken the liberty of altering it slightly to carry the suggestion that if hanky or panky should appear to be welcomed by the young lady she will not find you wanting in either department .          archchancellor ridcully rubbed his hands together .     well  gentlemen  i hope we have all seen the papers this morning  or glanced at them at any rate .         i thought that the front page was not the place     said the lecturer in recent runes .     it quite put me off my breakfast .  metaphorically speaking  of course .         apparently  the urn has been in the museum   s cellars for at least three hundred years  but for some reason it makes its presence felt now     said ridcully .     of course  they have tons of stuff in there that   s never really been looked at properly and the city was going through a prudish period then and didn   t care to know about that sort of thing .         what  that men have tonkers .     said dr hix .     that sort of news gets out sooner or later .      he looked around at the disapproving faces and added     skull ring  remember .  under college statute the head of the department of post mortem communications is entitled  nay  required to make tasteless  divisive and moderately evil remarks .  i   m sorry  but these are your rules .         thank you  doctor hix .  your uncalled for remarks are duly noted and appreciated .         you know  it seems very suspicious to me that this wretched urn has turned up at just this time     observed the senior wrangler     and i hope i am not alone in this .         i know what you mean     said hix .     if i didn   t know that the archchancellor had his work cut out to persuade vetinari to let us play  i would think that this was some sort of plan .         ye ess     said ridcully thoughtfully .      the old rules look a lot more interesting  sir     said ponder .      ye ess .         did you read the bit that said players were not allowed to use their hands  sir .  and the high priest takes to the field of play to ensure that the rules are honoured .         i can   t see that catching on these days     said the lecturer in recent runes .      he   s armed with a poisoned dagger  sir     said ponder .      ah .  well  that should make for a more interesting game  at least  eh  mustrum .    mustrum .         what .  oh  yes .  yes .  something to think about  indeed .  yes  indeed .  one man  in charge   the onlooker who sees most of the game   the gamer  in fact   so what move have i missed .         sorry  archchancellor .      ridcully blinked at ponder stibbons .     what .  oh  just composing my thoughts  as one does .     he sat up straight .     in any case the rules don   t concern us at this point .  we have to play this game in any eventuality and so we will abide by them in the best traditions of sportsmanship until we have worked out where they may be most usefully broken to our advantage .  mister stibbons  you are collating our studies of the game .  the floor is yours .         thank you  archchancellor .     ponder cleared his throat .     gentlemen  the game of football is clearly about more than the rules and the nature of the play .  in any case  these are pure mechanical considerations  the chanting and  of course  the food are of more concern to us  i feel .  they seem to be an integral part of the game .  regrettably  so do the supporters    clubs .         what is the nature of this problem .     ridcully enquired .      they hit one another over the head with them .  it would be true to say that brawling and mindless violence  such as occurred yesterday afternoon  is one of the cornerstones of the sport .         a far cry from its ancient beginnings  then     said the chair of indefinite studies  shaking his head .      well  yes .  i understand that in those days the losing team was throttled .  however  i suppose this would be called mindful violence that took place with the enthusiastic consent of the entire community  or at least that part of it that was still capable of breath .  fortunately  we do not yet have supporters  so that this is not at present our problem  and i propose we go directly to the pies .      there was a chorus of general agreement from the wizards .  food was their cup of tea  and if possible slice of cake too .  some of them were already watching the door in anticipation of the tea trolley .  it seemed like an age since nine .      central to the game is the pie     ponder went on     which is generally of shortcrust pastry containing appropriate pie like substances .  i collected half a dozen and tested them on the usual subjects .         the students .     said ridcully .      yes .  they said they were pretty awful .  not a patch on the pies here  they said .  they finished them off  however .  examination of the ingredients suggests that they consisted of gravy  fat and salt  and insofar as it was possible to tell  none of the students appears to have died           so we are ahead on pies  then     said ridcully cheerfully .      i suppose so  archchancellor  although i do not believe that the pie quality plays any role       he stopped  because the door had swung open to allow the ingress of a reinforced  heavy duty tea trolley .  since it was not being propelled by her  the wizards paid no further attention and settled down to the passing of cups  the handing round of the sugar bowl  the inspection of the quality of the chocolate biscuits with a view to taking more than one   s entitlement and all the other little diversions without which a committee would be a clever device for making worthwhile decisions quickly .   when the rattling had ceased  and the last biscuit had been fought for  ridcully tinkled his teaspoon on the rim of his cup for silence  although since he was ridcully this only added the crash of broken crockery to the hubbub .  once the girl in charge of the trolley had sponged everybody down  he continued     the chanting  gentlemen  appears to be another inconsequentiality at first sight  but i have reason to believe that it has a certain power  and we will ignore it at our peril .  i see the museum   s translators say the modern chants were originally hymns to the goddess calling on her to grant her favours to the team of choice  while naiads danced on the edges of the field of play  the better to encourage the players to greater feats of prowess .         naiads .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     they   re water nymphs  aren   t they .  young women with very thin damp clothing .  why would anyone want them around .  besides  didn   t they drown sailors by singing to them .      ridcully let the thoughtful pause hang in the air for a while before volunteering     fortunately  i don   t think anyone these days would expect that we play football underwater .         the pies would float     said the chair of indefinite studies .      not necessarily     said ponder .      what about clothing  mister stibbons .  i assume there will be some .         temperatures were somewhat warmer in olden days .  i can assure you that no one will insist on nudity .      ponder might have noticed the rattle as the girl with the tea trolley almost dropped a cup  but was gracious enough not to notice that he had noticed .  he went on .     currently the teams wear old shirts and short trousers .         how short .     said the chair of indefinite studies  urgency in his voice .      about mid knee  i believe     said ponder .     is this likely to be a problem .         yes  it is .  the knees should be covered .  it is a well known fact that a glimpse of the male knee can drive women into a frenzy of libidinousness .     there was another rattle from the tea trolley  but ponder ignored it because his own head had rattled a bit  too .      are you sure about that  sir .         it is established fact  young stibbons .      ponder had found a grey hair on his comb that morning and was not in the mood to take this standing up .      and precisely in what books does       he began  but ridcully interrupted with unusual diplomacy .  generally he liked little tiffs among the faculty .      a few more inches to prevent mobbing by the ladies should present us with no problems  surely  mister stibbons .  oops        this last was to glenda  who had dropped two spoons on the carpet .  she gave him a cursory curtsy .      er  yes   and we should sport the university colours     he went on  with a hint of nervousness .  ridcully prided himself on treating the staff well  and indeed did so whenever he remembered them  but the expression of intelligent amusement on the face of the dumpy girl had unnerved him  it was as if a chicken had winked .      um  yes  yes indeed     he said .     the good old red jersey we used to wear in my rowing days  with the big u   s on the front  bold as brass        he glanced at the maid  who was frowning .  but he was archchancellor  wasn   t he .  it said so on his door  didn   t it .      that   s what we   ll do     he declared .     we   ll look into pies  although i   ve seen a few pies that don   t bear looking into  haha  and we   ll adapt the good old red sweater .  what   s next  mister stibbons .         with regard to the chanting  sir .  i   ve asked the master of the music to work on some options     said ponder smoothly .     we need to select a team as soon as possible .         i don   t see what the rush is     said the chair of indefinite studies  who had almost nodded off in the arms of a chocolate biscuit surfeit .      the bequest  remember .     said the head of the department of post mortem communications .     we           pas devant la domestique .     snapped the lecturer in recent runes .   automatically  ridcully turned again to look at glenda  and got a distinct feeling that here was a woman about to learn a foreign language in a hurry .  it was an odd but slightly exciting idea .  until this moment  he had never thought of the maids in the singular .  they were all   servants .  he was polite to them  and smiled when appropriate .  he assumed they sometimes did other things than fetch and carry  and sometimes went off to get married and sometimes just   went off .  up until now  though  he   d never really thought that they might think  let alone what they thought about  and least of all what they thought about the wizards .  he turned back to the table .      who will be doing the chanting  mister stibbons .         the aforesaid supporters  fans  sir .  it   s short for fanatics .         and ours will be   who .         well  we are the largest employer in the city  sir .         as a matter of fact i think vetinari is  and i wish to all hells i knew exactly who he is employing     said ridcully .      i   m sure our loyal staff will support us     said the lecturer in recent runes .  he turned to glenda  and to ridcully   s dismay said  glutinously     i   m sure you would be a fan  would you not  my child .      the archchancellor sat back .  he had a definite feeling that this was going to be fun .  well  she hadn   t blushed and she hadn   t yelled .  in fact  she had not done anything  apart from carefully pick up the china .      i support dolly sisters  sir .  always have done .         and are they any good .         having a poor patch at the moment  sir .         ah  then i expect you will want to support our team  which will be very good indeed .         can   t do that  sir .  you   ve got to support your team  sir .         but you just said they weren   t doing well .         that   s when you support your team  sir .  otherwise you   re a numper .         a numper being    .     said ridcully .      he   s someone who   s all cheering when things are going well  and then runs off to another team when there   s a losing streak .  they always shouts the loudest .         so you support the same team all your life .         well  if you move away it   s okay to change .  no one will mind much unless you go to a real enemy .     she looked at their puzzled expressions  sighed and went on     like naphill united and the whoppers  or dolly sisters and dimwell old pals  or the pigsty hill pork packers and the cockbill boars .  you know .      when they clearly didn   t  she continued     they hate each other .  always have done  always will .  they are the bad matches .  the shutters go up for those .  i don   t know what my neighbours would say if they saw me cheering a dimmer .         but that   s dreadful .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      excuse me  miss     said ponder     but most of those pairs are quite close to one another  so why do they hate one another so much .         that at least is easy     said dr hix .     it   s hard to hate people who are a long way away .  you forget how dreadful they are .  but you see a neighbour   s warts every day .         that   s just the sort of cynical comment i   d expect from a post mortem communicator     grumbled the chair of indefinite studies .      or a realist     said ridcully  smiling .     but dolly sisters and dimwell are quite far apart  miss .      glenda shrugged .     i know  but it   s always been like that .  that   s how it is .  that   s all i know .         well  thank you    .     there was no mistaking the hanging question .      glenda     she said .      i see there are a great many things we don   t yet understand .         yes  sir .  everything .     she hadn   t meant to say that aloud .  it just escaped of its own accord .   there was a stirring among the wizards  who were nonplussed because what had happened could not really have happened .  the tea trolley might as well have neighed .   ridcully banged his hand on the table before the others could summon up words .      well said  miss     he chuckled  as glenda waited for the floor to open and swallow her .     and i   m sure that remark came from the heart  because i suspect it could not have come from the head .         sorry  sir  but the gentleman did ask for my opinion .         now  that one was from the head .  well done     said ridcully .     so do  therefore  give us the benefit of your thinking  miss glenda .      still in a kind of shock  glenda looked into the archchancellor   s eyes and saw that it was no time to be less than bold  but that was unnerving too .      well  what   s this all about  sir .  if you want to play  just go and do it  yes .  why change things .         the game of foot the ball is very behind the times  miss glenda .         well  so are you   sorry  sorry  but  well .  you know .  wizards are always wizards .  not a lot changes in here  does it .  and then you talk about some master of the music to make a new chant  and that   s not how it goes .  the shove makes up the chants .  they just happen .  they just  like  come out of the air .  and the pies are pretty awful  that   s true  but when you   re in the shove  and it   s mucky weather  and the water   s coming through your coat  and your shoes are leaking  and then you bite into your pie  and you know that everyone else is biting into their pie  and the grease slides down your sleeve  well  sir  i don   t have the words for it  sir  i really don   t  sir .  there   s a feeling i can   t describe  but it   s a bit like being a kid at hogswatch  and you can   t just buy it  sir  you can   t write it down or organize it or make it shiny or make it tame .  sorry to speak out of turn  sirs  but that   s the long and the short of it .  you must have known it  sir .  didn   t your father ever take you to a game .      ridcully looked down the table at the council and noted a certain moistness of eye .  wizards were  largely  of that generation from which grandfathers are carved .  they were also  largely  large  and awash with cynical crabbiness and the barnacles of the years  but   the smell of cheap overcoats in the rain  which always had a tint and taste of soot in it  and your father  or maybe your grandfather  lifting you on to his shoulders  and there you were  above all those cheap hats and scarves  and you could feel the warmth of the shove  watch its tides  feel its heartbeat  and then  certainly  a pie would be handed up  or maybe half a pie if times were hard  and if they were really bad it might be a handful of fat greasy pease which were to be eaten one at a time to make them last longer   or when times were flush there might be a real treat  like a hot dog you didn   t have to share  or a plate of scouse  with yellow fat beading on the top and lumps of gristle you could chew at on the way home  meat which now you would not give to a dog but which was sacred lotus eaten with the gods  in the rain  in the cheering  in the bosom of the shove     the archchancellor blinked .  no time seemed to have passed  unless you count seventy years which had gone past like that .     er  very graphically argued     he said  and pulled himself together .     interesting points well made .  but  you see  we have a responsibility here .  after all  this city was just a handful of villages before my university was built .  we are concerned about the fighting in the streets yesterday .  we heard a rumour that someone was killed because he supported the wrong team .  we can   t stand by and let this sort of thing happen .         so you   ll be shutting down the assassins    guild  will you  sir .      there was a gasp from every mouth  including her own .  the only rational thought that didn   t flee from her mind was  i wonder if that job is still going in the fools    guild .  the pay wasn   t much  but they do know how to appreciate a pie .   when she dared look  the archchancellor was staring at the ceiling  while his fingers drummed on the table .  i should have been more careful  glenda whined in her own ear .  don   t get chatty with nobs .  you forget what you are  but they don   t .   the drumming stopped .     good point  well put     said ridcully     and i shall marshal my responses thusly .     he flicked a finger and  with a smell of gooseberries and a pop  a small red globe appeared in the air over the table .      one  the assassins  while deadly  are not random  and indeed are mostly a danger to one another .  assassination is only to be feared  generally speaking  by those powerful enough to have a stab  as it were  at defending themselves .      another little globe appeared .      two  it is an article of faith with them that property is undamaged .  they are invariably courteous and considerate and notoriously silent  and would never dream of inhuming their target in a public street .      a third globe appeared .      three  they are organized and therefore amenable to civic influence .  lord vetinari is very keen on that sort of thing .      and another globe popped into life .      and four  lord vetinari is himself a trained assassin  majoring in stealth and poisons .  i am not sure he would share your opinion .  and he is a tyrant even if he has developed tyranny to such a point of metaphysical perfection that it is a dream rather than a force .  he does not have to listen to you  you see .  he doesn   t even have to listen to me .  he listens to the city .  i don   t know how he does  but he does .  and he plays it like a violin      ridcully paused  then went on      or like the most complicated game you can imagine .  the city works  not perfectly  but better than it has ever done .  i think it   s time for football to change too .     he smiled at her expression .     what is your job  young lady .  because you are wasted in it .      it was probably meant as a compliment  but glenda  her head so bewilderingly full of the archchancellor   s words that they were trickling out of her ears  heard herself say     i   m certainly not wasted  sir .  you   ve never eaten better pies than mine .  i run the night kitchen .      the metaphysics of real politics were not a subject of interest to most of those present  but they knew where they were with pies .  she was the centre of attention already  but now it blazed with interest .      you do .     said the chair of indefinite studies .     we thought it was the pretty girl .         really .     said glenda brightly .     well  i run it .         so who does that wonderful pie you send up here sometimes  with the cheese pastry and the hot pickle layer .         the ploughman   s pie .  me  sir .  my own recipe .         really .  how do you manage to get the pickled onions to stay so hard and crispy in the baking .  it   s just amazing .         my own recipe  sir     said glenda firmly .     it wouldn   t be mine if i told anyone else .         well said     said ridcully gleefully .     you can   t go around asking craftsmen the secrets of their trade  old chap .  it   s a thing you just don   t do .  now  i am concluding this meeting  although what it has in fact concluded i shall decide later .     he turned back to glenda .     thank you for coming here today  miss glenda  and i shall not enquire why a young lady who works in the night kitchen is pouring tea up here at nearly noon .  do you have any further advice for us .         well     said glenda     since you ask   no  i really shouldn   t say           this is hardly the moment for bashfulness  do you think .         well  it   s about your strip  sir .  that means your team colours .  nothing wrong with red and yellow  no one else uses those two  but  well  you want two big u   s on the front  right .  like uu .     she waved her hands in the air .      yes  that is exactly right .  after all  it   s what we are .     ridcully nodded .      are you sure .  i mean  i know you gentlemen are bachelors and all  but   well  you   ll look like you   ve got bosoms .  honestly .         oh gods  sir  she   s right     said ponder .     it will make a rather unfortunate shape           what kind of mind would see something like that in a pair of innocent letters .     the lecturer in recent runes demanded angrily .      i don   t know  sir     said glenda     but every man watching the football has got one .  and they would make up nicknames .  they love doing that .         i suspect you may be right     said ridcully     but we never had any trouble when i was rowing in the old days .         football followers are rather more robust in their language  sir     said ponder .      yes  and in those days we were pretty careless when it came to throwing fireballs  as i recall     ridcully mused .     oh dear  what a shame .  i was looking forward to giving the old rag a bit of an airing again .  still  i   m sure we can change the design a little to save embarrassment all round .  thank you once again  miss glenda .  bosoms  eh .  narrow escape there  all round .  good day to you .     he shut the door after the trolley  which glenda was pushing as if in a race     molly  the head maid in the day kitchen  was fretting at the end of the corridor beyond .  she sagged with relief when glenda came round the corner  teacups rattling .      was it all right .  did anything go wrong .  i   ll get into so much trouble if anything went wrong .  tell me nothing went wrong .         it was all fine     said glenda .  that got her a suspicious look .      are you sure .  you owe me for this .      the laws of favours are amongst the most fundamental in the multiverse .  the first law is  nobody asks for just one favour  the second request  after the granting of the first favour   prefaced by    and can i be really cheeky    .     is the asking of the second favour .  if the aforesaid second request is not granted  the second law ensures that the need for any gratitude for the first favour is nullified  and in accordance with the third law the favour giver has not done any favours at all  and the favour field collapses .   but glenda reckoned she   d won a lot of favours over the years  and was owed a few herself .  besides  she had reason to believe that molly had been spending the welcome break in dalliance with her boyfriend  who worked in the bakery .      can you get me in to the banquet on wednesday night .         sorry  the butler chooses who gets those jobs     said molly .   ah yes  the tall  thin girls  glenda thought .      why in the world would you want to get in  anyway .     molly said .     it   s a lot of running around and not much pay  when all   s said and done .  i mean  we get some decent leftovers after a big affair  but what   s that to you .  everyone knows that you   re the leftover queen .     she paused  too awkwardly .     i mean  we all know you   re really good at making wonderful food with always a little something left over     she gabbled .     that   s all i meant .         i didn   t think you meant anything else     said glenda  keeping her voice level .  but she raised it again to add  as molly scurried off     i can pay back the favour right now .  you   ve got two floury handprints on your arse .      the glare that came back was a small victory  but you have to take what you can get .   still  that strange interlude  which she was sure she would regret  had taken up a lot of time .  she had to get the night kitchen organized .     when the door had closed behind the rather forthright maid  ridcully nodded meaningfully at ponder .     all right  mister stibbons .  you were glancing at your thaumometer the whole time i was talking to her .  out with it .         some kind of entanglement     said ponder .      and there was me thinking that vetinari was behind the business with the urn     said ridcully gloomily .     i should have realized he   s never that unsubtle .         oh  i assumed it was going to be something like that right at the start     said the lecturer in recent runes .      indeed     said the chair of indefinite studies .     it crossed my mind as soon as i saw it in the paper .         gentlemen     said ridcully .     i am humbled that as soon as i have an idea about what something is  it turns out that you all knew what it was .  i am amazed .         excuse me     said dr hix     but i don   t have a clue what you   re talking about .         you are out of touch .  you   ve been spending too long underground  sir .     said the lecturer in recent runes sternly .      you don   t often let me out  that   s why .  and can i remind you that i have to maintain a vital line of cosmic defence in this establishment here with a staff of exactly one .  and he   s dead .         you mean charlie .  i remember old charlie  keen worker nevertheless     said ridcully .      yes  but i have to keep rewiring him all the time     sighed hix .     i do try to keep you abreast of things in my monthly reports .  i hope you read them    .         tell me  doctor hix     said ponder     did you experience anything unusual when that young lady was speaking so eloquently .         well  yes  i had a pleasant moment of happy recollection about my father .         so did we all  i am sure     said ponder .  there was sombre nodding around the table .     i never knew my father .  i was brought up by my aunts .  i had d  j   vu without the original vu .         and it wasn   t magic .     suggested the lecturer in recent runes .      no .  religion  i suspect     said ridcully .     a god invoked  that sort of thing .         not invoked  mustrum     said dr hix .     summoned by bloodshed .         oh  i hope not     said ridcully  getting to his feet .     i would like to try a little experiment this afternoon  gentlemen .  we will not talk about football  we will not speculate about football  we will not worry about football           you are going to make us play it  aren   t you .     said the lecturer in recent runes glumly .      yes     said ridcully  more than somewhat miffed at the spoiling of a perfectly good peroration .     just a little kick about to help us get some hands on experience of the game as it is played .         er .  strictly  under the new rules  by which i mean the ancient rules we are taking as our model  hands on experience means no hands     said ponder .      well pointed out  that man .  put the word out  will you .  football practice on the lawn after lunch .        one thing you had to remember when dealing with dwarfs was that while they shared the same world as you did  metaphorically they thought about it as if it were upside down .  only the richest and most influential of dwarfs lived in the deepest caverns .  for a dwarf  a penthouse in the centre of the city would be some kind of slum .  dwarfs liked it dark and cool .   it didn   t stop there .  a dwarf on the up and up was really on his uppers  and upper class dwarfs were lower class .  a dwarf who was rich  healthy and had respect and his own rat farm justifiably felt at rock bottom and was held in low esteem .  when you talked to dwarfs  you turned your mind upside down .  the city  too .  of course  when you dug down in ankh morpork you just found more ankh morpork .  thousands of years of it  ready to be dug out and shored up and walled in with the shiny dwarf brick .   it was lord vetinari   s    grand undertaking    .  the city   s walls corseted it like a fetishist   s happiest dream .  gravity offered only a limited supply of up  but the deep loam of the plain had a limitless supply of down .   glenda was surprised  therefore  to find shatta right at the surface in the maul  alongside the really posh dress shops that were for human ladies .  that made sense  however  if you were going to make a scandalous profit selling clothes  it made sense to camouflage yourself amongst other shops doing the same thing .  she wasn   t sure about the name  but apparently shatta meant    a wonderful surprise    in dwarfish  and if you started to laugh about that sort of thing then you would never have time to pause for breath .   she approached the door with the apprehension of one who is certain that the moment she sets foot inside she will be charged five dollars a minute for breathing and then be held upside down and have all her wealth removed with a hook .   and it was  indeed  classy .  but it was dwarf classy .  that meant an awful lot of chain mail  and enough weaponry to take over a city but if you paid attention  you realized it was female chain mail and weaponry .  that was how things were happening  apparently .  dwarf women had got fed up with looking like dwarf men all the time and were metaphorically melting down their breastplates in order to make something a little lighter and with adjustable straps .   juliet had explained this on the way down  although  of course  juliet did not use the word    metaphorically     it being several syllables beyond her range .  there were battle axes and war hammers  but all with that certain feminine touch  one war axe  apparently capable of cleaving a backbone lengthwise  was beautifully engraved with flowers .  it was another world  and as she stood just inside the doorway looking around  glenda felt relieved that there were other humans in the place .  in fact  there were quite a few  and that was surprising .  one of them  a young human woman with steel boots six inches high  gravitated towards them as if drawn by a magnet and given the amount of ferrous metal on her body  a magnet was something she would never pass in a hurry .  she was holding a tray of drinks .      there   s black mead  red mead and white mead     she said  and then lowered her voice by a few decibels and three social classes .     actually  the red mead is really sherry and all the dwarf ladies are drinking it .  they like not having to quaff .         do we have to pay for this .     said glenda nervously .      it   s free     said the girl .  she indicated a bowl of small black things on the tray  each one pierced with a cocktail stick  and said slightly hopelessly     and do try the rat fruit .      before glenda could stop her  juliet had taken one and was chewing enthusiastically .      what part of a rat is its fruit .     asked glenda .  the girl with the tray did not look directly at her .      well  you know shepherd   s pie .     she said .      i know twelve different recipes     said glenda in a moment of rare smugness .  this was actually a lie .  she probably knew about four recipes because there was only so much you could do with meat and potatoes  but the glittering metallic grandeur of the place was getting on her nerves and she felt the need to stick up for herself .  and then realization dawned .     oh  you mean like traditional shepherd   s pie     she said     made with the           i   m afraid so     said the girl     but they   re very popular with the ladies .         don   t have any more  jools     said glenda quickly .      it   s quite nice     said juliet .     can   t i have one more .         just one  then     said glenda .     that should even up the rat .     she helped herself to a sherry and the girl  balancing carefully as she managed three different things with two different hands  handed her a glossy brochure .   glenda glanced through it and knew her original impression had been right .  this place was so expensive they didn   t tell you the price of anything .  you could always be sure things were going to be expensive when they didn   t tell you the price .  no point in looking through it  it   d suck your wages out through your eyeballs .  free drinks .  oh  yes .   with nothing else to do  she scanned the rest of the crowd .  everyone  except the growing and  in fact  quite large number of humans  had a beard .  all dwarfs had beards .  it was part of being a dwarf .  here  though  the beards were a little finer than you usually saw around the city and there had been some experimentation with perms and ponytails .  there were mining pickaxes on view  it was true  but carried in expensively tooled bags as if the owner might spot a likely looking coal seam on the way to the shops and wouldn   t be able to help herself .   she shared this thought with juliet  who pointed down at the feet of another well heeled customer and said     wot .  and spoil those gorgeous boots .  they   re snaky cleavehelms  they are .  four hundred dollars a pop  an    you   ve to wait for six months .      glenda couldn   t see the face of the boots    owner  but she did see the change in her body language .  the hint of preening  even from the rear .  well  she thought  i suppose if you   re going to spend all of a working family   s yearly income on a pair of boots it   s nice that someone notices .   when you watch people  you forget that people are watching you .  glenda was not very tall  which meant that from her point of view dwarfs were not very short .  and she realized that they were being approached in a determined kind of way by two dwarfs  one of whom was extremely expansive around the waist and wearing a breastplate so beautifully hammered and ornamented that taking it into battle would be an act of artistic vandalism .  he   and you had to remember that all dwarfs were he unless they asserted otherwise   had  when he spoke  a voice that sounded like the darkest and most expensive type of dark chocolate  possibly smoked .  and the hand he offered had so many rings on each finger that you had to look with care to realize that he was not wearing a gauntlet .  and she was a she  glenda was sure of it  the chocolate was just too rich and fruity .      so glad you could come  my dears     she said  and the chocolate swirled .     i am madame sharn .  i wondered if you could be of assistance to me .  i really would not dream of asking  but i am  as you would put it  between a rock and a hard one .      all this was  to glenda   s annoyance  addressed to juliet  who was eating rat fruit as if there was no tomorrow  which presumably there had not been for the rat .  she giggled .      she   s with me     said glenda  and  without meaning to  added     madame .      madame waved another hand and more rings glistened .     this salon is technically a mine and that means that under dwarf law i am the king of the mine and in my mine my rules go .  and since i am king  i declare that i am queen     she said .     dwarf law bends and creaks but is not broken .         well     glenda began     we   hey .      this was to madame   s smaller companion  who was actually holding a tape measure up against juliet .     that is pepe     said madame .      well  if he   s going to take liberties like that i hope he   s a woman     said glenda .      pepe is   pepe     said madame calmly .     and there is no changing him  as it were  or her .  labels are such unhelpful things  i feel .         especially yours     cos you don   t put the prices on them     said glenda  out of sheer nervousness .      ah yes  you notice these things     said madame  with a wink that disarmed to the point of melting .   pepe looked up excitedly at madame  who went on     i wonder if you  if she   if you both would mind joining me backstage .  the matter is a little delicate .         ooh  yes     said juliet immediately .   out of nowhere  other human girls materialized among the crowd and carefully opened a path towards the back of the enormous room along which madame progressed as though propelled by invisible forces .   glenda felt that the situation had suddenly got away from her  but it had been a good measure of sherry and it whispered to her     why not let a situation get away from you every once in a while .  or even just once    she had no idea what she was expecting behind the gilded door at the far end  but she had not expected smoke and flames and shouting and someone screaming in a corner .  the place looked like a foundry on the day they let the clowns in .      come on through .  don   t let this disturb you     said madame .     it   s always like this at show time .  nerves  you know .  of course  everyone in this business is lowly strung and there is always this problem to begin with with the micromail .  it   s new  you see .  according to dwarf law it must be hallmarked on every link and that would not only be sacrilege  but also bloody difficult to do .     behind the scenes  it appeared that madame became a little less chocolatey and a little more earthy .      micromail .     said juliet  as if she had been shown the gateway to riches .      you know what it is .     said madame .      she talks about nothing else     said glenda .     talks and talks .         well  of course  it   s wonderful stuff     said madame .     almost as soft as cloth  certainly better than leather              and it doesn   t chafe     said juliet .      which is always a consideration for the more traditional dwarf who will not wear cloth     said madame .     old tribal customs  how they hold us back  always pull us back .  we haul ourselves out of the mine  but somehow we always drag a bit of the mine with us .  if i had my way  silk would be reclassified as a metal .  what is your name  young lady .         juliet     said glenda automatically  and then blushed .  that was mumming  pure and simple .  it was almost as bad as getting someone to spit on their handkerchief and wiping their face for them .  the young lady with the drinks had followed them in and chose this moment to take glenda   s sherry glass and replace it with a full one .      would you mind just walking up and down a moment  juliet .     said madame .   glenda wanted to ask why  but since her mouth was full of sherry as an anti embarrassment remedy  she let that one pass .   madame watched juliet critically  one hand cupping the elbow of the other arm .      yes  yes .  but i mean slowly  as if you were not in a hurry to get there and didn   t care     said madame .     imagine you   re a bird in the air  a fish in the sea .  wear the world .         oh  right     said juliet and started again .   by the time juliet was halfway across the floor for the second time  pepe had burst into tears .     where has she been .  where was she trained .     he  or conceivably she  squeaked while clapping his or her cheeks with both hands .     you must hire her at once .         she   s already got a good steady job at the university     glenda said .  but the sherry said     once in a while isn   t over yet .  don   t spoil it .       madame  who clearly had an instinct for this kind of thing  put an arm around her shoulders .     the problem with dwarf ladies  you see  is that a lot of us are a little shy about being the centre of attention .  i also have to bear in mind that dwarf clothing is proving quite interesting to young humans of a certain turn of mind .  your daughter is human       madame turned briefly to juliet .     you are human  aren   t you  dear .  i find it pays to check .      juliet  apparently staring rapturously into a private world  nodded enthusiastically .      oh good     said madame .     and while she is exquisitely well built and moves like a dream  she is not too much taller than the average dwarf and frankly  my dear  some of the ladies would aspire to being a little taller than they are .  this may be letting the side up  but that walk  my word .  dwarfs have hips  of course  but they seldom know what to do with them   i   m sorry  have i said something wrong .      the half pint of sherry so recently consumed by glenda finally gave way under the pressure of her rage .     i am not her mother .  she is my friend .      madame shot her another of those looks that gave her the feeling that her brain was being taken out and examined minutely .     then would you mind if i paid your friend    there was a pause    five dollars to model for me this afternoon .         all right     said the sherry to glenda .     you wondered where i was going to take you and here you are .  can you see the view .  what are you going to do now .         twenty five dollars     said glenda .   pepe clapped her  or possibly his  cheeks again and screamed     yes .  yes .         and a shop discount     said glenda .   madame gave her a long drawn out stare .     excuse me one moment     said the dwarf .   she walked over and took pepe   s arm  walking him at some speed to the corner .  glenda could not hear what was said over some nearby riveting and someone having hysterics .  madame came back smirking artificially  pepe trailing her .     i have a show starting in ten minutes and my best model has dropped her pickaxe on her foot .  we shall negotiate any future engagements .  and will you please stop that jumping up and down  pepe .      glenda blinked .  i cannot believe i just did that  she thought .  twenty five dollars for putting some clothes on .  that   s more than i earn in a month .  that   s just not right .  and the sherry said     what exactly is wrong here .  would you dress up in chain mail and parade in front of a lot of strangers for twenty five dollars .      glenda shuddered .  certainly not  she thought .      well  there you are then     said the sherry .   but it will all end in tears  thought glenda .      no  you   re just saying that because part of you thinks it should     said the sherry .     you know there are far worse things that a girl could do for twenty five dollars than put some clothes on .  take them off  for a start .      but what will the neighbours say .  was the last despairing argument from glenda .      they can stick it up their jumper     said the sherry .     anyway  they won   t know  will they .  dolly sisters doesn   t shop in the maul  it   s far too grand .  look  we   re looking at twenty five dollars .  twenty five dollars to do what you couldn   t stop her doing now with a length of lead pipe .  just look at her face .  she looks as if someone has lit a lamp inside .      it was true .   oh  all right then  thought glenda .      good     said the sherry .     and incidentally  i   m feeling lonely .      and as the tray was at glenda   s elbow again  she reached out automatically .  juliet was now surrounded by dwarfs and  by the sound of it  she was having a lightning education in how to wear clothing .  but it wouldn   t matter  would it .  the truth of the matter was that juliet would look good in a sack .  somehow  everything she wore fitted perfectly .  glenda  on the other hand  never found anything good in her size and indeed seldom found anything in her size .  in theory  something should fit  but all she ever found was facts  which are so unbecoming .        well  we have a nice day for it     said the archchancellor .      looks like rain     said the lecturer in recent runes hopefully .      i suggest two teams of five on a side     said ridcully .     only a friendly game  of course  just to get the hang of it .      ponder stibbons made no comment .  wizards were competitive .  it was a part of wizardry .  wizards have no more idea of a friendly game than cats have of a friendly mouse .  the college lawns stretched out in front of them .     of course  next time we   ll have proper jerseys     said ridcully .     mrs whitlow already has her girls working on that .  mister stibbons .         yes  archchancellor .         you shall be the keeper of the rules and adjudicate fairly .  i will  of course  be captain of one of the teams and you  runes  will captain the other .  as archchancellor  i suggest that i pick my team first and then you will be at liberty to choose yours .         it isn   t actually supposed to work like that  archchancellor     said ponder .     you pick a team member and then he picks a team member until you have enough team members or have run out of team members who aren   t grossly fat or trembling with nerves .  at least that   s how i remember it .     ponder  in his youth  had spent far too long standing next to the fat kid .      oh well  if that   s how it   s done  then i suppose we shall have to do it that way     said the archchancellor with bad grace .     stibbons  it will be your task to penalize the opposing side for any infringements they make .         don   t you mean that i should penalize either side for any infringements they make  archchancellor .     he said .     it has to be fair .      ridcully looked at him with his mouth open as if ponder had mentioned a concept that was totally alien .     oh yes  i suppose it has to be like that .      a variety of wizards had turned out this afternoon from curiosity  a suspicion that being there might turn out to be a good career move  and the prospect of maybe seeing some colleagues travelling across the lawn on their noses .   oh dear  thought ponder as the choosing began .  it was just like school again  but at school nobody wanted the fat boy .  here  of course  it had to be a case of nobody wanted the fattest boy  which  since the departure of the dean  was a matter of fine judgement .   ponder reached into his robes and pulled out a whistle or  perhaps  the grandfather of all whistles  eight inches long and as thick as a generous pork sausage .      where did that come from  mister stibbons .     said ridcully .      as a matter of fact  archchancellor  i found it in the study of the late evans the striped .         it   s a fine whistle     said ridcully .   it was an innocent sentence that managed to hint quite silently that such a fine whistle should not be in the hands of ponder stibbons when it could be in the ownership of  for example  the archchancellor of a university .  ponder spotted this because he had been expecting it .     i shall need this to alert and control the behaviour of both teams     he said haughtily .     you made me the referee  archchancellor  and i   m afraid that for the duration of the game i am  as it were     he hesitated     in charge .         this university is a hierarchy  you understand  stibbons .         yes  sir  and this is a game of football .  i believe that the procedure is to put the football down and when the whistle is blown each side will attempt to hit the goal of the opposing side with the ball while trying to prevent the ball hitting their own goal .  have we all understood that .         it seems pretty clear to me     said the chair of indefinite studies .  there was a murmur of agreement .      nevertheless  before the game i demand a blow on the whistle .         of course  archchancellor  but then you must give it me back .  i am the custodian of the game .     he handed over the whistle .   on ridcully   s first attempt at blowing he dislodged a spider that had been living a blameless yet frugal life for the last twenty years and deposited him in the beard of the professor of natural studies  who was just passing .   the second blow shook free the fossilized pea inside and filled the air with echoes of liquid brass .  and then     ridcully froze .  his face flushed from the neck upwards at speed .  the sound of his next drawn breath was like the vengeance of the gods .  his stomach expanded  his eyes became pinpoints  thunder rolled overhead and he roared     why haven   t you boys brought your kit .  .      st elmo   s fire roared along the length of the whistle .  the sky darkened and fear gripped every watching soul as time reversed and there stood the giant  maniacally screaming evans the striped .  the instigator of badly forged notes from your mother  the enthusiast for long runs in the sleet  the promoter of communal showers as a cure for adolescent shyness and the one who  if you didn   t bring your proper gear  would make you play in your pants .  venerable wizards who had faced down the most cunning of monsters through the decades trembled in damp adolescent fear as the scream went on and on  to be halted as sharply as it started .   ridcully fell forward on to the turf .      i do apologize for that     said dr hix  lowering his staff .     a slightly evil deed  of course  but i   m sure you   ll agree that it was necessary in the circumstances .  the skull ring  remember .  university statute .  and that was a clear case of possession by artefact if ever i saw one .      the collected wizards  the cold sweat beginning to evaporate  nodded sagely .  oh  yes .  it was regrettably necessary  they agreed .  for his own good  they agreed .  had to be done  they agreed .  and this verdict was echoed by ridcully himself when he opened his eyes and said     what the hell was that .         er  the soul of evans the striped  i think  archchancellor     said ponder .      in the whistle  was it .     ridcully rubbed his head .      yes  i think so     said ponder .      and who hit me .      a general shuffling and murmuring indicated that by democratic agreement this was a question that could best be answered by dr hix .      it was acceptable treachery under college statute  sir .  wouldn   t mind the whistle for the dark museum  if nobody objects .         quite so  quite so     said ridcully .     saw the problem  sorted it out .  well done that man .         do you think i could be allowed an evil chuckle  sir .      ridcully brushed himself down .     no .  we shall forgo the whistle  mister stibbons .  and now  gentlemen  let the game commence .      and thus  after a certain amount of bickering  unseen university   s first football match in decades began .  instantly  from ponder stibbons   s point of view  various problems arose .  the most pressing one was that all the wizards were dressed as wizards  which was to say alike .  ponder ordered the teams to play hats on and hats off  which caused another row .  and that particular problem was exacerbated further because there were so many collisions that even the officially hatted kept losing theirs .  and then the game was paused because it was declared that the statue commemorating archchancellor scrubbs   s discovery of blit was in fact three inches narrower than the venerable statue of archchancellor flanker discovering the third breakfast  thus giving an unfair advantage to the hatless squad .   but all these problems  foreseeable and inescapable  paled into insignificance compared with the problem of the ball .  it was an official ball   ponder had made certain of that .  but pointy shoes  even if they have a very long point  cannot absorb the impact of the human foot kicking what is  when all is said and screamed  a piece of wood with a thin cloth and leather wrapping .  eventually  as another wizard was helped away with a sprained ankle  even ridcully was moved to say     this is damn nonsense  stibbons .  there has got to be something better than this .         bigger boots .     suggested the lecturer in recent runes .      the kind of boots you need for kicking this would slow you right down     said ponder .      besides  the men on the urn had nothing at all on their feet .  i suggest we consider this research .  what do we need  stibbons .         a better ball  sir .  and some attempt at running about .  and a general consensus that it is not a good idea to stop to re light your pipe in the middle of play .  a more sensible type of goal  because running into a stone statue is painful .  some grasp  however small  of the notion of teamwork in a gaming situation .  a resolution not to run away if a member of the opposing team is rushing towards you .  an understanding of the fact that you do not handle the ball in any circumstances  may i remind you that i gave up stopping play because of this since you gentlemen  when you were excited  persisted in picking it up and  in one case  hiding it behind your back  and standing on it .  i would like to point out at this juncture that a sense of direction is worth cultivating vis    vis the goal that is yours and the goal that is theirs  inviting as it may be  there is no point in kicking the ball into your own goal  and nor should you congratulate and pat on the back anyone who achieves this feat .  out of the three goals scored in our match  the number scored by players into their own goal was    he paused and looked down at his clipboard    three .  this is a commendably high level of scoring  compared with football as currently played  though once again i must stress that issues of direction and goal ownership are of pivotal importance .  a tactic  which i admit looked promising  was for the players to cluster thickly around their own goal so there was no possibility of anything getting past them .  i regret  however  that if both teams do this you do not have a game so much as a tableau .  a more promising tactic  which seemed to be adopted by one or two of you  was to lurk near the opponents    goal so that if the ball came in your direction you would be ideally placed to get it past the custodian of the goal .  the fact that in some cases you and the opposing custodian leaned companionably against the goal  sharing a cigarette and watching the play up field  showed a decent spirit and may possibly be a good starting point for some more advanced tactics  but i do not think this should be encouraged .  on this general topic  i have to assume that retiring from the field of play for the call of nature or a breather is acceptable  but doing so for a snack is not .  my feeling  archchancellor  is that our colleagues    general desire to be never more than twenty minutes from some savouries may be satisfactorily catered for by a pause in the middle of the game .  happily  if they changed ends at that point  that would satisfy the complaints about one goal being larger than the other .  yes .     this was to the chair of indefinite studies .      if we change ends     said the chair  who had put his hand up     will that then mean that the goals that were scored into our own goal will now become goals scored against the opposing team since that goal is now physically theirs .      ponder considered the metaphysics of answering this one and settled for     no  of course not .  i have a whole list of other notes  archchancellor  and regrettably they add up to us not being very good at football .      the wizards fell silent .     let   s start with the ball     said ridcully .     i   ve got an idea about the ball .         yes  sir .  i thought you would .         then come and see me after dinner .        juliet had been sucked into the manic circus that was the backstage area of shatta  and no one was paying glenda any attention whatsoever .  just for now  she was a hindrance  surplus  no use to anyone  an obstruction to be worked around  an onlooker in the game .  a little way away  a handsome young dwarf with a double ponytail beard was waiting patiently while a temporary rivet was put into what looked like a silver cuirass .  she was surrounded by workers in much the same way as a knight is when his vassals must dress him for combat .  standing a little apart from them were two taller dwarfs  whose weaponry looked slightly more functional than beautiful .  they were male .  glenda knew this simply because any female of any sapient species knows the look of a man who has nothing very much to do in an environment that  for this time  is clearly occupied by and totally under the control of females .  it looked as though they were on guard .   propelled by the sherry  she wandered over .     that must cost a lot of money     she said to the nearest guard .  he looked slightly embarrassed by the approach .      you   re telling me .  moonsilver  they call it .  we   re even having to walk down the catwalk with her .  they say it   s the coming thing  but i dunno .  it won   t take an edge and it wouldn   t stop a decent blade .  you need igors to help you smelt it  too .  they say it   s worth even more than platinum .  looks good  though  and they say you hardly know you   re wearing it .  it   s not what my granddad would have called a metal  but they say that we have to move with the times .  personally  i wouldn   t even hang it on the wall  but there you go .         girl   s armour     said the other guard .      what about this micromail stuff .     said glenda .      ah  different pocketful of rats entirely  miss     said the first guard .     i hear they set up and forge it right here in the city     cos the best craftsmen are here .  just the job  eh .  chain mail as fine as cloth and strong as steel .  it   ll get cheaper  too  they say  and most of all it doesn   t           wotcher  glendy  guess who .      someone tapped glenda on the shoulder .  she turned round and saw a vision of heavily but tastefully armoured beauty .  it was juliet  but glenda only knew this because of the milky blue eyes .  juliet was wearing a beard .      madame says i   d better wear this     she said .     it   s not dwarf if it don   t include a beard .  what d   you think .      this time the sherry got in first .      it   s actually rather attractive     said glenda  still in mild shock .     it   s very   silvery .      it was a female beard  she could tell .  it looked styled and stylish and didn   t have bits of rat in it .      madame says there   s a place saved for you in the front row     said juliet .      oh  i couldn   t sit in the front row       glenda began  on automatic  but the sherry cut in with     shut up  stop thinking like your mother  will you  and go and sit down in the damn front row .      one of the ever present young ladies chose this exact moment to take glenda by the hand and lead her slightly unsteady feet through the settling chaos  out through the door and back into fairyland .  there was indeed a seat waiting for her .   fortunately  although in the front row it was off to one side .  she would have died of shame had it been right in the middle .  she clutched her handbag in both hands and risked a look along the row .  it was packed .  it wasn   t exclusively dwarf  either  there were a number of human ladies  smartly dressed  a little on the skinny side  in her opinion   almost offensively at ease and all talking .   another sherry mystically appeared in her hand and  as the noise stopped with rat trap sharpness  madame sharn came out through the curtain and began to address the crowded hall .  glenda thought  i wish i   d worn a better coat   at which point the sherry tucked her up and put her to bed .   glenda only started to think properly again some time later  when she was hit on the head by a bunch of flowers .  they struck her just over the ear and as expensive petals rained around her she looked up at the beaming  radiant face of juliet  at the very edge of the catwalk  halfway through the motions of shouting    duck .         and there were more flowers flying and people standing and cheering  and music  and in general the feeling of being under a waterfall with no water but inexhaustible torrents of sound and light .   out of it all juliet exploded  throwing herself at glenda and flinging her arms around her neck .      she wants me to do it again .     she panted .     she says i could go to quirm and genua  even .  she says she   ll pay me more if i don   t work for no one else and the world is an oyster .  i never knew that .         but you   ve already got a steady job in the kitchen       said glenda  only three quarters of her way into consciousness .  later  more often than she liked  she remembered saying those words while the applause thundered all around them .   there was a gentle pressure on her shoulder  and here was one of the interchangeable young women with a tray .     madame sends her compliments  miss  and would like to invite you and miss juliet to join her in her private boudoir .         that   s nice of her  but i think we should be getting   a boudoir  you say .         oh yes .  and would you like another drink .  it   s a celebration  after all .      glenda looked around at the chattering  laughing and  above all  drinking crowd .  the place felt like an oven .      all right  but not that sherry  thank you all the same .  have you got something very cold and fizzy .         why  yes  miss .  lots .     the girl produced a large bottle and expertly filled a tall fluted glass with  apparently  bubbles .  when glenda drank it  the bubbles filled her  too .      mm  quite nice     she ventured .     a bit like lemonade grown up .         that   s how madame drinks it  certainly .         er  this boudoir     glenda tried  following the girl rather unsteadily .     how big is it .         oh  pretty large  i think .  there must be about forty people in there already .         really .  that   s a big boudoir .     well  thank goodness  glenda thought .  that at least is sorted out .  they really ought to put proper explanations in these novels .   she had never been sure  given that she had no idea what sort of thing a boudoir was  what sort of thing you would find in it when you did .  she found that it contained people  heat and flowers not flowers in bunches  but in pillars and towering stacks  filling most of the air with clouds of sticky perfume while the people below filled the rest of it with words  tightly packed .  no one could possibly hear what they were saying  glenda told herself  but perhaps that wasn   t important .  perhaps what was important was being there to be seen to say it .   the crowd parted  and she saw juliet  still in the glittering outfit  still in the beard   being there .  salamanders were flashing on and off  which meant people with iconographs  didn   t it .  the trashy papers were full of people glittering for the picture .  she had no time for them .  what made it worse was that her disapproval mattered not a fig to anyone .  the people glittered anyway .  and here was juliet  glittering most of all .      i think i could do with a little fresh air     she mumbled .   her guide led her gently to an unobtrusive doorway .     restrooms through here  ma   am .     and they were   except that the long  carefully lit room was like some kind of fairy tale  all velvet and drapes .  fifteen surprised visions of glenda stared at her from as many mirrors .  it was overpowering enough to make her sit down in a very expensive bendy legged chair that turned out to be very restful  too     when she jerked awake  she staggered out  got lost in a dark world of smelly passages choked with packing cases and finally blundered into a very large room indeed .  it was more like a cavern  at the far end were a pair of double doors  probably ashamed to let in a grey light which did not so much illuminate as accuse .  another chaos of empty clothes racks and packing cases was scattered around the floor .  in one place  water had dripped from the roof  and a puddle had formed on the stone  soaking some cardboard .      there they are  in there with their glitter and their finery  and it   s all muck and rubbish round the back  right  dear .     said a voice in the dark .     you look like a lady who can spot a metaphor when she stares it in the face .         something like that     muttered glenda .     who   s doing the asking .      an orange light glowed and faded in the gloom .  someone was smoking a cigarette in the shadows .      it   s the same all over  love .  if there was an award for the arse end of things  there   d be a real bloody squabble for first place .  i   ve seen a few palaces in my time and they   re all the same  turrets and banners in the front  maids    bedrooms and water pipes round the back .  fancy a top up .  can   t be walking around here with an empty glass  you   ll stand out .      the cooler air was making her feel better .  she still had a glass in her hand .     what is this stuff .         well  if this was any other party it   d probably be the cheapest fizzing wine you could strain through a sock  but madame won   t stint .  it   s the real stuff .  champagne .         what .  i thought only nobby people drank that .         no  just people with money  love .  sometimes it   s the same thing .      she looked closer  and gasped .     what .  are you pepe .         that   s me  love .         but you   re not all   all       she waved her hands frantically .      off duty  love .  don   t have to worry about       he waved his hands equally frantically .     i   ve got a bottle here of our very own .  care to join me .         well  i ought to be getting back in there           why .  to fuss around her like an old hen .  leave her be  love .  she   s a duck who   s just found water .      pepe looked taller in this gloom .  maybe it was the language and the lack of flapping .  and  of course  anyone next to madame sharn would look small .  he was willowy  though  like someone made of sinews .      but anything could happen to her .      pepe   s grin gleamed .     yes .  but probably won   t .  my word  she sold micromail for us  and no mistake .  told madame i had a good feeling .  she   s got a great career in front of her .         no  she   s got a good  steady job in the night kitchen  with me     said glenda .     it might not be big money  but it   ll turn up every week .  on the nail  and she won   t lose it if someone prettier comes along .         dolly sisters  right .  sounds like the botney street area     said pepe .     i   m sure of it .  not too bad  as i recall .  i didn   t get beaten up much down there  but at the end of the day they   re all crab buckets .      glenda was taken aback .  she   d expected anger or condescension  not this sharp little grin .      you know a lot about our city for a dwarf from uberwald  i must say .         no  love  i know a lot about uberwald for a boy from lobbin clout     said pepe smoothly .     old cheese alley  to be precise .  local lad  me .  wasn   t always a dwarf  you know .  i just joined .         what .  can you do that .         well  it   s not like they advertised .  but yeah  if you know the right people .  and madame knew the right people  ha  knew quite a lot about the right people .  it wasn   t hard .  i   ve got to believe in a few things  there   s a few observances  and of course i have to keep off the old booze       he smiled as her glance pinned the glass in his hand  and went on     too quick  love  i was going to add    when i   m working     and good job too .  it doesn   t matter if you are shoring up the mine roof or riveting a bodice  being a piss artist is bloody stupid .  and the moral of all this is  you have to grab life or drop back into the crab bucket .         oh yes  that   s all very well to say     glenda snapped  wondering what crabs had got to do with anything .     but in real life people have responsibilities .  we don   t have shiny jobs with lots of money  but they are real jobs doing things that people need .  i   d be ashamed of myself  selling boots at four hundred dollars a go  which only rich people can afford .  what   s the point of that .         well  you must admit that it makes rich people less rich     said the chocolate voice of madame behind her .  like many large people  she could move as quietly as the balloon she resembled .     that   s a good start  isn   t it .  and it goes to wages for the miners and the smiths .  it all goes around  they tell me .      she sat down heavily on a packing case  glass in hand .     well  we   ve got most of them out now     she said  fumbling in her capacious breastplate with her spare hand and pulling out a thick wad of paper .      the big names want to be in on this and everyone wants it exclusively and we   re going to need another forge .  tomorrow i   ll go and see the bank .     she paused to dip into her metal bodice again .     as a dwarf i was raised in the faith that gold is the one true currency     she said  counting out some crisp notes     but i have to admit this stuff is a lot warmer .  that   s fifty dollars for juliet  twenty five from me and twenty five from the champagne  which is feeling happy .  juliet said to give it to you to look after .         miss glenda thinks that we   ll lead her treasure into a lifetime of worthless sin and depravity     said pepe .      well  that   s a thought     said madame     but i can   t remember when i last had some depravity .         tuesday     said pepe .      a whole box of chocolates is not depraved .  besides  you slid out the card between the layers  which confused me .  i did not intend to eat the bottom layer .  i did not want the bottom layer .  it was practically assault .      pepe coughed .     we   re scaring the normal lady  love .      madame smiled .     glenda  i know what you   re thinking .  you   re thinking we   re a couple of louche evil clowns who booze away in a world of smoke and mirrors .  well  that   s fairly accurate right now  but today was the end of a year   s hard work  you see .      and you bicker like an old married couple  glenda thought .  her head was aching .  she   d tried a rat fruit  that was the trouble  she was sure of it .      in the morning i   m going to show these orders to the manager of the royal bank and ask him for a lot of money .  if he trusts us  can you .  we need juliet .  she just   sparkles .      and you two are holding hands .  tightly .  something soft snapped inside glenda .      all right  look     she said .     it   s like this .  jools is going to come back home with me tonight  to get her head straight .  tomorrow   well  we   ll see .         we can   t ask for more than that .  can we .     said madame  patting glenda on the knee .     you know  juliet thinks the world of you .  she said she   d need you to say yes .  she was telling all the society ladies about your pies .         she   s been talking to society ladies .     said glenda in astonishment laced with trepidation and tinted with wonder .      certainly .  they all wanted a close look at the micromail  and she just chatted away  cheery as you like .  i don   t think anyone ever said    wotcher .     to them in their lives before .         oh no .  i   m sorry .         why be .  they were rather taken by it .  and apparently you can bake pickled onions into a pie so that they stay crunchy .         she told them that .         oh  yes .  i gather that they all intend to get their cooks to try it out .         hah .  they   ll never find the way .     said glenda with satisfaction .      so jools says .         we   generally call her juliet     said glenda .      she told us to call her jools     said madame .     is there a problem .         well  er  not really a problem     glenda began wretchedly .      that   s good  then     said madame  who clearly knew when not to notice subtleties .     now let   s prise her away from her new friends  and you can see to it that she gets a good night   s sleep .      there was laughter  and the girls helping with the show streamed out into the clammy place that was the midwife to beauty .  juliet was among them  and with the loudest laugh .  she broke away when she saw glenda and gave her another hug .     oh  glendy  isn   t this great .  it   s like a fairy story .         yes  well  it might be     said glenda     but they don   t all have happy endings .  just you remember you have a good job now  with prospects and regular leftovers to take home .  that   s not to be lightly thrown away .         no  it should be hurled with great force     said pepe .     i mean  what is this .  emberella .  the wand has been waved  the court is cheering  a score of handsome princes are waiting to sign up for just a sniff of her slipper  and you want her to go back to work making pumpkins .      he looked at their blank faces .     all right  perhaps that came out a little confused  but surely you can follow the seam .  this is a big chance .  as big as it gets .  a way out of the bucket .         i think we   ll go home now     said glenda primly .     come along  jools .         see     said pepe  when they had gone     it   s a crab bucket .      madame peered into a bottle to see if  against all probability  one glassful yet remained .     did you know she more or less raised the kid .  jools will do what she says .         what a waste     said pepe .     don   t take the world by storm  stay here and make pies .  you think that   s a life .         someone has to make pies     madame said  with an infuriating calm reasonableness .      oh  pur lease .  not her .  let it not be her .  and for leftovers .  oh no .      madame picked up another empty bottle .  she knew it was empty because it was in the vicinity of pepe at the end of a long day  but she examined it anyway because thirst springs eternal .      hmm .  it might not come to that     she said .     i have a feeling that miss glenda is just about to start thinking .  there   s a powerful mind behind that rather sad cloak and those awful shoes .  today might be its lucky day .        ridcully strode through the corridors of unseen university with his robes flapping confidently behind him .  he had a big stride and ponder had to run in a semi crabwise fashion to keep up with him  his clipboard clutched protectively to his chest .     you know we did agree that it wasn   t to be used for purposes other than pure research  archchancellor .  you actually signed the edict .         did i .  i don   t remember that  stibbons .         i remember it most distinctly  sir .  it was just after the case of mister floribunda .         which one was he .     said ridcully  still striding purposefully ahead .      he was the one who felt a little peckish and asked the cabinet for a bacon sandwich to see what would happen .         i thought that anything taken out of the cabinet had to be returned in    .    hours recurring .         yes  sir .  that is the case  but the cabinet appears to have strange rules that we do not fully understand .  in any case  mister floribunda   s defence was that he thought the fourteen hour rule didn   t apply to bacon sandwiches .  nor did he tell anybody and so the students on his floor were only alerted when they heard the screams some fourteen hours later .         correct me if i   m wrong     said ridcully  still covering the flagstones at an impressive rate     but would it not have been digested by that point .         yes  sir .  but it still went back to the cabinet  of its own accord  you might say .  that was quite an interesting discovery .  we did not know that could happen .      ridcully stopped and ponder bumped into him .     what exactly did happen to him .         you wouldn   t want me to draw a picture  sir .  however  the good news is that he will soon be out of the wheelchair .  in fact  i gather he   s already walking quite well with a stick .  how we discipline him is  of course  up to you  sir .  the file is on your desk  as are  indeed  a considerable number of other documents .      ridcully strode off again .     he did it to see what would happen  did he .     he said cheerfully .      so he said  sir     said ponder .      and this was against my express orders  was it .         yes  absolutely definitely  sir     said ponder  who knew his archchancellor and already had an inkling of how this one was going to end .     and so therefore  sir  i must insist that he       he walked into ridcully again because the man had stopped outside a large door on which was a bright red notice saying     no item to be removed from this room without the express permission of the archchancellor .  signed ponder stibbons pp mustrum ridcully .         you signed this one for me .     ridcully said .      yes  sir .  you were busy at the time and we had agreed on this one .         yes  of course  but i don   t think that you should pp just like that .  remember what that young lady said about the uu .      ponder produced a large key and opened the door .     may i also remind you  archchancellor  that we agreed a moratorium on the use of the cabinet of curiosity until we had cleaned up some of the residual magic in the building .  we still don   t seem to have got rid of the squid .         did we agree  mister stibbons     said ridcully  turning around sharply     or did you agree with yourself pp me  as it were .         well  er  i think i understood the spirit of your thinking  sir .         well  this is the spirit of pure research     said ridcully .     it   s research into how we can hope to save our cheeseboard .  many would say there could be no greater goal .  as for young floribunda           yes  sir .     said ponder wearily .      promote him .  whatever level he is  move him up one .         i think that   ll send the wrong kind of signal     ponder tried .      on the contrary  mister stibbons .  it will send exactly the right message to the student body .         but he disobeyed an express order  may i point out .         that   s right .  he showed independent thinking and a certain amount of pluck  and in the course of so doing added valuable data to our understanding of the cabinet .         but he might have destroyed the whole university  sir .         right  in which case he would have been vigorously disciplined  if we   d been able to find anything left of him .  but he didn   t and he was lucky and we need lucky wizards .  promote him  on the direct order of me  not pp   d at all .  incidentally  how loud were his screams .         as a matter of fact  archchancellor  the first one was so heartfelt that it kept going long after he   d run out of breath and apparently adopted an independent existence .  residual magic again .  we   ve had to lock it in one of the cellars .         did he actually say what the bacon sandwich was like .         coming or leaving  sir .     said ponder .      only coming  i think     said ridcully .     i do have a vivid imagination after all .         he said it was the most delightful bacon sandwich he   d ever eaten .  it was the bacon sandwich that you dream of when you hear the words bacon sandwich and never  ever quite get .         with brown sauce .     said ridcully .      of course .  apparently  it was the bacon sandwich to end all bacon sandwiches .         it nearly did  for him  but isn   t that what you already know about the cabinet .  that it always delivers a perfect specimen .         actually  we know very little for certain     said ponder .     what we do know is that it will hold nothing too large to fit inside a cube measuring    .    inches recurring on a side  that it will cease working if  we now know  a non organic object is not replaced in it in    .    hours recurring  and that none of its contents are pink  although we do not know why this should be .         but bacon is definitely organic  mister stibbons     said ridcully .   ponder sighed .     yes  sir  we don   t know why that is either .      the archchancellor took pity on him .     perhaps it was one of those very crispy ones     he suggested kindly .     the kind that you can break between your fingers .  i like that in a bacon sandwich .      the door swung open and there it was .  small  in the centre of a very large room     the cabinet of curiosity .      do you think this is wise .     said ponder .      of course not     said ridcully .     now find me a football .      on one wall was a white mask  such as one might wear to a carnival .  ponder turned towards it .     hex .  please find me a ball suitable for the game of football .         that mask is new .     said ridcully .     i thought hex   s voice travelled in blit space .         yes  sir .  it just comes out of the air  sir .  but somehow  well  it feels better to have something to talk to .         what shape football do you require .     said hex  his voice as smooth as clarified butter .     oval or spherical .         spherical     said ponder .   instantly the cabinet shook .   the thing had always worried ridcully .  it looked too smug  for a start .  it seemed to be saying  you don   t know what you are doing .  you use me as a kind of lucky dip and i bet you have never thought of how many dangerous things can fit into a fourteen inch cube .  in fact  ridcully had thought about that  often at three in the morning  and never went into the room without a couple of sub critical spells in his pocket just in case .  and then there was nutt   well  hope for the best and prepare for the worst  that was the uu way .   a drawer slid out and went on sliding until it reached the wall and presumably continued to slide into some other hospitable set of dimensions  because it never turned up outside the room  no matter how often you looked .      very smooth today     he observed  as another drawer rose up from under the floor and sprouted a further drawer exactly the same size as itself which began to move purposefully towards the far wall .      yes .  the lads at brazeneck have come up with a new algorithm for handling wave spaces in higher level blit .  it speeds up something like the cabinet by getting on for       drinkies .      ridcully frowned .     did you just make that up .         no  sir .  charlie drinkie came up with it at brazeneck .  it   s a shorter way of saying        iterations to the first negative blit .  and it   s a lot easier to remember .         so people you know at brazeneck send you stuff .     said ridcully .      oh  yes     said ponder .      for free .         of course  sir     said ponder  looking surprised .     the free sharing of information is central to the pursuit of natural philosophy .         and so you tell them things  do you .      ponder sighed .     yes  of course .         i don   t think i approve of that     said ridcully .     i   m all for the free sharing of information  provided it   s them sharing their information with us .         yes  sir  but i think we   re rather hampered by the meaning of the word    sharing    .         nevertheless     ridcully began and stopped .  a sound so quiet that they had barely noticed it had stopped .  the cabinet of curiosity had folded itself up and was once again just a piece of wooden furniture in the centre of the room  but as they looked at it its two front doors opened and a brown ball dropped on to the floor and bounced with a sound like gloing .  ridcully marched over and picked it up  turning it in his hands .      interesting     he said  slamming it towards the floor .  it bounced up past his head  but he was quick enough to catch it on the way down .     remarkable     he said .     what do you think of this  stibbons .     he flicked the ball into the air and kicked it hard across the room .  it came back towards ponder  who  to his own amazement  caught it .      seems to have a life of its own .     ponder dropped it on to the floor and tried a kick .   it flew .   ponder stibbons was the quintessential  all time holder of the one hundred metre note from his auntie  which also asked for him to be excused all sporting activities on account of his athlete   s ear  erratic stigmatism  a grumbling nose and a revolving spleen .  by his own admission  he would rather run ten miles  leap a five bar gate and climb a big hill than engage in any athletic activity .   the ball sang to him .  it sang gloing .   a few minutes later  he and ridcully walked back to the great hall  occasionally bouncing the ball on the flagstones .  there was something about the sound of gloing .  that made you want to hear it again .      you know  ponder  i think you   ve been doing it all wrong .  there are more things in heaven and disc than are dreamed of in our philosophies .         i expect so  sir .  i don   t have many things in my philosophies .         it   s all about the ball     said ridcully  slamming it down hard on the flagstones again and catching it .     tomorrow  we   ll bring it here and see what happens .  you gave the ball a mighty kick  mister stibbons  and yet you are  by your own admission  a wet and a weed .         yes  sir  and a wuss  and i am proud of the appellation .  i   d better remind you  archchancellor  that the thing mustn   t spend too long outside the cabinet .      gloing .      but we could make a copy  couldn   t we .     said ridcully .     it   s only leather stitched together  probably protecting a bladder of some sort .  i bet any decent craftsman could make another one for us .         what  now .         the lights never go off on the street of cunning artificers .      by now  they were back in the great hall and ridcully looked around until his gaze lighted on two figures pushing a trolley laden with candles .     you lads  to me .     he shouted .  they stopped pushing the trolley and walked over to him .     mister stibbons here would like you to run an errand for him .  it   s of considerable importance .  who are you .         trevor likely  guv .         nutt  archchancellor .      ridcully   s eyes narrowed .     yes   nutt     he said  and thought about the spells in his pocket .     the candle dribbler  yes .  well  you can make yourselves useful .  over to you  mister stibbons .      ponder stibbons held out the ball .     have you any idea what this is .      nutt took it out of his hands and bounced it on the tiles a couple of times .   gloing .  gloing .      yes .  it appears to be a simple sphere  although technically i believe it to be  in actual fact  a truncated icosahedron  made by stitching together a number of pentagons and hexagons of tough leather  and stitching means holes and holes let the air leak   ah  there is lacing just here  you see .  there must be some internal bladder   animal  probably .  a balloon  as it were  for lightness and elasticity  encapsulated by leather  simple and elegant .     he handed the ball back to ponder  who was open mouthed .      do you know everything  mister nutt .     he said with the sarcasm of a born pedagogue .   nutt   s reply was concentrated and there was a lengthy pause before he said     i   m not sure about a lot of the detail  sir .      ponder heard a snigger behind him and felt himself redden .  he   d been cheeked  by a dribbler  even if nutt was the most incontinently erudite one he   d ever encountered .      do you know where a copy of this may be made .     said ridcully loudly .      i expect so     said nutt .     i believe dwarf rubber will be our friend here .         there   s plenty of dwarfs up at old cobblers who could knock one up  guv     said trev .     they   re good at this sort of thing  but they   d want paying  they always want paying .  nuffin   s on credit when you   re dealing with a dwarf .         give these young gentlemen twenty five dollars  mister stibbons  will you .         that   s a lot of money  archchancellor .         yes  well  dwarfs  while the salt of the earth  don   t have much of a grasp of small numbers and i want this in a hurry .  i   m sure i can trust mister likely and mister nutt with the money  can   t i .     he said it jovially  but there was an edge to his voice .  trev  at least  got the message very quickly  a wizard could trust you because of the hellish future he could unleash on you if his trust was betrayed .      you can certainly trust us  guv .         yes  i thought i could     said ridcully .   when they had gone  ponder stibbons said     you   re entrusting them with twenty five dollars .         yes  indeed     said ridcully cheerfully .     it will be interesting to see the outcome .         nevertheless  sir  i have to say that it was an unwise move .         thank you for your input  mister stibbons  but may i gently remind you who is the guv around here .        glenda and juliet took a trolley bus home  another huge extravagance but  of course  glenda was carrying more money than she had ever seen at one go .  she had stuffed the notes into her bodice     la madame  and it seemed to generate a heat of its own .  you were safe on a troll .  anyone wanting to mug a troll would have to use a building on a stick .   juliet was quiet .  this puzzled glenda  she had expected her to bubble like a fountain full of soap flakes .  the silence was unnerving .      look .  i know it was a lot of fun     glenda said     but showing off clothes isn   t like a real job  is it .     no .  real jobs pay a lot less  she thought .   where had that come from .  jools hadn   t opened her mouth and the troll was still covered in mountain lichen and had a single syllable vocabulary .  it came from me  she thought .  this is about dreams  isn   t it .  she is a dream .  i dare say the micromail is good stuff  but she made it sparkle .  and what can i say .  you help in the kitchen .  you are useful and helpful  at least when you   re not daydreaming  but you don   t know how to keep accounts or plan a weekly menu .  what would you do without me .  how would you get on away from here  in foreign parts where folks are so odd .      i   ll have to open a bank account for you     she said aloud .     it   ll be our little secret  all right .  it   ll be a nice little nest egg for you .         and if dad don   t know i   ve got the money he won   t get it off me and piss it against the wall     said juliet  glancing up at the solemn  impassive face of the troll .  if glenda had known how to say    pas devant le troll    she would have done so .  but it was true  mr stollop commanded that all family earnings were pooled  with him holding the pool  which was then pooled with his friends in the bar of the turkey   vegetables  and ultimately pooled again in the reeking alley behind it .   she settled for     i wouldn   t put it quite like that .        gloing .  gloing .   the new ball was magic  that   s what it was .  it bounced back to trev   s waiting hand as if by its own free will .  for two pins he   d risk kicking it  but he and nutt and the ball were already picking up a trail of curious street urchins such that he would be guaranteed never to see it again .      are you really sure you know    ow it works .     he said to nutt .      oh  yes  mister trev .  it   s a lot simpler than it looks  although the polyhedrons will need some work  but overall        a hand landed on trev   s shoulder .     well  now .  trev likely     said andy .     and his little pet  harder to kill than a cockroach  by all accounts .  something   s going on  ain   t it  trev .  and you   re going to tell me what it is .  here  what   s that you   re holding .         not today  andy     said trev  backing away .     you   re lucky you didn   t end up in the tanty with mister one drop measurin    you up for a hemp collar .         me .     said andy innocently .     i didn   t do a thing .  can   t blame me for what a thicko stollop does  but something is going on with the football  ain   t it .  vetinari wants to muck it about .         just leave it alone  will you .     said trev .   there was more than the usual gang behind andy .  the stollop brothers had sensibly spared the streets their presence lately  but people like andy could always find followers .  like they said  it was better to be beside andy than in front of him .  and with andy you never knew just when he was     the cutlass was out in one movement .  that was andy .  whatever it was inside that held back the primeval rage could flick off just like that .  and here came the blade with trev   s future written on it in very short words .  and it stopped in mid air and nutt   s voice said     i believe i could squeeze with enough pressure  andy  to make your bones grind and flow .  there are twenty seven bones in the human hand .  i truly believe that i could make every one of them useless with the slightest extra pressure .  however  i would like to give you a chance to revise your current intentions .      andy   s face was a mix of colours  a white that was almost blue and a rage that was almost crimson .  he was trying to pull away and nutt stood calmly and was completely immoveable .     get    im .     andy hissed at the world in general .      could i regretfully remind you gentlemen that i have another hand .     said nutt .   he must have squeezed because andy yelped as his hand ground against the weapon   s handle .   trev knew all too well that andy did not have friends  he had followers .  they were looking at their stricken leader and they were looking at nutt  and they could see very clearly not only that nutt had a spare hand  but what he was capable of doing with it .  they did not move .      very well     said nutt .     perhaps this has been nothing more than an unfortunate misunderstanding .  i am about to release my grip just enough for you to drop the cutlass  mister andy  please .      there was another intake of breath from andy as the cutlass landed on the stones .      now  if you would excuse us  mister trev and i are going to walk away .         take the bloody cutlass .  don   t leave the cutlass on the ground     said trev .      i am sure mister andy would not come after us     said nutt .      are you bloody mad .     said trev .  he reached down  snatched up the cutlass and said     let    im go and let   s get a move on .         very well     said nutt .  he must have squeezed a little harder because now andy slumped to his knees .   trev pulled nutt away and towed him through the permanent city crowd .     that   s andy .     he said  hurrying them along .     you don   t expect logic with andy .  you don   t expect him to    learn the error of his ways    .  don   t look for any sense when andy   s after you .  got that .  don   t try talkin    to    im as if    e   s a human being .  now  keep up with me .        dwarf shops were doing well these days  largely because they understood the first rule of merchandising  which is this  i have got goods for sale and the customer has got money .  i should have the money and  regrettably  that involves the customer having my goods .  to this end  therefore  i will not say    the one in the window is the last one we have  and we can   t sell it to you  because if we did no one would know we have them for sale     or    we   ll probably have some more on wednesday     or    we just can   t keep them on the shelves     or    i   m fed up with telling people there   s no demand for them    i will make a sale by any means short of physical violence  because without one i am a waste of space .   glang snorrisson lived by this rule  but he didn   t like people much  an affliction that affects many who have to deal with the general public over a long period  and the two people on the other side of his counter were making him edgy .  one was small and looked harmless  but something so deep down in glang   s psyche that it was probably stuffed in his genes was making him nervous .  the other intru   customer was not much more than a boy and therefore likely to commit a crime any moment .   glang dealt with the situation by not understanding anything they said and uttering silly insults in his native tongue .  there was hardly a risk .  only the watch learned dwarfish  and it came as a surprise when the worryingly harmless one said  in better llamedos dwarfish than glang himself spoke these days     such incivility to the amiable stranger shames your beard and erases the writings of tak  ancient merchant .         what did you say to him .     trev asked  as glang spluttered out apologies .      oh  just a traditional greeting     said nutt .     could you pass me the ball  please .     he took the football and bounced it on the floor .   gloing .      i suspect you might know the trick of making brimstoned rubber .         that was my   my grandfather   s name     glang stuttered .      ah  a good omen     said trev quickly .  he caught the ball and batted it down again .   gloing .      i can cut out and stitch the outer cover if you will work on the bladder     said nutt     and we will pay you fifteen dollars and allow you a licence to make as many more as you wish .         you   ll make a fortune     said trev encouragingly .   gloing .  gloing .  went the ball  and trev added     that   d be a university licence  too .  no one would dare mess with it .         how come you know about brimstoned rubber .     said glang .  he had the look about him of someone who knows that he is outnumbered but will go down fighting .      because king rhys of the dwarfs presented a dress of brimstoned rubber and leather to lady margolotta six months ago  and i   m pretty sure i understand the principle .         her .  the dark lady .  she can kill people with a thought .         she is my friend     said nutt calmly     and i will help you .        glenda wasn   t quite sure why she tipped the troll tuppence .  he was elderly and slow  but his upholstery was well kept and he had twin umbrellas and it was no fun for trolls to come this far  because the kid gangs would have graffitied them to the waist by the time they got out of there .   she felt hidden eyes on her as she walked up to her door  and it didn   t matter .      all right     she said to juliet .     have a night off  okay .         i   ll go back to work with you     said juliet  to her surprise .     we need the money and i can   t tell dad about the fifty dollars  can i .      there was a small collision of expectations in glenda   s head as juliet went on     you   re right  it   s a steady job and i want to keep it an    i   m so fick i   d prob   ly muck up the other one .  i mean  it was fun and all that  but then  i thought  well  you always gave me good advice  an    i remembered that time you kicked greasy damien in the goolies so hard when he was messin    me around  he walked bent double for a week .  besides  if i go away with them it means leaving the street  and dad and the lads .  that   s really scary .  an    you said be careful about fairy stories  and you   re right  half the time it   s goblins .  an    i don   t know how i   d get on without you puttin    me right .  you are solid  you are .  i can   t remember you not bein    around  and when one of the girls sniggered about your old coat i told her you work very hard .      glenda thought  i used to be able to read you like a book   one with big colourful pages and not many words .  and now i can   t .  what   s happening .  you   re agreeing with me and i ought to feel smug about it  but i don   t .  i feel bad about it  and i don   t know why  and that hurts .      maybe you ought to sleep on it     she suggested .      no  i   d mess it up  i know i would .         do you feel all right .     something inside glenda was shouting at her .      i   m okay     said juliet .     oh  it was fun and that  but it   s for nobby girls  not me .  it   s all glitter  nuffin    you can hold .  but a pie   s a pie  right .  solid .  besides  who   d look after dad and the lads .      no  no  no  screamed glenda   s voice in her own head  not that .  i didn   t want that .  oh  didn   t i .  then what did i think i was doing  passing on all that old toot .  she looks to me  and i   ve gone and given her a good example .  why .  because i wanted to protect her .  she   s so   vulnerable .  oh dear  i   ve taught her to be me  and i   ve even made a bad mess of that chore .      all right  then  you can head back with me .         will we see the banquet .  our dad has been fretting about the banquet .  he reckons lord vetinari is going to have everyone murdered .         does he do that a lot .         yes  but it gets hushed up  our dad says .         there   s going to be hundreds of people there .  that would need a lot of hush .     and if i don   t like what i hear  there won   t be enough hush in all the world  she thought .     trev mooched aimlessly around the shop while nutt and the dwarf put their heads together over the ball .  for some reason there was a faint scrabbling on the roof .  it sounded like claws .  just a bird  he told himself .  even andy wouldn   t come in through the roof .  there was another pressing matter .  this place would have a privy  wouldn   t it .  there was at least a back door and that would inevitably lead to a back alley and  well  what is a back alley for except for sleeping tramps and the call of nature .  possibly in the same place if you were feeling cruel .   trev unbuckled his belt  faced a noisome wall and stared upwards nonchalantly  as a man does in these circumstances .  however  most men don   t look up into the astonished faces of two birdlike women who were standing  no  perching on the roof .  they screeched awk .  awk .  and flew up into the darkness .   trev scuttled quickly and damply back into the shop .  this city got bloody stranger every day .   after that  time flew past for trev  and every second stank of sulphur .  he   d seen nutt dribbling candles  but that was at snail   s pace compared with the speed at which the leather was cut for the ball .  but that wasn   t creepy  that was just nutt .  what was creepy was that he didn   t measure anything .  eventually  trev couldn   t stand it any more  and stopped leaning against the wall  pointed to one of the multi sided little leather strips and said     how long is that .         one and fifteen sixteenths of an inch .         how can you tell without measuring .         i do measure  with my eyes .  it is a skill .  it can be learned .         an    that makes you worthy .         yes .         an    who judges .         i do .         here we are  mister nutt  still warm     said glang  arriving from the back of the shop holding something that looked like something taken from an animal that was now  you hoped for its own sake  dead .      of course  i could do a lot better with more time     he continued     but if you blow down this little tube        trev watched in wonder  and it occurred to him that in all his life he   d made a few candles and a lot of mess .  how much was he worth .   gloing .  gloing .   two balls in harmony  thought trev  but clapped as nutt and glang shook hands  then  while they were still admiring their handiwork  he reached behind him and slipped a dagger off the bench and into his pocket .   he wasn   t a thief .  oh  fruit off stalls  but everyone knew that didn   t count  and picking a toff   s pocket was just a case of social redistribution  everyone knew that  too  and maybe you found something that looked lost  well  someone would pick it up  so why not you .   weapons got you killed  often because you were holding one .  but things were going too far .  he had heard andy   s bones creak and nutt had brought the man to his knees without sweating .  and there were two reasons for taking precautions right there .  one was that if you put andy down you   d better put him out  right out  because he would come back  blood around the corner of his mouth .  and two  the worst  was that right now nutt was more worrying than andy .  at least he knew what andy was     carrying a ball each  they hurried back to the university  with trev keeping a watchful eye on high buildings .     it   s amazin    what   s turnin    up in this city     he said .     there were a couple of vampire types back there  did you know .         oh  those .  they work for ladyship .  they are there for protection .         whose .     said trev .      do not worry about them .         hah .  and do you know something even stranger has happened this evening .     said trev  as the university hove into sight .     you offered that dwarf fifteen dollars and he didn   t even haggle .  like  that   s unheard of .  must be the power of gloing .         yes  but i actually gave him twenty dollars     said nutt .      why .  he didn   t ask for anythin    more .         no  but he did work very hard and the extra five dollars will more than repay him for the dagger you stole while our backs were turned .         i never did .     said trev hotly .      your automatic  unthinking and spring loaded reply is noted  mister trev .  as was the sight of the dagger on the bench  shortly followed by the sight of the empty space where the dagger had been .  i am not angry  because i saw you most sensibly toss mister shank   s wretched cutlass over a wall and i understand your nervousness  but nevertheless i must point out that this is stealing .  and so i ask you  as my friend  to take the dagger back in the morning .         but that will leave    im up by five dollars and his dagger back .     trev sighed .     but at least we   ve got a few dollars each     he said  as they entered the back door of the university .      yes  and then again no  mister trev .  you will take the remaining five dollars and this rather grubby although genuine receipt for twenty dollars to mister stibbons  who thinks you are no good  thus making him doubt his original assumption that you are a thief and a scallywag and assisting your progress in this university .         i   m not a       trev began and stopped  honest enough to acknowledge the knife in his coat .     honestly  nutt  you   re one of a kind  you are .         yes     said nutt .     i am coming to that conclusion .          wotcher .   the word  in huge type  shouted out from the front page of the times  next to a big picture of juliet glittering in micromail and smiling right at the reader .  glenda  frozen for the last fifteen seconds in the act of raising a piece of toast to her mouth  finally bit .   now she blinked and dropped the toast to read       mystery model    jewels    was the toast of an astounding fashion show at shatta yesterday when she was the very incarnation of micromail  the remarkable metal    cloth    about which there has been so much speculation in recent months and which  she confirms  does not chafe .  she chatted happily and with fetching straightforward earthiness to dignitaries to whom  this writer is certain  no one has ever said    wotcher    before .  they appeared to find the experience refreshing and entirely without chafe       glenda stopped reading at this point because the question    how much trouble are we going to get into about this .     was attempting to fill her whole head .  and there was no trouble  was there .  and there would not be .  there couldn   t be .  first  who would think that the beauty in the silver beard  like some goddess of the forge  was a cook   s assistant .  and  second  there was no trouble to be had  unless someone tried to make it  in which case they would have to go through glenda and glenda would go through them  in very short order .  because jools was wonderful .  she had to admit it .  the girl brought radiant sunshine to the page  and suddenly it was plain  it would be a crime to hide all that grace and beauty in a cellar .  so what if she had a vocabulary of fewer than seven hundred words .  there were more than enough people who were stuffed tight as an egg with words  and who would want to see any of them on the front page .   anyway  she thought  as she pulled her coat on  it would be a nine minute wonder in any case and besides  she added to herself  it wasn   t as if anyone would spot it was juliet .  after all  she was wearing a beard and that was amazing  because there was no way that a woman in a beard should look attractive  but it worked .  imagine that catching on .  you   d have to spend twice as long at the hairdresser   s .  someone   s going to think about that  she thought .   there was no sound from the stollops    house .  she wasn   t surprised .  juliet did not have much grasp of the idea of punctuality .  glenda popped next door to see how the widow crowdy was and then headed  in the drizzling rain  back to her safe haven of the night kitchen .  halfway there an all but forgotten pressure in her bodice reminded her of her duty and she dared go into the royal bank of ankh morpork .   trembling with fear and defiance  she walked up to a clerk at his desk  slapped fifty warm dollars in front of him and said     i want to start a bank account  all right .     she left five minutes later with a shiny account book and the delightful recollection that a posh looking man at a posh looking desk in a posh looking building had called her madam  and enjoyed the sensation until it ran into the reality that madam had better roll up her sleeves and get to work .   there was a lot to do .  she made pies at least a day ahead so that they could mature  and mister nutt   s appetite last night had put quite a large dent in her pantry .  but at least there wouldn   t be much demand for pies tomorrow night .  even the wizards didn   t call for a pie after a banquet .   ah  yes  the banquet  she thought  as the rain started to soak into her coat .  the banquet .  she would have to see about the banquet .  sometimes if you wanted to go to the ball you had to be your own fairy godmother .   there were several obstacles requiring the touch of a magic wand  mrs whitlow did indeed operate a certain kind of apartheid between the night and day kitchens  as if one flight of stairs actually changed who you were .  the next difficulty was that glenda did not have  according to the traditions of the university  the right kind of figure to serve at table  at least when there were visitors  and  lastly  glenda did not have the temperament for serving at table .  it wasn   t that she didn   t know how to smile  she was quite capable of smiling  if you gave her enough warning  but she positively hated having to smile at people who actually merited  instead  a flick around the earhole with a napkin .  she hated taking away plates of unfinished food .  she always had to suppress a tendency to say things like    why did you put it on your plate if you didn   t intend to finish it .     and    look  you   ve left more than half of it and it cost a dollar a pound     and    of course it   s cold  but that   s because you   ve been playing footsie with the young lady opposite and haven   t been concentrating on your dinner     and when all else failed    there   s little children in klatch you know         it was a phrase of her mother   s  but she   d obviously missed some significant part of it .   she hated waste  she thought to herself as she walked along the stone corridor towards the night kitchen .  there never needed to be any if you knew your way around a kitchen and if your diners had the decency to take your food seriously .  she was rambling to herself .  she knew that .  occasionally she would pull the front page of the times out of her bag and take a look at it again .  it had all really happened and there was the proof .  but  it was a funny thing  every day something happened that was important enough to be on the front page of the newspaper .  she   d never bought it and seen a little sign that said    not much happened yesterday  sorry about that    .  and tomorrow  wonderful though that picture was  it would be wrapping up fish and chips and everyone would have forgotten about it .  that would be a load off her mind .   there was a polite cough .  she recognized it as belonging to nutt  who had the politest cough there could possibly be .     yes  mister nutt .         mister trev has sent me with this letter for miss juliet  miss glenda     said nutt  who had apparently been waiting by the steps .  he held it out as if it were some double edged sword .      she   s not come in yet  i   m afraid     said glenda as nutt followed her up the steps     but i   ll put it on the shelf over here where she   ll be bound to see it .     she looked at nutt and saw his eyes firmly fixed on the pie racks .     oh  and i do seem to have made one apple pie more than called for .  i wonder if you could assist me by removing it from the premises .      he gave her a grateful smile  took the pie and hurried away .   alone again  glenda looked at the envelope .  it was the cheapest sort  the kind that looked as if it had been made from recycled lavatory paper .  and somehow  it seemed to have got a bit bigger .   inexplicably  she found herself recalling that the gum on those envelopes was so bad that when it came to sealing them it was probably better to just have a very bad cold .  anyone could simply open it up  see what it said  dig out a bit of earwax and no one would be any the wiser .   but that would have been a very bad thing to do .   glenda thought that same thought fifteen times before juliet walked into the night kitchen  hung up her coat on the hook and put on her apron .     there was a man on the bus readin    the paper and it had a picture of me on the front     she said excitedly .   glenda nodded and handed over her own paper .      well  i suppose it   s me     said juliet  with her head on one side .     what shall we do now .         open the damn letter .     shouted glenda .      what .     said juliet .      er  oh  trev sent you a letter     said glenda .  she snatched it from the shelf and held it out .     why don   t you read it right now .         he   s probably just mucking about .         no .  why don   t you just read it right now .  i haven   t tried to open it .      juliet took the envelope .  it opened more or less to a touch .  glenda   s evil side thought  hardly any gum at all .  i could have just flicked it open .      i can   t read with you standin    so close     said juliet .  after some time moving her lips she went on     i don   t get it .  it   s all kinda long words .  lovely curly writing  though .  there   s a bit here saying that i look like a summer   s day .  what   s that all about  then .     she pressed it into glenda   s hand .     can you read it for me  glendy .  you know i   m not good at complicated words .         well  i   m a bit busy     said glenda     but since you ask .         first time i   ve ever had a letter that   s not all in capitals     said juliet .   glenda sat down and started to read .  a lifetime of what even she would call bad romantic novels suddenly bore fruit .  it read as though someone had turned on the poetry tap and then absent mindedly gone on holiday .  but they were wonderful words  nevertheless .  there was the word swain  for example  which was a definite marker  and quite a lot about flowers and quite a lot of what looked like pleading  wrapped up in fancy letters  and after a while she took out her handkerchief and fanned the air around her face .      so  what   s it all about .     said juliet .   glenda sighed .  how to begin .  how did you talk to juliet about similes and metaphors and poetic licence all wrapped up in wonderful curly writing .   she did her best .     weeell  basically he   s saying that he really fancies you  thinks you   re really fit  how about a date  no hanky panky  he promises .  and there   s three little x   s underneath .      juliet started to cry .     that   s loverlee .  fancy    im sitting down and writing all those words just for me .  real poetry just for me .  i   m gonna sleep with it under my pillow .         yes  i suspect that he had something like that in mind     said glenda and thought  trev likely a poet .  not likely at all .     there was a dreadful load on pepe   s bladder  and he was stuck between a rock and a hard place  if that wasn   t too offensive a description of lying between madame and a wall .  she was still asleep .  she snored magnificently  using the traditional multi part snore  known to those who are fortunate enough to have to listen to it every night as the    errgh  errgh  errghh  blorrrt .     symphony .  and she was lying on his leg .  and the room was pitch dark .  he managed to retrieve his leg  half of which had gone to sleep  and set out on the well known search for porcelain  which began by him putting his foot down on an empty champagne bottle  which skittered away and left him flat on his back .  in the gloom he groped for it  found it  tested it for true emptiness  because you never knew your luck  and  as it were  filled it again  putting it down on what was probably a table  but in his mind and the darkness could just as well have been an armadillo .   there was another sound syncopating with madame   s virtuoso performance .  it must have been that which woke him .  by groping  he located his shorts and after only three tries managed to get them the right way up and the right way round .  they were a little chilly .  that was the problem with micromail  it was  after all  metal .  on the other hand  it did not chafe and you never had to wash it .  five minutes on the fire and it was as hygienic as anything .  besides  pepe   s version of the shorts held a surprise all of their own .   thus feeling that he could face the world  or at least the part of it that would need to see only the top of him  he shuffled and stubbed his way to the shop   s door  checking every bottle along the way for evidence of liquid content .  remarkably  a bottle of port had survived with fifty per cent remaining capacity .  any port in a storm  he thought  and drank his breakfast .   the shop   s door was rattling .  it had a small sliding aperture by which the staff could determine whether they wanted to let a prospective customer in  because when you are a posh shop like shatta  you don   t sell things to just anyone .  pairs of eyeballs zigzagged back and forth across his vision as people clustered on the other side of the door and fought for attention .  somebody said     we   re here to see jewels .         she   s resting     said pepe .  that was always a good line and could mean anything .      have you seen the picture in the times .     said a voice .  then     look     as a vision of juliet was held up in front of the door .   blimey  he said to himself .     she had a very tiring day     he said .      the public wants to know all about her     said a sterner voice .   and a rather less aggressive female voice said     she seems to be rather amazing .         she is .  she is     said pepe  inventing desperately     but a very private person and a bit artistic too  if you know what i mean .         well  i   ve got a big order to place     said yet another voice as the owner managed to shuffle for slot space .      oh  well  we don   t have to wake her up for that .  just give me a moment and i   ll be right with you .     he took another swig of the port .  when he turned around  madame  in a nightshirt that could have accommodated a platoon  at least if they were very friendly  was bearing down on him with a glass in one hand and the champagne bottle in the other .      this stuff   s gone horribly flat     she said .      i   ll go and find some fresh     he replied  snatching it from her quickly .     we   ve got newspaper people and customers out there and they all want jools .  can you remember where she lives .         i   m sure she told me     said madame     but it all seems a long time ago .  that other one  glenda i think  works at some big place in the city  as a cook .  anyway  why do they want to see her .         there   s a wonderful picture in the times     said pepe .     you know when you said you thought we   d get rich .  well  it looks like you weren   t thinking big enough .         what do you suggest  dear .         me .     said pepe .     take the order  because that   s good business  and tell the others that jools will see them later .         do you think they   ll go for that .         they   ll have to  because we don   t know where the hell she is .  there   s a million dollars walking around this city on legs .        rhys  low king of the dwarfs  paid particular attention to the picture of the wonderful girl .  the definition wasn   t too bad at all .  the technique of translating the clacks semaphore signal into a black and white picture was quite well advanced these days .  even so  his people in ankh morpork must have thought this particularly interesting to merit the expense of the bandwidth required .  certainly  it was exercising a lot of other dwarfs  but in the low king   s experience  it was possible to find someone  somewhere  who objected to anything .  he looked at the grags in front of him .  so simple for people like vetinari  he thought .  he just has religions to deal with .  we don   t have religions .  being a dwarf is a religion in itself  and no two priests ever agree  and sometimes it seems that every other dwarf is a priest .     i see nothing here to disturb me     he said .      we believe the beard to be a false one     said one of the grags .      that is perfectly acceptable     said the king .     there is absolutely nothing in any precedent that bans false beards .  they are a great salvation to those who find beards hard to grow .         but she looks  well  alluring     said one of the other grags .  they were indistinguishable under their tall  pointed leather cowls .      attractive  certainly     said the king .     gentlemen  is this going to take long .         it must be stopped .  it   s not dwarfish .         oh  but it manifestly is  is it not .     said the king .     micromail is one hundred per cent mail and you don   t get any more dwarfish than that .  she is smiling and while i would agree that dwarfs do not appear to smile very much  certainly not when they come to see me  i think we could profit from her example .         it   s positively an offence against morality .         how .  where .  only in your heads  i feel .      the tallest grag said     so you intend to do nothing .      the king paused for a moment  staring at the ceiling .     no  i intend to do something     he said .     first of all  i shall see to it that my staff find out just how many orders there have been for micromail originating from here in bonk today .  i   m sure shatta would not object to them seeing their records  especially since i intend to tell madame sharn that she can come back and establish her premises here .         you would do that .     said a grag .      yes  of course .  we have nearly concluded the koom valley accord  a peace with the trolls that no one ever thought they would see .  and i am fed up  gentlemen  with your whining  moaning and endless  endless attempts to re fight battles that you have already lost .  as far as i am concerned  this young lady is showing us a better future and now  if you are not out of my office in ten seconds  i will charge you rent .         there will be trouble over this .         gentlemen  there is always trouble .  but this time i will be making it for you .      as the door slammed shut behind them  the king sat back in his chair .      well done  sir     said his secretary .      they   ll keep on .  i can   t imagine what being a dwarf would be like if we didn   t argue all the time .     he squirmed a little in his chair .     you know  they   re right when they say it doesn   t chafe and it   s not as cold as you would imagine .  do ask our agent to express my thanks to madame sharn for her generous gift  will you .        even this early in the day  the great hall of the university was a general thoroughfare .  most of the tables were pushed back against the walls or  if someone felt like showing off  levitated to the ceiling  and the huge black and white slabs of the floor  worn smooth by the footfalls of millennia  were polished still further as today   s faculty and students took a short cut to various concerns  destinations and  very occasionally  when no viable excuse presented itself  to lectures .   the great chandelier had been swung down and off to one side for its daily replenishing of candles  but there was  fortunately for mustrum ridcully   s purposes  a large expanse of clear floor .   he saw the figure he was waiting for hurrying towards him .     how did it go  mister stibbons .         extremely well  i have to say  sir     said ponder .  he opened the sack he was carrying .     one of these is our original ball and one of them is the ball that nutt and trevor likely had made last night .         ah  spot the ball     said ridcully .  he picked them both up in his enormous hands and dropped them on the flagstones .   gloing .  gloing .      perfectly identical     he said .      trevor likely said they had it made by a dwarf for twenty dollars     said ponder .      did he really .         yes  sir  and he gave me the change and the receipt .         you seem puzzled  mister stibbons .         well  yes  sir .  i feel i have been rather misjudging him .         possibly even small leopards can change their shorts     said ridcully  slamming him on the back convivially .     call it score one for human nature .  now  which of these balls is the one that   s going back to the cabinet .         amazingly  sir  they did think to mark the new ball and there   s a tiny little dot of white paint on this one here   i mean this one here   i think it was here   ah .  here it is .  it   s ours .  i   ll send one of the students to put the other one back shortly .  we still have an hour and a half .         no  i   d rather you did it yourself  mister stibbons  i   m sure it would only take a few minutes .  do hurry back  i   d like to try a little experiment .      when ponder returned  he found ridcully loitering unobtrusively by one of the big doors .     you have your notebook ready  mister stibbons .     he said quietly .      and a fresh pencil  archchancellor .         very well  then .  the experiment begins .      ridcully gently rolled the new football out on to the floor  straightened up and glanced at his stopwatch .      ah  the ball has been kicked aside by the professor of illiberal studies  quite possibly by accident   now one of the bledlows  mister hipney i think his name is  has kicked it somewhat uncertainly .  one of the students  pondlife  i believe  has prodded it back   we have momentum  mister stibbons .  undirected  it is true  but promising .  ah  but we can   t have this        no touching the ball with your hands  gentlemen .     shouted the archchancellor  deftly trapping the travelling ball with his boot .     that   s a rule .  we really could do with that whistle  stibbons .      he bounced the ball on the stone floor .   gloing .      don   t just mess about like kids kicking a tin .  play football .  i am the archchancellor of this university  by io  and i will rusticate  or otherwise expel  any man who skives off without a note from his mother  hah .      gloing .      you will arrange yourself into two teams  set up goals and strive to win .  no man will leave the field of play unless injured .  the hands are not to be used  is that clear .  any questions .     a hand went up .  ridcully sought the attached face .      ah  rincewind     he said  and  because he was not a determinedly unpleasant man  amended this to     professor rincewind  of course .         i would like permission to fetch a note from my mother  sir .      ridcully sighed .     rincewind  you once informed me  to my everlasting puzzlement  that you never knew your mother because she ran away before you were born .  distinctly remember writing it down in my diary .  would you like another try .         permission to go and find my mother .      ridcully hesitated .  the professor of cruel and unusual geography had no students and no real duties other than to stay out of trouble .  although ridcully would never admit it  it was against all reason an emeritus position .  rincewind was a coward and an unwitting clown  but he had several times saved the world in slightly puzzling circumstances .  he was a luck sink  the archchancellor had decided  doomed to being a lightning rod for the fates so that everyone else didn   t have to .  such a person was worth all his meals and laundry  including an above average level of soiled pants  and a bucket of coal every day even if he was  in ridcully   s opinion  a bit of a whiner .  however  he was fast  and therefore useful .      look     said rincewind     a mysterious urn turns up and suddenly it   s all about football .  that bodes .  it means something bad is going to happen .         come now  it could be something wonderful     ridcully protested .   rincewind appeared to give this due consideration .     could be wonderful  will be dreadful .  sorry  that   s how it goes .         this is unseen university  rincewind .  what is there to fear .     ridcully said .     apart from me  of course .  good heavens  this is a sport .     he raised his voice .     arrange yourselves into two teams and play football .      he stepped back and joined ponder .  the dragooned footballers  having been given clear instructions in a loud voice  went into a huddle to find out by hubbub what they should actually do instead .      i can   t believe this     said ridcully .     every boy knows what to do when they   ve found something to kick  don   t they .     he cupped his hands .     come on  two captains step up .  i don   t care who it is .     this took rather more time than might have been expected since those who had not surreptitiously left the hall could see that the post of football captain was one that offered a wonderful chance for being the target of the archchancellor   s mercurial wrath .  eventually two sacrifices were pushed forward and found it too difficult to push their way back into the ranks again .      now  i say again  pick the teams alternately .     he took off his hat and flung it to the ground .     now we all understand this .  it   s a boy thing .  it   s like little girls and the colour pink .  you know how to do this .  pick the teams alternately so one of you ends up with the weird kid and the other with the fat kid .  some of the fastest mathematics of all time has been achieved by team captains trying not to end up with the weird kid   stay where you are  rincewind .      ponder gave an involuntary shudder as his schooldays came running back  jeering at him .  the fat kid in his class had been the unfortunately named    piggy    love  whose father owned a sweet shop  which gave the son some weight in the community  not to mention clout .  that had left only the weird kid as the natural target for the other boys  which meant a chronic hell for ponder until that wonderful day when sparks came out of ponder   s fingers and martin sogger   s pants caught fire .  he could smell them now .  best days of your life be buggered  the archchancellor could be a bit crass and difficult at times  but at least he wasn   t allowed to give you a wedgie        are you listening to me  stibbons .      ponder blinked .     er  sorry  sir  i was   calculating .         i said  who   s the tall feller with the tan and the dinky beard .         oh  that   s professor bengo macarona  archchancellor .  from genua  remember .  he   s swapped with professor maidenhair for a year .         oh  right .  poor old maidenhair .  perhaps he won   t get laughed at so much in a foreign language .  and mister macarona   s here to better himself  yes .  put a bit of polish on his career  no doubt .         hardly  sir .  he   s got doctorates from unki  qis and chubb  thirteen in all  and a visiting professorship at bugarup  and he has been cited in two hundred and thirty six papers and  er  one divorce petition .         what .         the rule about celibacy isn   t taken seriously over there  sir .  very hot blooded people  i understand  of course .  his family owns a huge ranch and the biggest coffee plantation outside klatch  and i think his grandmother owns the macarona shipping company .         so why the hell did he come here .         he wants to work with the best  sir     said ponder .     i think he   s serious .         really .  oh  well  he seems like a sensible chap  then .  er  the divorce thing .         don   t know much  sir  it got hushed up  i believe .         angry husband .         angry wife  as i heard it     said ponder .      oh  he was married  was he .         not to my knowledge  archchancellor .         i don   t think i quite understand     said ridcully .   ponder  who was not at all at home in this area  said very slowly     she was the wife of another man   i  er  believe  sir .         but i        to ponder   s relief  light dawned on ridcully   s huge face .     oh  you mean he was like professor hayden .  we used to have a name for him        ponder braced himself .      snakes .  very keen on them  you know .  could talk for hours about snakes with a side order of lizards .  very keen .         i   m glad you feel like that  archchancellor  because i know that a number of the students           and then there was old postule  who was in the rowing team .  coxed us through two wonderful years .     ponder   s expression did not change  but for a few moments his face went pink and shiny .     a lot of that sort of thing about  apparently     said ridcully .     people make such a fuss .  anyway  in my opinion there   s not enough love in the world .  besides  if you didn   t like the company of men you wouldn   t come here in the first place .  i say .  well done  that man .     this was because  in the absence of ridcully   s attention  the footballers had at last started their own kick about and some quite fancy footwork was emerging .     yes  what .      a bledlow had appeared alongside ridcully .      gentleman to see the archchancellor  sir .  he   s a wizard  sir .  the  er  the dean  as was  only he says he   s an archchancellor too .      ridcully hesitated  but you   d have had to be an experienced ridcully watcher  like ponder  to notice the moment .  when the archchancellor spoke  it was calmly and carefully  every word hammered on the anvil of self control .      what a pleasant surprise  mister nobbs .  do show the dean in .  oh  and please do not glance at mister stibbons for confirmation  thank you .  i am still the archchancellor in these parts .  the only one  in fact .  is there a problem  mister stibbons .         well  sir  it is a bit public in here       ponder stopped  because suddenly he had nobody   s attention .  he hadn   t seen the ball bounce towards bledlow nobbs  no relation  .  nor the vicious kick the latter gave it  just as he would an impertinent intrusion by a street urchin   s tin can .  ponder did see the ball curving majestically through the air  heading for the other end of the hall where  behind the organ  rose the stained glass window dedicated to archchancellor abasti  which on a daily basis showed one of several thousand scenes of a mystical or spiritual nature .  the intuition with which ponder had successfully calculated the distance and trajectory of the ball told him that the current glowing picture of    bishop horn realizing that the alligator quiche was an unwise choice    had appeared just in time to be extremely unlucky .   and then  like some new planet swimming into the ken of a watcher of the skies  as they are prone to do  a rusty red shape arose  unfolding as it came  snatched the ball out of the air and landed on the organ keyboard to the sound of gloing .  in b flat .      well done  that ape .     the archchancellor boomed .     a beautiful save  but  regrettably  against the rules .      to ponder   s surprise there was a murmur of dissent from all the players .     i believe that decision may benefit from some consideration     said a small voice behind them .      who said that .     said ridcully  spinning round and looking into the suddenly terrified little eyes of nutt .      nutt  sir .  the candle dribbler .  we met yesterday .  i helped you with the ball    .         and you are telling me i   m wrong .  are you .         i would rather you thought of me as suggesting a way in which you could be even more right .          ridcully opened his mouth and then shut it again .  i know what he is  he thought .  does he .  or did they spare him that .      very well  mister nutt .  is there a point you wish to make .         yes  sir .  what is the purpose of this game .         to win  of course .         indeed .  regrettably  it is not being played that way .         it isn   t .         no  sir .  the players all want to kick the ball .         and so they should  surely .     said ridcully .      only if you believe the purpose of the game is healthy exercise  sir .  do you play chess .         well  i have done .         and would you have thought it proper for all the pawns to swarm up the board in the hope of checkmating the king .      for a moment  ridcully had a mental vision of lord vetinari holding aloft a solitary pawn and saying what it might become        oh  come now  that is quite different .     he burst out .      yes  but the skill lies in marshalling resources in the right way .      ridcully saw a face appear behind nutt  like a rising moon of wrath .      you don   t talk to the gentlemen  nutt  it is not your place to take up their time with your chatter        ridcully writhed in sympathy with nutt  all the more so because smeems  as is the habit of such people  kept looking at the archchancellor as if seeking and  worse  expecting approval of this petty tyranny .   but authority must back up authority  in public at least  otherwise there is no authority  and therefore the senior authority is forced to back up the junior authority  even if he  the senior authority  believes that the junior authority is a tiresome little tit .      thank you for your concern  mister smeems     he said     but in fact i asked mister nutt his opinion of our little kick about  since it is the game of the people and he is rather more people than i am .  i will not keep him long from his duties  mister smeems  nor you from yours  which i know are both vital and pressing .      small  insecure authority can spot  if it is sensible  when a larger authority is giving it a chance to save face .      right you are  sir .     said smeems after only a second   s hesitation  and he scurried off to safety .  the thing called nutt appeared to be trembling .   he thinks he   s done something wrong  ridcully thought  and i shouldn   t think of him as a thing .  some wizard   s sense made him look round into the face of   what was the lad   s name .    trevor likely .      do you have anything else to add  mister likely .  only i   m a bit busy at the moment .         i gave mister stibbons the change and the receipt     said trevor .      what is it you do around here  young man .         i run the candle vats  guv .         oh  do you .  we   re getting some very good dribbling from you fellows these days .      trev appeared to let this pass .     mister nutt is not in any trouble  is he  guv .         not to my knowledge .      but what do i know .  ridcully asked himself .  mr nutt  by definition  is trouble .  but the librarian says he potters about repairing things and is generally an amiable milksop  and he talks as though he   s giving a lecture .   this little man  who actually  when you look at him  is not as little as he appears because he weighs himself down with humility   this little man was born with a name so fearsome some peasants chained him to an anvil because they were too scared to kill him .  perhaps vetinari and his friends are right in their smug way and a leopard can change his shorts .  i hope so  because if they aren   t  a leopard will be a picnic .  and any minute now  the dean is coming  damn his treacherous hide .      only he   s my friend  guv .         well  that   s good .  everyone should have a friend .         i   m not gonna let anyone touch    im  guv .         a brave ambition  young man  if i may say so .  nevertheless  mister nutt  why did you object when i pointed out that the librarian  wonderful though his rising save was  was in infringement of the rules .      nutt didn   t look up  but in a small voice said     it was elegant .  it was beautiful .  the game should be beautiful  like a well executed war .         oh  i don   t think many people would say that war is very jolly     said ridcully .      beauty can be considered to be neutral  sir .  it is not the same as nice or good .         i thought it was the same as truth  though     said ponder  trying to keep up .      which is often horrible  sir  but mister librarian   s leap was both beautiful  sir  and good  sir  and therefore must be true and therefore the rule which should prevent him from doing it again would be proved to be neither beautiful nor true and would  indeed  be a false law .         that   s right  guv     said trev .     people will shout for that stuff .         do you mean that they   d cheer for a goal not achieved .     said ponder .      of course they will .  and groan .  it   s something happening     ridcully snorted .     you saw the game the other day .  if you were lucky  you got a glimpse of a lot of large  grubby men fighting over a ball like a lump of wood .  people want to see goals scored .         and saved  remember .     trev pointed out .      exactly  young man     agreed ridcully .     it must be a game of speed .  this is the year of the pensive hare  after all .  people get bored so easily .  no wonder there are fights .  we need  do we not  to make a sport that is more exciting than beating other people over the head with big weapons .         that one   s always been very popular     said ponder doubtfully .      well  we are wizards  after all .  and now i must go and greet the bloody  the so called archchancellor of brazeneck so called college in the correct damn spirit of fraternal goodwill .         so called     murmured ponder  not quite softly enough .      what say .     the archchancellor bellowed .      just wondering what you want me to do  archchancellor .         do .  keep    em playing .  see who   s good at it .  work out what the most beautiful rules are     ridcully called out  heading out of the hall at speed .      by myself .     said ponder  horrified .     i   ve got a huge workload .         delegate .         you know i   m hopeless at delegating  sir .         then delegate the job of delegating to someone who isn   t .  now  i must be off before he steals the silverware .        it was very rare for glenda to take time off .  being the head of the night kitchen was a mental state  not a physical one .  the only meal she ever ate at home was breakfast  and that was always in a hurry .  but now she   d stolen some time to sell the dream .  may hedges was looking after the kitchen and she was reliable and got on with everyone and so there were no worries there .   the sun had come out and now she knocked on the rear door of mr stronginthearm   s workshop .  the dwarf opened the door with rouge all over his fingers .     oh  hello  glenda .  how   s it going .      she thumped a wad of orders on the table proudly and opened the suitcase .  it was empty .     and i need a lot more samples     she said .      oh  that   s wonderful     said the dwarf .     when did you get these .         this morning .      it had been easy .  door after door seemed to have opened for her and every time a little voice in her head said     are you doing the right thing .     a slightly deeper voice  which sounded remarkably like madame sharn  said     he wants to make it .  you want to sell it .  they want to buy it .  the dream goes round and round and so does the money .         the lipstick went down very well     she said .     those troll girls put it on with a trowel and i   m not kidding .  so what you ought to do  sir  is sell a trowel .  a pretty one  in a nice box with sprinkles on it .      he gave her an admiring look .     this isn   t like you  glenda .         not sure about that     said glenda  as more samples were dropped into the battered case .     have you thought about getting into shoes .         do you think it would be worth a try .  they don   t normally wear shoes .         they didn   t wear lipstick until they moved here     said glenda .     it could be the coming thing .         but they   ve got feet like granite .  they don   t need shoes .         but they   ll want them     said glenda .     you could be in on the ground floor  as it were .      stronginthearm looked puzzled and glenda remembered that even city dwarfs were used to the topsy turvy language of home .     oh  sorry  i meant to say the top floor .         and then there   s dresses     said glenda .     i   ve been looking around and no one makes proper dresses for trolls .  they   re just outsized human dresses .  and they   re cut to make the troll look smaller  but they   d be better if they were cut to make them look bigger .  more like a troll and less like a fat human .  you know  you want the clothing to shout     i   m a great big troll lady and proud of it    .         have you been hit on the head with something .     said stronginthearm .     because  if so  i   d like it to drop on me .         well  it   s spreading the dream  isn   t it .     said glenda  carefully arranging the samples in her suitcase .     it   s a bit more important than i thought .      she made fourteen more successful calls before calling it a day  posted the orders through stronginthearm   s letterbox and  with a light case and uncharacteristically light heart  went back to work .     ridcully turned the corner and there  right in front of him  was   his mind spun as it sought for the correct mode of address     archchancellor    was out of the question     dean    too obvious an insult     two chairs    ditto with knobs on  and    ungrateful  backstabbing  slimy bastard    took too long to say .  what the hell was the bastard   s name .  great heavens  they   d been friends since their first day at uu      henry .     he exploded .     what a pleasant surprise .  what brings you here to our miserable and sadly out of date little university .         oh  come now  mustrum .  when i left  the lads were pushing back the boundaries of knowledge .  it   s been a bit quiet since  i gather .  by the way  this is professor turnipseed .      there appeared from behind the self styled archchancellor of brazeneck  like a moonlet moving out of the shadow of a gas giant  a sheepish young man who instantly reminded ridcully of ponder stibbons  although for the life of him he couldn   t make out why .  perhaps it was the look of someone permanently doing sums in his head  and not just proper sums either  but the sneaky sort with letters in them .      oh  well  you know how it is with boundaries     ridcully mumbled .     you look at what   s on the other side and you realize why there was a boundary in the first place .  good afternoon  turnipseed .  your face is familiar .         i used to work here  sir     said turnipseed sheepishly .      oh yes  i recall .  in the high energy magic department  yes .         a coming man  our adrian     said the former dean  proprietorially .     we have our own high energy magic building now  you know .  we call it the higher energy magic building  but i stress that this is only to avoid confusion .  no slight on good old uu is intended .  adopt  adapt  improve  that   s my motto .      well  if you adapted it then it   s now grab  copy and look innocent  ridcully thought  but carefully .  senior wizards never rowed in public .  the damage was apt to be appalling .  no  politeness ruled  but with sharpened edges .      i doubt there will be any confusion  henry .  we are the senior college  after all .  and of course i am the only archchancellor in these parts .         by custom and practice  mustrum  and times are changing .         or being changed  at least .  but i wear the archchancellor   s hat  henry  as worn by my predecessors down the centuries .  the hat  henry  of supreme authority in the affairs of the wise  the cunning and the crafty .  the hat  in fact  on my head .         it isn   t  you know     said henry cheerfully .     you are wearing the everyday hat that you made yourself .         it would be on my head if i wanted it to be .      henry   s smile was glassy .     of course  mustrum  but the authority of the hat has often been challenged .         almost correct  old chap .  in fact  it is the ownership of the hat that has  in the past  been disputed  but the hat itself  never .  now  i note that you yourself are wearing a particularly spiffy hat of a magnificence that goes beyond the sublime  but it is just a hat  old boy  just a hat .  no offence meant  of course  and i am sure that in another millennium it will have become weighted with dignity and wisdom .  i can see that you have left plenty of room .      turnipseed decided to make a run for the lavatories right now  and with a muted apology pushed past ridcully and sped away .   oddly enough  the sudden lack of an audience lowered the tension rather than increased it .   henry pulled a slim packet out of his pocket .     cigarette .  i know that you roll your own  but verdant and scour make these specially for me and they are rather fine .      ridcully took one  because a wizard  however haughty  who would not accept a free smoke or a drink would be in his coffin  but he took care not to notice the words    archchancellor   s choice    in garish type on the packet .   as he handed the packet back  something small and colourful dropped out on to the floor .  henry  with an agility unexpected in a wizard so far up the main sequence as described in the well known owlspring tips diagram   reached down quickly and snatched it up  muttering something about    not letting it get dirty    .      you could eat your dinner off these floors     said ridcully sharply  and probably would  he added to himself .      only the collectors get so annoyed if there is a speck of dust on them and i give mine to the butler   s little boy     henry went on blithely .  he turned the pasteboard over and frowned .     notable wizards of our time  no .    of     dr able baker  bc  hons   fdl  kp  pdf  escrow   director of blit studies  brazeneck .  i   m sure he   s already got this one .     he dropped it into a waistcoat pocket .     never mind  good for swapsies .      ridcully could assess things quite fast  especially when fuelled by banked fires of rage .      the wizla tobacco  snuff and rolling paper company     he said     of pseudopolis .  hmm  clever idea .  who   s in this from uu .         ah .  well  i have to admit that the assembly and people of pseudopolis are rather   patriotic in their outlook           i think the word is    parochial     don   t you .         harsh words  considering that ankh morpork   s the smuggest  most self satisfied city in the world .     this was self evidently true  so ridcully decided he hadn   t heard it .      you on one of these cards  then .     he grunted .      they insisted  i   m afraid     said henry .     i was born there  you see .  local boy and all that .         and no one from uu     said ridcully flatly .      technically no  but professor turnipseed is in there as the inventor of pex .     as henry said it  guilt and defiance fought for space in the sentence .      pex .     said ridcully slowly .     you mean like hex .         oh  no  not at all like hex .  certainly not .  the principle is quite different .     henry cleared his throat .     it   s run by chickens .  they trigger the morphic resonator  or whatever it   s called .  your hex  as i recall  utilizes ants  which are far less efficient .         how so .         we get eggs we can eat .         that doesn   t sound all that different  you know .         oh  come now .  they are hundreds of times bigger .  and pex is in a purpose built room  not strung haphazardly all over the place .  professor turnipseed knows what he is doing  and even you  mustrum  must acknowledge that the river of progress is fed by a thousand springs .         and they didn   t all rise in bloody brazeneck .     said ridcully .   they glared at one another .  professor turnipseed poked his head around the corner and pulled it back very quickly .      if we were the men our fathers were  we   d be throwing fireballs by now     said henry .      the point is taken     said ridcully .     although  i must point out  our fathers were not wizards .         that   s right  of course     said the former dean .     your father was a butcher  as i recall .         that   s right .  and your father owned a lot of cabbage fields     said ridcully .   there was a moment   s silence and then the former dean said     remember the day we both turned up at uu .         we fought like tigers as i recall     said ridcully .      good times  when you come to remember them     said the dean .      of course  we   ve all passed a lot of water over the bridge since then     said ridcully .  there was another pause and he added     fancy a drink .         i don   t mind if i do     said the former dean .      so you are trying to play football .     said henry as they progressed majestically towards the archchancellor   s office .     i did see something about it in the paper  but i thought it was a joke .         why  pray .     said ridcully as they began to walk across the great hall .     we have a fine sporting tradition  as well you know .         ah yes  tradition is the scourge of endeavour .  be sensible  mustrum .  the leopard may change his shorts  but i think he   d have a job getting into the ones he wore forty years ago .  oh  i see that you still have mister stibbons here .         er       began ponder  looking from one to the other .   ponder stibbons had once got one hundred per cent in a prescience exam by getting there the previous day .  he could see a little storm cloud when it was beginning to grow .      how   s the football going  lad .         oh  it seems to be going very well  archchancellor .  good to see you again  dean .         archchancellor     purred the former dean .     i wonder how good you would be against my university .         well  we have a pretty nifty team built here     said ridcully     and  while it is our intention to play our first game against a local side  i would take great pleasure in showing brazeneck a thing or two on the field .     by now they were almost in the middle of the great hall and their presence  not unexpectedly  had stopped play .      archchancellor  i really feel that it might be a good idea to       ponder began  but his voice was drowned out by the roar of approval that rang out from all sides around the great hall .      and the prize would be .     said henry  smiling at the crowd .      what .     spluttered the archchancellor .     what prize .         we picked up a few rowing trophies when we were lads  didn   t we .         i believe the patrician has got something planned for the league  yes .         i think that refreshments will be laid out in the blue refectory shortly     said ponder with a kind of desperate  sweaty cheerfulness .     there will  of course  be cake  but also  i believe  an interesting assortment of curries .      on many occasions this might have worked  but the two senior wizards had locked glares and would not so much as blink  even for a slice of ploughman   s pie .      but we men of craft are not interested in such paltry baubles as cups and medals  are we .     said henry .     for us it   s huge great big baubles or nothing  is that not right  mustrum .         you are after the hat     said ridcully flatly .  the air between them was humming .      yes  of course .      there followed the menacing silence of a clash of wills  but ponder stibbons decided that as he was  technically  twelve important people at the university  he formed  all by himself  a committee  and since he was therefore  de facto  very wise  he should intervene .      and your stake  dea   sir  would be    .      ridcully turned his head slightly and growled     he doesn   t have to have one .  i have rather walked into this        there was a stirring from the more senior wizards  and ponder heard a whispered phrase .     dead man   s pointy shoes .         no  i forbid it .     said ponder .      you forbid it .     said henry .     you are but a chick  young stibbons .         the accumulated votes of all the posts i hold on the university council mean that i do  technically  control it     said ponder  trying to stick out a skinny chest that was never built for sticking  but still buoyed up and awash with righteous rage and a certain amount of terror about what might happen when it ran out of steam .   the contenders relaxed a little more in the presence of this turning worm .      didn   t anyone notice that you were getting all this power .     said ridcully .      yes  sir  me .  only i thought it was responsibility and hard work .  none of you ever bother with details  you see .  technically  i have to report to other people  but usually the other people are me .  you have no idea  sirs .  i   m even the camerlengo  which means that if you drop dead  archchancellor  from any cause other than legitimate succession under the dead man   s pointy shoes tradition  i run this place until a successor is elected which  given the nature of wizardry  will mean a job for life  in which case the librarian  as an identifiable and competent member of the senior staff  will try to discharge his duties  and if he fails  the official procedure is for wizards everywhere to fight among themselves for the hat  causing fire  destruction  doves  rabbits and billiard balls to appear from every orifice and much loss of life .     after a short pause he continued .     again .  which is why some of us get a little worried when we see powerful wizards squabbling like this .  to conclude  gentlemen  i have spoken at some length in order to give you time to consider your intentions .  somebody has to .      ridcully cleared his throat .     thank you for your input  stibbons .  we shall discuss this matter further .  definitely something that needed to be said .  these aren   t the old days  after all .         your point is taken     said henry     except that  technically  these are going to be somebody else   s old days .      ponder   s chest was still going up and down .      a very good point     said ridcully .      i believe i heard mention of a curry .     said henry  with equal care .  it was like listening to two ancient dragons talking to each other with the help of an even older book of etiquette written by nuns .      it   s a long time until lunch .   i tell you what  why don   t you accept the hospitality of my university .  i believe we have left your room exactly as it was  although i understand some quite amazing things have crawled out under the door .  and perhaps you might like to stay on for tomorrow   s banquet .         oh .  are you having a banquet .     said henry .      indeed so  and i would be delighted if you would accept  old boy .  we   ll be entertaining some of the solid citizenry .  salt of the earth fellows  you understand .  wonderful people if you don   t watch them eat  but quite good conversationalists if you give them enough beer .         funnily enough  i find that works with wizards too .  well  i must accept  of course .  i haven   t been to a banquet in ages .         you haven   t .     said ridcully .     i thought you would have a banquet every night .         we have a limited budget  you know     said the archchancellor of brazeneck .     it   s a governmental grant thing  you see .      the wizards fell silent .  it was as if a man had just told you his mother had died .   ridcully patted him on the hand .     oh  i   m so sorry .     he paused at the doors of the hall and turned back to ponder .     we will be having some high level discussions  stibbons .  keep them on their toes .  the lads will help .  find out what football wants to be .      the older members of the faculty exhaled as the two heads left .  most of them were old enough to recall at least two pitched battles among factions of wizards  the worst of which had only been brought to a conclusion by rincewind  wielding a half brick in a sock     ponder looked across at rincewind now  and he was hopping awkwardly on one leg  trying to put a sock back on .  he thought it better not to comment .  it was probably the same sock .   the chair of indefinite studies slapped ponder on the back .     well done  lad .  could have been a nasty incident there .         thank you  sir .         i   m sorry we seem to have loaded you down a bit .  i   m sure it wasn   t deliberate .         i   m sure it wasn   t  too  sir .  very little around here is .     ponder sighed .     i   m afraid that unthinking delegation and prevarication and procrastination are standard practice here .     he looked expectantly at the remaining members of the council .  he wanted to be disappointed  but knew he wouldn   t be .      a very bad state of affairs indeed     said the lecturer in recent runes .   the chair looked grave .     hm        so go on  thought ponder  say it .  i know you   re going to  you just won   t be able to stop yourself  you really won   t        i think  stibbons  that you should sort it out when you have a moment     said the chair .      bingo .         i beg your pardon  stibbons .         oh  nothing  sir  not really .  i was just pondering  as it were  on the unchangeable nature of the universe .         i   m glad somebody is .  keep it up .     the lecturer in recent runes looked around and added     it all seems to have quietened down .  that curry sounds amusing .      there was a general movement towards the doors on the part of those wizards who were well endowed with years  gravitation or both  but the scratch match went on among those less magnetically attracted to knives and forks .   ponder sat down  his clipboard balanced on his lap .     i don   t have the faintest idea what i   m doing here     he declared to the world around him .      may i be of some worth  sir .         mister nutt .  oh  well  it   s very kind of you  but i don   t think that your skill with a candle can be of much           in games of this nature there are three classes of things to be considered  one  the rules of the game in all their detail  two the correct skills  actions and philosophies required for success  and three  an understanding of the real nature of the game .  may i continue .         huh     said ponder  in that slight daze that overcame everyone hearing a nutt lecture for the first time .      got a fine jaw on him  ain   t he .     said trev .     he can say the long words where the likes of you an    me would    ave to stop for a rest    alfway through .  me  anyway     he trailed off .      er  do continue  mister nutt .         thank you  sir .  as i understand it  the purpose of this game is to score at least one more goal than your opponents .  but our two teams just ran around  with everyone trying to kick the ball at once .  oh  goals were scored  but only opportunistically .  as in chess  you must secure the king  your goal .  yes  you are going to say that you have the custodian of the goal  but he is only one man  figuratively speaking .  every ball he saves shames the team members who let the opponents get so close .  yet at the same time  they must maximize their chances of getting the ball into the opposing goal .  this is a problem i will have to address .  i have mentioned chess  but this game  and particularly the ease with which the ball takes flight  means that the activity can go from one end of the play to the other in seconds  just as one dwarf piece can upset the whole board in a game of thud .      he smiled up at their expressions and added     you know  this game is surely one of the simplest .  any little boy knows how to play it   and yet playing it optimally requires superhuman talents .     he thought for a moment and added     or possibly subhuman .  certainly the willing sublimation of the ego  which takes us into the realms of the metaphysical .  so simple and yet so complex .  you know  this is wonderful .  i am quite thrilled .      the ring of silence around him was not ominous  but the air choked with bafflement .  finally  the wizard rincewind said     er  mister nutt  i thought you told us we just had to get the ball between the pointy hats .         professor rincewind  you run very well  but you don   t do anything with it .  professor macarona  you attempt to score as soon as you get the ball irrespective of anything else that is happening .  dr hix  you cheat and foul constantly           excuse me  skull ring     hix intervened .     i am required to attempt to break the rules  under college statutes .         within acceptable limits     ponder added quickly .      bledlow nobbs  no relation   you have a furiously powerful kick     nutt continued     but you don   t seem to care where the ball goes so long as it gets there .  all of you have strengths and weaknesses and it might be possible to make use of both of them .  that is  if you want to win .  but for now  a good exercise would be to get a lot more of these balls and learn how to control them .  running while kicking the ball ahead of you simply means that you will lose it to an opponent .  you must learn to keep it at your feet .  you were all looking down to check that you had the ball .  gentlemen  if you need to check that you still have the ball  you either do not have it or you will lose it in the next fraction of a second .  now  if you will excuse me  mister trev and i will get into trouble if we don   t get the chandelier back up soon .      the spell broke .      what .     said ponder .     i mean  what .  stay there  mister nutt .      nutt immediately hunched and stared at his feet in their clumsy shoes .     i am sorry if i have transgressed in any way .  i was only seeking worth .         worth .     said ponder  looking at trev for some kind of map of this new territory .      that   s how he talks  that   s all     said trev .     he    asn   t done anythin    wrong  so why shout at him like that .  they were some bloody good ideas .  you shouldn   t pick on    im just    cos he   s small and talks posh .      nutt seemed noticeably taller a little while ago  ponder thought .  is he really just hunched up .     i wasn   t exactly shouting at him     he said .     i just wondered what he   s doing dribbling candles .  i mean  i know that   s what he   s doing  but why .         ah  you have to have dribbled candles  sir     said bledlow nobbs  no relation      and to my mind  the dribbling has been particularly fine just lately .  often  when i   m walking the corridors of a night  i think to myself           good heavens  man  he   s erudite .  he radiates learning .  he   s a polymath .     said ponder .      are you saying he   s too smart to be a candle dribbler .     said the bledlow  a militant look in his eye .     you wouldn   t want a stupid dribbler  would you .  you   d get  like  manky dribbles all over the place .         i simply meant that              and blobs     said the bledlow firmly .      but you must admit that it is strange that        probably everyone wants him dead .   ponder stopped as the chasm of memory opened .     that makes no sense .  it can   t be true .         sir .      he realized that all the footballers were staring at him .  ridcully had refused to say any more  and in ponder   s crowded mind he   d settled for believing that nutt was on the run in some way .  it was not unknown .  occasionally a novice wizard working in a small town might find it a good idea to hurry back for a swift refresher course in the safety of the university   s hospitable stones until his little mistake had been rectified forgotten erased caught and bottled .  there had always been others given sanctuary for mysterious reasons .  the politics of wizardry were either very simple  and resolved by someone ceasing to breathe  or as complex as one ball of yarn in a room with three bright eyed little kittens .   but nutt   what crime could he have done .  and then you had to factor in that it was ridcully who had allowed him to come here and indeed had put ponder in this position .  the sensible thing  therefore  was to   just get on with it .      i think mister nutt has some very good ideas     he said carefully     and i think he should continue .  do carry on  mister nutt .      watching nutt look up was like watching the sun rise  but a hesitant sun afraid that any moment the gods might slap it back down into the night  and hungry for reassurance that this would not be so .      i am worthy .         well  er       ponder began  and saw trev nodding frantically .      well  er  yes  it would seem so  mister nutt .  i   m amazed at your insight in so short a time .         i have a talent for pattern recognition in developing situations .         really .  oh .  good .  carry on  then .         excuse me  i have a question  if you would be so good .      looks like a bag of second hand clothes  talks like a retired theologian  ponder thought .     ask away  mister nutt .         can i carry on with the dribbling .         what .  do you want to .         yes  thank you .  i enjoy it and it does not take me long .      ponder glanced at trev  who shrugged  made a face and nodded .      but i have a favour to ask     nutt went on .      i rather expected you would     said ponder     but i   m sorry to say that the budget this term means           oh no  i don   t want any money     said nutt .     i don   t really spend it anyway .  i just want mister trev in the team .  he is very modest  but you should know that he is a genius with his feet .  i cannot see how you could lose with him in the team .         oh no     said trev  waving his hands and backing away .     no .  not me .  i   m not a footballer .  i just kick tin cans around .         thought that was at the heart and soul of foot the ball  isn   t it .     said ponder  who   d never been allowed to play in the street .      i thought it was when early blokes kicked a dead enemy   s head around     bledlow nobbs  no relation  volunteered .   a throat was cleared .     unlikely in my opinion     said hix .     unless it   s in a bag or some sort of metal brace  and then you have the problem of weight  because a human head comes in at around ten pounds  which is a pain in the foot  i should think .  scooping it out would work for a while  of course  but mind you wire the jaw  because no one wants to be bitten in the foot .  i do have some heads on ice if anyone wants to experiment .  it   s amazing  but there are still those who leave their bodies to necromancy .  there   s some strange people out there .      at this point  the head of the department of post mortem communications realized that he was not taking his audience with him .      there   s no need to look at me like that     he grumbled .     skull ring  remember .  i have to know this wretched stuff .      ponder coughed politely .     mister  er  likely  isn   t it .  your colleague speaks very highly of you .  won   t you join us .         sorry  guv  but i promised my old mum that i   d never play football .  it   s a good way of gettin    your head caved in .         trev likely .     roared bledlow nobbs  no relation  .     are you dave likely   s lad .  he           scored four goals  yeah  yeah  yeah     said trev .     and then died in the street with the rain washing his blood down the gutter and someone   s smelly overcoat over him .  the prince of football .         do we need a little talk  mister trev .     nutt said urgently .      no .  no .  i   m okay .  okay .         this isn   t that kind of football  trev     said nutt soothingly .      yeah  i know .  but i promised my old mum .         then at least show them your moves  mister trev     nutt pleaded .  he turned to the players .     you must see this .      trev sighed  but nutt knew just how to wheedle .     all right  if it shuts you up     he said  and pulled a tin can out of his pocket  to much laughter .      see .     he complained to nutt .     they just think it   s a joke .      nutt folded his arms .     show them .      trev dropped the can on to his foot and with hardly any effort flicked it on to his shoulder  where it rolled around his neck to his other shoulder and  after a tiny pause  righted itself .  he shrugged it on to his other foot  spun it into the air  and let it tumble and spin on the toe of his boot with a faint rattling noise .   trev winked at ponder stibbons .     don   t move  guv .      the can sprang off the boot and up into the air  then  as it fell  he hit it with a roundhouse kick  driving it at ponder .  the people behind ponder dived out of the way as it growled past his face and went into orbit  appearing for a moment to give him a silver necklace until it broke away and dropped into trev   s hand like a beached salmon .   in the silence  ponder pulled his thaumometer out of his pocket and glanced at it .      natural background     he said flatly .     no magic involved .  how did you do that  mister likely .         you just    ave to get the hang of it  guv .  getting the spins is the thing  but if i    ave to think too much it don   t work .         can you do it with a ball .         dunno  never tried .  but prob   ly no .  can   t get the long spin and the short spin  see .  but you ort to be able to get somethin    out of a ball .         but how would that help us .     said hix .      mastery of the ball is everything     said nutt .     the planned rule will  i think  allow the keeper of the goal to handle the ball .  this is vital .  there is  however  no explicit ban on nodding the ball  kneeing the ball or blocking the ball with the chest and letting it drop neatly on to the foot .  remember  gentlemen  this ball flies .  it will spend a lot of time in the air .  you must learn not to think just about the ground .         i feel sure that using the head would be considered illegal     said ponder .      sir  you presume a rule where there is none .  remember what i said about the real nature of the game .      ponder saw nutt   s little half smile  and gave in .     mister nutt  i am delegating the selection and training of our football team to you .  you will report to me  of course .         yes  sir .  thank you  sir .  i will need the power to sequester team members from their normal duties when required .         well  i suppose i must agree to that .  very well  i shall leave the team in your hands     said ponder  thinking  how many bags of old clothes use the word    sequester    as if they   re used to it .  still  ridcully likes the little goblin  if that   s what he is  and i   ve never seen the point of team games .      may i also  sir  request a very small budget .         why .         with all due respect to the exigencies of university finances     said nutt     i believe it is very necessary .         why .         i wish to take the team to the ballet .         that   s ridiculous .     ponder snapped .      no  sir  it   s essential .        the next day there was a piece in the times about the mysterious disappearance of the fabulous    jewels     which made glenda smile .  they just haven   t read their fairy stories  she thought as she left the house .  if you want to find a beauty  you look for her in the ashes .  because glenda was glenda and would always irredeemably be glenda to the core  she added  although the ovens in the night kitchen are scrupulously maintained at all times and all ashes are immediately disposed of .   to her surprise  juliet stepped out of her doorway at almost the same time and looked as if she was almost awake .     do you think they   ll let me in on the banquet .     she said as they waited for the bus .   theoretically yes  glenda thought  but probably no  because she was a night kitchen girl .  even though she was juliet  she would be tarred by mrs whitlow as a night kitchen girl .     juliet  you shall go to the banquet     she said aloud     and so shall i .         but i think mrs whitlow won   t like that     said juliet .   something was still bubbling inside glenda .  it had started in shatta and lasted all day yesterday and there was still some left today .     i don   t care     she said .   juliet giggled and looked around in case mrs whitlow was hiding near the bus stop .   and i really don   t care  glenda thought .  i don   t care .  it was like drawing a sword .     ponder   s office always puzzled mustrum ridcully .  the man used filing cabinets for heavens    sake .  ridcully worked on the basis that anything you couldn   t remember wasn   t important and had developed the floor heap method of document storage to a fine art .   ponder looked up .     ah  good morning  archchancellor .         just had a look in at the hall     said ridcully .      yes  archchancellor .         our lads were all doing ballet .         yes  archchancellor .         and there were some girls from the opera house with those short dresses .         yes  archchancellor .  they   re helping the team .      ridcully leaned over and put huge knuckles either side of the paper ponder was working on .     why .         mister nutt   s idea  archchancellor .  apparently they must learn balance  poise and elegance .         have you ever seen bledlow nobbs try to stand on one leg .  let me tell you  it   s an immediate cure for melancholy .         i can imagine     said ponder  not looking up .      i thought the idea was to learn how to kick the ball into the goal .         ah  yes  but mister nutt has a philosophy .         does he .         yes  sir .         they   re runnin    about all over the place  i know that     said ridcully .      yes  mister nutt and mister likely are preparing a little something extra for the banquet     said ponder  getting up and opening the top drawer of a filing cabinet .  the sight of filing cabinets opening tended to remind ridcully that he should be elsewhere  but on this occasion the ruse failed to work .      oh  and i believe we have some fresh balls .         mister snorrisson knows an opportunity when he sees one .         so it   s all going well  then .     said ridcully  in a kind of mystified voice .      apparently so  sir .         well  i suppose i   d better leave it alone     said ridcully .  he hesitated  feeling at a bit of a loose end  and found another thread to pull .     and how are those rules coming along  mister stibbons .         oh  quite well  thank you  archchancellor .  i   m keeping in some of the ones from the street game  of course  to keep everybody happy .  some of them are quite strange .         mister nutt is quite a decent chap  it appears .         oh yes  archchancellor .         very good idea of his to redesign the goal  i thought .  makes it more fun .         aren   t you going to train  sir .     said ponder  pulling another document towards him .      i am the captain .  i do not need to train .     ridcully turned to leave and stopped with his hand on the doorknob .     had a long chat with the former dean last night .  decent soul at heart  of course     he said .      yes  i understand the atmosphere in the uncommon room was very convivial  archchancellor     said ponder .  and expensive  he added to himself .      you know young adrian turnipseed is a professor .         oh  yes  archchancellor .         you wanna be one .         not really  archchancellor .  i think there should be one or two posts in this institution that i don   t hold .         yes  but they   ve just called their machine pex .  hardly a great leap of ingenuity  is it .         oh  there are some significant differences .  i believe he   s using chickens to generate the blit diametric     said ponder .      apparently so     said ridcully .     something like that  anyway .         hmmm     said ponder .  and it was quite a solid hmmm  possibly one you could moor a small boat to .      something wrong .     said ridcully .      oh  er  not really  archchancellor .  did the former dean mention anything about the need to totally rebuild the morphic resonator to allow for the necessary changes in the blit slood interface .         shouldn   t think so     said ridcully .      oh     said ponder  his face blank .     well  adrian is bound to get round to that .  he is very clever .         yes  but it was all based on your work .  you built hex .  and now they   re putting out that he   s some big clever clogs .  he   s even on a cigarette card .         that   s nice  sir .  it   s good when researchers get recognition .      ridcully felt like a mosquito that was trying to sting a steel breastplate .     hah  wizardry has certainly changed since my day     he said .      yes  sir     said ponder noncommittally .      and by the way  mister stibbons     said ridcully as he opened the door     my day isn   t over yet .      there was a yell in the distance .  and then a crash .  ridcully smiled .  the day had suddenly brightened up .   when he and ponder reached the great hall  most of the team were gathered around one of their members lying on the floor  with nutt kneeling over him .      what   s happened here .     ridcully demanded .      badly bruised  sir .  i shall put a compress on it .         ah .     his gaze fell upon a large  brass bound chest .  it looked at first sight like any other chest  until you saw the tiny little toes poking out .      rincewind   s luggage     he growled .     and where that is  rincewind can   t be far in front .  rincewind .         actually  it wasn   t my fault     said rincewind .      he   s right  sir     said nutt .     i have to apologize for the fact that this was a group misapprehension .  i understand it is a remarkably magical chest on hundreds of little legs and i am afraid that the gentlemen here believed that it would play football like stink  as they put it .  in which surmise  i have to say  they were proved wrong .         i tried to tell them     said the former dean from the edge of the crowd .     morning  mustrum .  good team you have here .         all its feet do is get in each other   s way     said bengo macarona .     and if it does get on top of the ball  it spins out of control and  alas  it crashed into mister sopworthy here .         oh  well  we learn by our mistakes     said ridcully .     and now  do you happen to have something nice to show me .         i think i have the very thing  archchancellor     said a cheerful but reedy voice behind him .   ridcully turned and looked into the face of a man with the shape and urgency of a piccolo .  he seemed to be vibrating on the spot .      professor ritornello  master of the music     ponder whispered into ridcully   s ear .      ah  professor     said ridcully smoothly     and i see you have the choir with you .         yes indeed  archchancellor  and i must tell you  i am thrilled and filled with inner light by what i have witnessed this morning .  without ado  i have penned a chant  such as you asked for .         did i .     said ridcully  out of the corner of his mouth .      you will remember that chanting was mentioned and so i thought it best to alert the professor     whispered ponder .      another pp  eh .  oh  well .         happily  it is based on the traditional plainchant or stolation form and is a valedicta  or hail to the winner .  may i .     said professor ritornello .     it is a cappella  of course .         go ahead  by all means     said ridcully .   the master of the music pulled a short baton out of his sleeve .     i   ve put the name of bengo macarona in there for a marker at the moment  because he has apparently scored two fine    goals     as i believe they are called     he said  dealing carefully with the word as one might deal with a large spider in the bathtub .  then he caught the eyes of his little flock  nodded  and       hail the unique qualities of magister bengo macarona .  of macarona the unique qualities hail .  hail the .  hail the .  the singular talent possessed by no other .  hail .  hail the .  hail the bountiful gods .  who to the  two the   singula singular singula .     after a minute and a half of this ridcully coughed loudly  and the master waved the choir into a stuttering silence .      is there something untoward  archchancellor .         er  not as such  master  but  er  do you not feel that it is a bit too  well  long .     ridcully was aware that the former dean was not trying very hard to suppress a snigger .      not at all .  in fact  sir  i intend that when it is finished it will be scored for forty voices and  though i dare to say so  will be my masterwork .         but it is something for football fans to sing  you see .     said ridcully .      well then     said the master  holding his baton in a rather threatening manner     is it not the duty of the educated classes to raise the standards of the lower orders .         he   s got a point there  mustrum     said the chair of indefinite studies  and ridcully felt his grandfather kick him in the heredity  and was glad that maid wasn   t here what was her name now .  oh  yes  glenda  smart woman but although she was not there he saw something of her expression in trev likely   s face .      during the week  possibly     he snapped     but not on saturdays  i think .  but very well done  anyway  and i look forward to hearing more of your efforts .      the master of the music flounced out with the choir flouncing out in perfect unison behind him .   ridcully rubbed his hands together .     well  gentlemen  perhaps you could show me your moves .      while the players spread out in the hall  nutt said     i must say that professor macarona is excelling at the game .  he clearly has excellent ball skills .         i   m not surprised     said ridcully brightly .      the librarian is  of course  an excellent keeper of the goal .  especially since he can stand in the middle and reach either side of it .  i believe that it will be very hard for any of our opponents to get past him .  and  of course  you will be partaking also  archchancellor .         oh  you don   t become archchancellor if you don   t get the hang of things quickly .  i will just watch for now .      he watched .  after the second occasion when macarona  like a silver streak  ran the length of the hall to flick the ball into the opponents    goal  ridcully turned to ponder and said     we   re going to win  aren   t we .         if indeed he is still playing for you     put in the former dean .      oh  come now  henry .  can we at least agree to just play one game at a time here .         well  i think today   s session should end pretty soon  sir     said ponder .     it   s the banquet tonight after all and it will take some time to get the place ready .         excuse me  guv  that   s right     said trev behind him     and we   ve got to get the chandelier down an    put new candles in .         yes  but we have been practising a little demonstration for tonight .  maybe the archchancellor would like to see it     said nutt .   ridcully looked at his watch .     well  yes  mister nutt  but time is getting on and so i look forward to seeing it later .  splendid effort all round  though     he boomed .     the night market was setting up in sator square as glenda and juliet arrived for work .  ankh morpork lived on the street  where it got its food  entertainment and  in a city with a ferocious housing shortage  a place to hang around until there was space on a floor .  stalls had been set up anywhere  and flares filled the early evening air with stink and  almost as a by product  a certain amount of light .   glenda could never resist looking  especially now .  she was very good at all sorts of cookery  she really was  and it was important to keep that knowledge at the calm centre of her spinning brain .  and there was verity pushpram  queen of the sea .   glenda had a lot of time for miss pushpram  who was a self made woman  although she could have used some help when it came to her eyes  which were set so far apart that she rather resembled a turbot .   but verity  like the ocean that was making her fortune these days  had hidden depths  because she   d made enough to buy a boat  and then another boat and a whole aisle in the fish market .  but she still woman handled her barrow to the square most evenings  where she sold whelks  shrimps  leather crabs  blossom prawns  monkey clams and her famous hot fish sticks .   glenda often bought from her  there was the kind of respect you give to an equal who is  crucially  no threat to your own position .      going to the big bun fight  girls .     said verity cheerfully  waving a halibut at them .      yes     said juliet proudly .      what  both of you .     said verity  with a glance towards glenda  who said  firmly     the night kitchen is expanding .         oh well  so long as you   re having fun     said verity  looking  in theory  from one to the other .     here  have one of these  they   re lovely .  my treat .      she reached down and picked a crab out of a bucket .  as it came up it turned out that three more were hanging on to it .      a crab necklace .     giggled juliet .      oh  that   s crabs for you     said verity  disentangling the ones who had hitched a ride .     thick as planks  the lot of them .  that   s why you can keep them in a bucket without a lid .  any that tries to get out gets pulled back .  yes  as thick as planks .     verity held the crab over an ominously bubbling cauldron .     shall i cook it for you now .         no .     said glenda  much louder than she had intended .      are you okay  dear .     verity enquired .     you look a bit ill .         i   m fine .  fine .  just a touch of a sore throat  that   s all .     crab bucket  she thought .  i thought pepe was talking nonsense .     erm  can you just truss it up for us .  it   s going to be a long night .         right you are     said miss pushpram  expertly wrapping the unresisting crab in twine .     you know what to do  that   s certain .  lovely crabs  these  real good eating .  but thick as planks .        crab bucket  thought glenda as they hurried towards the night kitchen .  that   s how it works .  people from the sisters disapproving when a girl takes the trolley bus .  that   s crab bucket .  practically everything my mum ever told me  that   s crab bucket .  practically everything i   ve ever told juliet  that   s crab bucket  too .  maybe it   s just another word for the shove .  it   s so nice and warm on the inside that you forget that there   s an outside .  the worst of it is  the crab that mostly keeps you down is you   the realization had her mind on fire .   a lot hinges on the fact that  in most circumstances  people are not allowed to hit you with a mallet .  they put up all kinds of visible and invisible signs that say    do not do this    in the hope that it   ll work  but if it doesn   t  then they shrug  because there is  really  no real mallet at all .  look at juliet talking to all those nobby ladies .  she didn   t know that she shouldn   t talk to them like that .  and it worked .  nobody hit her on the head with a hammer .   and custom and practice as embodied by mrs whitlow was that the night kitchen staff should not go above stairs  to where the light was comparatively clean and had not already been through a lot of other eyeballs .  well  glenda had done that  and nothing bad had happened  had it .  so now glenda strode towards the great hall  her serviceable shoes hitting the floor enough to hurt .  the day girls said nothing as she marched in behind them .  there was nothing for them to say .  the real unwritten rule was that girls on the dumpy side didn   t serve at table when guests were present  and glenda had decided tonight that she couldn   t read unwritten rules .  besides  there was a row already going on .  the servants who were laying out the cutlery were trying to keep an eye on it  which subsequently meant that more than one guest had to eat with two spoons .   glenda was amazed to see the candle knave waving his hands at trev and nutt  and she headed for them .  she did not like smeems very much  a man could be dogmatic  and that was all right  or he could be stupid  and no harm done  but stupid and dogmatic at the same time was too much  especially fluxed with body odour .      what   s this all about .      it worked .  the right tone from a woman with her arms folded always bounces an answer out of an unprepared man before he has time to think  and even before he has time to think up a lie .      they raised the chandelier .  they raised it without lighting the candles .  we won   t have enough time now to get it down and up again before the guests come in .         but  mister smeems       trev began .      and all i get is talking back and lies     smeems complained bitterly .      but i can light them from here  mister smeems .     nutt spoke quietly  even his voice huddling .      don   t give me that .  even wizards can   t do that without getting wax all over the place  you little           that   s enough  mister smeems     said a voice that to glenda   s surprise turned out to be hers .     can you light them  mister nutt .         yes  miss .  at the right time .         there you are  then     said glenda .     i suggest you leave it to mister nutt .     smeems looked at her  and she could see there was  as it were  an invisible mallet in his thinking  a feeling that he might get into some trouble here .      i should run along now     she said .      i can   t stand around .  i   m a man with responsibilities .     smeems looked wrong footed and bewildered  but from his point of view absence was a good idea .  glenda almost saw his brain reach the conclusion .  not being there diluted the blame for whatever it was that was going to go wrong .     can   t stand around     he repeated .     ha .  you   d all be in the dark if it wasn   t for me .     with that  he grabbed his greasy bag and scuttled off .   glenda turned to nutt .  he can   t possibly make himself smaller  she told herself .  his clothes would fit him even worse than they do already .  i must be imagining it .      can you really light the candles from here .     she said aloud .  nutt carried on staring at the floor .   glenda turned to trev .     can he really       but trev was not there  because trev was leaning against the wall some distance away talking to juliet .   she could read it all at a glance  his possessive stance  her modestly downcast eyes  not hanky panky  as such  but certainly overture and beginners to hanky panky .  oh  the power of words     as you watch  so are you watched .  glenda looked down into the penetrating eyes of nutt .  was that a frown .  what had he seen in her expression .  more than she wanted  that was certain .   the tempo in the hall was increasing .  the football captains would be assembling in one of the anterooms  and she could imagine them there  in clean shirts  or at least in shirts less grubby than usual  dragged here from the various versions of botney street all over the city  staring up at the wonderful vaulting and wondering if they were going to walk out of there dead .  huh  she tagged on to that thought  more likely it would be dead drunk .  and  just as her brain began to pivot around that new thought  a severe voice behind her said     hwe do not usually expect to see you in the great hall  glenda .      it had to be mrs whitlow .  only the housekeeper would pronounce    we    with an h and finish a plain statement as if it were a question .  besides  without turning round  glenda heard the clink of her silver chatelaine  reputed to hold the one key that could open any lock in the university  and the creaking of her fearsome corsetry .    glenda turned .  there is no mallet .     i thought you might need a few extra hands tonight  mrs whitlow     she said sweetly .      nevertheless  custom and practice           ah  dear mrs whitlow  i think we   re ready to let them through now .  his lordship   s coach will shortly be leaving the palace     said the archchancellor  behind them .   mrs whitlow could loom .  but mostly only horizontally .  mustrum ridcully could out loom her by more than two feet .  she turned hurriedly and gave the little half curtsy which  he   d never dared tell her  he always found mildly annoying .      oh  and miss glenda  isn   t it .     said the archchancellor happily .     good to see you up here .  very useful young lady  mrs whitlow .  got initiative  fine grasp of things .         how kind of you to say so .  she is one of my best girls     said the housekeeper  spitting teeth and taking care not to meet glenda   s suddenly cherubic gaze .      big chandelier not lit  i see     said ridcully .   glenda stepped forward .     mister nutt is planning a surprise for us  sir .         mister nutt is full of surprises .  we   ve had an amazing day here today  miss glenda     said ridcully .     our mister nutt has been teaching the lads to play football his way .  do you know what he did yesterday .  you   ll never guess .  tell them  mister nutt .         i took them along to the royal opera house to watch the dancers in training     said nutt nervously .     you see  it is very important that they learn the skills of movement and poise .         and then when they came back     said ridcully  with the same  slightly threatening joviality     he had them playin    here in the hall blindfolded .      nutt coughed nervously .     it is vital for them to keep track of every other player     he said .     it is essential that they are a team .         and then he took them to see lord rust   s hunting dogs .      nutt coughed again  even more embarrassed .     when they hunt  every dog knows the position of every other dog .  i wanted them to understand the duality of team and player .  the strength of the player is the team and the strength of the team is the player .         did you hear that .     said ridcully .     great stuff .  oh  he   s had them running up and down here all day long .  balancing balls on their heads  doing big diagrams on a blackboard .  you   d think it was some kind of battle being planned .         it is a battle     said nutt .     i mean  not with the opposing team  as such  but it is a battle between every man and himself .         that sounds very uberwaldian     said ridcully .     still  they all seem full of vim and vigour and ready for the evening .  i think mister nutt is planning one of those sunny luminair things .         just a little something to capture people   s attention     said nutt .      anything going to go off bang .     said ridcully .      no  sir .         promise .  personally i like the occasional bit of sturm and drang  but lord vetinari is a tad particular about that sort of thing .         no thunder and lightning  sir .  possibly a brief haze  high up .      it seemed to glenda that the archchancellor was paying some thoughtful attention to nutt .      how many languages do you speak  you   nutt .         three dead and twelve living  sir     said nutt .      really .  really     said ridcully  as though filing this away and trying not to think how many of them were alive before you murdered them .     well done .  thank you  mister nutt  and you too  ladies .  we will bring them in shortly .      glenda took this opportunity to get out of mrs whitlow   s way .  she was not pleased to see that trev and juliet had already taken a slightly earlier opportunity to get out of hers .      do not worry about juliet     said nutt  who had followed her .      who said i was worried .     glenda snapped .      you did .  your expression  your stance  the set of your body  your   reactions  your tone of voice .  everything .         you have no business to be looking at my everything   i mean the set of my body .         it is simply the way you stand  miss glenda .         and you can read my mind .         it may appear that way .  i am so sorry .         and juliet .  what was she thinking .         i am not sure  but she likes mister trev  she thinks he is funny .         so have you read trev   s everything .  bet that was a dirty book .         er  no  miss .  he is worried and confused .  i would say he is trying to see what kind of man he is going to be .         really .  he   s always been a scallywag .         he is thinking of his future .      across the hall  the big doors opened just as the last scurrying servants reached their stations .   this made no impression on glenda  lost in thought as she wrestled with the prospect that a leopard might change his shorts .  he has been a bit quiet lately  i must admit .  and he did write her that lovely poem   that should mean a lot  a poem .  who   d have thought it .  it   s not like him at all     with atomic speed nutt was suddenly missing  and the doors stood wide  and here came the captains with their retinues  and all of them were nervous and some of them were wearing unaccustomed suits  and some of them were walking a little unsteadily even now  because the wizards    idea of an aperitif had bite  and in the kitchen plates would be being filled and the chefs would be cursing and the ovens clanging as they   as they   what was the menu  anyway .   life as an unseen part of unseen university was a matter of alliances  feuds  obligations and friendships  all stirred and twisted and woven together .   glenda was good at it .  the night kitchen had always been generous to other toilers and right now the great hall owed her favours  even if all she had done was keep her mouth shut .  now she bore down on shiny robert  one of the head waiters  who gave her the cautious nod due to someone who knew things about you that you wouldn   t want your mother to know .      got a menu .     she asked .  one was produced from under a napkin .  she read it in horror .      that   s not the stuff they like .         oh dear  glenda     robert smirked .     are you saying it   s too good for them .         you   re giving them avec .  nearly every dish has got avec in it  but stuff with avec in the name is an acquired taste .  i mean  do these look to you like people who habitually eat in a foreign language .  oh dear  and you are giving them beer .  beer with avec .         a choice of wines is available .  they are choosing beer     said robert coldly .   glenda stared at the captains .  they seemed to be enjoying themselves now .  here was free food and drink and if the food tasted strange there was plenty of it  and the beer tasted welcomely familiar and there was lots of that  too .   she didn   t like this .  heavens knew that football had got pretty disgusting these days  but   well  she couldn   t quite work out what she was uneasy about  but            scuse me  miss .      she looked down .  a young footballer had decided to confide in the only uniformed woman he could see who was not carrying at least two plates at once .      can i help .      he lowered his voice .     this chutney tastes of fish  miss .      she looked at the other grinning faces around the table .     it   s called caviar  sir .  it   ll put lead in your pencil .      the table  as one well oiled drinker  guffawed  but the youth only looked puzzled .     i haven   t got a pencil  miss .     more amusement .      there   s not a lot of them around     said glenda  and left them laughing .        so kind of you to invite me  mustrum     said lord vetinari  waving away the hors d   oeuvres .  he turned to the wizard on his right .     and the archchancellor formerly known as dean is back with you  i see .  that is capital .         you may remember that henry went to pseudopolis brazeneck  you know .  he is  er       ridcully slowed .      the new archchancellor     said vetinari .  he picked up a spoon and perused it carefully  as if it were a rare and curious object .     dear me .  i thought that there could be only one archchancellor .  is this not so .  one above all others and one hat  of course .  but these are wizardly matters  of which i know little .  so do excuse me if i have misunderstood .     in the gently turning bowl of the spoon his nose went from long to short .     however  it occurs to me  as an onlooker  that this could lead to a little friction  perhaps .     the spoon stopped in mid twirl .      a soup  on  perhaps     said ridcully  not looking in the direction of henry .      that much  indeed .  but i surmise from the absence of people being turned into frogs that you gentlemen have forgone the traditional option of magical mayhem .  well done .  when it comes to the pinch  old friends  united by the bonds of mutual disrespect  cannot bring themselves to actually kill one another .  we have hope .  ah  soup .      there was a brief interregnum as the ladle went from bowl to bowl  and then the patrician said     could i assist you .  i am without any bias in this matter .         excuse me  my lord  but i think it might be said that you would favour ankh morpork     said the archchancellor formerly known as dean .      really .  it might also be said that it would be in my interest to weaken the perceived power of this university .  you take my meaning .  the delicate balance between town and gown  the unseen and the mundane .  the twin foci of power .  it might be said that i could take the opportunity to embarrass my learned friend .     he smiled a little smile .     do you still own the official archchancellor   s hat  mustrum .  i notice that you don   t wear it these days and tend to prefer the snazzy number with the rather attractive drawers and the small drinks cabinet in the point .         i never liked wearing the official one .  it grumbled all the time .         it really can talk .     said vetinari .      i think the word    nag    would be far more accurate  since its only topic of conversation has been how much better things used to be .  my only comfort here is that every archchancellor over the last thousand years has complained about it in exactly the same way .         so it can think and speak .     said vetinari innocently .      well  i suppose you could put it like that .         then you can   t own it  mustrum  a hat that thinks and speaks cannot be enslaved .  no slaves in ankh morpork  mustrum .     he waved a finger waggishly .      yes  but it is the look of the thing .  what would it look like if i gave up the uniqueness of archchancellorship without a fight .         i really could not say     said lord vetinari     but since just about every genuine battle between wizards has hitherto resulted in wholesale destruction  i feel that you would at least look a little embarrassed .  and  of course  i will remind you that you were quite happy that archchancellor bill rincewind at bugarup university cheerfully calls himself archchancellor .         yes  but he   s a long way away     said ridcully .     and fourecks doesn   t really count as anywhere  whereas in pseudopolis we are talking about a johnny come lately of an organization and its           so are we then merely arguing over the question of distance .     said vetinari .      no  but       said ridcully and stopped .      is this worth the argument  i ask you .     said vetinari .     what we have here  gentlemen  is but a spat between the heads of a venerable and respected institution and an ambitious  relatively inexperienced  and importunate new school of learning .         yes  that   s what we   ve got all right     said ridcully .   vetinari raised a finger .     i hadn   t finished  archchancellor .  let me see now .  i said that what we have here is a spat between an antique and somewhat fossilized  elderly and rather hidebound institution and a college of vibrant newcomers full of fresh and exciting ideas .         here  hang on  you didn   t say that the first time     said ridcully .   vetinari leaned back .     indeed i did  archchancellor .  do you not remember our talk about the meaning of words a little while ago .  context is everything .  i suggest  therefore  that you allow the head of brazeneck university the opportunity to wear the official archchancellor   s hat for a short time .      you had to pay close attention to what lord vetinari said .  sometimes the words  while clearly docile  had a tendency to come back and bite .      play the football for the hat     said vetinari .   he looked at their faces .     gentlemen .  gentlemen .  do take a moment to consider this .  the importance of the hat is enhanced .  the means by which the wizards strive are not primarily magical .  the actual striving and indeed the rivalry will  i think  be good for both universities and people will be interested  whereas in the past when wizards have argued they have had to hide in the cellars .  please do not answer me too quickly  otherwise i will think you have not thought about this enough .         as a matter of fact  i can think very fast indeed     said ridcully .     it will simply be no contest .  it will be totally unfair .         it certainly will     said henry .      ah  you both feel that it will be totally unfair     said vetinari .      indeed .  we have a much younger faculty and the brisk and healthy playing fields of pseudopolis .         capital     said lord vetinari .     it seems to me that we have a challenge .  university against university .  city  as it were  against city .  warfare  as it were  without the tedious necessity of picking up all those heads and limbs afterwards .  all things must strive  gentlemen .         i suppose i have to agree     said ridcully .     it   s not as if i   m going to lose the hat in any case .  i must note  though  havelock  that you do not allow many challenges to your position .         oh  but i am challenged very frequently     said lord vetinari .     it   s just that they don   t win .  incidentally  gentlemen  i did notice in today   s paper that the new voters of pseudopolis yesterday voted not to have to pay taxes .  when you see the president again  please don   t hesitate to tell him that i will be more than happy to advise him when he feels it is necessary .  cheer up  gentlemen .  neither of you has got exactly what you want  but both of you have got exactly what you deserve .  if the leopard can change his shorts  a wizard can change his hat .  and the leopard must change his shorts  gentlemen  or we are all doomed .         are you referring to the loko business .     said henry .     you needn   t look surprised .         i don   t intend to .  i am surprised     said vetinari     but please credit me with not looking surprised unless  of course  there is some advantage in doing so .         we are going to have to do something .  the expedition found a nest of the damn things .         yes .  children  which they killed     said vetinari .      pups that they exterminated .         indeed .  and what do you suggest .         we are talking about a very evil force here .         archchancellor  i see evil when i look in my shaving mirror .  it is  philosophically  present everywhere in the universe in order  apparently  to highlight the existence of good .  i think there is more to this theory  but i tend to burst out laughing at this point .  i take it that you are behind the idea of an expeditionary force to far uberwald .         of course .     said the former dean .      it has been tried once before .  it was tried twice before that .  why is there a certain cast of the military mind which leads sensible people to do again  with gusto  what didn   t work before .         force is all they understand .  you must know that .         force is all that   s been tried  archchancellor henry .  besides  if they are animals  as some people claim  then they understand nothing  but if  as i am convinced  they are sapient creatures  then some understanding is surely required by us .      the patrician took a sip of his beer .     i have told this to few people  gentlemen  and i suspect never will again  but one day when i was a young boy on holiday in uberwald i was walking along the bank of a stream when i saw a mother otter with her cubs .  a very endearing sight  i   m sure you will agree  and even as i watched  the mother otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon  which she subdued and dragged on to a half submerged log .  as she ate it  while of course it was still alive  the body split and i remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out  much to the delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy .  one of nature   s wonders  gentlemen  mother and children dining upon mother and children .  and that   s when i first learned about evil .  it is built in to the very nature of the universe .  every world spins in pain .  if there is any kind of supreme being  i told myself  it is up to all of us to become his moral superior .      the two wizards exchanged a glance .  vetinari was staring into the depths of his beer mug and they were glad that they did not know what he saw in there .      is it me or is it rather dark in here .     said henry .      good heavens  yes .  i forgot about the chandelier .     exclaimed ridcully .     where is mister nutt .         here     said nutt  rather closer than ridcully would have preferred .      why .         i said i would be ready when you needed me  sir .         what .  oh  yes  of course you did .     he   s short and polite and amazingly helpful  he told himself .  nothing to worry about at all      well  show us how to light the candles  mister nutt .         could i possibly have a fanfare  sir .         i doubt it  young man  but i will bring the hall to attention .      ridcully picked up a spoon and tapped the side of a wine glass  in the time honoured    look  everybody  i   m trying to make a loud noise very quietly .     procedure  which has successfully eluded after dinner speakers ever since the invention of glasses  spoons and dinners .      gentlemen  pray silence  an expectant one  followed by appreciative applause for the lighting of the chandelier .      there was the silence .   as a round of applause was followed by some more silence  people turned around in their chairs for a better view of nothing to see .      would you please puff on your pipe and hand it to me  sir .     said nutt .   shrugging  ridcully did so .  nutt took it  raised it in the air and     what happened .  it was a topic of conversation for days .  did the red fire come up from the pipe or down from the ceiling or simply out of the walls .  all that was certain was that the darkness was suddenly fractured by glowing zigzags that vanished in a blink  leaving a total blackness which cleared like the sky at dawn as all at once every candle  in perfect unison  glowed into life .   as the applause began to mount  ridcully looked along the table at ponder  who waved his thaumometer  shook his head and shrugged .   then the archchancellor turned to nutt  took him out of earshot of the table and for the benefit of watchers shook him by the hand .      well done  mister nutt .  just one thing  that wasn   t magic  because we would know  so how was it done .         well  initially  dwarfish alchemy  sir .  you know  the kind that works .  it is how they light the big chandeliers in the caverns under bonk .  i worked that out by tests and analysis .  all the candle wicks are connected by a network of black cotton thread  which terminates in one single thread  which barely shows up in this hall .  you see  the thread is soaked in a formula which burns with extreme but brief ferocity when dry .  my slightly altered solution burns considerably faster even than that  consuming the thread until it is nothing but gas .  it is quite safe .  only the tips of the candle wicks are treated  you see  and they light as normal .  you might be interested  sir  in the fact that the flame travels so fast as to be instantaneous by any human measure .  certainly faster than twenty miles a second  i calculate .      ridcully was good at looking blank .  you couldn   t deal with vetinari on a regular basis without being able to freeze your expression at will .  but  right now  he didn   t have to try .   nutt looked concerned .     have i failed to achieve worth  sir .         what .  ah .  well .     ridcully   s face thawed .     a wonderful effort  nutt .  well done .  er  how did you get hold of the ingredients .         oh  there is an old alchemy room in the cellars .         hmm .  well  thank you again     said ridcully .     but as master of this university i must ask you not to talk to anyone about this invention until we have spoken again on the matter .  now  i must get back to the events in hand .         don   t you worry  sir  i will see that it does not fall into the wrong hands     said nutt  bustling off .   except  of course  that you are the wrong hands  ridcully thought  as he returned to the table .      an impressive display     said vetinari  as ridcully took his seat again .     am i right in thinking  mustrum  that the mister nutt you referred to is indeed  as it were  the mister nutt .         that   s right  yes  quite a decent chap .         and you   re letting him do alchemy .         i think it was his own idea  sir .         and he   s been standing here all this time .         very keen .  is there a problem  havelock .         no  no  not at all     said vetinari .     it was indeed an impressive display  glenda acknowledged  but while she watched it she could feel mrs whitlow   s gaze on her .  in theory glenda   s activities would merit another kind of firework display later on  but it wasn   t going to happen  was it .  she had nailed the invisible hammer .  but there were other  if less personal  matters on her mind .   stupid  silly  and thoughtless though some of her neighbours were  it was up to her  as ever  to protect their interests .  they had been dropped into a world they didn   t understand  so she had to understand it for them .  she thought this because as she prowled between the tables she could make out a certain type of clink  clink noise  and  sure enough  the amount of silverware on the tables appeared to be diminishing .  after watching carefully for a moment or two  she walked up behind mr stollop and without ceremony pulled three silver spoons and a silver fork out of his jacket pocket .   he spun around and then had the decency to look a bit embarrassed when he saw that it was her .   glenda didn   t have to open her mouth .      they   ve got so many     he protested .     who needs all those knives and forks .      she reached into the man   s other pocket and pulled out three silver knives and a silver salt cellar .      well  there   s such a lot     said stollop .     i didn   t think they   d miss one or two .      glenda stared at him .  the clinking of cutlery disappearing from the tables had been a small but noticeable part of the ambient noise for some time .  she leaned down until her face was an inch away from his .      mr stollop .  i wonder if that   s what lord vetinari is expecting you all to do .     his face went white .  she nodded .     just a word to the wise     she said .   and words spread fast .  as glenda walked on she was gratified to hear behind her  spreading along the tables  more clinking as a tide of cutlery flowed swiftly out of pockets and back on to the tables .  the tinkling flew up and down the tables like little fairy bells .   glenda smiled to herself and hurried off to dare everything .  or at least everything that she dared .     lord vetinari stood up .  for some inexplicable reason he needed no fanfare .  no    would you put your hands together for     no    lend me your ears     no    be upstanding for    .  he simply stood up and the noise went down .     gentlemen  thank you for coming  and may i thank you  archchancellor ridcully  for being such a generous host this evening .  may i also take this opportunity to put your minds at rest .      you see  there appears to be a rumour going around that i am against the playing of football .  nothing could be further from the truth .  i am completely in favour of the traditional game of football and  indeed  would be more than happy to see the game leave the fusty obscurity of the back streets .  moreover  while i know you have your own schedule of games  i personally propose a league  as it were  of senior teams  who will valiantly vie with one another for a golden cup        there were cheers  of a beery nature .         or should i say gold ish cup        more cheers and more laughter .         based on the recently discovered ancient urn known as the tackle  which  i am sure  you have all seen .      general sniggering .      and if you haven   t  then your wives certainly have .      silence  followed by a tsunami of laughter which  like most tidal waves  had a lot of froth on the top .   glenda  lurking among the serving girls  was taken aback and affronted at the same time  which was a bit of a squeeze  and wondered   so  he   s planning something .  they   re lapping it up along with the beer  too .      never seen that before     said a wine waiter beside her .      seen what before .         seen his lordship drinking .  he doesn   t even drink wine .      glenda looked at the skinny black figure and said  enunciating carefully     when you say he does not drink wine  do you mean he does not drink wine  or he does not drink   wine .         he doesn   t have a bloody drink .  that   s all i   m saying .  that   s lord vetinari  that is .  he   s got ears everywhere .         i can only see two  but he   s quite handsome  in a way .         oh  yeah  the ladies like him     said the waiter and sniffed .     everyone knows he   s got something going on with that vampire up in uberwald .  you know .  the one who invented the temperance league .  vampires who don   t suck blood .  hello  what   s this    .         let no one suppose that i am alone in a desire to see a better future for this great game     vetinari was saying .     tonight  gentlemen  you will see football  hear football and if you don   t duck  gentlemen  you might even eat football .  here to display a marriage of football from the past and i dare hope from the future  i present to you the first team of unseen university   unseen academicals .      the candles went out  all at once  even the ones high up in the chandelier  glenda could see pale ghosts of smoke rising in the gloom .  beside her  nutt started counting under his breath .  one  two   at the count of three  the candles at the far end of the hall burst into life again  revealing trevor likely  wearing his most infectious grin .      evenin    all     he said     an    to you too  your lordship .  my  but ain   t you lookin    quite the swell tonight .     as breaths were indrawn all around the hall trev pulled out his tin can  dropped it on to his foot and flicked it up on to his shoulder  where it travelled around the back of his neck and down his other arm .      at the start people used to kick rocks .  that was sort of stupid .  then they tried skulls  but you had to get    em off people and that led to fightin    .      beside glenda  nutt was still counting        an    now we   ve got what we call a ball     trev continued  as his tin can rolled and climbed around him     but it ain   t all that     cos it   s a lump of firewood .  you can   t kick it    less you   ve got big heavy boots on .  it   s slow .  it   s heavy .  it don   t live  gentlemen  and football should live        the doors at the other end of the hall opened and bengo macarona trotted in  bouncing the new football .  its gloing  gloing echoed around the hall .  some of the football captains had got to their feet  craning for a better view .      and with the old football  you couldn   t do this     said trev  and dived for the floor as macarona spun in one balletic movement and sent the ball screaming up the aisle like an angry hornet .   some scenes are only ever a memory rather than an experience  because they happen too fast for immediate comprehension  and glenda watched the subsequent events on the internal screen of horrified recollection .  there were the two archmages and the tyrant of the city  watching with frozen interest as the spinning globe hummed towards them  dragging terrible consequences in its wake  and then there was the librarian rising out of nowhere  stopping it dead in mid air with a hand like a shovel .      that   s us  gentlemen .  and we   ll take on the first team that joins us on the hippo on saturday at one o   clock .  we   ll be training all around the city .  you can join in if you like .  and don   t worry if you don   t have the balls .  we   ll give you some .     the candle flames went out  which was just as well because it is hard to riot in the dark .  when the flames rose again in their eerie way  shouting  arguments  laughter and even discussion were taking place on every table .  quietly  too  the servants went to and fro with their flagons .  there always seemed to be another one  glenda noticed .      what have they been drinking .     she whispered to the nearest waiter .      winkle   s old peculiar  mages    special .  it   s top stuff .         what about his lordship .      he grinned .     ha .  funny thing  some of    em have asked me that  too .  just the same as the guests .  poured out of the same flagon  just like for everyone else  so it   s       he stopped .   lord vetinari was on his feet again .     gentlemen  who among you will accept the challenge .  it need not be dimwell  it need not be dolly sisters  it need not be the nappers  it just has to be a team  gentlemen  the unseen academicals will take on the best of you  in the best traditions of sportsmanship .  i have set the date of the game for saturday .  as far as the academicals are concerned  you can watch them train and mister stibbons will give you all the advice you may need .  this will be a fair match  gentlemen  you have my word on it .     he paused .     did i mention that when it is presented  the very nearly gold urn will be full of beer .  the concept is quite popular  i gather  and i predict that for a reasonable period the golden cup will quite miraculously stay full of beer  no matter how many drink thereof .  i shall personally see to it .      this got a big cheer  too .  glenda felt embarrassed for the men  but angry at them too .  they were being led by the nose .  or  more accurately  by the beer .   vetinari didn   t need whips and thumbscrews  he just needed winkle   s old peculiar  mages    special  and he was leading them like little lambs and matching them pint for pint .  how could he manage that .  hey  look at me  he   s saying  i   m just like you  and he   s not like them at all .  they can   t have someone killed she paused the thought to allow consideration of some of the street fights when the pubs shut  and amended it to and get away with it .      my friend the archchancellor has just informed me that  of course  the unseen academicals will not on any account resort to magic .  nobody wants to see a team of frogs  i am sure .      there was general laughter at this lame joke  but the plain fact was that right now they would have laughed at a paper bag .      this will be a proper football match  gentlemen  no trickery  only skills     said the patrician  his voice sharp again .     and on that note i am decreeing a new code  based on the hallowed and traditional rules of football so recently rediscovered  but including many familiar ones of more recent usage .  the office of referee is there to ensure obedience to the rules .  there must be rules  my friends .  there must be .  there is no game without rules .  no rules  no game .      and there it was .  no one else seemed to notice  through the fumes  the razor blade glittering for a moment in the candyfloss .  rules .  thought glenda .  what are these new rules .  i never knew there were rules .  but lord vetinari   s assistant  whoever he was  was quietly putting a few sheets of paper in front of each man .   she remembered old stollop   s bafflement when confronted with a mere envelope .  some of them could read  surely .  but how many of them could read now .   his lordship had not finished .     finally  gentlemen  i would like you to peruse and sign the copies of the rules mister drumknott has given you .  and now i understand the archchancellor and his colleagues are looking forward to seeing you in the uncommon room for cigars and  i believe  an exceptionally rare brandy .      well  that would about wrap it up  wouldn   t it .  the footballers were used to just beer .  to be fair  they were used to lots of just beer .  nevertheless  if she was any judge  and she was pretty good  they would now be very nearly falling down drunk .  although some seasoned captains could stand up for some time while being  technically  falling down drunk .  and there is nothing more embarrassing than seeing a falling down drunk except for when it is a falling down drunk who is still standing up .  and that was amazing  the captains were the type of men who drank in quarts  and could belch the national anthem and bend steel bars with their teeth  or even somebody else   s teeth .  okay  they had never had much in the way of schooling  but why did they have to be so dumb .      tell me     murmured ridcully to vetinari as they watched the guests file out unsteadily     are you behind the discovery of the urn .         we have known one another for quite some time  mustrum  have we not     said vetinari     and as you know  i would not lie to you .     he paused for a moment and added     well  of course i would lie to you in acceptable circumstances  but on this occasion i can truthfully say that the discovery of the urn came as a surprise to me as well  albeit a pleasant one .  indeed  i assumed that you gentlemen had had something to do with it .         we didn   t even know it was there     said ridcully .     personally  i suspect that religion is involved .      vetinari smiled .     well  of course  classically  gods play with the fates of men  so i suppose there is no reason why it shouldn   t be football .  we play and are played and the best we can hope for is to do it with style .        it might have been possible to cut the air in the uncommon room with a knife  had anyone been able to find a knife .  or hold a knife the right way if found .  from the point of view of the wizards  it was business as usual  but while a number of captains were being wheeled away in a wheelbarrow  thoughtfully stationed there earlier in the evening  there were enough visitors still standing to make for a damp  hot hubbub .  in an unregarded corner  the patrician and the two archchancellors had found a space where they could relax unheeded in the big chairs and settle a few matters .      you know  henry     said vetinari to the former dean     i think it would be a very good idea if you were to referee the match .         oh  come on .  i think that would be most unfair     said ridcully .      to whom  pray .         well  er     said ridcully .     there could be a question of rivalry between wizards .         but on the other hand     said vetinari  his voice all smoothness     it might also be said that  for political reasons  another wizard would have a vested interest in not allowing a fellow archmage to be seen to be bested by people who  despite their often amazing talents  skills  features and histories  are nevertheless lumped together in the term ordinary people .      ridcully raised a very big brandy glass in the general direction of the edge of the universe .     i have every faith in my friend henry     he said .     even though he   s a little bit on the tubby side .         oh  unfair .     snapped henry .     a large man may be quite light on his feet .  is there any chance of me having the poisoned dagger .         in these modern times     said vetinari     i   m sorry to say that a whistle of some sort will have to suffice .      at which point someone tried to slap vetinari on the back .   it happened with remarkable speed and ended possibly even faster than it began  with vetinari still seated in his chair with his beer mug in one hand and the man   s wrist gripped tightly at head height .  he let go and said     can i help you  sir .         you   re that lord veterinary  ain   t ya .  i seed you on them postage stamps .      ridcully glanced up .  some of lord vetinari   s clerks were briskly heading towards them  along with some of the slurred speaker   s friends  who could be defined at this point as people who were slightly more sober than he was and right now were sobering up very  very fast  because when you have just slapped a tyrant on the back you need all the friends you can get .   vetinari nodded at his gentlemen  who evaporated back into the crowd  and then he snapped his fingers at one of the waiters .     a chair here  please  for my new friend .         are you sure .     said ridcully  as a chair was pushed under the man who  by happy coincidence  was falling backwards in any case .      i mean     said the man     everary one saysh you   re a bit of a wnacker  but i saysh you   re awright over thish football fing .     sno future in jus    shlogging away .  i should know  i got kicked inna head quite a few times .         really .     said lord vetinari .     and what is your name .         swithin  shir     said the man .      any other name  by any chance .     said vetinari .      dustworthy     he said .  he raised a finger in a kind of salute .     captain  the cockbill boars .         ah  you aren   t having a good season     said vetinari .     you need fresh blood in the squad  especially since jimmy wilkins got put into the tanty after eating someone   s nose .  naphill walked all over you because you lost your backbone when both of the pinchpenny brothers were taken to the lady sybil  and you   ve been stuck down in the mud for three seasons .  okay  everyone says that harry capstick is making a very good showing since you bought him from treacle mine tuesday for two crates of winkle   s old peculiar and a sack of pork scratchings  which is not bad for a man with a wooden leg  but there   s never anyone in support .      a circle of silence spread outwards from vetinari and the swaying swithin .  ridcully   s mouth had dropped open and henry   s brandy glass remained half empty  an unusual occurrence for a glass that   s been in the hands of a wizard for more than fifteen seconds .      also  i   m hearing that your pies are leaving a lot to be desired  such as dead  cooked  organic content     continued vetinari .     can   t get the shove behind you when the pies are seen to walk about .         my ladsh     said swithin     are the besht there ish .  it   sh not their fault they   re up againsht better people .  they never getsh a chance to play shomeone they can beat .  they alwaysh gives it one hundred and twenty pershent and you can   t give more than that .  anyhow  how come you know all this shtuff .  it   s not like we   re big in the league .         oh  i take an interest     said vetinari .     i believe that football is a lot like life .         there ish that  shir  there ish that .  you does your besht and then shomeone kicksh you inna fork .         then i strongly advise you to take an interest in our new football     said vetinari     which will be about speed  skill and thinking .         oh  yeah  right  i can do all them     said swithin  at which point he fell off his chair .      does this poor man have any friends here .     said vetinari  turning to the crowd .   there was some diffidence among them concerning whether or not it was a good idea to be friends with swithin at this point .   vetinari raised his voice     i would just like a couple of people to take him back to his home .  i would like them to put him to bed and see that no trouble comes to him .  perhaps they ought to stay with him until morning too  because he just might try to commit suicide when he wakes up .           new dawn for football    said the times when glenda picked it up the next morning .  as was its wont when it was reporting something it thought was particularly important  the paper   s headline was followed by two others in descending sizes of font     footballers sign up for the new game    was on the next line down and then on the next    new balls a success    .   to glenda   s surprise and dismay  juliet still had a place on the front page  with the picture of her used smaller than yesterday  under the headline    mystery lady vanishes     and a paragraph which simply said that no one had seen the mystery model  jewels  since her debut  glenda had to look this one up  two days ago .  honestly  she thought  not finding somebody is news .  and she was surprised that there was room for even this  since most of the front page was dedicated to the football  but the times liked to start several stories on the front page and then  just when they were getting interesting  whisk them off to page     or somewhere  to end their days behind the crossword and the permanent advert for surgical trusses .   the leader column inside was headed    score one for vetinari    .  glenda never normally read the leader column because there was only a certain number of times she was prepared to see the word    however    used in a     word article .   she read the front page story at first glumly and then with rising anger .  vetinari had done it .  he had got them drunk and the fools had signed away their football for a pale variety cooked up by the palace and the university .  of course  minds are never quite that simple .  she had to admit to herself that she hated the stupidity of the present game .  she hated the idiot fighting and mindless shoving  but it was hers to hate .  it was something that people themselves had put together and rickety and stupid though it was  it was theirs .  and now the nobs were again picking up something that wasn   t theirs and saying how wonderful it was .  the old football was going to be banned .  that was another little razor blade in lord vetinari   s alcoholic candyfloss .   she was also deeply suspicious about the urn  the picture of which  for some reason  was still on her kitchen table .  since what was claimed to be the original rules was written in an ancient language  how could anyone other than a nob know what they meant .  she ran her eye down the description of the new rules .  some of the rules of old street football had survived in there like monsters from another era .  she recognized one that she had always liked  the ball shall be called the ball .  the ball is the ball that is played as the ball by any three consecutive players  at which point it is the ball .  she   d loved it when she first read it for the sheer stupidity of its phraseology .  apparently  it had been added on a day  centuries ago  when an unfortunately severed head had rolled into play and had rather absent mindedly replaced the ball currently in play on account of some body  formerly belonging to the head  now lying on the original ball .  that kind of thing stuck in the memory  especially because after the match the owner of the head was credited with scoring the winning goal .   that rule and a few others stood out as remnants of a vanished glory in the list of lord vetinari   s new regulations .  a few nods at the old game had been left in as a kind of sop to public opinion .  he should not be allowed to get away with it .  just because he was a tyrant and capable of having just about anybody killed on a whim  people acted as if they were scared of him .  someone ought to tell him off .  the world had turned upside down several times .  she hadn   t quite got her bearings  but making sure that lord vetinari did not get away with it was suddenly very important .  it was up to the people to decide when they were being stupid and old fashioned  it wasn   t up to nobs to tell them what to do .   with great determination she put on her coat over her apron and  after a moment   s thought  took two freshly made jammy devils from her cupboard .  where a battering ram cannot work  really good shortcrust pastry can often break through .     in the oblong office  the patrician   s personal secretary looked at the stopwatch .      fifty seconds slower than your personal best  i   m afraid  my lord .         proof indeed that strong drink is a mocker  drumknott     said vetinari severely .      i suspect that no further proof is needed     said drumknott  with his little secretarial smile .      although i would  in fairness  point out that charlotte of the times is emerging as the most fearsome crossword compiler of all time  and they are a pretty fearsome lot .  but her .  initialisms  odds and evens  hidden words  container reverses  and now diagonals .  how does she do it .         well  you did it  sir .         i undid it .  that is much easier .     vetinari raised a finger .     it is that woman who runs the pet shop in pellicool steps  depend upon it .  she hasn   t been mentioned as a winner recently .  she must be compiling the things .         the female mind is certainly a devious one  my lord .      vetinari looked at his secretary in surprise .     well  of course it is .  it has to deal with the male one .  i think        there was a gentle tap at one of the doors .  the patrician turned back to the times while drumknott slipped out of the room .  after some whispered exchanges  the secretary returned .      it would appear that a young woman has got in via the back gate by bribing the guards  sir .  they accepted the bribes  as per your standing orders  and she has been shown into the anteroom  which she will soon find is locked .  she wishes to see you because  she says  she has a complaint .  she is a maid .      lord vetinari looked over the top of the paper .     tell her i can   t help her with that .  perhaps  oh  i don   t know  a different perfume would help .         i mean she is a member of the serving classes  sir .  her name is glenda sugarbean .         tell her       vetinari hesitated  and then smiled .     ah  yes  sugarbean .  did she bribe the guards with food .  something baked  perhaps .         well done  sir .  a large jammy devil apiece .  may i ask how    .         she is a cook  drumknott  not a maid .  show her in  by all means .      the secretary looked a little resentful .     are you sure this is wise  sir .  i have already told the guards to throw the foodstuffs away .         food cooked by a sugarbean .  you may have committed a crime against high art  drumknott .  i shall see her now .         i must point out that you have a full schedule this morning  my lord .         quite so .  it is your job to point this out  and i respect that .  but i did not return until half past four this morning and i distinctly remember stubbing my toe on the stairs .  i am as drunk as a skunk  drumknott  which of course means skunks are just as drunk as i .  i must say the term is unfamiliar to me  and i had not thought hitherto of skunks in this context  but mustrum ridcully was kind enough to enlighten me .  allow me  then  a moment of indulgence .         well  you are the patrician  sir     said drumknott .     you can do as you please .         that is kind of you to say so  but i did not  in fact  need reminding     said vetinari  with what was almost certainly a smile .     when the severe thin man opened the door  it was too late to flee .  when he said     his lordship will see you now  miss sugarbean     it was too late to faint .  what had she been thinking of .  had she been thinking at all .   glenda followed the man into the next room  which was oak panelled and sombre and the most uncluttered office she had ever seen .  the room of the average wizard was so stuffed with miscellaneous things that the walls were invisible .  here  even the desk was clear  apart from a pot of quill pens  an inkwell  an open copy of the ankh morpork times and   her eye stayed fixed on this one  unable to draw itself away   a mug with the slogan    to the world   s greatest boss    .  it was so out of place it might have been an intrusion from another universe .   a chair was quietly placed behind her .  this was just as well  because when the man at the desk looked up she sat down abruptly .   vetinari pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed .     miss   sugarbean  there are whole rooms in this palace full of people who want to see me  and they are powerful and important people  or at least they think they are .  yet mister drumknott has kindly inserted in my schedule  ahead of the postmaster general and the mayor of sto lat  a meeting with a young cook with her coat on over her apron and an intent  it says here  of    having it out with me    .  and this is because i take notice of incongruity  and you  miss sugarbean  are incongruous .  what is it you want .         who says i want anything .         everyone wants something when they are in front of me  miss sugarbean  even if it is only to be somewhere else .         all right .  you made all the captains drunk last night and got them to sign that letter in the paper .      the stare did not flicker .  that was much worse than  well  anything .      young lady  drink levels all mankind .  it is the ultimate democrat  if you like that sort of thing .  a drunk beggar is as drunk as a lord  and so is a lord .  and have you ever noticed that all drunks can understand one another  no matter how drunk they are and how different their native tongues .  i take it for a certainty that you are a relation to augusta sugarbean .     the question  tagged on to the praises of inebriation  hit her between the eyes  scattering her thoughts .      what .  oh .  well  yes .  that   s right .  she was my grandmother .         and she was a cook at the guild of assassins when she was younger .         that   s right .  she always made a joke about how she wouldn   t let them use any       she stopped quickly  but vetinari finished the sentence for her .         of her cakes to poison people .  and we always obeyed  too  because as you surely know  miss  no one likes to upset a good cook .  is she still with us .         she passed on two years ago  sir .         but since you are a sugarbean  i assume you have acquired a few more grandmothers as a replacement .  your grandmother was always a stalwart in the community and you must take all those little dainties for someone .         you can   t know that  you   re only guessing .  but all right  they   re for all the old ladies that don   t get out much .  anyway  it   s a perk .         oh  but of course .  every job has its little perks .  why  i don   t expect drumknott here has bought a paperclip in his life  eh  drumknott .      the secretary  tidying papers in the background  gave a wan little smile .      look  i only take leftovers       glenda began  but this was waved away .      you are here about the football     said vetinari .     you were at the dinner last night  but the university likes its serving girls to be tall and i have an eye for such things .  therefore  i assume you made it your business to be there without bothering your superiors .  why .         you   re taking their football away from them .      the patrician steepled his fingers and rested his chin on them while he looked at her .   he   s trying to make me nervous  she thought .  it   s working  oh  it   s working .   vetinari filled in the silence .     your grandmother used to do people   s thinking for them .  that trait runs in families  always on the female side .  capable women  scurrying about in a world where everyone else seems to be seven years old and keeps on falling over in the playground  picking them up and watching them run right out there again .  i imagine you run the night kitchen .  too many people in the big one .  you want spaces you can control  beyond the immediate reach of fools .      if he   d added    am i right .     like some windbag seeking applause  she would have hated him .  but he was reading her from the inside of her head  in a calm  matter of fact way .  she had to suppress a shiver  because it was all true .      i   m taking nothing from anybody  miss sugarbean .  i am simply changing the playground     the man went on .     what skill is there in the mob pushing and shoving .  it is nothing more than a way of bringing on a sweat .  no  we must move with the times .  i know the times moves with me .  the captains will moan  no doubt  but they are getting old .  dying in the game is a romantic idea when you are young  but when you are older the boot is in the other ear .  they know this  even if they won   t admit it  and while they will protest  they will take care not to be taken seriously .  in fact  far from taking  i am giving much .  acceptance  recognition  a certain standing  a gold ish cup and the chance to keep what remains of their teeth .      all she could manage after this was     all right  but you tricked them .         really .  they did not have to drink to excess  did they .         you knew they would .         no .  i suspected they might .  they could have been more cautious .  they should have been more cautious .  i   d prefer to say that i led them along the correct path with a little guile rather than drove them along it with sticks .  i possess many types of stick  miss sugarbean .         and you   ve been spying on me .  you knew about the dainties .         spying .  madam  it was once said of a great prince that his every thought was of his people .  like him  i watch over my people .  i am just better at it  that   s all .  as for the dainties business  that was a simple deduction from the known facts of human nature .      there was a lot that glenda wanted to say  but in some very definite way she sensed that the interview   or at least the part of it that involved her opening her mouth   was over .  nevertheless  she said     why aren   t you drunk .         i beg your pardon .         you must weigh about half of what they do and all of    em went home in wheelbarrows .  you drank as much as them and you look fresh as a daisy .  what is the trick .  did you get the wizards to magic the beer out of your stomach .      she had stopped pushing her luck a long time ago .  now it was out of control  like a startled carthorse that can   t stop because of the huge load bouncing and rumbling along behind it .   vetinari frowned .     my dear lady  anyone drunk enough to let wizards  who themselves had just been partaking copiously of the fruit of the vine  i might add  take anything out of him would already be so drunk as to be dead .  to forestall your next comment  the hop is also  technically  a vine .  i am  in fact  drunk .  is this not so  drumknott .         you did indeed consume some twelve pints of very strong malted beverage  sir .  technically  you must be drunk .         idiosyncratically put  drumknott .  thank you .         you don   t act drunk .         no  but i do act sober quite well  don   t you think .  and i must confess that this morning   s crossword was something of a tussle .  procatalepsis and pleonasm in one day .  i had to use the dictionary .  the woman is a fiend .  nevertheless  thank you for coming  miss sugarbean .  i recall your grandmother   s bubble and squeak with great fondness .  if she had been a sculptress  it would have been an exquisite statue  with no arms and an enigmatic smile .  it is such a shame that some masterpieces are so transitory .      the proud cook in glenda rose unstoppably .     but she passed the recipe on to me .         a legacy better than jewels     said vetinari  nodding .   actually a few jewels would not have gone amiss  glenda reflected .  but there was a secret of bubble and squeak  of course  right out there in the open where everyone could miss it .  and as for the truth of salmagundi        i believe this audience is at an end  miss sugarbean     said vetinari .     i have so much to do and so have you  i am sure .     he picked up his pen and turned his attention to the documents in front of him .     goodbye  miss sugarbean .      and that was it .  somehow  she was at the door  and it had almost closed behind her when a voice said     and thank you for your kindnesses to nutt .      the door clicked shut  nearly hitting her in the face as she spun round .        was that a wise thing for me to have said  do you think .     said vetinari  when she had gone .      possibly not  sir  but she will merely assume it is her that we are watching     said drumknott smoothly .      possibly we should .  that   s a sugarbean woman for you  drumknott  little domestic slaves until they think someone has been wronged and then they go to war like queen ynci of lancre  with chariot wheels spinning and arms and legs all over the place .         and no father     observed drumknott .     not very good for a child in those days .         only served to make her tougher .  one can only hope she doesn   t take it into her head to enter politics .         is that not what she is doing now  sir .         well noted  drumknott .  do i appear drunk .         in my opinion no  sir  but you seem unusually   talkative .         coherently .         to the minutest scruple  sir .  the postmaster is waiting  sir  and some of the guild leaders want to talk to you urgently .         i suspect they want to play football .         yes  sir .  they intend to form teams .  i cannot for the life of me understand why .      vetinari put down his pen .     drumknott  if you saw a ball lying invitingly on the ground  would you kick it .      the secretary   s forehead wrinkled .     how would the invitation be couched  sir .         i   m sorry .         would it be  for example  a written note attached to the ball by person or persons unknown .         i was rather inclining to the idea that you might perhaps feel simply that the whole world was silently willing you to give said ball a hearty kick .         no  sir .  there are too many variables .  possibly an enemy or japester might have assumed that i would take some action of the kind and made the ball out of concrete or similar material  in the hope i might do myself a serious or humorous injury .  so  i would check first .         and then  if all was in order  you would kick the ball .         to what purpose or profit  sir .         interesting question .  i suppose for the joy of seeing it fly .      drumknott seemed to consider this for a while  and then shook his head .     i am sorry  sir  but you have lost me at this point .         ah  you are a pillar of rock in a world of changes  drumknott .  well done .         i was wondering if i could just add something  sir     said the secretary solemnly .      the floor is yours  drumknott .         i would not like it thought that i do not buy my own paperclips  sir .  i enjoy owning my own paperclips .  it means that they are mine .  i thought it helpful i should tell you that in a measured and non confrontational way .      vetinari looked at the ceiling for a few moments and then said     thank you for your frankness .  i shall consider the record straightened and the matter closed .         thank you  sir .          sator square was where the city went when it was upset  baffled or fearful .  people who had no real idea why they were doing so congregated to listen to other people who also did not know anything  on the basis that ignorance shared is ignorance doubled .  there were clusters of people there this morning and several scratch teams  for it is written  or more probably scrawled on a wall somewhere  that wherever two or more are gathered together  at least one will have something to kick .  tin cans and tightly wound balls of rag were annoying adults on all sides  but as glenda hurried nearer  the big doors of the university opened and ponder stibbons stepped out  somewhat inexpertly bouncing one of the wretched new leather balls .  gloing .  silence clanged  as rolling cans rattled on unheeded .  all eyes were on the wizard and on the ball .  he threw it down and there was a double gloing .  as it bounced off the stones .  and then he kicked it .  it was a bit wussy as kicks went  that kick  but no one in the square had ever kicked anything even one tenth as far  and every male chased after it  propelled by ancient instinct .   they   ve won  glenda thought glumly .  a ball that goes gloing .  when others go clunk   well  where   s the contest .   she hurried on to the back entrance .  in a world that was getting too complicated  where she could barge in on the black hearted tyrant and walk out unscathed  she needed a place to go that wasn   t spinning .  the night kitchen was as familiar as her bedroom  her place  under her control .  she could face anything there .   there was a figure lounging against the wall by the rubbish bins  and for some reason she identified it right away  despite the heavy cloak and the hat pulled down over the eyes  no one she had ever met could relax as perfectly as pepe .      wotcher  glenda     said a voice from under the hat .      what are you doing here .     she said .      do you know how hard it is to find somebody in this city when you can   t tell anyone what they look like and aren   t really sure you can remember their name .     said pepe .     where   s jools .         i don   t know     she said .     i haven   t seen her since last night .         it might be a good idea to find her before other people do     said pepe .      what people .     said glenda .   pepe shrugged .     everybody     he said .     they   re mostly looking in the dwarf districts right now  but it can only be a matter of time .  we can   t move down at the shop for them and it was all i could do to sneak out .         what are they after her for .     said glenda  panic rising .     i saw in the paper that people were trying to find her  but she hasn   t done anything wrong .         i don   t think you exactly grasp what   s going on     said the  possible  dwarf .     they want to find her to ask her a lot of questions .         has this got anything to do with lord vetinari .     said glenda suspiciously .      i wouldn   t have thought so     said pepe .      what sort of questions  then .         oh  you know what is your favourite colour .  what do you like to eat .  are you an item with anybody .  what advice do you have for young people today .  do you wax .  where do you get your hair done .  what is your favourite spoon .         i don   t think she   s got a favourite spoon     said glenda  waiting for the world to make some sense .   pepe patted her on the shoulder .     look  she   s on the front page of the paper  isn   t she .  and the times keeps on at us about wanting to do a lifestyle profile of her .  that might not actually be a bad thing  but it   s up to you .         i don   t think she   s got a lifestyle     said glenda  a little bewildered .     she   s never said .  and she doesn   t wax .  she hardly even dusts .  anyway  just tell them all that she doesn   t want to talk to anybody .      pepe   s expression went strange for a moment  then he said with care  like a man  or dwarf  struggling to be heard across a cultural divide     do you think i was talking about furniture .         well  what else .  and i don   t think her housework is anyone else   s business .         don   t you understand .  she   s popular  and the more we tell people they can   t talk to her  the more they want to  and the more you say no the more interested they become .  people want to know all about her     said pepe .      like what her favourite spoon is .     said glenda .      i might have been a bit ironic     said pepe .     but there   s newspaper writers all over the city looking for her and bu bubble want to do a two page spread on her .     he paused .     that means they   ll write about her and it   ll take two pages     he volunteered helpfully .     the low king of the dwarfs has said that she is an icon for our times  according to satblatt .         what   s satblatt .     said glenda .      oh  the dwarf newspaper     said pepe .     you   ll probably never see it .         but she was just in a fashion show .     wailed glenda .     she was just walking up and down .  i   m sure she doesn   t want to get involved in all that sort of thing .      pepe gave her a sharp look .     are you .     he said .   and then she thought  really thought about juliet  who would read bu bubble from cover to cover  wouldn   t generally go near the times  but would absorb all kinds of rubbish about frivolous and silly people .  people that glittered .     i don   t know where she is     she said .     i really haven   t seen her since yesterday .         ah  a mystery disappearance     said pepe .     look  we   re already learning about this sort of thing down at the shop .  can we go somewhere a bit more private .  i hope none of them followed me up here .         well  i can smuggle you in through the back entrance  as long as there isn   t a bledlow around     said glenda .      fine by me .  i   m used to that sort of thing .      she led him through the doorway and into the maze of cellars and yards that contrasted rather interestingly with the fine frontage of unseen university .      got anything to drink .     said pepe behind her .      water .     snapped glenda .      i   ll drink water when fish climb out of it to take a piss  but thank you all the same     said pepe .   and then glenda caught the smell of baking coming from the night kitchen .  she was the only one who baked in her kitchen .  no one else was supposed to bake in her kitchen .  baking was her responsibility .  hers .  she ran up the steps with pepe behind her and noted that the mystery cook had yet to master the second most important rule of cooking  which was to tidy things up afterwards .  the place was a mess .  there were even lumps of dough on the floor .  in fact  it looked as though it had been possessed by some kind of frenzy .  and in the middle of it all  curled up on glenda   s battered and slightly rancid old armchair  was juliet .      just like sleeping beauty  ain   t it .     said pepe behind her .   glenda ignored him and hurried along the rows of ovens .     she   s been baking pies .  what on earth did she want to come along and bake pies for .  she   s never been any good at baking pies .     that   s because i   ve never let her bake a pie  she told herself .  that   s because as soon as she found anything difficult you took it away and did it yourself  her inner voice scolded .   glenda opened oven door after oven door .  they had arrived just in time .  by the smell of it  a couple of dozen assorted pies were cooked to a turn .      how about a drink .     said pepe  in whom thirst sprang eternal .     i   m sure there   s brandy .  every kitchen has some brandy in it somewhere .      he watched as glenda pulled the pies out  using her apron to protect her hands .  pepe regarded the pies with the indifference of a man who likes to drink his meals and listened to glenda   s sotto voce monologue as pie after pie was laid out on the table .      i never told her to do this .  why did she do this .     because i did tell her to do this  sort of  that   s why .     and these are not half bad pies     she said more loudly .  in surprise .   juliet opened her eyes  looked around blearily  and then her face contorted in panic .      it   s okay  i   ve taken them all out     said glenda .     well done .         i didn   t know what else to do and trev was busy with the footballing and i thought they would be wantin    pies tomorrow and i thought i better do some     said juliet .     sorry .      glenda took a step backwards .  how to begin .  she wondered .  how to unravel it and then ravel it all back up again in a better shape because she had been wrong .  juliet hadn   t just walked up and down with clothes on  she had become some kind of a dream .  a dream of clothes .  sparkling and alive and tantalizingly possible .  and in glenda   s memory of the fashion show  she literally shone  as if being lit from the inside .  it was a kind of magic and it shouldn   t be making pies .  she cleared her throat .      i   ve taught you a lot of things  haven   t i  juliet .     said glenda .      yes  glenda     said juliet .      and they   ve always been useful  haven   t they .         yes  glenda .  i remember it was you that said i should always keep my hand on my ha   penny and i   m very glad that you did .      there was a strange noise from pepe  and glenda  feeling her face go red  didn   t dare look at him .      then i   ve got a bit more advice for you  juliet .         yes  glenda .         first  never  ever apologize for anything that doesn   t need apologizing for     said glenda .     and especially never apologize for just being yourself .         yes  glenda .         got that .         yes  glenda .         no matter what happens  always remember that you now know how to make a good pie .         yes  glenda .         pepe is here because bu bubble wants to write something about you     said glenda .     your picture was in the paper again this morning and       glenda stopped .     she is going to be all right  isn   t she .     she said .   pepe paused in the act of surreptitiously removing a bottle from a cupboard .     you can trust me and madame on that     he said .     only people who are very trustworthy would dare to look as untrustworthy as me and madame .         and all she will have to do is show off clothes   don   t drink that  that   s cider vinegar .         i   m only drinking the cider bit     said pepe .     yes  all she   ll have to do is show off clothes  but to judge from the mob back at the shop there   s going to be people who want her to show off shoes  hats  hairstyles           no hanky panky     said glenda .      i don   t think you   ll find  anywhere in the world  a greater expert in both hanky and panky than madame .  in fact  i would be surprised if you  glenda  knew one hundredth of the hanky and panky that she does  especially as she invented quite a lot of it herself .  and since we   ll notice it when we see it  we   ll keep an eye on her .         and she   s got to eat proper meals and get a good night   s sleep     said glenda .   pepe nodded  although she expected that both those concepts were quite alien to him .      and paid     she added .      we   ll cut her in on the profits if she works exclusively for us     said pepe .     madame wants to talk to you about that .         yes  someone might want to pay her more than you do     said glenda .      my  my  my .  how fast we learn .  i   m sure madame will have great fun talking to you .      juliet looked from one to the other  sleep still wreathing her face .     you want me to go back to the shop .         i don   t want you to do anything     said glenda .     it   s up to you  okay .  it   s just up to you  but it seems to me that if you stay here then basically what you   ll be doing is pies .         well  not just pies     said juliet .      well  no  fair enough  there are also flans  bubble and squeak and assorted late night dainties     said glenda .     but you know what i mean .  on the other hand  you could go and show off all these fancy clothes and go to lots of fancy places a long  long way from here and see a lot of new people and you   d know that if it all goes pear shaped you could always make it pie shaped .         hah  nice one     said pepe  who   d found another bottle .      i really would like to go     said juliet .      then go now .  i mean right now  or at least as soon as he   s finished drinking the ketchup .         but i   ll have to go back for my stuff .      glenda reached down inside her vest and pulled out a burgundy coloured booklet with the seal of ankh morpork on it .      what   s that .     said juliet .      your bank book .  your money   s safe in the bank and you can take it out any time you want .      juliet turned the bank book over and over in her hands .     i don   t fink anyone in my family   s ever been in a bank except for uncle geoffrey and they caught up with    im even before he got home .         keep quiet about it .  don   t go home .  buy yourself lots of new stuff .  get yourself sorted out and then go back and see your dad and everybody when you have .  the point is  even if you don   t go right away  in your mind you should always be going .  but the important thing is to go right now .  move out .  get on .  climb up .  all the things i should have done .         what about trev .     said juliet .   glenda had to think about that .     how are things with you and trev  then .  i saw you two talking last night .         talking is allowed     said juliet defensively .     anyhow  he was only telling me how he was going to get himself a better job .         doing what .     said glenda .     i   ve never seen him doing a straight day   s work in all the years i   ve known him .         he says he   s going to find something     said juliet .     he said nutt told    im to .  he said nutt said that when trev finds out who trev is  like  he will  like  know what he can do .  so i told    im he was trevor likely  and he said that was  you know  helpful .      i   m stuck  aren   t i .  glenda told herself .  i   m talking about changing and getting out  so i have to allow that maybe he   s going to  too .  aloud  she said     it   s up to you .  it   s all up to you  but just mind that he keeps his hands to himself .         he always keeps his hands to himself     said juliet .     it   s a bit worryin    .  i   ve never had to think about kneeing him in the tonker  not once .      there was a strangled laugh from pepe  who had just discovered the wow wow sauce .  the bottle was almost empty and  in theory  he should have no stomach left .      never  ever .     said glenda  mystified at this unnatural history .      no  he   s always very polite and just a bit sad .      that must mean he   s planning something  glenda   s inner self provided .  she said     well  it   s up to you .  i can   t help here  but remember  you   ve always got your knee .         and what about    .     juliet began .      look     said glenda firmly     either you go off now and see the world and earn lots of money and get your picture in the papers and all of the other things i know you would really like to do  or you have to sort it out for yourself .         we   re going to be here for some time     said pepe .     you know  this sauce would be nice with a little bit of vodka in it .  it really would give it a little bit of zest .  a little bit of sparkle .  come to think of it  a lot of vodka would be even better .         but i love    im .     juliet wailed .      that   s all right  then  stay here     said glenda .     have you even kissed .         no .  he never quite gets round to it .         perhaps he   s one of those gentlemen who don   t like the ladies     said pepe primly .      and we could really do without your input     snapped glenda  turning on him .      i mean  for some of the others  like rotten johnny  i nearly wear my knee out  but trev   s just   sweet  all the time .         look  i know you told me to keep out of this  and i know i   ve been a terrible sinner in my time and hope to remain so  but i have been around the houses more times than a postman and the reason for this imp ass is obvious     pepe volunteered .     he   s got the nous to see that she   s so beautiful that she should be painted standing on some shell somewhere without her vest on and little fat pink babies inexplicably zooming around all over the place and he   s some kid with nothing more than a bit of street smarts .  i mean  it   s pointless  isn   t it .  he   s not going to stand a chance and he knows it  even if he doesn   t know he knows it .         i   d give him a kiss if he wanted one and would definitely not knee him in the tonker     said juliet .      you have to sort it out     said glenda .     i can   t sort it out for you .  if i tried  it would get sorted out all wrong .         but       juliet began .      no  that   s it     said glenda .     off you go  buy yourself lots of nice stuff   it   s your money .  and if you don   t look after her  mister pepe  a knee would only be the start .      pepe nodded and very gently tugged juliet away and down the stone steps .   now what would i do at this point if i were in a romantic novel .  glenda said to herself as the footsteps died away .  her reading had left her pretty much an expert on what to do if you were in a romantic novel  although one of the things that really annoyed her about romantic novels  as she had confided to mr wobble  was that no one did any cooking in them .  after all  cooking was important .  would it hurt to have a pie making sequence .  would a novel called pride and buns be totally out of the question .  even a few tips on how to make fairy cakes would help  and be pretty much in period as well .  she   d be a little happier if  even  the lovers could be thrown into the mixing bowl of life .  at least it would be some acknowledgement that people actually ate food .   around about now she knew  and knew all through her body  that she should be dissolving into a flood of tears .  she started cleaning up the floor .  then she cleaned up the ovens .  she always left them sparkling  but that was no reason not to clean them again .  she used an old toothbrush to ease minute amounts of dirt from odd corners  scoured every pot with fine sand  emptied the grates  riddled the cinders  swept the floor  tied two brooms together to dislodge the spider   s webs of years from the high wall  and scrubbed again until the soapy water poured down the stone stairs and washed away the footprints .   oh  yes   and one other thing .  there were some anchovies on the freezing slab .  she warmed up a couple and went to the large three legged cauldron in the corner of the kitchen where last night she had chalked the words    do not touch    .  she took off the lid and peered into its depths .  the crab that verity pushpram had given her last night  which seemed a very long time ago now  waved its eyeballs at her .      i wonder what would have happened if i had left the lid off .     she said .     i wonder how fast crabs learn .      she dropped in the soggy anchovies  which seemed to meet with crabby approval .  with that done  she stood in the middle of the kitchen and looked for something else to clean .  the black iron would never shine  but every surface had been scrubbed and dried .  as for the plates  you could eat your dinner off them .  if you wanted a job done properly  you had to do it yourself .  juliet   s version of cleanliness was next to godliness  which was to say it was erratic  past all understanding and was seldom seen .   something brushed against her face .  she absent mindedly swiped at it and found her fingers holding a black feather .  those wretched things in the pipes .  someone ought to do something about them .  she took her longest broom and banged on a pipe .     go on .  get out of there .     she yelled .  there was a scuffling in the darkness and a faint    awk .  awk .             scuse me  miss     said a voice  and she looked down the steps into the misshapen face of   what was his name .  oh  yes .     good morning  mister concrete     she said to the troll .  she couldn   t help but notice the brown stains coming from his nose .      can   t find mister trev     concrete stated .      haven   t seen him all morning     said glenda .      can   t find mister trev     the troll repeated  louder .      why do you need him .     said glenda .  as far as she knew  the vats just about ran themselves .  you told concrete to dribble candles and he dribbled candles until he   d run out of candles .      mister nutt sick     said concrete .     can   t find mister trev .         take me to mister nutt right now .     said glenda .     it   s a bit harsh to call anybody a denizen  but the people who lived and worked in the candle vats fitted the word to a t .  the vats were  in fact  their den .  if you ever saw them anywhere in the underground maze  they were always scuttling very fast  but most of the time they just worked and slept and stayed alive .  nutt was lying on an old mattress with his arms wrapped tightly around himself .  glenda took one look and turned to the troll .     go and find mister trev     she said .      can   t find mister trev     said the troll .      keep on looking .     she knelt down beside nutt .  his eyes had rolled back inside his head .     mister nutt  can you hear me .      he seemed to wake .     you must go away     he said .     it will be very dangerous .  the door will open .         what door is that .     she said  trying to remain cheerful .  she looked at the denizens  who were watching her with a kind of meek horror .     can   t one of you find something to put over him .     the mere question sent them scurrying in panic .      i have seen the door  so it will open again     said nutt .      i can   t see any door  mister nutt     said glenda  looking around .   nutt   s eyes opened wide .     it   s in my head .      there was no privacy to the vats  it was just a wider room off the long  endless corridor .  people went past all the time .      i think you may have been overdoing it  mister nutt     said glenda .     you rush around working all hours  worrying yourself sick .  you need a rest .     to her surprise  one of the denizens turned up holding a blanket  quite large parts of which were still flexible .  she put it over him just as trev arrived .  he had no choice about arriving as concrete was dragging him by the collar .  he looked down at nutt and then up at glenda .     what   s happened to him .         i don   t know .     she raised a finger to her head and swivelled it a little  the universal symbol for    gone nuts    .      you must go away .  things will be very dangerous     nutt moaned .      please tell us what is going on     said glenda .     please tell me .         i can   t     said nutt .     i cannot say the words .         there are words you want to say .     said trev .      words that don   t want to be said .  strong words .         can   t we help .     glenda persevered .      are you sick .     said trev .      no  mister trev .  i passed an adequate bowel motion this morning .     that was a flash of the old nutt precise  but slightly odd .      sick in the head .     said glenda .  that came out of desperation .      yes .  in the head     said nutt .     shadows .  doors .  can   t tell you .         is there anyone who can cure that kind of sickness .      nutt didn   t answer for a while and then said     yes .  you must find me a philosopher trained in uberwald .  they will help the thoughts come straight .         isn   t that what you did for trev .     said glenda .     you told him what he was thinking about his dad and everything  and that made him a lot happier  didn   t it  trev .         yes  it did     said trev .     and there   s no need to elbow me in the ribs like that .  it really did help .  couldn   t you be hypnotized .     he said to nutt .     i saw a man in the music hall once and he just waved his shiny watch at them and it   s amazing the kind of things they did .  barked like dogs  even .         yes .  hypnosis is an important part of the philosophy     said nutt .     it helps to relax the patient so that the thoughts get a chance to be heard .         well  there you are  then     said glenda .     why not try doing it on yourself .  i   m sure i could find something shiny for you to wave .      trev pulled his beloved tin can out of his pocket .     tra la .  and i think i   ve got a piece of string here somewhere .         that is all very well  but i would not be able to ask myself the right kinds of questions because i will have been hypnotized .  how the questions are posed is very important     said nutt .      i know what     said trev .     i   ll tell you to ask yourself to ask the right questions .  you   d know what questions to ask if it was someone else  wouldn   t you .         yes  mister trev .         you didn   t need to hypnotize trev     glenda pointed out .      no  but his thoughts were close to the surface .  i fear that mine will not be so easy to access .         can you really be hypnotized to ask yourself the right questions .         in the doors of deception  fussbinder did report on a way of hypnotizing himself     said nutt .     it is conceivably possible       his voice trailed off .      then let   s get on with it     said trev .     better out than in  as my old granny used to say .         i think perhaps that it is not such a good idea .         didn   t do me any harm     said trev robustly .      the things that i do not know   the things that i do not know       muttered nutt .      what about them .     said glenda .      the things that i do not know       said nutt     i think are behind the door  because i think i put them there because i think i do not want to know them .         so you must know what it is you don   t want to know .     said glenda .      yes .         well  how bad could it be .     said trev .      perhaps it is very bad     said nutt .      what would you say if it was me .     said glenda .     i want the truth  now .         well     said nutt  stuttering slightly     i think i would say that you should look behind the door to face the things that you do not want to know so we may confront them together .  that would certainly be the advice of von kladpoll in doppelte ber  hrungssempfindung .  indeed  doing so would almost be a fundamental part of the analysis of the hidden mind .         well then     said glenda  standing back .      but what sort of bad things could possibly be in your head  miss glenda .     said nutt  managing gallantry even in the fetid circumstances of the vats .      oh  there   s a few     said glenda .     you don   t go through life without picking up a few .         i   ve had dreams in the night     said nutt .      oh  well  everyone has bad dreams     said glenda .      these were more than dreams     said nutt .  he unfolded his arms and held up a hand .   trev whistled .   glenda said     oh     and then     should they be like that .         i have no idea     said nutt .      do they hurt .         no .         well  maybe that sort of thing    appens when goblins get a bit older     said trev .      yes  perhaps they need claws     said glenda .      yesterday was wonderful     said nutt .     i was part of the team .  the team were around me .  i was happy .  and now        trev held up a piece of grubby string and the battered but shiny tin can .     perhaps you should find out .         i might be getting all this wrong     said glenda     but if you don   t want to know what the things are that you don   t want to know  then that means that there are going to be even more things that you don   t want to know and i imagine that sooner or later  if that goes on  your head will cave in around the hole .         there is something in what both of you say     said nutt reluctantly .      then give me a hand to put him on the couch     said trev .     should he be covered in sweat like that .         i don   t think so     said glenda .      i would be happier if you chained me down     said nutt .      what .  why do you think we should do that .     said glenda .      i think you should beware .  some things leak around the door .  they may be bad .      glenda looked at the claws .  they were a shiny black and  in their way  quite neat  but it was hard to imagine them being used for  say  painting a picture or cooking an omelette .  they were claws  and claws were for clawing  weren   t they .  but this was mr nutt .  even with claws it was still mr nutt .      shall we get started .     said trev .      i insist on the chains     said nutt .     there are all sorts of metal things in the old storeroom four doors down .  i saw chains there .  please hurry .      automatically glenda looked down at the claws and saw they had grown longer .     yes  trev  please hurry .      trev followed her gaze and said brightly     i   ll be back before you know i   ve gone .      in fact  it was less than a couple of minutes  and she could hear the clanking as he dragged them all the way down the passageway .   glenda was fighting tears at the simple strangeness of the whole business .  nutt lay there  looking at the ceiling  as they lifted him on to the couch and carefully wrapped the chains around him .      there   s padlocks  but there   s no keys .  i can close them  but i can   t open them .         close them     said nutt .   glenda had very seldom cried  and she was trying not to now .     i don   t think we should be doing this     she said .     not here in the vats .  people are watching .         please swing your pendulum  mister trev     said nutt .   trev shrugged and did so .      now you have to start telling me that i am feeling sleepy  mister trev     said nutt .   trev cleared his throat and swung the shiny can back and forth .     you are definitely feelin    sleepy .  extremely sleepy .         that is good .  i am feeling enormously sleepy     said nutt wearily .     and now you must ask me to analyse myself .         what does that mean .     said glenda sharply  always on the lookout for dangerous words .      i   m sorry     said nutt .     i mean  help me examine in detail the workings of my own mind by means of question and answer .         but i don   t know the questions to ask     said trev .      i do     said nutt patiently     but you must instruct me to do it .      trev shrugged .     mister nutt  you must find out what is wrong with mister nutt     he said .      ah yes     said nutt  his tone of voice changing slightly .     are ve comfortable  mister nutt .  yes  thank you .  the chains hardly chafe at all .  verrry good .  now  tell me about your mother  mister nutt .  i am familiar with the concept  but i never had a mother as i recall .  thank you for asking anyway     said nutt .   and so the monological dialogue began .  the other two sat on the stone steps as the quiet voice unravelled itself until     ah yes  ze library .  is zere something in ze library  mister nutt .         there are many books in the library .         what else is in ze library  mister nutt .         there are many chairs and ladders in the library .         and what is in ze library zat you do not want to tell me about  mister nutt .      they waited .  at last  the voice said     there   s a cupboard in the library .         is zere anything special about zis cupboard  mister nutt .      another pause  another faint little voice     i must not open the cupboard .         why is half of him talking like someone from uberwald .     said glenda to trev  forgetting the notoriously acute sense of hearing .      questions asked in a mild uberwaldian accent in examinations of zis nature appear to put ze patient more at ease     said nutt .     and now i would be pleased if you would not make wiz ze interruptions .         sorry     said glenda .      don   t mention it .  so  why must you not open ze cupboard  mister nutt .         because i promised ladyship that i would not open the cupboard .         and did you open ze cupboard  mister nutt .         i promised ladyship that i would not open the cupboard .         and did you open ze cupboard  mister nutt .      a much longer pause this time .     i promised ladyship that i would not open the cupboard .         did you learn many things in ze castle  mister nutt .         many things .         did you learn how to make ze lockpicks  mister nutt .         yes .         where is ze door now  mister nutt .         it is in front of me .         you opened ze door  mister nutt .  you think you did not  but you did .  and now it is very important zat you open ze door again .         but what is inside the door is wrong .      the two eavesdroppers craned to hear .      nothing is wronk .  nothing is wronk at all .  in ze past  you opened ze door in the foolishness of chilthood .  now  to understand ze door  you must open it with ze wisdom of ze adult .  open ze door  mister nutt  and i will walk with you to it .         but i no longer have the lockpick .         nature will provide  mister nutt .      glenda shivered .  it had to be her imagination  but they didn   t seem to be in the candle vats any more .   a corridor stretched in front of nutt .  he felt everything drop away from him .  chains  clothes  flesh  thoughts .  all there was was the corridor and  drifting gently towards him  the cupboard .  it was glass fronted .  light glinted off the bevelled edges .  he raised a hand and extended the claw .  it cut through wood and glass as if they were air .  there was one shelf in the cupboard and one book on the shelf .  there was a title on it in silver and chains around it in steel .  these were much easier to break through than last time as well .  he sat down on a chair that had not been there until he sat down and he began to read the book .  the book was called orc .   when the scream came  it didn   t come from nutt  but from overhead in the tangle of pipes .  a skinny woman in a long black robe  perhaps a witch  glenda thought  shocked by the suddenness  dropped down on to the flagstones and looked around like a cat .   no  more like a bird  glenda thought .  jerky .   and then it opened its mouth and screamed     awk .  awk .  danger .  danger .  beware .  beware .     it made a lunge towards the couch  but trev stepped in the way .     foolish .  the orc will eat your eyes .      and now this was a duet  because another of the creatures had slid down out of the gloom on what might have been a billowing cloak  or might have been wings .  they never stopped moving  each in a different direction  trying to get closer to the couch .      do not be afraaaid     squawked one of them     we are on your siiide .  we are here to protect you .      glenda  trembling in shock  managed to stand up .  she folded her arms .  she always felt better like that .     who do you think you are   dropping out of the ceiling and shouting at people .  and you   re shedding feathers .  that   s disgusting .  this is a   this is quite near a food preparation area .         yeah  push off     said trev .      that   s telling them     said glenda out of the corner of her mouth .     i bet that took a lot of thinking .         you do not understand     said a creature .  the faces really were strange  as if someone had made a bird out of a woman .     you are in great danger .  awk .         from you .     said glenda .      from the orc     said the creature .  and the word was a scream .     awk .        in the shadows in front of the open cupboard the soul of nutt turned a page .  he felt someone at his elbow and looked up into the face of ladyship .      why did you tell me not to open the book  ladyship .         because i wanted you to read it     said her voice .     you had to find the truth for yourself .  that is how we all find the truth .         and if the truth is terrible .         i think you know the answer to that one  nutt     said the voice of ladyship .      the answer is that  terrible or not  it is still the truth     said nutt .      and then .     said her voice  like a teacher encouraging a promising pupil .      and then the truth can be changed     said nutt .        mister nutt is a goblin     said trev .      yeah  right     said the creature .  and the phrase seemed incredibly exotic for someone whose face was looking more birdlike all the time .      if i scream  a lot of people will come running     said glenda .      and what will they do .     said the creature .   and what would they do .  glenda thought .  they would stand around saying    what   s all this then .     and asking all the same questions we are .  she shuffled again as one of the things tried to get to the couch .      the orc will kill     said a third voice  and another of the things dropped down almost in front of glenda   s face .  its breath was like carrion .      mister nutt is kind and gentle and has never hurt anyone     said glenda .      who didn   t deserve it     said trev hurriedly .      but now the orc knows it is an orc     said a creature .  and now they were milling backwards and forwards in a ghastly pavane .      i don   t think you   re allowed to touch us     said trev .     i really don   t think you can touch us .      he sat down suddenly beside the recumbent nutt and dragged glenda down next to him .     i think you    ave to obey rules     said trev .  the moving figures stopped instantly .  that was somehow creepier than their movement .  they stood there as frozen as statues .      they   ve got talons     said glenda  quietly .     i can see their talons .         pounces     said trev .      what   re you talking about .         those big claws are called pounces .  the ones at the back are called talons   the ones they carry the prey off with .  everyone gets that wrong .         except you     said glenda .     you   re like the big expert on horrible birdlike creatures all of a sudden .         i can   t help it .  sometimes you just pick stuff up     said trev .      we must protect you     said one of the females .      we don   t need protecting from mister nutt .  he   s our friend     said glenda .      and how many of your friends have claws .         what have we got to worry about here  in unseen university  which has got great big thick walls and is pretty much generally crawling with wizards .      one of the women stretched her neck until her face was a few inches from trev   s .     there is an orc in here with you .      there was a clink of chain .  nutt had moved slightly .      you work for somebody  don   t you .     said trev .     you   ve got tiny little heads .  you can   t    ave enough brains to think this up for yourself .  do the wizards know you   re here .      glenda screamed .  she had never screamed before  not in a proper way  straight up from the bottom of her terror .  cutting her finger while using the knife carelessly didn   t count and almost certainly would never have been so loud .  the scream echoed along the passages  bounced into the cellars and made the undercrofts ring .    glenda screamed a second time and  as her lungs had got into practice  she managed to make this one even louder .  there were hurrying footsteps from both directions .   that was reassuring .   she was not certain how reassuring was the little clink and sliding of metal that suggested a chain had broken .   the creatures went into an instant panic  trying to take wing at once .  they were as clumsy as herons and got in one another   s way .      and don   t come back .     she yelled as they disappeared back into the dark .  then she turned to trev  her heart thumping  and said     what is an orc .         i dunno .  i think it   s some kind of old bogey man     said trev .      and what were those things .         i know it sounds silly     said trev     but we saw one of them the other night  and he seems to think they   re  like   friends .      butchers  bakers  butlers and bledlows came hurrying out of the dark corridors and one of them was bledlow nobbs  no relation   who was inexplicably wearing just his official hat  a string vest and a pair of shorts  far too short and far too tight for a man the size of bledlow nobbs  no relation  .   he looked at glenda and then glared at trev .  people like trev were  as far as bledlow nobbs  no relation  was concerned  an automatic enemy .     did you scream .  what   s been going on .     he said .      i   m sorry  i made an improper suggestion     trev said .  he looked at glenda  his expression saying     help me out here .         i   m afraid i let my girlish modesty get the better of me     she said  cursing him with her eyes .      it must have been a pretty strange suggestion     said a baker  who seemed to think that an extremely long loaf would have been a suitable aid to combat  but he was grinning   and grinning was good .   if this ends up with no more than sniggering and grinning then we   ll all be happy  glenda thought .  hard to live down afterwards  but still good .      but what   s that bloke chained to that bed for .     said the bledlow .      yeah  what kind of improper suggestions go on around here .     said the baker .  he really was having fun .   i am going to kill someone before the end of all this and it might just have to be myself  thought glenda .      isn   t that mister nutt .     said the bledlow .     we   re supposed to be in training in five minutes .      there was another clink behind glenda and nutt   s voice said     don   t worry  alphonse  i often do this trick .  dynamic tension you know  helps build up the muscles .         alphonse .     said the baker  looking incredulously at the bledlow .     i thought your name was alfred  alf for short .  alphonse is a quirmian name if ever i   ve heard one .  you   re not from there  are you .     that was an accusation as much as a question .      what   s wrong with alf being short for alphonse .     said the bledlow .  he had very large hands that might have troubled even mustrum ridcully in a game of pat a cake .  also  his ears were going red  never a good sign in a man of his size .      oh  i never said it wasn   t a nice name     said the baker  belatedly using his loaf .     but i would never have figured you for an alphonse .  it just goes to show that you never can tell .         i am an orc     said nutt quietly .      actually  alphonse is quite a nice name     the baker went on .     the phonse spoils it a bit  but the alf i quite like .     he paused and turned to nutt .     what do you mean     orc    .         an orc     said nutt again .   and away in the distant central heating pipes there was a scream of    awk .  awk .         don   t be daft  there   s no such thing as orcs any more .  they all got killed off hundreds of years ago .  bloody hard to kill  too  i read somewhere     said a butler .      in the latter part of your statement you are substantially correct     said nutt  still chained to the couch .     however  nevertheless  i am an orc .      glenda looked down .     you told me you   re a goblin  mister nutt .  you told me you   re a goblin .         i was misinformed     said nutt .     i know i am an orc .  i think i have always known that i am an orc .  i have opened the door and read the book and i know the truth of my soul and i am an orc  and for some reason i am an orc with a terrible urge to smoke a cigar .         but they were like these big horrible monsters that wouldn   t stop fighting and were quite happy to tear off their own arm to use as a weapon     said bledlow nobbs  no relation  .     there was an article about them in bows   ammo .      every eye turned to nutt   s arms .     certainly that is the judgement of history     said nutt .  he looked up at glenda .     i am so sorry     he said .     i disobeyed  everybody does it  you see .  schnouzentintle says as much in his book the obedience of disobedience .  so i wondered what was in the cupboard .  and i already had some expertise with lockpicks .  i opened the cupboard  i read the book and      his chains clinked as he shifted position .     i disobeyed .  i think everybody does it .  we are very good at hiding from ourselves what we do not want to know .  believe me  i was very good at keeping that from myself .  but it leaks out  you see  in dreams and things when you have dropped your guard .  i am an orc .  there is no doubt about that .         okay  right  if you are an orc  right  then why are you not tearing my head off .     said bledlow nobbs  no relation  .      would you like me to .     said nutt .      well  as it happens  no .         who cares .     said trev .     it   s all ancient history anyway .  these days you see vampires hangin    around all over the place .  an    we   ve got trolls and golems and zombies and all kinds of people just graftin    away .  who cares what    appened    undreds of years ago .         hang on a minute .  hang on a minute     said the butler .     he   s not tearing your head off    cos he   s chained down .         so  why did you get us to chain you down .     said glenda .      so i wouldn   t tear off anybody   s head .  i suspected the truth  although i didn   t know what it was that i suspected .  at least  i think it works like that .         so that means you can   t escape and tear us all limb from limb     said bledlow nobbs  no relation  .     no offence meant  but does this mean you won   t be training us .         i am sorry     said nutt     but as you can see  i   m rather inconvenienced .         have you all gone loony .     astonishingly  this came from juliet  standing in the corridor .     he   s nutt .  he potters around making candles and stuff .  i see    im around all the time and    e   s never    olding someone else   s leg or head .  and    e likes his football  too .      glenda thought she could actually hear trev   s heartbeat .  she hurried over to the girl .     i told you to go     she hissed .      i   ve come back to tell trev about everythin    .  after all  he did write such a lovely poem .         she   s got a point     said a man in a butcher   s apron .     i   ve seen him running around everywhere and i   ve never seen him carrying any limbs .         that   s true     said the baker .     and anyway  didn   t he do all those lovely candles at the banquet last night .  that doesn   t sound very orc like to me .         and     said bledlow nobbs  no relation      he was training us yesterday and he never once said     get in there  lads  and tear their    eads off    .         oh  yes     said the butler  who was making no friends as far as glenda was concerned .     humans don   t tear off heads  not like orcs .      an    awk .  awk .     echoed in the distance .      he   s been teaching us kinds of stuff you   d never think about     said the bledlow     like playing the game with a blindfold on .  amazing stuff .  more like filosopy than football  but damn good stuff .         tactical thinking and combat analysis is part of the orc make up     said nutt .      see .  no one who uses make up is going to tear your head off  right .         didn   t you meet my ex wife .     said the baker .      well  i   d draw the line if you wore make up     said the butcher to general amusement .     being an orc is one thing  but we don   t want a funny one .      glenda looked down at nutt .  he was crying .      my friends  i thank you for your trust in me     he said .      well  you know  you   re like part of the team     said bledlow nobbs  no relation   whose smile almost managed to conceal his nervousness .      thank you  mister nobbs  that means a lot to me     said nutt  standing up .   that was quite a complex movement .   it stayed in glenda   s mind for ever afterwards as a kind of slow motion scene of bursting chains and cracking wood when nutt stood up as though he had been restrained by cobwebs .  pieces of chain spun off and hit the wall .  padlocks broke .  as for the couch  barely one piece remained attached to another .  it dropped to the floor as so much firewood .      run for it  lads .      you would have needed some kind of special micrometer to work out which man said it first  but the stampede along the corridor was swift and over very quickly .      you know     said trev  after a few moments    silence     at one point i thought this was all goin    very well .         those women     said glenda     what were they .      nutt stood forlornly in the wreckage  a length of chain slithered off him like a serpent and landed on the flagstones .     them .     he said .     they are the little sisters of perpetual velocity .  they come from ephebe .  i think the name for their species is furies .  i think ladyship sent them in case i tried to hurt anybody .     the words came out without emphasis or emotion .      but you haven   t hurt anyone     said glenda .      but they ran away     said nutt     because of what i am .         well  you know  they   re ordinary people     said glenda .     they   re           twits     said trev .   nutt turned and walked down the opposite corridor  kicking off the remnants of wood and chain .     but the world is full of ordinary people .         you can   t just let    im go like that     said juliet .     you just can   t .  look at    im .     e looks like    e   s been kicked .         i   m    is boss  that   s my job     said trev .   glenda caught trev by the arm .     no  i   ll sort this out .  now  you listen to me  trev likely  under all that gab  you   re a decent sort  so i   ll tell you this  see juliet over there .  you know her  she works in the kitchens .  you wrote her a lovely poem  didn   t you .  ever heard of emberella .  everyone   s heard of emberella .  well  you might not be my first choice for prince charming  but there   s probably plenty worse .         what the hell are you talkin    about .     said trev .      juliet   s going to be leaving soon  isn   t that right  jools .      juliet   s face was a picture .     well  er           and that   s because she   s been that girl in the papers .         what  the shiny dwarf one .  with a beard .         that   s her .     said glenda .     she   s going to go off with the circus  well  you know what i mean .  with the fashion show  at least .         but she hasn   t got a beard     said trev .   blushing  juliet delved into her apron and to glenda   s surprise produced the beard .     they let me keep it     she said  with a nervous giggle .      right     said glenda .     you say you love him .  trev  i don   t know whether you love her or not  time to make up your mind .  you   re both grown up  well  strictly speaking  and so you better sort yourselves out     cos i don   t see any fairy godmothers around .  as for mister nutt  he hasn   t got anyone .         she   s gonna leave the city .     said trev  realization dawning slowly through a male mind .      oh  yes .  for quite a long time  i suspect     said glenda .   she watched his face carefully .  you haven   t got much learning and you haven   t opened a book in your life  trevor likely  but you are smart and you must know there is a wrong way and a right way to reply to what i have just told you .   she watched the high speed changes around his eyes as he thought  and then he said     well  that   s nice .  it   s the kind of thing she   s always dreamed of .  i   m very happy for her .      you cunning bastard  you actually got it right  glenda thought .  you   re not appearing to be thinking about yourself at all     cos you know i   d have no time for you if you were .  and who knows  you might just be genuine .  in fact  heavens help me  i think you are  but i   d pull all my own teeth out rather than tell you .      she likes you  you like her and i   ve made a lot of silly mistakes .  the two of you  sort out what you want to do .  and now  if i were you i   d run  before anyone else beats you to it .  and can i offer you a word of advice  trev .  don   t be smart  be clever .      trev took glenda by the shoulders and kissed her on both cheeks .     was that smart or clever .         get away with you  trev likely .     she said  pushing him away  in the hope that he wouldn   t notice her blush .     and now i   m going to see where mister nutt has gone .         i know where he   s gone     said trev .      i thought i just told you two to go off and live happily ever after     said glenda .      you won   t find    im without me     said trev .     i   m sorry  glenda  but we like him too .         do you think we should tell somebody .     said juliet .      and what will they do .     glenda snapped .     it   ll just be like that lot back there .  all hanging around in the hope that somebody will come up with an idea .  anyway     she added     i   m sure the wizards upstairs know all about him .  oh yes  i bet they do .      she had to admit  ten minutes later  that trev had been right .  she probably wouldn   t have noticed the door on the other side of another cluttered  abandoned cellar .  light shone from under the door .      i followed    im once     said trev .     everyone should have a place to call their own .         yes     said glenda  and she pushed open the door .  she might as well have opened an oven .  there were candles of every size and every colour and many of them were burning .   and in the middle of it was nutt  sitting behind a ramshackle table  which was covered with candles .  in front of him they burned in every colour .  he was staring at them with a blank expression  and did not look up as they approached .     you know  i fear that i will never really get the hang of blue     he said  as if to the air .     orange  of course  is ridiculously easy and red goes without saying and green is not difficult at all  but the best blue i could achieve  i have to admit  is very largely green       his voice trailed off .      are you all right .     said glenda .      do you mean  am i all right apart from being an orc .     said nutt  with a very small smile .      well  yes  but that   s not really your fault .         it can   t really be true  can it .     said trev .   glenda turned on him .      what good is it saying that .     she said .      well  they were supposed to have died out hundreds of years ago .         annihilated     said nutt .     but some survived .  i fear that when this oversight is revealed  there will be those who will endeavour to rectify the situation .      trev looked blankly at glenda .     he means he thinks they   re going to try to kill him     she said .   nutt stared at his candles .     i must accumulate worth .  i must be helpful .  i must be friendly .  i must make friends .         if anyone comes to hurt you     said glenda     i will kill them .  i   m sure you won   t try to pull a leg off  but i might .  trev  this needs a woman   s touch .         yes  i can see that .         that wasn   t clever  trev likely .  no  mister nutt  you stay there     said glenda  dragging trev and juliet back out into the corridor .     off you go  i want to talk to him alone .      nutt hung his head as she stepped back in .     i   m sorry i   m spoiling it for everyone     he said .      what   s happened to your claws  mister nutt .      he stretched out his arm and with a faint noise the claws extended .      oh  well  that   s convenient     said glenda .     at least that means you can change your shirt .      she thumped the table so the candles jumped .     and now  get up .     she screamed .     you are supposed to be training the team  mister nutt  don   t you remember .  you   re supposed to be going out there and showing them how to play the football .         i must accumulate worth     said nutt  staring at the candles .      then train the team  mister nutt .  how can you be so certain that the orcs were that bad in any case .         we did terrible things .         they     said glenda .     they  not we  not you .  and one thing i am certain of is that in a war no one is going to say that the other side is made up of very nice people .  now  how about you just run along to training .  how hard can it be .         you saw what happened     said nutt .     it could be very bad indeed .     he picked up a nearly blue candle .     i must think .         okay     said glenda .   she shut the door carefully behind her  walked a little way along the corridor and looked up at the dripping pipes .     i know someone is listening .  i could hear the creaking pipes .  come out right now .      there was no reply .  she shrugged and then hurried along the labyrinth until she reached the steps to the library  ran up them and headed for the librarian   s desk .   as she approached it  his big grinning face appeared above it .      i want       she began .   the librarian rose slowly  put a finger to his lips and placed a book on the table in front of her .  the three letter title  silver on black  was orc .   he looked her up and down  as if trying to reach a conclusion  then opened the book  and turned the pages with exquisite care  given the thickness of those fingers  until he found the page he had been looking for .  he held it up in front of her .  there had been no time for breakfast today  but it   s still possible to throw up when there   s nothing left to throw .  and if you needed to vomit  the woodcut held up beneath the librarian   s hands would be a sure fire medicine .   he put the book down on the desktop  reached down again and produced a barely used handkerchief and  after some rummaging around  a glass of water .      i don   t have to believe that     said glenda .     it   s a drawing .  it   s not real .      the librarian   s thumb went up and he nodded .  he put the book under one arm and grabbed her with another and led her with surprising speed out of the door into the great maze of halls and corridors of the university .   their breathless journey finished in front of a door on which was painted    department of post mortem communications    .  the paint  however  had peeled somewhat and under the bright new title could just be made out the letters necr and what could possibly be one half of a skull .   the door opened   any door pushed by the librarian would assuredly open .  glenda heard the clink of the catch falling on to the floor inside .   in the middle of the floor that was revealed stood a hideous figure .  its horrifying countenance had less than the effect it might have done  because from it dangled a quite readable label that said    boffo novelty and joke emporium .  improved necromancer   s mask .  sale price am      .  this was removed to reveal the more salubrious countenance of dr hix .      there really is no need to       he said  and then spotted the librarian .     oh  can i help you .      the librarian held up the book and dr hix groaned .     that again     he said .     all right  what do you want .         we   ve got an orc down in the cellars     said glenda .      yes  i know     said dr hix .   the librarian had a big face  but it nevertheless was not large enough to accommodate all of the surprise he wished to show .  the head of the department of post mortem communications shrugged and sighed .     look     he said  as if weary of having to explain so often  and sighed again .     i am supposed to be the bad person as defined by university statute  right .  i am supposed to listen at doors .  supposed to dabble in the black arts .  i   ve got the skull ring .  i   ve got the staff with the silver skull on it           and a joke shop mask .     said glenda .      quite serviceable as a matter of fact     said hix  haughtily .     rather more frightening than the original thing and washable  which is always a consideration in this department .  anyway  the archchancellor was down here weeks ago  after the same stuff you are  i very much imagine .         were the orcs terrible creatures .     said glenda .      i think i can probably show you     said hix .      this gentleman has already shown me the picture in the book     said glenda .      was it the one with the eyeballs .      glenda found the memory only too vivid .     yes .         oh  there   s worse than that     said hix happily .     and i suppose you want the proof .     he half turned his head .     charlie .     a skeleton walked out through black curtains at the far end of the room .  it was holding a mug .  there was something curiously depressing about the slogan on said mug  which ran     necromancers do it all night    .      don   t be scared     said dr hix .      i   m not     glenda said  terrified to her insteps .     i   ve seen the insides of a slaughterhouse .  it   s part of the job and  anyway  he   s polished .         thank you very much     the skeleton articulated .      but    necromancers do it all night    .  that   s a bit pathetic  isn   t it .  i mean  don   t you think it   s trying a bit too hard .         it was hard enough to get that one made     said dr hix .     we   re not the most popular department in the university .  charlie  the young lady wants to know about orcs .         again .     said the skeleton  handing the mug to the doctor .  it had a rather hoarse voice  but on the whole far less dreadful than it might have been .  apart from anything else  his bones were  well  apart from anything else  and floated in the air as if they were the only visible parts of an invisible body .  the jaw moved as charlie went on     well  i think we   ve still got the memory in the sump    cos  you remember  we called it up for ridcully .  i haven   t got round to wiping it yet .         memory of what .     said glenda .      it   s a kind of magic     said hix loftily .  he continued .     it would take too long to explain .      glenda didn   t like this .     let   s have it in a nutshell  then .         okay .  we   re now quite certain that what we call the passage of time is in fact the universe being destroyed and instantly rebuilt in the smallest instant of eventuality that it is possible to have .  while the process is instant at every point  nevertheless to renew the whole universe takes approximately five days  we believe .  interestingly enough           can i have it in a smaller nut .         so you don   t want to hear about houseman   s theory of the universal memory .         possibly the size of a walnut     said glenda .      very well  then  can you imagine this  current thinking is that the old universe is not destroyed in the instant the new universe is created  a process which  incidentally  has been happening an untold billion number of times since i have been talking           yes  i can believe that .  can we try for a pistachio .     said glenda .      copies of the universe are kept .  we don   t know how  we don   t know where  and it beats the hell out of me trying to imagine how it all works .  but we   re finding that it is sometimes possible to  er  read this memory in certain circumstances .  how am i doing in terms of nut dimensions .         you   ve got some kind of magic mirror .     said glenda flatly .      that   s it  if you want the size of a pine nut     said hix .      pine nuts are actually seeds     said glenda smugly .     so  what you   re saying is that everything that happens stays happened somewhere and you can look at it if you have the knowing .         that is a magnificent distillation of the situation     said hix .     which is incredibly helpful while at the same time inaccurate in every possible way .  but  as you put it  we use a      and here he gave a little shudder      magic mirror  as you put it .  we recently looked at the battle of orc deep for the archchancellor .  that was the last known battle in which the race known as orcs were deployed .         deployed .     said glenda .      used     said hix .      used .  and you can find something like that in the total history of everything there has ever been .         ahem .  it helps to have an anchor     said hix .     something that was present .  and all i am going to tell you  young lady  is that there was a piece of a skull found on that battlefield  and since it was a skull that firmly puts it into the responsibility of my department .     he turned to the librarian .     it   s okay to show her  isn   t it .     he said .  the librarian shook his head .     good .  that means i can do it  then  under university statute .  a certain amount of surreptitious disobedience is demanded of me .  we have it set up on an omniscope .  since my colleague is so certain that i should not be doing this  he will not mind if i do .  it   s only a very brief fragment of time  but it did impress the archchancellor  if impress is the right word .         i just want to get something clear     said glenda .     you can actually disobey the orders of someone like the archchancellor .         oh  yes     said hix .     i am under instruction to do so .  it is expected of me .         but how can that possibly work .     said glenda .     what happens when he gives you an instruction that he doesn   t want you to disobey .         it works by common sense and good will on all sides     said hix .     if  for example  the archchancellor gives me a command that absolutely must not be disobeyed  he will add something like     hix  you little worm  by university statute   if you disobey this one  i   ll smack your head .     though in reality  a word to the wise  madam  is sufficient .  it   s all done on the basis of trust  really .  i am trusted to be untrustworthy .  i don   t know what the archchancellor would do without me .         yeah  right     said charlie  grinning .   a few minutes later  glenda was in another dark room  standing in front of a round  dark mirror  at least as high as she was .     is this going to be like the moving pictures .     she said sarcastically .      an amusing comparison     said hix .     except for  one  there is no popcorn and  two  you would not want to eat it if there was .  what might be called the camera in this case was the last thing one of the human fighters saw .         is this the person whose skull you   ve got .         well done .  i see you have been following things     said hix .   there was a moment of silence .     this is going to be scary  isn   t it .         yes     said hix .     nightmares .  very probably .  even i think it   s extremely disconcerting .  are you ready  charlie .         ready     said charlie  from somewhere in the darkness .     are you sure  miss .      glenda wasn   t sure  but anything would be better than facing hix   s know it all smile .     yes     she said  keeping her voice firm .      the fragment we are able to show lasts less than three seconds  but i doubt whether you will want to see it again .  are we ready .  thank you  charlie .      glenda   s chair went backwards very quickly and hix  who had been hovering  caught her .     the only known representation of an orc in battle     said hix  standing her upright .     well done  by the way .  even the archchancellor swore out loud .      glenda blinked  trying to slice slightly less than three seconds out of her memory .     and that   s true  is it .     but it had to be true .  there was something about the way the image was sticking to the back of her brain that declared the truth of it .      i want to see it again .         you what .  .     said hix .      there   s more to it     said glenda .     it   s only a part of a picture .         it took us hours to work that out     said hix severely .     how did you spot it the very first go .         because i knew it had to be there     said glenda .      she   s got you there  boss     said charlie .      all right .  show it again and this time magnify the right hand corner .  it   s very blurry     he said to glenda .      can you stop it .     said glenda .      oh  yes .  charlie has worked that one out .         then you know the bit i mean .         oh  yes .         then show me it again .      charlie disappeared behind his curtain .  there were a few flashes of light and then        there .     she pointed at the frozen image .     that   s men on horseback  isn   t it .  and they   ve got whips .  i know it   s blurry  but you can tell that they   ve got whips .         well  yes  of course     said hix .     it   s quite hard to get anything to run into a hail of arrows unless you give it some encouragement .         they were weapons .  living creatures as weapons .  and they don   t look so different from humans .         a lot of really interesting stuff happened under the evil emperor     said hix  conversationally .      evil stuff     said glenda .      yes     said hix     that was rather the point .  evil emperor .  evil empire .  it did what it said on the iron maiden .         and what happened to them .         well  officially they   re all dead     said hix .     but there have been rumours .         and men drove them into battle     said glenda .      if you want to put it like that  i suppose so     said hix     but i   m not certain that changes anything .         i think it changes everything     said glenda .     it does if all that people talk about are the monsters and not the whips .  things that look very much like people  well  a kind of people .  what can you make from people if you really try .         it   s an interesting theory     said hix .     but i don   t think you can prove it .         when kings fight other kings and win  they chop off the other king   s head  don   t they .     said glenda .      sometimes     said hix .      i mean  you can   t blame a weapon for how it   s used .  what   s it they say .  people can   t help how they were made .  i think the orcs were made .      glenda glanced at the librarian  who looked at the ceiling .      you work as a cook  don   t you .  would you like to work for my department .         everyone knows women can   t be wizards     said glenda .      ah  yes  but necro   post mortem communications is different     said hix proudly .  and added     we could do with some sensible people here  heavens know .  and the feminine touch would be very welcome .  and don   t think i would require you to just come and do the dusting .  we treasure our dust in this place and your cookery skills will be invaluable .  after all  basic butchery is all part of the job .  and i do believe that boffo   s shop has a rather good female necromancer   s costume in their sale  isn   t that right  charlie .         ten dollars including lace up bodice .  a bargain in anybody   s money     said charlie from behind his curtain .     very slinky .      there had been no reply because glenda   s mouth had stuck in the act of opening  but she finally managed a polite  but firm     no .      the head of the department of post mortem communications gave a little sigh .     i thought as much  but we are part of the scheme of things .  light and dark .  night and day .  sweet and sour .  good and evil  within acceptable college statutes  .  it just helps if you can have sensible and reliable people on both sides  but i   m glad that we   ve been able to be of assistance .  we don   t see many people down here .  well  not people as such .        this time glenda walked along the corridor .     orc     she thought .     a thing that just kills .     every time she blinked  the image came back to her .  the teeth and claws of a creature in full leap seen  as far as one could tell  by whoever it was it was leaping at .  fighters you couldn   t stop .  and nutt had been killed  according to trev  and then sort of became unkilled again before going back to unseen university and eating all the pies .   there was an awfully big gap in all this  but men with whips filled it .  you can   t have something that just fights  she thought .  it has to do other things as well .  and nutt isn   t any stranger than most of the people you see around these days .  it   s not a lot to go on  though  but then again  the evil emperor was a sorcerer  everyone knew that .  everyone knows you can   t help how you   re made .  well  it   s worth a try .  it   s a little bit of uncertainty .   as soon as she arrived back outside nutt   s special place  she sensed that it would be empty .  she pushed the door open and there was a definite absence of candles and  more importantly  a very noticeable absence of nutt .  but i told him to go and help them train .  that   s where he   s gone  to go and train  definitely  she said to herself .  so no need to worry  then .   on edge  feeling that something was nevertheless wrong  she forced herself back to the night kitchen .     she was nearly there when she met mr ottomy  his scrawny adam   s apple as red and glistening as chicken giblets .      so  we   ve got a man eating orc down here  have we .     he said .     people aren   t going to stand for that .  i heard somewhere that they could go on fighting while their heads are chopped off .         that   s interesting     said glenda .     how did they know which way to go .         ah ah .  they could smell their way     said the bledlow .      how could they do that with their heads chopped off .  are you telling me they had a nose up their arse .     she was shocked at herself for saying that  it was bad language  but ottomy was bad language made solid .      i don   t hold with it     he said  ignoring the question .     you know something else i heard .  they were kind of made .  when the evil emperor wanted fighters he got some of the igors to turn goblins into orcs .  they   re not really proper people at all .  i   m going to complain to the archchancellor .         he already knows     said glenda .  well  he must do  she thought .  and vetinari  too  she added to herself .     you   re not going to make trouble for mister nutt  are you .     she said .     because if you are  mister ottomy      she leaned forward      you will never be seen again .         you shouldn   t threaten me like that     he said .      you   re right  i shouldn   t     said glenda .     i should have said that you will never be seen again  you egregious slimy little twerp .  go and tell the archchancellor if you like and see how much good that does you .         they ate people alive .     said ottomy .      so did trolls     said glenda .     admittedly they spat them out again  but not in much of a state to enjoy life .  we used to fight dwarfs once and when they cut you off at the knees they weren   t joking .  we know  mister ottomy  that the leopard can change his shorts     she sniffed     and it might be a good idea if you did  too .  and if i hear of any trouble from you  you will hear from me .  up there it   s the archchancellor .  down here in the dark  it   s cutlery .         i   ll tell him what you said     said the luckless bledlow  backing away .      i would be very grateful if you did     said glenda .     now push off .      why do we tell one another that the leopard cannot change his shorts .  she mused as she watched him scurry away .  has anyone ever seen a leopard wearing shorts .  and how would they be able to put them on if they had them .  but we go on saying it as if it was some kind of holy truth  when it just means that we   ve run out of an argument .     there was something she had to do  now what was it .  oh  yes .  she went over once again to the cauldron on which she had chalked    do not touch    and lifted up the lid .  the beady eyes stared up at her from the watery depths and she went away and got a few scraps of fish  which she dropped towards the waiting claws .     well  i know what to do with you  at least     she said .   a fully working kitchen holds a great many things  not least of which is a huge collection of ways of committing horrible murder  plus multiple ways of getting rid of the evidence .  this wasn   t the first time the thought had crossed her mind .  she was quite glad about it .  for now  she selected a really thick pair of gloves from a drawer  put her old coat on again  reached into the cauldron and picked up the crab .  it snapped at her .  she knew it would .  never  ever expect gratitude from those you help .      tide   s turning     she told the crustacean     so we   re going to take a little walk .     she dropped it into her shopping bag and headed across the university lawns .   a couple of graduate wizards were working in the university boatyard nearby .  one looked at her and said     are you supposed to be walking on the university lawns  madam .         no  it is absolutely forbidden to kitchen staff     said glenda .   the students looked at one another .     oh  right     said one of them .   and that was it .   as easy as that .   it was only a metaphorical hammer .  it only hit you if you allowed it to be there .   she pulled the crab out of her bag and it waved its claws irritably .     see that over there .     she said  waving her own spare hand .     that   s hen and chickens field .     it   s doubtful whether the crab   s beady eyes could focus on the grassy waste across the river  but at least she pointed it in the right direction .     people think it   s because there was chickens kept there     she went on conversationally while the two wizards looked at one another .     as a matter of fact  that   s not so .  it used to be where people were hanged  and so when they walked out from the old gaol that used to be over there  the priest in front of the procession with his billowing robes seemed to lead the line of doomed men and gaolers like a hen leading its chicks .  that sort of thing is what we call a droll sense of humour in these parts and i haven   t got the faintest idea why i   m talking to you .  i   ve done my best .  you now know more than any other crab .      she walked down to the very edge of what passed for water as the river flowed through the city  and dropped the crab into it .     stay clear of crab pots and don   t come back .     she turned round and realized the wizards had been watching her .     well .     she snapped .     is there any law about talking to crabs around here .     she then gave them a little smile as she walked past .   back in the long corridors she wandered  feeling a little light headed  towards the vats .  some of its denizens eyed her nervously as she passed through  but there was no sign of nutt  not that she was looking for him at all .  as she walked on towards the night kitchen  trev and juliet appeared .  glenda couldn   t help but notice that juliet had a somewhat bright eyed and ruffled look .  that is  she couldn   t help but notice because she made a point of noticing every time .  semi parental responsibility was a terrible thing .      what are you still doing here .     she said .   they looked at her and there was more in their expressions than mere embarrassment .      i come back to say goodbye to the girls and i    ad to wait for trev because of the training .      glenda sat down .     make me a cup of tea  will you .     and because old habits died hard she added     boil water in the kettle  two spoons of tea in the pot .  pour water from kettle into pot when it boils .  do not put tea in kettle .     she turned to trev .     where   s mister nutt .     she said  nonchalance booming in her voice .   trev looked down at his feet .     i don   t know  glenda     he said .     i   ve been           busy     glenda completed .      but no hanky panky     said juliet quickly .   glenda realized that right now she would not have minded if there had been hanky panky or even spanky .  there were things that were important and things that weren   t  and times when you knew the difference .      so  how did mister nutt get on  then .      trev and juliet looked at one another .     we don   t know .  he wasn   t there     said trev .      we kind of thought    e might be with you     said juliet  handing her a cup of what you get when you ask for a cup of tea from someone who tends to confuse the recipe even at the best of times .      he wasn   t in the great hall .     said glenda .      no     e wasn   t there   wait one moment .     trev ran down the steps and after a few seconds they heard his footsteps coming back .     his toolbox    as gone     said trev .     i mean  it wasn   t much .  he made it outta bits he found in the cellars  but as far as i know it   s all    e owned .      i knew it  thought glenda .  of course i knew it .     where could he be .  he   s got nowhere else to go but here     she said .      well  there is that place up in uberwald he talks about quite a lot     said trev .      that   s getting on for about a thousand miles away     said glenda .      well  i suppose he thinks he might as well be there as here     said juliet innocently .     i mean  orc  i   d want to run away from a name like that if i was me .         look  i   m sure he   s just wandered off somewhere in the building     glenda said  believing absolutely that he hadn   t .  but if i believe he   s going to be around the next corner or has just nipped off to   powder his nose  or has just wandered away for half an hour   which  of course  is his right  perhaps he needs to go and buy a pair of socks .    if i keep believing he   ll turn up any minute  he might  even though i know he won   t .   she put down the cup .     half an hour     she said .     juliet  you go and check around the great hall .  trev  you go down the tunnels that way .  i   ll go down the tunnels this way .  if you find anyone you can trust  ask    em .      a little more than half an hour later  glenda was the last to turn up back in the night kitchen .  she very nearly half expected that he would be there and knew that he wouldn   t .     would he know about getting on a coach .     she said .      i doubt    e   s ever seen one     said trev .     you know what i would do if i was    im .  i   d just run .  it was like when dad died  i spent all night walkin    around the city .  i wasn   t bothered where i went .  just went .  wanted to run away from bein    me .         how fast can an orc run .     said glenda .      much faster than a man  i bet     said trev .     an    for a long time  too .         listen .     this was juliet .     can   t you    ear it .         hear what .     said glenda .      nothing     said juliet .      well .         what happened to awk .  awk .  .         i think we   ll find them where we find him     said trev .      well  he can   t run all the way back to uberwald     said glenda .     you couldn   t .      at last glenda said it     i think we should go after him .         i   ll come     said trev .      then i   m goin    to come  too     insisted juliet .     besides  i   ve still got the money and you   re goin    to need it .         your money   s in the bank     said glenda     and the bank is shut .  but i think i   ve got a few dollars in my purse .         then  excuse me     said trev     i won   t be a moment .  i think there   s somethin    we ought to take          the driver of the horse bus to sto lat looked down and said     two dollars fifty pence each .         but you only go to sto lat     said glenda .      yes     said the man calmly .     that   s why it says sto lat on the front .         we might    ave to go a lot further     said trev .      just about every coach in this part of the world goes through sto lat     he said .      how long will it take to get there .         well  this is the late night bus  okay .  it   s for people who   ve got to be in sto lat early and haven   t got much money  and there   s the rub  see .  the less the money  the slower the travel .  we get there in the end .  somewhere around about dawn  in fact .         all night .  i think i could walk it faster .      the man had the quiet  friendly air about him of someone who had found the best way to get through life was never to give much of a stuff about anything .     be my guest     he said .     i   ll wave to you as we go past .      glenda looked down the length of the coach .  it was half full of the kind of people who took the overnight bus because it wasn   t very expensive  the kind of people  in fact  who had brought their own dinner in a paper bag  and probably not a new paper bag at that .   the three of them huddled .     it   s the only one we can afford     said trev .     i don   t think we can even afford travel for one on the mail coaches .         can   t we try and bargain with him .     said glenda .      good idea     said trev .  he walked back to the coach .      hello again     said the driver .      when are you gonna leave .     said trev .      in about five minutes .         so everyone who   s gonna be riding is on the coach .      glenda glanced past the driver .  the passenger behind him was very meticulously peeling a hardboiled egg .      could be     said the driver .      then why not leave right now     said trev     and go faster .  it   s very important .         late night     said the driver .     that   s what i said .         supposing i was to threaten you with this lead pipe  would you go any faster .     said trev .      trevor likely .     said glenda .     you can   t go around threatening people with lead pipes .      the driver looked down at trev and said     can you run that past me again .         i told you that i had this length of lead pipe     said trev  banging it gently against the bus   s door .     sorry  but we really need to get to sto lat .         oh  right  yes     said the driver     i see your lead pipe     and he reached down to the other side of his seat     and i will raise you this battle axe and would remind you that if i were to cut you in arf  the law would be on my side  no offence meant .  you must think i am some kind of fool  but you   re all hopping about like nits on a griddle  so what   s this all about then .         we   ve got to catch up with our friend .  he could be in danger     said trev .      and it   s very romantic     said juliet .   the driver looked at her .      if you    elp us catch up wiv him  i   ll give you a big kiss     she said .      there .     said the driver to trev .     why didn   t you think of that .         all right  i   ll give you a kiss as well     said trev .      no thanks  sir     said the driver  clearly enjoying himself .     in your case i think i   ll go for the lead pipe  although please don   t try anything    cos it   s a devil   s own job to get the bloodstains off the seats .  nothing seems to shift them .         okay  i   ll try to hit you with the lead pipe     said trev .     we   re desperate .         and we   ll give you some money     said juliet .      sorry .     said the driver .     do i get the kiss  the money and the lead pipe .  i mean  i   d rather forgo the lead pipe for another kiss .         two kisses  a whole three dollars and no lead pipe     said juliet .      or just the lead pipe and i   ll take my chances     said trev .   glenda  who had been watching them with a fascinated horror  said     and i   ll give you a kiss as well if you like .     she couldn   t help noticing that this didn   t move the stakes either way .      but what about my passengers .     said the driver .   all four of them looked into the back of the bus and realized that they were the subject of at least a dozen fascinated stares .     go for the kiss .     said a woman  holding a large laundry basket in front of her .      and the money .     said one of the men .      i don   t give a stuff if she kisses him or hits him on the head with the lead pipe  so long as they drop us off first     said an old man towards the back of the bus .      do any of us get kissed as well .     said one half of a couple of giggling boys .      if you like     said glenda viciously .  they slumped back into their seats .   juliet grabbed the driver   s face and there was  for what seemed slightly too long  by the internal clocks of both glenda and trev  the sound of a tennis ball being sucked through the strings of a tennis racket .  juliet stepped back .  the driver was smiling  in a slightly stunned and cross eyed way .     well  that was pretty much of a lead pipe .         perhaps i   d better drive     said trev .   the driver smiled at him .     i   ll drive  thank you very much  and don   t kid yourself  mister  i know a dicey one when i see one and you don   t come close .  my old mum would be more likely to hit me with a lead pipe than you .  throw it away  why don   t you  or someone will give you a centre parting you won   t forget in a hurry .      he winked at juliet .     what with one thing or another it   s a good idea to give the horses a bit of a run every now and again .  all aboard for sto lat .      the horse buses did not usually travel very fast and the driver   s definition of a run was only marginally faster than what most people would call a walk  but he managed to get them up to something that at least meant they did not have the time to get bored by a passing tree .   the bus was for people  as the driver had pointed out  who couldn   t afford speed but could afford time .  in its construction  therefore  no expense had been attempted .  it was really no more than a cart with double seats all the way along it from the driver   s slightly elevated bench .  tarpaulins on either side kept out the worst of the weather but fortunately still let in enough of the wind to mitigate the smell of the upholstery  which had experienced humanity in all its manifold moods and urgencies .   glenda got the impression that some of the travellers were regulars .  an elderly woman was sitting quietly knitting .  the boys were still engaged in the furtive giggling appropriate to their age  and a dwarf was staring out of the window without looking at anything in particular .  no one really bothered about talking to anybody  except a man right at the back  who was having a continuous conversation with himself .      this isn   t fast enough .     glenda shouted after ten minutes of bouncing over the potholes .     i could run faster than this .         i don   t think he   s gonna get that far     said trev .   the sun was going down and the shadows were already drawing across the cabbage fields  but there was a figure on the road ahead  struggling .  trev jumped off .      awk .  awk .         it   s those wretched things     said glenda  running up behind him .     give me that lead pipe .      nutt was half crouched in the dust on the road .  the sisters of perpetual velocity were half flying and half flapping around him while he tried to protect his face with his hands .  the passengers of the bus were quite unnoticed until the lead pipe arrived  followed very shortly by glenda .  it didn   t have the effect she   d hoped .  the sisters were indeed like birds .  she couldn   t so much hit them as bat them through the air .      awk .  awk .         you stop trying to hurt him .     she screamed .     he hasn   t done anything wrong .      nutt raised an arm and grabbed her wrist .  there wasn   t much pressure  but somehow she couldn   t move it at all .  it was as if it had suddenly been embalmed in stone .     they   re not here to hurt me     he said .     they   re here to protect you .         who from .         me .  at least that   s how it   s supposed to go .         but i don   t need any protection from you .  that doesn   t make any sense .         they think you might     said nutt .     but that is not the worst of it .      the creatures were circling and the other passengers  sharing the endemic ankh morpork taste for impromptu street theatre  had piled out and had become an appreciative audience  which clearly discomforted the sisters .      what is the worst of it  then .     said glenda  waving the pipe at the nearest sister  which jumped back out of the way .      they may be right .         all right  so you   re an orc     said trev .     so they used to eat people .  have you eaten anyone lately .         no  mister trev .         well  there you are  then .         you can   t arrest someone for something he hasn   t done     said one of the bus passengers  nodding sagely .     a fundamental law  that .         what   s an orc .     said the lady next to him .      oh  back in the olden days up in uberwald or somewhere they used to tear people to bits and eat them .         that   s foreigners for you     said the woman .      but they   re all dead now     said the man .      that   s nice     said the woman .     would anyone like some tea .  i   ve got a flask .         all dead  except me .  but i am afraid that i am an orc     said nutt .  he looked up at glenda .     i   m sorry     he said .     you have been very kind  but i can see that being an orc will follow me around .  there will be trouble .  i would hate you to be involved .         awk .  awk .      the woman unscrewed the top of her flask .     but you   re not about to eat anyone  are you  dear .  if you feel really hungry i   ve got some macaroons .     she looked at the nearest sister and said     what about you  love .  i know none of us can help how we   re made  but how come you   ve been made to look like a chicken .         awk .  awk .         danger .  danger .         dunno about that     said another passenger .     i don   t reckon he   s going to do anything .         please  please     said nutt .  there was a box lying on the road beside him .  he tore it open frantically and started to pull things out of it .   they were candles .  knocking them over in his haste  picking them up in shaking fingers only to knock them over again  he finally had them upright on the flints of the road .  he pulled matches out of another pocket  knelt down and once again got his shaking fingers tangled in themselves as he struggled to strike a match .  tears streamed down his face as the light of the candles rose .   rose   and changed .   blues  yellows  greens .  they would go out for a few smoky seconds and then light again a different colour  to the oohs and aahs of the crowd .      see .  see .     said nutt .     you like them .  you like them .         i think you could make yourself a lot of money out of that     said one of the passengers .      they   re lovely     said the old lady .     honestly  the things you young people can do today .      nutt turned to the nearest sister and spat     i am not worthless  i have worth .         my brother in law runs a novelty shop down in the smoke     said the erstwhile expert in orcs .     i   ll write his address down for you if you like .  but i reckon that thing would go down very well on the kiddies    birthday circuit .      glenda had watched all of this open mouthed  as the kind of democracy practised by reasonable and amiable but not very clever people  the people whose education had never involved a book but had involved lots of other people  surrounded nutt in its invisible  beneficent arms .   it was heartwarming  but glenda   s heart was a little bit calloused on this score .  it was the crab bucket at its best .  sentimental and forgiving  but get it wrong   one wrong word  one wrong liaison  one wrong thought   and those nurturing arms could so easily end in fists .  nutt was right  at best  being an orc was to live under a threat .      you lot have got no right treating the poor little devil like that     said the old lady  waving a finger at the nearest sister .     if you want to live here  you have to do things our way  all right .  and that means no pecking at people .  that   s not how we do things in ankh morpork .      even glenda smiled at that one .  pecking was a picnic compared with what ankh morpork could offer .      vetinari   s letting all sorts in these days     said another passenger .     i won   t hear a word said against the dwarfs           good     said a voice at his back .  he moved aside and glenda saw the dwarf standing behind him .      sorry  mate  i didn   t see you there  what with you being so little     said the man who had nothing against dwarfs .     as i was saying  you lot just settle down and get on with it and are no trouble to anybody  but we   re getting some weird ones now .         that woman they put in the watch last month  for one     said the old lady .     the weird one from out ephebe way .  gust of wind caught her sunglasses and three people turned into stone .         she was a medusa     said glenda  who had read about that in the times .     the wizards managed to turn them back again  though .         well  what i   m saying is     started the man who had nothing against dwarfs     we don   t mind anyone  so long as they mind their own business and don   t do any funny stuff .      this was the rhythm of the world to glenda  she   d heard it so many times .  but the feeling of the crowd was now very much against the sisters .  sooner or later somebody was going to pick up a stone .     i   d get out of here now     she said     get out and go back to the lady you work for .  i should do that right now  if i were you .         awk .  awk .     one of them screeched .   but there were brains in those strange shaped heads .  and the three sisters were clearly bright enough to want to keep them there and ran for it  hopping and leaping like herons until what seemed like cloaks turned out to be wings  which pounded on the air as they sought for height .  there was a final scream of    awk .  awk .      the driver of the horse bus coughed .     well  if that   s all sorted out then i suggest you all get back on board  please  ladies and gentlemen .  and whoever .  and don   t forget your candles  mister .      glenda helped nutt on to a wooden seat .  he was holding his toolbox tightly across his knees  as if it would offer some sort of protection .     where were you trying to go .     she said as the horses began to move .      home     said nutt .      back to her .         she gave me worth     said nutt .     i was nothing and she gave me worth .         how can you say you were nothing .     said glenda .  on the pair of seats in front of them  trev and juliet were whispering together .      i was nothing     said nutt .     i knew nothing  i understood nothing  i had no understanding  i had no skill           but that doesn   t mean someone is worthless     said glenda firmly .      it does     said nutt .     but it does not mean they are bad .  i was worthless .  she showed me how to gain worth and now i have worth .      glenda had a feeling they were working from two different dictionaries .     what does    worth    mean  mister nutt .         it means that you leave the world better than when you found it     said nutt .      good point     said the lady with the macaroons .     there   s far too many people around the place who wouldn   t dream of doing a hand   s turn .         all right  but what about people who   re blind  for example .     this from the hardboiled egg man  sitting on the other side of the bus .      i know a blind bloke in sto lat who runs a bar     said an elderly gentleman .     knows where everything is and when you put your money on the counter he knows if it   s the right change just by listening .  he does all right .  it   s amazing  he can pick out a dud sixpence halfway across a noisy bar .         i don   t think there are absolutes     said nutt .     i think what ladyship meant was that you do the best you can with what you have .         sounds like a sensible lady     said the man who had nothing against dwarfs .      she   s a vampire     said glenda maliciously .      nothing against vampires  just so long as they keep themselves to themselves     said the macaroon lady  who was now engaged in licking something revoltingly pink .     we   ve got one working down at the kosher butcher   s on our street  and she   s as nice as you like .         i don   t think it   s about what you end up with     said the dwarf .     it   s about what you end up with compared with what you started with .      glenda leaned back with a smile as attempts at philosophy bounced their way from seat to seat .  she wasn   t at all certain about the whole thing  but nutt was sitting there looking far less bedraggled and the rest of them were treating him as one of themselves .   there were dim lights ahead in the darkness .  glenda slipped from her seat and went up ahead to the driver .     are we nearly there yet .         another five minutes     said the driver .      sorry about all that silly business with the lead pipe     she said .      didn   t happen     said the man cheerfully .     believe me  we get all sorts on the night bus .  at least no one   s thrown up .  quite an interestin    lad you   ve got back there with you .         you   ve no idea     said glenda .      of course  all he   s saying is you   ve got to do your best     said the driver .     and the more best you   re capable of  the more you should do .  that   s it  really .      glenda nodded .  that did seem to be it  really .     do you go straight back .     she said .      no .  me and the horses are stopping here and will go back in the morning .     he gave her the wry look of a man who   s heard a great many things  and surprisingly seen a great many things  when to those behind him he was just a head facing forward keeping an eye on the road .     that was a wonderful kiss she give me .  i   ll tell you what  the bus will be in the yard  there   s plenty of straw around and if anyone was to have a bit of a kip  i wouldn   t know about it  would i .  we   ll leave at six with fresh horses .     he grinned at her expression .     i told you  we get all sorts on the late night bus  kids running away from home  wives running away from husbands  husbands running away from other wives    husbands .  it   s called an omnibus  see  and omni means everything and damn near everything happens on this bus  that   s why i have the axe  see .  but the way i see it  life can   t be all axe .     he raised his voice     sto lat coming up  folks .  return trip six o   clock prompt .     he winked at glenda .     and if you   re not there  i   ll go withoutcha     he said .     you   ve got to catch the bus at bus catching time .         well  this hasn   t been so bad  has it .     said glenda  as the lights of the city grew bigger .      my dad   s going to fret     said juliet .      he   ll think you   re with me .      trev said nothing .  by the rules of the street  being exposed in front of your want to be girlfriend as the kind of man who can so easily be seen not to be the kind of man that would have the guts to belt someone over the head with a length of lead pipe was extremely shaming  although no one seemed to have noticed this .      looks like a bit of trouble ahead     the driver called back .     the lancre flyer ain   t gone .      all they could see were flares and lantern lights  illuminating the big coaching inn outside the city gate  where several coaches were standing .  as they drew nearer  he called to one of the skinny  bandy legged and weaselly looking men who seemed to self generate around any establishment that involved the movement of horses .     flyer not gone .     he enquired .   the weaselly man removed a cigarette end from his mouth .         orse frowed a shoe .         well .  they   ve got a smith    ere  ain   t they .  speed the mails and all that .         he   s not speedin    nuffink on account of him just laminating his hand to the anvil     said the man .      there   ll be the devil to pay if the flyer don   t go     said the driver .     that   s post  that is .  you should be able to set your watch by the flyer .      nutt stood up .     i could certainly re shoe a horse for you  sir     he said  picking up his wooden toolbox .     perhaps you had better go and tell someone .      the man sidled off and the bus came to rest in the big yard  where a rather better dressed man came hurrying up .     one of you a smith .     he enquired  looking directly at glenda .      me     said nutt .   the man stared .     you don   t look much like a smith  sir .         contrary to popular belief  most smiths are on the wiry side rather than bulky .  it   s all a matter of sinews rather than muscle .         and you know your way around an anvil  do you .         you would be amazed  sir .         there   s shoes in the smithy     said the man .     you   ll have to work one to size .         i know how to do that     said nutt .     mister trev  i would be glad if you would come and help me with the bellows .        the inn was huge and crowded  because as with coaching inns everywhere its day lasted for twenty four hours and not a moment less .  there were no meal times  as such .  hot food for those who could afford it was available all the time and cold cuts of meat were on a large trestle in the main room .  people arrived  were emptied and refilled in the speediest time possible and sent on their way again because the space was needed for the next arrivals .  there never seemed to be a moment without the jangle of harnesses .  glenda found a quiet corner .     i tell you what     she said to juliet     go and fetch some sandwiches for the lads .         fancy mister nutt being a blacksmith     said juliet .      he   s a man of many parts     said glenda .   juliet   s brow wrinkled .        ow many parts .         it   s just a figure of speech  juliet .  off you go now .     she needed time to think .  those strange flying women .  mister nutt .  it was all a lot to take .  you start the day and it   s just another day and here you are  having mercifully not ended up as a highwayman  sitting in another city with nothing more than the clothes you   re standing up in  not knowing what is going to happen next .   which  in a way  was exciting .  she had to analyse that feeling for several moments because excitement was not a regular feature of her life .  pies  on the whole  do not excite .  she got up and wandered unheeded through the crowds  with the vague idea of seeing what the kitchens were like  but found her path blocked by someone whose sweating face  flustered air and rotund body suggested he was the innkeeper .     if you could just wait a moment  ma   am     he said to her and then addressed a woman who was emerging from what looked like a private dining room .     so nice to see you again  your ladyship     he said  bobbing up and down a little .     it   s always an honour to have you grace our humble establishment .      ladyship .   glenda looked up at the woman who was everything she had pictured when nutt had first talked about her .  tall  thin  dark  forbidding  to be feared .  her expression was stern and she said  in what to glenda were posh tones     far too noisy in here .         but the beef was superb     said another voice and glenda realized that ladyship had almost eclipsed a smaller woman  quite pleasant  not particularly tall and with a slightly fussy air about her .      are you lady margolotta .     said glenda .   the tall lady gave her a look of brief disdain and swept on towards the main doors  but her companion stopped and said     do you have business with her ladyship .         is she coming to ankh morpork .     glenda asked .     everybody knows she   s lord vetinari   s squeeze .     she felt instantly embarrassed as she said the word  it conjured up images that simply could not fit into the available space in her brain .      really .     said the woman .     they are certainly very close friends .         well  i want to talk to her about mister nutt     said glenda .   the woman gave her a worried look and pulled her over to an empty bench .     there has been a problem .     she said  sitting down and patting the wood beside her .      she told him he was worthless     said glenda .     and sometimes i think all he worries about is being worthy .         are you worthy .     said the woman .      what sort of question is that to ask a stranger .         an interesting and possibly revealing one .  do you think the world is a better place with you in it  and would you do me the courtesy of actually thinking about your answer rather than pulling one off the    affronted    rack .  i   m afraid there   s far too much of that these days .  people believe that acting and thinking are the same thing .      faced with that  glenda settled for     yes .         you   ve made it better  have you .         yes .  i   ve helped lots of people and i invented the ploughman   s pie .         did the people you helped want to be helped .         what .  yes  they came and asked .         good .  and the ploughman   s pie .      glenda told her .      ah  you must be the cook at unseen university     said the woman .     which means that you have access to rather more than the average cook and  therefore  i would deduce that to keep the pickled onions crisp in the pie you put them in a cold room at very nearly freezing point for some time immediately before baking  possibly wrapping them in cheese for the sake of temporary insulation  and  if you have assembled your pie correctly and paid attention to temperatures  i think that would do the trick .     she paused .     hello .         are you a cook .     said glenda .      good grief  no .         so you worked it out  just like that .  mister nutt told me her ladyship employs very clever people .         well  i   m embarrassed to say it  but that is true .         but she shouldn   t have told mister nutt that he   s worthless .  she shouldn   t say that to people .         but he was worthless  yes .  he couldn   t even talk properly when he was found .  surely what she has done has helped him .         but he frets all the time and it   s got out now that he   s an orc .  what   s that all about .         and is he  in your mind  doing anything particularly orcish .      reluctantly  glenda said     sometimes his fingernails turn into claws .      the woman looked suddenly concerned .     and what does he do then .         well  nothing     said glenda .     they just sort of   go back in again .  but he makes wonderful candles     she added quickly .     he   s always making things .  it   s as if   worth is something that drains away all the time so you have to keep topping it up .         possibly  now you put it that way  she has been a little too brisk with him .         does she love him .     asked glenda .      i beg your pardon .         i mean  has anyone ever loved him .         oh  i think she does  in her way     said the woman .     although she   s a vampire  you know .  they tend to see the world rather differently .         well  if i met her i   d give her a piece of my mind     said glenda .     muddling him about .  setting those wretched flying ladies on him .  i wouldn   t let her do that sort of thing .         she   s immensely strong  i   m led to believe     said the woman .      that doesn   t give her the right     said glenda .     and shall i tell you something .  mister nutt is right here .  oh yes  out in the yard  shoeing one of the horses for the lancre flyer .  he really is amazing .         it sounds like it     said the woman with a faint little smile .     you certainly seem to be a vehement supporter .      glenda hesitated .     is that something to do with foxes .     she said .      it means with great passion     said the woman .     do you have a great passion for mister nutt  miss sugarbean .  and remember  please  i do like people to do me the honour of thinking before they speak .         well  i like him a lot     said glenda hotly .      that is charming     said the woman .     it does occur to me that mister nutt might have achieved more worth than i had previously thought .         so you tell her ladyship what i said     said glenda  feeling her neck on fire with blushes .     mister nutt has got friends .         indeed i will     said the woman  standing up .     and now if you   ll excuse me  i   m sure our coach is about to depart .  i must fly .         remember to tell her what i said .     glenda shouted after her .   she saw the woman turn to smile at her and then she was lost as a party arriving from a new coach hurried in from the cold night air .   glenda  who had stood up at the same time as the woman  sat down heavily .  who on earth did that woman think she was .  her ladyship   s librarian  probably .  nutt had mentioned her several times .  altogether too many ideas above her station for glenda   s liking .  she hadn   t even had the decency to give glenda her name .   the faint  distant hunting horns of sheer terror began to sound in the back of her mind .  had the woman asked glenda her name .  no .  but she   d certainly known it and how would she know about the    cook    at unseen university .  and she   d been so quick  she   d worked out the ploughman   s pie with a snap of her fingers .  that little part of her that had first been liberated by the sherry chimed in with  the trouble with you is that you make assumptions .  you see something and you think you know what you   ve seen .  she certainly didn   t sound like a librarian  did she .   very slowly  glenda raised her right hand into a fist and lowered it into her mouth  and bit down very hard in an attempt to somehow retrieve the last fifteen minutes from the records of the universe and replace them with something far less embarrassing  like her knickers falling down .     even here  late into the night  the forge was the heart of attention .  coaches were arriving and leaving constantly .  the inn did not run according to the sun  it ran according to the timetable  and aimless people waiting for their connections gravitated to the forge as a free show and a place of comfort in the chilly night air .   nutt was shoeing a horse .  trev had seen horses being shod before  but never like this .  the animal stood as if transfixed  trembling very slightly .  when nutt wanted it to move  he clicked his tongue .  when he wanted its leg raised  another click caused this to happen .  trev felt that he wasn   t watching a man shoeing a horse  but a master demonstrating his skills to a world of amateurs .  when the shoe was on  the horse walked backwards in front of the crowd  for all the world like a fashion model  turning as nutt moved a hand or made a clicking noise .  it didn   t seem to be a particularly happy horse  but  great heavens  it was certainly an obedient one .     yes  that all seems fine     nutt said .      how much is that going to cost us .     said the coachman .     wonderful job  if i may say so .         how much .  how much .  how much .     said nutt  turning it over in his mind .     have i earned worth  sir .         i should say so  mate .  i   ve never seen a horse shod as smooth as that .         then worth will do     said nutt .     and a ride for myself and my three friends back to ankh morpork .         an    five dollars     said trev  coming away from his lounging spot near the wall with the speed of money .   the coachman sniffed .     a bit steep     he said .      what .     said trev .     for a late night job .  to better than burleigh and stronginthearm specification .  not a bad deal  i think .      a murmur from the other watchers backed trev up .     i never seen anyone do anything like that     said juliet .     he   d    ave    ad that    orse dancing if you   d asked    im .      the coachman winked at trev .     all right  lad .  what can i say .  old havacook there is a good lad  but a bit bad tempered  as it goes .  once kicked a coachman through the wall .  i never thought i   d see him stand there and lift    is leg up like a trained lap dog .  your chum has earned his money and his ride .         please take him away     said nutt .     but hold him with care because when he gets a little way away from me he might get a tiny bit frisky .      the crowd dispersed .  nutt methodically damped down the forge and started to pack his tools into the box .     if we   re going to go back  we   d better go now .  has anyone seen miss glenda .         here     said glenda  advancing out of the shadows .     trev  you and jools go and get us some seats on the coach .  i need to talk to mister nutt .         her ladyship was here     said glenda when they   d gone .      i would not be surprised     said nutt calmly  snapping the catches shut on his box .     just about everybody passes through here and she travels a great deal .         why were you running away .         because i know what will happen     said nutt .     i am an orc .  it   s as simple as that .         but the people on the bus were on your side     said glenda .   nutt flexed his hands and the claws slid out  just for a moment .     and tomorrow .     he said .     and if something goes wrong .  everybody knows orcs will tear your arms off .  everybody knows orcs will tear your head off .  everybody knows these things .  that is not good .         well  then  why are you coming back .     glenda demanded .      because you are kind and came after me .  how could i refuse .  but it does not change the things that everybody knows .         but every time you make a candle and every time you shoe a horse  you change the things that everybody knows     said glenda .     you know that orcs were       she hesitated .     sort of made .         oh  yes  it was in the book .      she nearly exploded .     well  then  why didn   t you tell me .  .         is it important .  we are what we are now .         but you don   t have to be .     glenda yelled .     everybody knows trolls eat people and spit them out .  everybody knows dwarfs cut your legs off .  but at the same time everybody knows that what everybody knows is wrong .  and orcs didn   t decide to be like they are .  people will understand that .         it will be a dreadful burden .         i   ll help .     glenda was shocked at the speed of her response and then mumbled     i   ll help .          the coals in the forge crackled as they settled down .  fires in a busy forge seldom die out completely .  after a while  glenda said     you wrote that poem for trev  didn   t you .         yes  miss glenda .  i hope she liked it .      glenda thought she   d better raise this carefully .     i think i ought to tell you that she didn   t understand a lot of the words exactly .  i sort of had to translate it for her .     it hadn   t been too difficult  she reckoned .  most love poems were pretty much the same under the curly writing .      did you like it .     said nutt .      it was a wonderful poem     said glenda .      i wrote it for you     said nutt .  he was looking at her with an expression that stirred together fear and defiance in equal measure .   the cooling embers brightened up at this .  after all  a forge has a soul .  as if they had been waiting there  the responses lined themselves up in front of glenda   s tongue .  whatever you do next is going to be very important  she told herself .  really  extremely  very important .  don   t start wondering about what mary the bloody housemaid would do in one of those cheap novels you read  because mary was made up by someone with a name suspiciously like an anagram for people like you .  she is not real and you are .      we had better get on the coach     said nutt  picking up his box .   glenda gave up on the thinking and burst into tears .  it has to be said that they were not the gentle tears they would have been from mary the housemaid  but the really big long drawn out blobby ones you get from someone who very rarely cries .  they were gummy  with a hint of snot in there as well .  but they were real .  mary the housemaid would just not have been able to match them .   so  of course  it will be just like trev likely to turn up out of the shadows and say     they   re calling the coach now   are you two all right .      nutt looked at glenda .  tears aren   t readily retractable  but she managed to balance a smile on them .     i believe this to be the case     said nutt .     travelling on a fast coach  on even a mild autumn night  those passengers on the roof experience the temperature that can freeze doorknobs .  there are leather covers and rugs of various age  thickness and smell .  survival is only possible by wrapping yourself in the biggest cocoon you can achieve  preferably with somebody else next to you  two people can heat up faster than one .  in theory  all of this could lead to hanky panky  but the seats of the coach and the rockiness of the road mean that such things are not uppermost in the traveller   s mind  which dreams longingly of cushions .  furthermore  there was a fine rain now .   juliet craned her head to look at the seats behind  but there were just the mounds of damp rugs that were the coach company   s answer to the cold night air .     you don   t think they   re sweet on each other  do you .     she said .   trev  who was himself cocooned in rugs  only managed a grunt  but then went on     i think    e admires her .  he always seems a bit tongue tied when    e   s near her  that   s all i know .        this had to be a romance  glenda thought .  it wasn   t like the ones peddled every week by iradne comb buttworthy .  it felt more real   more real and very  very strange .      did you know that all of the orcs were hunted down after the war .  all of them  children too     nutt said .   and people don   t say things like that in a romantic situation  thought glenda .  but it still is  she added .      but they were forced     she replied .     they had children .  okay .     should i tell him about the magic mirror .  she wondered .  would it make things better .  or worse .      they were very bad times     said nutt .      well  look at it like this     said glenda .     most of the people who talk about orcs now don   t know what they   re on about  but the only orc they are ever going to see is you .  you making beautiful candles .  you training the football team .  that will mean a lot .  you   ll show them that orcs don   t go around pulling people   s heads off .  that   ll be something to be proud of .         well  in fairness  i have to say that when i think of the amount of radial force that must have been necessary to effectively unscrew a human head against its owner   s wishes  i am a little impressed .  but that   s now  sitting here with you .  then  i wanted to go up to the hills .  i think that   s how we must have survived .  if you didn   t keep away from humans you died .         yes  that   s a very good point     said glenda     but i think you should keep it to yourself for now .     she noticed a surprised owl  lit up briefly by the coach   s lamps .   then she said  keeping her eyes straight ahead     the thing about the poem           how did you know  miss glenda .     said nutt .      you talk about kindness a lot .     she cleared her throat .     and under the circumstances  i think glenda is sufficient .         you were kind to me     said nutt .     you are kind to everybody .      glenda swiftly put aside a vision of mr ottomy and said     no  i   m not  i   m shouting at everyone all the time .         yes  but it   s for their own good .         what do we do now .     glenda said .      i have no idea .  but can i tell you something very interesting about ships .      it wasn   t exactly what glenda had expected  but somehow it was one hundred per cent nutt .     please tell me the interesting thing about ships     she said .      the interesting thing about ships is that the captains of ships have to be very careful when two ships are close together at sea  particularly in calm conditions .  they tend to collide .         because of the wind blowing  and that .     said glenda  thinking  in theory this is a romantic novel situation and i am about to learn about ships .  iradne comb buttworthy never puts a ship in her books .  they probably don   t have enough reticules .      no     said nutt .     in fact  to put it simply  each ship shields the other ship from lateral waves on one side  so by small increments outside forces bring them together without their realizing it .         oh .  it   s a metaphor .     said glenda  relieved .     you think we   re being pushed together .         it   s something like that     said nutt .  they rocked as the coach hit a particularly nasty pothole .      so  if we don   t do anything we   ll just get closer and closer .         yes     said nutt .   the coach jumped and rattled again  but glenda felt as if she was travelling over very thin ice .  she   d hate to say the wrong thing .      you know trev said that i   d died .     nutt continued .     well  that was true .  probably .  ladyship said that we were made from goblins for the evil emperor .  the igors did it .  and they put in something very strange .  it   s a part of you that isn   t quite a part of you .  they called it the little brother .  it   s tucked in deep inside and absolutely protected and it   s like having your own hospital with you all the time .  i know that i was hit very hard  but the little brother kept me alive and simply cured things again .  there are ways to kill an orc  but there are not many of them and anyone trying them out on a living orc is not going to have very much time to get it right .  does that worry you at all .         no  not really     said glenda .     i don   t really understand it .  i think it   s more important just to be who you are .         no  i don   t think i should be who i am  because i am an orc .  but i have some plans in that direction .      glenda cleared her throat again .     this thing with the ships   does it happen quite quickly .         it starts quite slowly  but it   s quite quick towards the end     said nutt .      the thing is     said glenda     i mean  i can   t just walk away from my job  and there   s old ladies i go and visit  and you   ll be busy with the football           yes .  i think we should be doing the things we should be doing  and it   s the last training day tomorrow  which is actually today now     said nutt .      and i   ve got to make a lot of pies .         it   s going to be a very busy time for both of us     said nutt solemnly .      yes .  um  er  do you mind me saying   in your lovely poem   the line    the crypt   s a handsome place to be  but none i think leave after tea    didn   t quite           didn   t quite work .  i know     said nutt .     i feel rather bad about that .         oh  please don   t .  it   s a wonderful poem .     glenda burst out  and felt the ripples in the calm sea .     the rising sun managed to peek around the vast column of smoke that forever rose from ankh morpork  city of cities  illustrating almost up to the edge of space that smoke means progress or  at least  people setting fire to things .     i think we   re going to be so busy that we   re not going to have much time for   ourselves     said glenda .      i quite agree     said nutt .     leaving things alone would definitely be our wisest move .        glenda felt light as air as the coach trundled down broad way  and it wasn   t just from lack of sleep .  that stuff about boats  i really hope he doesn   t think it   s all about ships .   there was a crowd outside the university when they arrived  just as yesterday  but it seemed to have a different complexion now .  people were staring at her and nutt  and there was something wrong with the way they were looking .   she reached over to the mound that was trev  pretended not to hear a girlish giggle and said     trev .  could you  er  have a look at this .  i think there   s going to be trouble .      trev  very tousled  stuck his head out and said     hmm  me too .  let   s all nip in around the back .         we could stay on and get off at the post office     said glenda .      no     said trev .     we    aven   t done anythin    wrong .      as they dismounted from the coach a small boy said to nutt     are you the orc  mister .         yes     said nutt  as he helped glenda down .     i am an orc .         cool .  have you ever twisted someone   s head off .         i don   t believe so .  i am sure i would have remembered     said nutt .   this got if not applause then a certain amount of approval from some of the bystanders .  it   s his voice  thought glenda .  he sounds posher than a wizard .  you can   t imagine a voice like that with its hands around somebody   s head .   at this point the back gate opened and ponder stibbons came hurrying through .     we saw you from the hall     he said  grabbing nutt .     come in quick .  where have you all been .         we    ad to go to sto lat     said trev .      on business     said juliet .      personal     said glenda  daring ponder to object .     is there something wrong .         there was something in the paper this morning .  we have not been having a very nice time     said ponder  towing them into the relative safety of the undercrofts .         ave they been sayin    somethin    nasty about mister nutt .     said trev .      not exactly     said ponder .     the editor of the times came round  in person  and was knocking on the door to see the archchancellor at midnight .  he wanted to know all about you .     this was said directly to nutt .      i bet it was bloody ottomy that told them     growled glenda .     what have they done .         well  of course  you know there was all that trouble over the medusa in the watch a little while ago     ponder began .      yes  but you wizards sorted that out     said trev .      but no one likes being turned into stone  even if it   s just for half an hour .     ponder sighed .     the times has done one of their thoughtful pieces .  i suppose it isn   t too bad .  it quoted the archchancellor  who says that mister nutt is a hardworking member of the university staff and there have been no incidents of anyone   s leg being torn off .         they put it like that .     said glenda  wide eyed .      oh  you know the sort of thing if you read the papers a lot     said ponder .     i seriously think they think that it   s their job to calm people down by first of all explaining why they should be overexcited and very worried .         oh  yes  i know they do that     said glenda .     how would people get worried if they weren   t told how to be .         well  it wasn   t all that bad     said ponder     but a few of the other papers have picked it up as well and some of the facts have become   elastic .  the inquirer said nutt is training the football team .         that   s true     said glenda .      well  actually it   s me .  i am merely delegating the task to him .  i hope that   s understood .  anyway  they did a cartoon about it .      glenda put a hand over her eyes .  she hated cartoons in newspapers .     was it a football team of orcs .     she said .   ponder   s look was almost admiring .     yes     he said .     and they did an article about raising important questions about vetinari   s open door policy  while saying at the same time that rumours that mister nutt had to be chained down were quite likely false .         what about the tanty bugle .     said glenda .     they never write anything unless it   s got blood and horrible murder in it .     she paused and then added     or pictures of girls without their vests on .         oh  yes     said ponder .     they did a rather grainy picture of a young lady with enormous melons .         d   you mean       trev began .      no  they were just enormous melons .  the green ones .  slightly warty .  she won a contest for growing them  apparently  but in the caption it said that she   s worried that she won   t be able to sleep easily in her bed now that orcs are coming into the city .         is lord vetinari doing anything about this .         i haven   t heard     said ponder .     oh  and bu bubble want to interview mister nutt .  what they call a lifestyle piece .     he said the words as if trying to hold them at arm   s length .      have people turned up for training .     said nutt calmly .      oh  yes .  the ground is heaving .         so we   ll go and train them     said nutt .     don   t worry  i won   t twist anybody   s head off .         no  don   t make jokes     said glenda .     i think this could be terribly bad .         we know something   s going on with the teams     said ponder .     and there were lots of fights during the night .         about what .         about who   s going to play us .     ponder stopped and looked nutt up and down .     commander vimes is back in town and would like to lock you up     he said .     only in protective custody  of course .         you mean put him somewhere where they can all find him .     said glenda .      i would say that the chances of a mob breaking into pseudopolis yard are remote     said ponder .      yes  but you   re locking him up .  that   s what it would be .  he   d be locked up and coppers chat like everyone else .  the orc would be locked up in prison and if people don   t know why  they   ll make it up  that   s how people are .  can   t you wizards do something .         yes     said ponder .     we can do practically anything  but we can   t change people   s minds .  we can   t magic them sensible .  believe me  if it were possible to do that  we would have done it a long time ago .  we can stop people fighting by magic and then what do we do .  we have to go on using magic to stop them fighting .  we have to go on using magic to stop them being stupid .  and where does all that end .  so we make certain that it doesn   t begin .  that   s why the university is here .  that   s what we do .  we have to sit around not doing things because of the hundreds of times in the past it   s been proved that once you get beyond the abracadabra  hey presto  changing the pigeons into ping pong balls style of magic you start getting more problems than you   ve solved .  it was bad enough finding ping pong balls nesting in the attics .         ping pong balls nestin    .     said trev .      i don   t want to talk about it     said ponder glumly .      i remember when one of you gentlemen got hungry in the night and cast a spell for a baked potato     said glenda .   ponder shuddered .     that was the bursar     he said .     he really does get confused about the decimal point .         i remember all those wheelbarrows     said glenda  slightly amused at ponder   s discomfort .     days and days it took to get them all out .  i heard we were feeding every beggar in the city and every pig farm out as far as sto lat for weeks .      ponder nearly gave a harrumph .     well  yes  there   s an example of why we have to be careful .         but there   s still going to be a match tomorrow and i would like to conclude my training programme     said nutt .      ah  there   s another problem .  you know lord vetinari is allowing the hippo to be used for the game .  well  some of the teams are doing their training there now .  you know  a bit of a kick about  and so on .  it   s all about who will be playing unseen academicals .         but that   s the other side of the city     said glenda .      commander vimes has said the watch will provide an escort     said ponder .     just for protection  you know .         whose .     said glenda .     you can see what   s going on here .  people will see mister nutt as the problem .         oh  it   s all fun and games until someone loses a head     said a voice behind glenda .  she recognized that voice and it always sounded as if it was trying to put its hand up her jumper .      pepe .  what the hell are you doing here .         and how did you get in .     ponder demanded .     the watch are all around this place .      pepe barely gave him a glance .     and who are you  smart boy .         i run this university .         then i should go away and run it  because you   re not going to be any good around here .         is this   person   known to you  miss .     ponder demanded .      er  yes .  he  er  designs clothes .         i am a fashionista     said pepe .     i can do things with clothing that you wouldn   t think were possible .         i   d believe that  at least     said trev .      and i know a thing or two about riots and mobs .      an idea struck glenda and she whispered to the irate ponder     very big in dwarf circles  sir .  knows a lot of influential people .         so do i     said ponder .     actually  i am one     he wailed .     but i had to do the training myself yesterday and i couldn   t remember all of the things mister nutt comes up with so i had them running on the spot  which i don   t think is very helpful .         there   s somethin    goin    bad     said trev .     i know about this city .  i   ll go and check a few things out .  it   s not as if you really need me .         i do     said juliet .   trev hesitated  but nutt had shown him how to do this .  he extended a hand and blew her a kiss as he went through the door .      did you see that .     said juliet .     he blew me .      glenda looked at pepe  whose eyes were turned up so far in his head that she could see the whites   although they were red .   a short while later  when most of the uu squad headed for the hippo with glenda and juliet trailing after them like camp followers  half a dozen watchmen appeared from the various places that they had selected for a quiet smoke and fell in after them  trying to make it look as if they all just happened to be strolling in the same direction .   trev was right  glenda thought .  it is going bad .     trev had not gone very far when his street sense told him he was being followed .  he jinked in and out of a few alleys and waited at the next corner to confront the follower   the follower who wasn   t there .  the alley behind him was empty all the way to the last street .  he realized this at the same time as someone pressed what definitely felt like a knife to his neck .      cor  this takes me back and so it does     said a voice .     i reckon i can still remember every back alley in this place .         i know you  it   s pepe  isn   t it .  you   re a dwarf .     said trev  trying not to turn round .      sort of a dwarf     said pepe .      but i don   t have no argument with you  do i .     said trev .   something small and shiny appeared on the edge of trev   s vision .     sample piece of moonsilver     said pepe   s voice .     i could do more damage with a broken champagne bottle   and i have  believe you me .  i wouldn   t threaten a bloke like you with a knife  not with that little girl doting on you like she is .  she seems very happy with you and i   d like to keep her happy .         somethin   s goin    down on the street     said trev .      what  the whole street .  sounds like fun .         somethin   s gone wrong     asn   t it .     said trev .   only now did pepe enter his field of view .     not really my problem at all     he said .     but there   re some kinds of people i just don   t like .  i   ve seen too many of    em  bullies and bastards .  if you want to learn athletics very quickly  be born around here with a talent for design and maybe a few other little preferences .  lord vetinari has got it all wrong .  he thought he could take on the football and it   s not working .  it   s not like the thieves    guild  see .  he had it easy with the thieves    guild .  that   s because the thieves    guild is organized .  football ain   t organized .  just because he   s won over the captains don   t mean that everyone   s going to meekly get into line after them .  there was fights all over the place last night .  your chums with their shiny new football and their shiny new jerseys are going to get creamed tomorrow .  no  worse than creamed   cheesed .         i thought you were just someone who made clothes .     said trev .      just .  someone .  who .  made .  clothes .  just someone .  .  i am not anyone .  i am pepe and i don   t make clothes .  i create gorgeous works of art that just happen to require a body to show them off as they should be seen .  tailors and dressmakers make clothes .  i forge history .  have you heard about micromail .         got yer .  yep     said trev .      good     said pepe .     now  what have you heard about micromail .         well  it doesn   t chafe .         it   s got one or two other little secrets  too       said pepe .     anyway  i can   t say i   ve got any time for the wizards  myself .  snooty lot .  but it   s not going to be a game out there tomorrow  it   s going to be a war .  do you know a bloke called andy .  andy shank .      trev   s heart sank .     what   s he gotta do with it .         i just heard the name  but i reckon i know the type .  lord vetinari has done what he wanted .  he   s broken the football  but that   s leaving a lot of sharp bits  if you get my meaning .         the watch   ll be there tomorrow     said trev .      what   s this .  what   s this .  a street face like you being glad that the watch is going to be anywhere .         there   ll be a lot of people watching .         yeah  won   t that be fun .     said pepe .     and  you know  there   s people in this city that would watch a beheading and hold their kiddies up for a better view .  so i   ll tell you what i   ll do .  i   m not going to give you an edge  the last thing you   ll want to see tomorrow is an edge .  i   ll give you something that   s much better than an edge .  after all  you   re dave likely   s lad .         i   m not playing     said trev .     i promised my ol    mum .         you promised your old mum .     said pepe .  there wasn   t even any attempt to hide the disdain .     and you think that makes any difference  do you .  you   ve got a star in your hand  lad .  you   ll play  all right  so i   ll tell you what i   ll do .  you come along and see me round the back entrance of shatta  sorry about that  it sounds better in dwarfish  and kick on the door round about midnight .  you can bring a chum with you if you like  but you better bloody well come .         why do i    ave to kick the door .     said trev .      because you   ll have a bottle of best brandy in each hand .  don   t thank me .  i   m not doing it for you .  i   m protecting my investment and  on the way  that means protecting yours as well .  off you go  boy .  you   re late for training .  and me .  i   m a soddin    genius .      trev noticed more watchmen around as he headed onwards .  they could be absolute bastards if they felt like it  but sam vimes had no use for coppers that couldn   t read the streets .  the watch was jumpy .     carter used to live in his mum   s cellar until she rented it out to a family of dwarfs  and now he lived in the attic  which baked in the summer and froze in the winter .  carter survived because the walls were insulated with copies of bows   ammo  back street pins  stanley howler   s stamp monthly  giggles  girls and garters  golem spotter weekly  and fretwork today .  these were only the top layer .  in self defence against the elements  he glued old copies over the larger cracks and holes in the roof .  as far as trev knew  carter had never persevered beyond a week with any of the hobbies indicated by his rather embarrassing library except  possibly  the one notoriously associated with the centrefolds of giggles  girls and garters .   mrs carter opened the door to him and indicated the stairs with all the hearty welcome and hospitality that mothers extend to their sons    no good street friends .     he   s been ill     she announced  as if it were a matter of interest rather than concern .   this turned out to be an understatement .  one of carter   s eyes was a technicolor mess and there was a livid scar on his face .  it took some time for trev to find this out because carter kept telling him to go away  but since the ramshackle door was held shut with a piece of string  the application of trev   s shoulder had seen to that  at least .   trev stared at the boy  who shrank back into his unspeakably dreadful bed as if he was expecting to be hit .  he didn   t like carter .  no one liked carter .  it was impossible .  even mrs carter  who in theory at least should entertain some lukewarm affability to her son  didn   t like carter .  he was fundamentally unlikeable .  it was a sad thing to have to say  but carter  farting or otherwise  was a wonderful example of charisntma .  he could be fine for a day or two and then some utterly stupid comment or off key joke or entirely inappropriate action would break the spell .  but trev put up with him  seeing in him  perhaps  what trev might have been had he not been  in fact  trev .  maybe there was a bit of carter the farter in every bloke at some time in his life he had thought  but with carter it wasn   t just a bit  it was everything .      what    appened .     trev said .      nuffin    .         this is trev .  i know about nothin       appenin    .  you need to get to the hospital with that .         it   s worse than it looks     carter moaned .   trev cracked .     are you bloody stupid .  that cut   s a quarter of an inch from your eye .         it was my fault     carter protested .     i upset andy .         yeah  i can see where that   d have been your fault     trev said .      where were you last night .     said carter .      you wouldn   t believe me .         well  it was a bloody war  that   s what it was .         i found it necessary to spend a little time down the lat .  there was fightin     wasn   t there .         the clubs    ave signed up to this new football and some people ain   t    appy .      trev said     andy .     and looked at the livid  oozing scar again .  yep  that looked like andy being unhappy .   it was hard to feel sorry for someone as basically unlikeable as carter  but just because he had been born with kick me up the arse tattooed on to his soul was no reason for doing it .  not to carter .  that was like pulling wings off flies .      not just andy     said carter .     there   s tosher atkinson and jimmy the spoon and spanner .         spanner .     said trev .      and mrs atkinson .         mrs atkinson .         and willy piltdown  harry capstick and the brisket boys .         them .  but we hate them .  andy hates them .  they hate andy .  one foot on their turf and you get sent home in a sack .         well  you know what they say     said carter .     my enemy   s enemy is my enemy .         i think you got that wrong     said trev .     but i know what you mean .      trev stared at nothing  utterly aghast .  the subjects of that litany of names were faces .  hugely influential in the world of the teams and  more importantly  among the supporters .  they owned the shove .  pepe had been right .  vetinari thought the captains were in charge and the captains were not in charge .  the shove was in charge and the faces ran the shove .       there   s going to be a team put together for tomorrow and they   ll try to get as many of them in as possible     carter volunteered .      yeah  i heard .         they   re going to show vetinari what they think of his new football .         i didn   t hear the name of the stollops there     trev said .      i hear their dad   s got them doing choir practice every night     said carter .      the captains did sign up     said trev     so it   ll look bad for them .  but    ow much do you think andy and his little chums care    bout that .     he leaned forward .     vetinari   s got the watch  though     asn   t he .  and you know about the watch .  okay  so there   s some decent bastards among    em when you get    em by theirselves  but if it all goes wahoonie shaped they   ve got big  big sticks and big  big trolls and they   ve not got to bother too much about who they hit because they   re the watch  which means it   s all legal .  and  if you get    em really pissed off  they   ll add a charge of damaging their truncheons with your face .  and talking of faces  exactly    ow come you   re a quarter inch away from being a candidate for a white stick .         i told andy i didn   t think it was a good idea     said carter .   trev couldn   t hide his surprise .  even that much bravery was alien to carter .     well  as it    appens  it might be a blessin    in disguise .  you just stay here in bed and you won   t end up stuck between the old sam and andy .      he stopped because of a rustling noise .   since carter glued pages of his used magazines to the walls with flour and water paste  the attic was home to some quite well fed mice  and for some reason  one of them had just gnawed its way to freedom via the chest of last year   s miss april  thus giving her a third nipple  which was  in fact  staring at trev and wobbling .  it was a sight to put anyone off their tea .      what   re you goin    to do .     said carter .      anything i can     said trev .      you know andy   s out to get you .  you and that weird bloke .         i   m not afraid of andy     said trev .  as a statement  this was entirely true .  he was not frightened of andy .  he was mortally terrified to his boots and back again  with a visceral fear that dripped off his ribs like melting snow .      everyone   s afraid of andy  trev .  if they   re smart     said carter .      hey  fartmeister  i   m trevor likely .         i think you   re goin    to need a lot more than that .        i am going to need a lot more than that  thought trev  travelling at speed across the city .  if even pepe knew there was something on the boil  then surely the old sam would know too .  oops .   he sprinted quickly to the horse bus   s rear platform and landed in the road before the conductor was anywhere near .  if they didn   t catch you on the bus then they couldn   t catch you at all  and while they were issued with those big shiny choppers to deter non paying passengers  everyone knew that a  they were too scared to use them and b  the amount of trouble they would get into if they actually whacked a respectable member of society did not bear thinking of .   he darted through the alley into cockbill street  spotted another bus plodding its way in the right direction  jumped on to the running board and held on .  he was lucky this time .  the conductor gave him a look and then very carefully did not see him .   by the time he reached the big junction known as five ways  he had travelled almost the width of the city at an average speed faster than walking pace and had hardly had to run very far at all .  a near perfect result for trev likely  who wouldn   t walk if he could ride .   and there  right in front of him  was the hippo .  it used to be a racetrack until all that was moved up to the far end of ankh .  now  it was just a big space that every large town needs for markets  fairs  the occasional insurrection and  of course  the increasingly popular cart tail sales  which were very fashionable with people who wanted to buy their property back .   it was full today  without even a stolen shovel to be seen .  all over the field  people were kicking footballs about .  trevor relaxed a little .  there were pointy hats in the distance and no one seemed to be doing any murder .      wotcher  howya doing .      he adjusted his eyeline down a little bit .     how   s it goin     throat .         i   m hearing you   re kind of associated with unseen academicals     said cut me own throat dibbler  the city   s most enterprising but inexplicably least successful businessman .      don   t tell me you   ve come to sell pies .         nah  nah  nah     said dibbler .     too many amateurs here today .  my pies aren   t just knocked up out of rubbish for a load of drunken old football fans .         so your pies are for    .     trev left the question hanging in the air with a noose on the end of it .      anyway  pies are so yesterday     said dibbler dismissively .     i am on the ground floor of football memorabilityness .         what   s that  then .         like genuine autographed team jerseys and that sort of thing .  i mean  look here .     dibbler produced from the large tray around his neck a smaller version of what one of the new gloing .  gloing .  footballs would be if it were about a half of the size and had been badly carved out of wood .     see those white patches .  that   s so they can be signed by the team .         you   re goin    to get them signed  are you .         well  no  i think people would like to get that done themselves .  the personal touch  you know what i mean .         so they   re actually just painted balls of wood and nothin    else .     said trev .      but authentic .     said dibbler .     just like the shirts .  want one .  five dollars to you  and that   s cutting me own throat .     he produced a skimpy red cotton item and waved it enticingly .      what   s that .         your team colours  right .         two big yellow us on the front .     said trev .     that   s wrong .  ours has got two little us interlocked on the left breast like a badge .  very stylish .         pretty much the same     said dibbler airily .     no one   ll notice .  and i had to keep the price down for the kiddies .      he leaned closer .     anything you can tell me about the game tomorrow  trev .  looks like the teams are putting together a tough squad .  vetinari   s not going to get it all his own way for once .         we   ll play a good game  you   ll see     said trev .      right .  can   t lose with a likely playing  right .         i just help around the place .  i   m not playin    .  i promised my ol    mum after dad died .      dibbler looked around at the crowded stadium of the hippo .  he appeared to have something else on his mind other than the need for the next dollar .     what happens if your lot lose .     he said .      it   s only a game     said trev .      ah  but vetinari   s got his reputation based on it .         it   s a game .  one side wins  one side loses .  just a game .         a lot of people aren   t thinking like that     said dibbler .     things always come out well for vetinari     he went on  staring at the sky .     and that   s the magic  see .  everyone thinks he always gets it right .  what do you think will happen if he gets things wrong .         it   s just a game  throat  only a game   be seein    you .     trev wandered onwards .  people were putting up tiers of wooden stands on one side of the arena  and because this was ankh morpork  when two or more people gathered together thousands turned up just to wonder why .   and there was mr ponder stibbons  sitting at a long table with some of the football captains .  oh  yes  the rules committee .  there had been talk about that .  even with the rules written down  and half of them as old as the game itself  there were a few things that had to be made clear .  he arrived in time to hear ponder say     look  you can   t have a situation in the new game where people hang around right next to the other team   s goal .         worked all right before     said one of the captains .      yes  but the ball flies .  one really good kick would send it down half the length of the hippo .  if someone gets that right the goalkeeper wouldn   t have a chance .         so  what you   re saying     said mr stollop  who had become a kind of spokesman for the captains     is that there   s got to be two blokes from team a in front of a bloke from team b before he scores .         yes  that   s about right     said ponder stiffly     but one of them is the goalkeeper .         so  what happens if one of them fellers nips past him downfield before he kicks the ball .         then he will be what is traditionally known as off his side     said ponder .      off his head  more like     said one of the captains .  and since this had the same shape as humour  it got a laugh .     if that   s true  you could end up with loads of blokes rushing past one another  all trying to get the other poor buggers into an unlawful position without any of the poor devils moving  right .         nevertheless  we are standing by this rule .  we have tried it out .  it allows for free movement on the field .  in the old game it wasn   t unusual for players to bring their lunch and a copy of girls  giggles and garters and just wait for the ball to come along .         hello  trev  how are you getting on .     it was andy  and he was standing behind trev .   there must be a thousand people here today  trev thought in a curiously slow and blissful sort of way .  and a lot of watchmen .  i can see a couple of them from here .  andy isn   t going to try anything right here  is he .   well  yes  he might  because that   s what made him andy .  the little bee that buzzed in his brain might bang against the wrong bit and he would carve your face off .  oh  yes  and there was tosher atkinson and his mum  strolling about as if out for a walk .      haven   t seen you about much lately  trev     said andy .     been busy  i suspect .         i thought you were lyin    low .     said trev hopelessly .      well  you know what they say .  sooner or later all sins are forgiven .      in your case  quite a bit later  trev thought .      besides     said andy     i   m turning over a new leaf  ain   t i .         oh  yeah .         got out of the shove     said andy .     gotta put aside my scallywag ways .  time to fit in .         glad to hear it     said trev  waiting for the knife .      so i   m a key player for ankh morpork united .     it wasn   t a knife  but it had a rather similar effect .     apparently his lordship gave them the idea     andy said  still speaking in the same greasy  friendly tone .     of course  no one wants to be the team playing you wizards .  so there is  like  a new one just for the occasion .         i thought you never played .     said trev weakly .      ah  but that was in the bad old days before football was open to more individual effort and enterprise .  see this shirt .     he said .   trev looked down .  he hadn   t thought much about what the man was wearing  just that he was there .      white with blue trim     said andy cheerfully .     very snazzy .     he turned around .  the numeral   was on the back in blue with the name andy shank above it .     my idea .  very sensible .  means we   ll know who we are from the back .         and i told your wizards that your gentlemen ought to do the same     said mrs atkinson  surely one of the most feared faces who had ever wielded a sharpened umbrella with malice aforethought .  grown men would back away from mrs atkinson  otherwise grown men bled .   just what we need  thought trev .  our names on the back as well .  saves them having the trouble to go round the front before they stab .      still  i can   t stand here chattin    all day with you .  got to talk to the team .  got to think about tactics .      there will be a referee  thought trev .  the watch will be there .  lord vetinari will be there .  unfortunately  andy shank will be there  too  and nutt wants me as his assistant and so i   ve got to be there .  if it all goes wrong  the floor of the arena isn   t going to be the place to be and i   ll be in it .      and if you   re wondering where that dim little girl of yours is  she   s back there with the fat girl .  honestly  what must you think of me .         nothing  right up until you said that     said trev .     and now i do .         give my best to the orc     said andy .     shame to hear he   s the last one .      they strolled on  but trev was quick enough to get out of the way before mrs atkinson sliced at his leg with her stick .   find juliet .  find nutt .  find glenda .  find help .  find a ticket to fourecks .   trev had never fought .  never really fought .  oh  there had been times when he was younger when he was drawn into a bit of a ruck and it was politic to be among the other kids  holding a makeshift weapon in his hands .  he   d been so good at appearing to be everywhere  shouting a lot and then running into the thick of the fray  but never actually catching up with the real action .  he could go to the watch and tell them   that andy had been threatening .  andy was always threatening .  when trouble struck in the shove as it sometimes did  when two tribes were brought into conjunction  there was always the forest of legs to dive between and once  when trev had been really desperate  a number of shoulders to run across   what was he thinking .  he wouldn   t be there .  he wasn   t going to play .  he   d promised his old mum .  everyone knew he   d promised his old mum .  he   d like to play  but his old mum wouldn   t like it .  it was as if his old mum had written him a note  dear andy  please do not knife trevor today because he has promised not to play .   he blinked away the sensation that a knife was already hurtling towards him and heard the voice of nutt saying     oh  i have heard about bu bubble .     there was glenda and juliet and nutt and juliet and a slightly worried young lady with a notebook and juliet .  there was also juliet  but it was hard to even notice her because juliet was there .      she says she wants to write an article     said glenda  who had clearly waylaid the journalist .     her name is miss           roz     said the girl .     everyone   s talking about you  mister nutt .  would you answer a few questions  please .  we have a very now audience .          yes .     he ventured .      how does it feel to be an orc  mister nutt .         i am not sure .  how does it feel to be human .     said nutt .      have your experiences as an orc affected the way you will play football .         i will only be playing as a substitute .  my role is merely that of a trainer .  and  i have to say  in answer to your question  i   m not sure i have had many experiences as an orc up until now .         but are you advising the players to rip opponents    heads off .     the girl giggled .   glenda opened her mouth  but nutt said solemnly     no  that would be against the rules .         i hear they think you   re a very good trainer .  why do you think this is .      despite the patent stupidity of the question  nutt seemed to think deeply .     one must consider the horizons of possibility     he said slowly .     e pluribus unum  the many become one  but it could just as easily be said that the one becomes many  ex uno multi  and indeed  as von sliss said in the effluence of reality  the one  when carefully considered  may in fact be a many in different clothing .      glenda looked at the girl   s face .  her expression hadn   t moved and neither had her pencil .  nutt smiled to himself and continued .     now let us consider this in the light  as it may be  of the speeding ball .  where it has come from we believe we know  but where it will land is an ever changing conundrum  even if only considered in four dimensional space .  and there we have the existential puzzle that confronts the striker  for he is both striker and struck .  as the ball flies  all possibilities are inexorably linked  as herr frugal said in das nichts des wissens     ich kann mich nicht genau erinnern  aber es war so etwas wie eine vanillehaltige s  sse nachspeisenbeigabe     although i believe he was on some medication at the time .  who is mover and who is moved .  given that the solution can only be arrived at through conceptual manifestation using  i believe  some perception of transfinite space  it can clearly be seen that among the possibilities is that the ball will land everywhere at the same time or turn out never to have been kicked at all .  it is my job to reduce this metaphysical overhead  as it were  and to give my lads some acceptable paradigm  such as  it might be  whack it right down the middle  my son  and at least if the goalie stops it you will have given him a hot handful he won   t forget in a hurry .      you see  the thing about football is that it is not about football .  it is a most fascinating multi dimensional philosophy  an extrusion  as it were  of what doctor maspinder promulgated in das meer von unvermeidlichkeit .  now  you would say to me  i am sure     he went on     what of the           or even the                    yes .  and my answer to that would be  there is only the one .  traditionally we say there are eleven players in the team  but that is because of our rather feeble perceptions .  in truth  there is only the one and therefore  i would say     he gave a little laugh     daring to adapt a line from the doors of deception  it does not matter whether you win or lose so long as you score the most goals .      the girl looked down at her notepad .     could you give that to me a little bit more simply .         oh  i   m sorry     said nutt .     i thought i had .         and i think that   s about enough     said glenda  taking the girl by the arm .      but i haven   t asked him about his favourite spoon     she wailed .   nutt cleared his throat .     well  i would have appreciated some notice of that question because it is quite a large field  but i think the great bronze spoon of cladh  which weighed more than a ton  would definitely have to be a runner  though we must not forget the set of spoons  each one smaller than a grain of rice  crafted by some unknown genius for the concubines of the emperor whezi .  but undoubtedly  from what i can gather  these were surpassed by the notorious clockwork spoon  devised by bloody stupid johnson  which could apparently stir coffee so fast that the cup would actually rise up from the saucer and hit the ceiling .  oh  to be a fly on that wall  but not too close  obviously .  possibly less well known is the singing spoon of the learned sage ly tin wheedle  which could entertain the dinner table by singing comic songs .  among other great spoons           that is enough     said glenda  tugging the girl away for her own good .      he   s an orc .     the girl said .      so everyone says     said glenda .      were they all like that .  i thought it was all about twisting heads off .         well  i suspect people get bored with the same old thing .         but how does he know all about spoons .         believe me  if anyone has ever written great spoons of the world  mister nutt has read it .      trev heard the girl   s plaintive voice as glenda almost forcibly led her away  or at least away from nutt .     i really wanted to talk to jewels     trev heard the girl say  as she walked past juliet without a glance .     but she   s hiding out  everyone says .      he hurried across and pulled the other two in a huddle towards him .     there   s gonna be murder tomorrow     he said .     the wizards can   t use magic and ankh morpork united is gonna be made up out of the toughest  nastiest bunch of buggers that   re outside of the tanty .         we shall have to change our tactics to suit  then     said nutt .      are you nu   insane .  i   m talkin    about people like andy  nutt .  an    he might not be the worst one .         but everything is a matter of tactics .  a respect for strengths and weaknesses and the proper utilization of the knowledge     said nutt .      listen .     said trev .     there won   t be time for that sort of thing .         if i may quote       nutt began .      i said listen .  do you know any quotes by people who have been knifed in the back an    then kicked in the nu       he stopped and then continued .     kicked when they   re lyin    on the ground  yes .  because that   s what you need to be thinkin    about at the moment .         the watch will be there     said nutt .      but generally their way of dealing with a complicated event is to get everyone lyin    on the ground     said trev .     that makes it simpler .         i feel certain that we could beat any team at football     said nutt soothingly .   trev looked around him in a desperate search for anyone who might have a grip .     it doesn   t work like that .  it   s not about the football .         i don   t think i want to see anyone hurt     said juliet .      then you   ll have to close your eyes     said trev .     nutt  you think that everythin    is going to be nice and sportsmanlike    cos that   s how the new football has been designed  but it   s the same old people out there .  you know what i think .         my dad says it won   t look very good for vetinari if the academicals lose     said juliet .      an    will he be glad about that .     said trev .      well  i suppose  yes  but even dad says prob   ly better to have bloody vetinari than most of the buggers we   ve had .      that was because the city worked  thought trev .  it had been a mess before vetinari had taken over and no one knew exactly how he   d done it .  he   d got the watch working properly .  he   d got the war between the dwarfs and the trolls sorted out .  he let people do whatever they liked  provided they did whatever he liked .  and above all  the city was crammed with people and money .  everyone wanted to live in ankh morpork .  could he really be shaken down because the new football went bad .  well  the answer was  of course  yes   because that   s how people were .   trev mentioned this to glenda as she came back from ushering the bemused roz out of the range of more of nutt   s philosophy .  she looked at trev and said     do you think vetinari knows about this .         dunno     said trev .     well  i know he   s s   posed to have lots of spies  but i dunno whether they   d know about this .         do you think someone ought to tell him .     said glenda .   trev laughed .     what are you suggestin    .  that we go over to the palace  walk right up to him and say     excuse us  mister  there are a few things that have escaped your attention .            yes     said glenda .        thank you  drumknott  that will be all for now     said vetinari .      yes  sir     said drumknott .  he nodded at lady margolotta and oiled his way noiselessly out of the room .      havelock  i appreciate that drumknott is very competent  but he always seems to me to be a rather strange little man .         well  it would be a funny old world if we were all alike  madam  although i admit not very funny if we were all like drumknott .  but he is loyal and excessively trustworthy     said vetinari .      hmm     said her ladyship .     does he have much of a personal life .         i believe that he collects different types of stationery     said vetinari .     i have sometimes speculated that he might change his life for the better should he meet a young lady willing to dress up as a manila envelope .      they were on the balcony outside the oblong office  which offered a perfect view of the centre of the city while leaving the viewer almost invisible .      the accord is going ahead .     said vetinari .      certainly     said her ladyship .     peace at last between dwarfs and trolls .      vetinari smiled .     the word    peace    is generally defined as a period of rest and rearmament before the next war .  were many assassinations necessary .         havelock  sometimes you are too direct .         i do beg your pardon  it   s just that the progress of history requires butchers as well as shepherds .         there were no assassinations     said her ladyship .  she turned her eyes upwards .     there was  however  a terrible mining accident and a rather unusual rock slide .  but  of course  there is still the loko business to sort out .  the dwarfs still want total extermination .         how many orcs are there .         nobody knows .  perhaps nutt will be able to find them .         we must not have genocide     said vetinari .     history has a way of repaying .         he is turning out to be quite a surprise .         so i understand .  from the reports i have been receiving  all that the orcs were not  he is .         but he will remain an orc underneath it all     said her ladyship .      i wonder what remains under all of us .     said vetinari .      you   ve taken a very big risk  you know     said lady margolotta .      madam  this city is all risk  i assure you .         and power is a game of smoke and mirrors     said her ladyship  reaching for the wine .      oddly enough  commander vimes reminds me of that nearly every day .  no civil police force could hold out against an irate and resolute population .  the trick is not to let them realize that .  yes .      there was a knock at the door .  it was drumknott again .     i am sorry to interrupt  sir  madam  but in the circumstances i thought it would be a good idea .     he sniffed .     it   s the lady with the pies .         ah  miss sugarbean  legendary inventor of the famous ploughman   s pie     said vetinari .  he glanced at her ladyship .     and mister nutt   s friend .         i have met her  havelock .  she harangued me .         yes  she does it very well .  you feel as if you   ve had a nice cold bath .  do show her in  drumknott .         and there is a young man with her .  i recognize him as trevor likely  son of the famous footballer dave likely  and i am informed by her that she has indeed brought you a ploughman   s pie .         you would take untested food from a member of the public .     said her ladyship  horrified .      certainly from this one     said vetinari .     there is no possible way that she would ever put poison in anything .  not out of respect for me  you understand  but out of respect for the food .  don   t leave .  i think you will find this   interesting .      the pie was still warm in glenda   s hands as she stepped into the oblong office .  she herself almost froze at the sight of lady margolotta  but a certain robustness kicked in .      do i have to curtsy .     she said .      not unless you really feel the need .         we   ve come to warn you     said trev .      indeed .     vetinari raised an eyebrow .      ankh morpork united will walk all over unseen academicals with great big boots on .         oh  dear .  do you think that will be the case .         they   re not yer average players .     trev blurted out .     they   re from the shove .  they go armed .         ah  yes .  football as warfare     said vetinari .     well  thank you for telling me .      silence fell .  vetinari broke it by saying     was there anything else you would like to say .     he looked at the pie that glenda was holding out in front of her like some kind of chastity device .      can   t you do something .     she said .      it   s a game  miss sugarbean .  having suggested the match in the first place  what do you think i would look like if i intervened .  there will  after all  be rules .  there will  after all  be a referee .         they won   t care     said trev .      then i suppose the watch will have to do its duty .  and now  if you will excuse me  i have affairs of state to attend to  but please leave the pie .         one moment     said her ladyship .     why have you come to warn his lordship  young lady .         isn   t that the sort of thing i ought to do .     said glenda .      and you walked in  just like that .         well  the pie helped .         we have met before  you know     said her ladyship .   she stared at glenda and glenda stared back  and she finally managed     yes  i know  and i   m not frightened and i   m not sorry .      the battle of the stares went on for a year too long and then lady margolotta turned her head away sharply and said     well  you have got one of them right  but i am sure i shall enjoy the pie and also the match .         yes  yes     said vetinari .     thank you both for calling  but if you will excuse us we do have matters of state to discuss .         well .     said lady margolotta as the door shut behind them .     what type of people are you incubating in this city of yours  havelock .         i imagine some of the very best     said vetinari .      two common people can barge in on you without so much as an appointment .         but with a pie     said vetinari quickly .      you were expecting them .         let us just say that i was not unduly surprised     said vetinari .     i certainly know about the make up of ankh morpork united .  so does the watch .         and you are going to let them into an arena with a bunch of old wizards who have promised not to do magic .         a bunch of old wizards and mister nutt     said vetinari cheerfully .     apparently he   s very good at tactical planning .         i can   t allow that .         this is my city  margolotta .  there are no slaves in ankh morpork .         he is my ward .  i expect you will ignore that  though .         i have every intention of doing so .  after all  it   s only a game .         but a game is not about games .  and what sort of game do you think you will get tomorrow .         a war     said vetinari .     and the thing about war is that it   s about war .      lady margolotta shot out her long sleeve and a fine steel dagger was suddenly in her hand .      i suggest you cut it in half     said vetinari  indicating the pie     and i will choose which half to pick up .         but what if one half has more pickled onions than the other .         then i think that will be open to negotiation .  would you like some more   wine .         did you see that she tried to stare me down .     said margolotta .      yes     said vetinari .     i saw that she succeeded .        when glenda and trev got back to the hippo  nutt looked at them expectantly .     he hardly listened     said trev .      quite so     said nutt .     i am confident of our success on the morrow .  i am quite certain that we will be tactically supreme .         i   m just glad i won   t be playin     that   s all     said trev .      yes  mister trev  that really is a great shame .      from the nearby table where last minute adjustments were being made by the football league came the voice of somebody saying     nah  nah .  look  you   ve still got it wrong .  if a bloke from side b is closer to the goalkeeper   no  i tell a lie   if he   s closer to the goal than the goalkeeper  then he surely puts one away there and then .  stands to reason .      there was a sigh that could only have come from ponder stibbons .     no  i don   t think you understand        another voice chipped in .     if the goalkeeper is that far out of his goal then he   s a pillock .         look  let   s start again     said another voice .     supposing i   m this bloke here .     trev looked across and saw one of the men flick a screwed up piece of paper across the table .     like  i   ve kicked the ball that far and this is me  this piece of paper .  then what .     he flicked the paper once again  which hit ponder   s pencil .      no .  i   ve already explained that .  and stop flicking bits of paper around  i find it very confusing .         but it must work if he dribbles on it     said a voice .      hold on a minute  though     said yet another voice .     what happens  right  if you get the ball in your own half of the field and run all the way  not passing it to anyone else  and get it into the net .         that would be perfectly legal     said ponder .      yeah  but there   s no way that   s goin    to happen  is there .     said the man who had just flicked a soggy piece of paper and had enjoyed it so much that he   d flicked another one .      but if he tries and succeeds it would be magnificent football  would it not .     said ponder .      where   s our team .     said trev  looking around .      i   ve suggested they have an early night     said ponder .      an early night for wizards is two o   clock in the morning     said glenda .      i have also given instructions that the team are to have a special meal this evening     said nutt .     on that note  miss glenda  i shall have to ask you to lock the night kitchen .        stony silence hung over the dining room that evening .      i don   t eat salads     said bledlow nobbs  no relation  .     they gives me the wind .         how can a man live without pasta .     said bengo .     this is barbaric .         i hope you notice that my plate is as barren as yours  gentlemen     said ridcully .     mister nutt is training us and i   m allowing mister nutt the driver   s seat .  nor is there to be any smoking this evening .      there was a chorus of dismay and he raised his hand for silence .     also  his instruction here       he looked closer at nutt   s rather untidy writing and gave a little smile .     there is to be no sexual congress .     this did not meet with the reaction he had expected .      that means talking about it  doesn   t it .     said the chair of indefinite studies .      no  that   s oral sex     said rincewind .      no  that   s listening to it .      bengo macarona sat with a dazed look on his face .      now  i don   t want any sneaking off for midnight snacks     said ridcully .     there are rules .  mrs whitlow and miss sugarbean have been told that i fully back mister nutt   s authority here .  surely you gentlemen could show some backbone .         in an attempt to show solidarity with the rest of the team     said the lecturer in recent runes     i am led to believe that there is some cheese in the mousetrap in my room .      ridcully was left all alone with only the echo of falling chairs for company .   the archchancellor repaired to his own room and tossed his hat on to its stand .  there have to be rules  he said to himself  and there has to be a rule for them and a rule for me .  he went to his eight poster bed and opened the hatch containing the tobacco jar .  it now contained a little note instead  saying          dear archchancellor   in accordance with your ratification of mister nutt   s instructions that the faculty are not to be allowed food or the implements of smoking this evening  i   ve taken the liberty of clearing away your cigarettes and pipe tobacco .  may i also mention that i have emptied the cool cupboard of the usual cold cuts and pickles to avoid temptation .           bugger     said ridcully under his breath .   he walked to his wardrobe and rummaged in the pocket of his smoking jacket  coming up with a note that said          in accordance with mister nutt   s rules  as ratified by yourself  archchancellor  and it was remarkable how reproachful mrs whitlow could make her handwriting   i have taken the liberty of removing your emergency peppermints .           change and decay .     ridcully declared to the night air .     i am surrounded by traitors .  they thwart me at every turn .     he wandered disconsolately past his bookcase and pulled out boddrys    occult companion  a book he knew by heart .  and because he knew the book by heart  page    opened on to a neat little cavity  which contained a packet of extra strong liquorice mints  an ounce of jolly sailor tobacco and a packet of wizzla   s   and  as it turned out  a small note          dear archchancellor   i just didn   t have the heart .  mrs whitlow .        it seemed darker than usual .  generally  the archchancellor   s rulings were obeyed  and it seemed to the members of unseen academicals that every door was closed  indeed slammed  as they searched for food .  every pantry was locked and spell proofed .  the team trudged helplessly from one hall to another .      i do have some reheatable pasta in my room     said bengo macarona .     my grandmother gave it to me before i came down here .  it will keep for ten years and my grandmother says that it will taste as good after ten years as it does now .  i regret that she may have been telling the truth .         if you get it  we could cook it up in my room     said the lecturer in recent runes .      if you like .  it contains alligator testicles  for nourishment .  they are very popular at home .         i didn   t know alligators had testicles     said the lecturer in recent runes .      they haven   t got    em any more     said bledlow nobbs  no relation  .      i   ve got a biscuit  we could share that out     said ponder stibbons .  he was immediately pierced by their questioning gazes .     no     he said     i am not going to countermand the archchancellor   s orders any further than that .  i would never hear the last of it  gentlemen .  without a hierarchy we are nothing .         the librarian will have some bananas     said rincewind .      are you sure .     said macarona .      i think the librarian has a motto in these cases     if you try to take my bananas from me  i will reclaim them from your cold dead hands .         trev  who had been lurking in the shadows  waited until the rumble of stomachs died away in the distance and then hurried back and knocked on the bolted door of the night kitchen .     they   ve all met up and they   re headed for the library .         good  i think he   ll share his bananas with them     said nutt .      i don   t really see the point     said glenda .      the point is they are friends .  partners in adversity .  they are a team .  that is football .  you have to train a team to be a team and i will have no problem with them having a very large breakfast in the morning .      nutt was changing  trev thought .     can i ask you a personal question  mister nutt .         nearly all the questions people ask me are personal  though do go ahead  mister trev .         well  er  all right .  sometimes you look big and sometimes you look small .  what   s that all about .         it is something built into us     said nutt .     i believe that it is a product of the morphic field contracting and expanding .  it affects your perceptions .         when you   re upset  you do look very small     said glenda .      what size do i look now .         pretty big     said trev .      good     said nutt  helping himself to a slice of pie .     tomorrow i intend to look even bigger .         there   s somethin    else we have to do     said trev .     pepe wants to help me .  he thinks i   m gonna play football .         well  you are going to play football     said nutt .      no .  you know this .  i promised my ol    mum and you can   t break a promise to your ol    mum  gods rest her soul .  do you    ave keys to the wine cellar  glenda .         do you think i   d tell you  trev likely .         thought not .  i want two bottles of best brandy .  and  er  could you all come with me  please .  i think pepe means well  but he  er  well  you know him  it   s midnight and everythin    .         i think i know pepe     said glenda .     there was a guard on the rear door of shatta  but before he could even think of turning away trev and his bodyguards  pepe appeared .     cor .  three chums .  i must be very frightening     he said  leering .     hello  chums  got the brandy .         yes  what   s this all about  pepe .  you   ve been putting the willies up trev     said glenda .      i never have .  i hardly ever put the willies up anyone these days .  i just told him he was going to play in the football .         i promised my ol    mum     said trev  clinging to the declaration as if it were a tiny raft in a choppy sea .      but you   ve got a star in your hand and you don   t have much of a choice .      trev looked at his palm .     just a lot of lines .         well there   s them that has the sight and there again there   s them that don   t .  i   m one of those that have .     s metaphorical  see .  but all it is is that i would like to give you a little something that may be of use to you tomorrow .  what am i saying .  it might damn well save your life     said pepe .     it   ll certainly save your marriage .  i   m sure the ladies here would like to think that us at shatta have done the best for you .         for what it   s worth  trev  i trust pepe     said glenda .      and this is mister nutt     said trev .     he   s a friend .         yeah .  i know what mister nutt is     said pepe .     and you can come  too .  i am pleased to make your   acquaintance .      he turned to glenda .     you girls stay here  miss     he said .     this is no errand for a lady .     he ushered the boys into the gloom .     what i   m going to show you gentlemen is top secret and if you cross me  trev likely  i will do things that will make andy shank look like a playground bully .         andy was a playground bully     said trev  as they reached what was clearly a forge .      micromail     said pepe with satisfaction .     the world hasn   t seen the half of it yet .         it just looks like fine chain mail     said nutt .      it   s strange stuff     said the dwarf .     i can give you a vest and pair of shorts and they better both come back here  boy  otherwise said implications will be performed on your arse and i ain   t kidding .  this stuff isn   t just for making the girls look pretty .  you would be amazed what it can do with just a little change in the alloy .     he pointed to a glistening heap .     it   s as light as a feather and doesn   t chafe  you know .         and what else does it do .         i   ll show you in a minute .  slip on a pair of the shorts .         wot  here .     said trev .   somehow  pepe looked like a small demon by the light of the forge .     ooh  look at mister bashful .     said pepe .     just pull a pair on over your trousers for now and i   ll tell you what i   ll do  i   ll even turn my back while you   re doing that .     he looked away  fiddling with the tools beside the anvil .     got    em on .     he said  after listening to a few minutes of heavy breathing .      yes  they  er  well  they feel all right .         okay     said pepe .     could you just wait    ere one moment .     he disappeared into the darkness and  after a succession of strange noises  walked back into view  slowly and awkwardly .      what   s that you   re wearin     pepe .     said trev .     it looks like a mass of cushions to me .         oh  just a bit of protection     said pepe .     now if you could just go back a little way  mister nutt  and trev  if you could oblige me by putting your hands on your head  it just helps to get the measurements right .     he turned his back on them .     okay  trevor  are your hands on your head .         yeah  yeah .      at which point  pepe spun round and hit him full force in the groin with a twenty four pound sledgehammer     surprisingly  the only effect was to send pepe crashing into the opposite wall .     perfect .     said his voice  muffled by the padding .     morning came  but it seemed to glenda that there was no night and no day  no work and no play  there was just football  ahead of them all  drawing them together .  in the great hall the team had a table all to themselves .  servants and wizards side by side  filling up as only unseen university could .   football owned the day .  nothing was happening that wasn   t about football .  there were certainly no lectures .  of course  there never were  but at least today they weren   t being attended because of the excitement about the upcoming match rather than not being attended because no one wanted to go to them .  and after a while  glenda became aware of the sound which was coming from the city itself .   there were crowds outside the university  there were crowds  even now  queuing to get into the hippo .  the sound of a hundred thousand people at one purpose rose like the buzz of a distant swarm .   glenda went back to the sanctuary of the night kitchen and tried to pass some time by doing some baking  but the dough fell from her fingers .      are you upset .     said juliet .      i hope we   re going to win     said glenda .      well  of course we   re going to win     said juliet .      that   s all very well up until the time we lose     said glenda .     yes  who   s that .      the door was pushed open and pepe stepped in  looking smarter than usual .     hello  ladies     he said .     got a little message for you .  how was you expecting to watch the match .         just so long as we can get close     said glenda .      tell you what  then     said pepe .     madame has got the best seats in the stadium .  nothing underhand  just open and above board bribery .  shatta has got to be seen out and about  you see .  got to keep micromail in the public eye .         i   d love to .     juliet shouted .  and even glenda found that her automatic  unthinking cynicism was letting her down .      there will be sherry     said pepe .      will there be anyone famous there .     said juliet .   pepe walked over and prodded her gently in the chest and said     yes .  you  miss .  everyone wants to see jewels .        it seemed as if the clocks turned backwards .  all watch leave had been suspended  but it was hard to see what crime there could be in streets where nobody could move .  a flood of humanity  well  mostly humanity  poured towards the stadium  bounced off it and overflowed and backfilled more and more of the city .  the game was in the hippo  the crowd stretched back to sator square and eventually the pressure of so many eyeballs on the hands of so many clocks moved time forwards .     only the team  and trev  remained in the great hall  everyone else having left much earlier in a fruitless attempt at securing a seat .  they milled around aimlessly prodding the ball to one another until ponder  nutt and the archchancellor turned up .      well  big day  lads .     said ridcully .     looks like there   s going to be a nice day for it as well .  they   re all over there waiting for us to give them a show .  i want you to approach this in the best traditions of unseen university sportsmanship  which is to cheat whenever you are unobserved  though i fear that the chance of anyone being unobserved today is remote .  but in any case  i want you all to give it one hundred and ten per cent .         excuse me  archchancellor     said ponder stibbons .     i understand the sense of what you are saying  but there is only one hundred per cent .         well  they could give it one hundred and ten per cent if they tried harder     said ridcully .      well  yes and no  sir .  but  in fact  that would mean that you had just made the one hundred per cent bigger while it would still be one hundred per cent .  besides  there is only so fast a man can run  only so high a man can jump .  i just wanted to make the point .         good point  well made     said ridcully  dismissing it instantly .  he looked around at the faces .     ah  mister likely  i suppose there is nothing i can do that would get you on to the team .  dave likely   s boy playing for unseen academicals would be a bit of a feather in our cap .  and i see my colleague professor rincewind has humorously already put a white one in his .         well  sir  you know how i   m fixed     trev mumbled .      your old mum     said ridcully  nodding understandingly .      i promised her     said trev .     i know she   s passed away  but i   m certain that she still watches over me  sir .         well  that   s nice and does you credit .  is there anything else that can be said .  let me think .  oh yes  gentlemen   mrs whitlow  as is her wont on these occasions  has organized her maids to dress up in appropriate costume and cheer us on from the sidelines .     his face was a blank mask as he continued .     mrs whitlow unaccountably takes an enthusiastic and uncharacteristically athletic part in these things .  there will be high kicking  i am told  but if you are careful where you let your gaze fall  you should see nothing that will upset you too much .         excuse me  sir     said rincewind .     is it true that some of the men in ankh morpork united are just a bunch of thugs from the shove .         that might be a bit harsh     ridcully began .      excuse me  sir     said trev     that is quite true .  i would say about half of them are honest cloggers and the rest of them are bastards .         well  i   m sure we will overcome     said ridcully jovially .      i would also like to make a few comments before we leave  sir     said nutt .     a few words of advice  perhaps .  in these few days i have taught you everything i know  even if i do not know how i know it .  as you know  i am an orc and whatever else we were  we were team players .  you are playing  therefore  not as individuals  but as a team .  i think it was von haudenbrau who said           i don   t think we   ve got very much time to get through the crowds     said ridcully  who had been expecting this .     thank you  mister nutt  but i really think we ought to get going .        those watching from above would have seen the cramped streets of the city waver as the red caterpillar that was the unseen academicals made its way to the ground .  there were cheers and there were boos and because this was ankh morpork  usually the cheers and the booing were done alternately by everyone concerned .   by the time lance constable bluejohn of the watch and two other trolls had forcibly prised open the gates against the pressure of bodies  the noise was just one great hammer of sound .  the troll officers opened a path for them with the forethought and delicacy that has made police crowd control such a byword .  it led to a fenced off and heavily guarded area  in the centre of which was the archchancellor formerly known as dean  the entire team of ankh morpork united and his grace the duke of ankh  commander of the city watch  sir samuel vimes  with a face like a bad lunch .     what the hell are you clowns proposing to do to my city .     he demanded and looked up at vetinari in his box in the middle of the stand .  he raised his voice .     i   ve been grafting like mad this last month on getting the kv accord sorted out and it turns out that just when the dwarfs and the trolls are shaking hands and being jolly good pals  you lot are starting another kv of your very own .         oh  come now  sam     said ridcully .     it   s only a jolly day out .         people are queueing up at the gates     said vimes .     the actual city gates .  how much of this is magical .         none  sam  as far as we   re aware .  there will be no magic used during the game  this has been discussed and agreed and the d       ridcully swallowed hard .     the archchancellor of brazeneck university is making himself responsible for thaumic damping of the stadium .         then let me tell you this     said the commander .     none of my men will set a foot on the field of play  no matter what happens .  do i make myself clear .         as crystal  sam .         sorry  archchancellor  for now i am commander of the city watch  not sam  if it   s all the same to you     said vimes .     the whole damn city is an accident waiting to   no  an accident that already has happened and anything that goes bad will get worse very quickly .  i   m not going to have it said that the watch were the problem .  honestly  mustrum  i really would have expected better from you .         that will be archchancellor     said ridcully coldly .      as far as i   m concerned     said vimes     this is a scuffle between rival gangs .  do you know what my job is  archchancellor .  it   s to keep the peace  and for two pins  i   d arrest the whole boiling of ya  but his lordship won   t have it .      ridcully coughed .     may i extend my congratulations  sir  on the very good work you have been doing in koom valley .         thank you     said vimes .     and so i suspect you can imagine how cheerful i am to see you involved in another kind of war .     the commander turned to archchancellor henry .     nice to see you again  sir   it   s good to see that you   ve moved up in the world .  i   m formally telling you that i am laying down the law  here  and as the referee  you have to pick it up .  inside these lines it   s football   step over the line and it   s me .     he turned back to ridcully .     mind how you go  archchancellor .      he departed  watchmen falling into place behind him .      well  now  i suspect the good commander has a lot on his mind these days     said archchancellor henry  brightly .  he pulled out his watch .     i would like to speak to the team captains .         well  i know i   m one of them     said ridcully .   a man stepped forward from the ranks of united .      joseph hoggett  of the pork packers  as it happens .  captain  for my sins .      hoggett held out his hand to ridcully and  to his credit  hardly winced when it was taken in a firm handshake .      well  gentlemen     said the former dean .     i am sure you know the rules  we   ve been through them often enough .  i want a good clean game .  one long  er  peep from my whistle means that i am interrupting play for an infringement or injury or for some other reason at that point known only to myself .  one even longer peep  which i suppose will be more of a parrp  will mean the end of one half and time for refreshment  after which the game will recommence .  during the interval  i believe that there will be a marching display by the ankh morpork accordion band  but i suppose these things are sent to try us .  may i remind you gentlemen that you change ends at the half time .  also  please impress on your team that the goal they are aiming for should not be behind them .  if i see any serious infringement  that player will be removed from the pitch .  a considerably longer parrp  which as far as i am concerned will continue until i am out of breath  will mark the end of the game .  may i also remind you  as commander vimes has reminded us  that within these four  rather sticky lines of chalk  i am a wielder of power second only to the gods themselves  and then only perhaps .  if at any time it becomes clear that the rules themselves are impractical  i will change them .  when i blow the whistle  i shall raise my staff and unleash a spell which will prevent any further magic being used within these hallowed lines until the close of play .  is that understood .         yes  sir     said mr hoggett .      mustrum .     said the former dean  in a meaningful voice .      yes  yes  all right     grumbled ridcully .     you are making the most of your little moment  aren   t you .  let   s get on with it  shall we .         gentlemen  would you please form up your teams for the singing of the national anthem .  mister stibbons  i believe you have found me a megaphone  thank you very much .     he raised the horn to his lips and shouted through it     ladies and gentlemen  be upstanding for the national anthem .      the singing of the national anthem was always a ragged affair  the good people of ankh morpork feeling that it was unpatriotic to sing songs about how patriotic you were  taking the view that someone singing a song about how patriotic they were was either up to something or a head of state .    an additional problem today lay in the acoustics of the arena  which were rather too good  coupled with the fact that the speed of sound at one end of the stadium was slightly off beat compared with the other end  a drawback exacerbated when both sides tried to recover the gap .   these acoustical anomalies did not count for much if you were standing next to mustrum ridcully  as the archchancellor was one of those gentlemen who will sing it beautifully  correctly enunciated and very  very loudly .         when dragons belch and hippos flee  my thoughts  ankh morpork  are of thee        he began .   trev noticed  to his surprise  that nutt was standing stiffly to attention .  his own mouth operating on automatic  he looked along the massed rank of ankh morpork united .  about fifty fifty  he thought .  half of them decent old cloggers and half of them andy and his chums .  his gaze lighted on andy just as he thought that and andy flashed him a little smile and pointed a finger briefly .  but i   m not playing  trev thought  because of my old mum .  he glanced down at the palm of his hand  no star there  he was sure of that .  anyway  he thought  staring at the opponents  when it all goes bad the referee is a wizard  after all .         let others boast of martial dash  for we have boldly fought with cash        roared the crowd at various pitches and speeds .   i mean  trev thought  he wouldn   t switch off his own magic  would he .         we own all your helmets  we own all your shoes .         i mean  he really wouldn   t do that  would he .  the only person who could stop it if it all went wrong wouldn   t have made a mistake like that .         we own all your generals   touch us and you   ll lose .         yes  he has done .  he has done just that .         morporkia .  morporkia .  morporkia owns the day        trev shouted to quell his own rising panic .  he has done that  we all saw him .  he   s kept his own staff inside the field where you can   t do magic .  he looked at andy and andy nodded .  yes  he had worked it out as well .         we can rule you wholesale .  touch us and you   ll pay .         it is considered in the sto plains that only scoundrels know the second verse of their national anthem  since anyone spending time memorizing that would be up to no good purpose .  the ankh morpork national anthem  therefore  had a second verse that was deliberately written as ner ner ners and the occasional coherent word desperately trying to stay afloat  on the basis that this is how it would sound in any case .  trev listened to it with even more agony than usual .   but everyone joined in cheerful unison for the last line  which everybody knew        we can rule you wholesale  credit where it   s due .         glenda  one arm as far across her bosom as it would go  risked a look at what would still probably be called the royal box  just as vetinari raised the gold ish coloured urn and a cheer went up .  ankh morpork was not particularly keen on cheering the patrician but it would cheer money any day of the week .  yet it seemed to glenda that there was some strange harmonic to the cheer  coming up from under the ground itself  as if the place was one huge mouth   then the feeling went away .  and the day came back .      gentlemen .  team players to their places     said the archchancellor of brazeneck  haughtily .      er  can i have a word with you  sir .     said trev  sidling up as quickly as possible .      ah  yes .  dave likely   s boy     said the former dean .     we are about to play football  mister likely  i   m sure you   ve noticed .         yes  sir  well  er  but           do you know of any good reason why i should hold up the game .     the referee demanded .   trev gave up .   henry produced a coin from his waistcoat pocket .     mustrum .     he said .      heads     said the archchancellor  and he turned out to be wrong .      very well  mister hoggett   and who has the ball .      gloing .  gloing .   nutt picked the ball out of the air and handed it over .     me  sir .         ah  you are the coach for the academicals .         yes  but a player as well should it become necessary .         gentlemen  you will see that i am placing the ball in the centre of the pitch .     it   s true that the archchancellor formerly known as dean did rather relish the occasion .  he took a few steps back  paused for dramatic effect  produced a whistle from his pocket and flourished it .  he gave a blow that only a man of that size could give  his face began to twitch and go red .  he raised his megaphone to his lips and shouted     any boy who has not brought his kit will play in his pants .     followed by ponder stibbons shouting     i want to know who gave that to him .      the crowd roared and you could hear the laugh going away in the distance  rolling down the streets as every listener in the crowded city passed it on  bringing back such memories that at least two people started to forge letters from their mother .   in his goal  the librarian swung himself to the top of his posts to get a better look .  in his goal  charlie barton  goalkeeper for united  methodically lit his pipe .  and the man with the biggest problem within the ground that day apart possibly from trev  was the editor of the times  mr william de worde  who had not trusted any underling with the reporting of this unique  most prestigious occasion  but wasn   t at all sure how it should be done .   at the whistle  he   d managed       the united chief  should i say chief .  there must be a better word for him  but i can sort that out in the office  does not actually appear to know what to do next .  archchancellor ridcully  bf  no  no  i   ll fill that in later  has kicked the ball hard towards  well  actually it has hit jimmy wilkins  formerly of the miners  who seems uncertain as to what to do with it .  no  no  he   s picked it up .  he   s picked up the ball .  the referee  who is the former dean of unseen university  has called him over for what i imagine is to be a refresher course in the rules of this new game of football .     a megaphone  thought de worde  that   s what i need  an extremely big megaphone so i can tell everyone what   s going on .       the ball has been handed to  let me see  number sixty nine  oh yes  the multi talented professor bengo macarona  who according to the regulations  the new rules  is allowed what is known as a free kick from where the infringement took place and it   s  and here comes  bengo maca   sorry  professor bengo macarona for unseen academicals and   oh my word .  it has gone right down the pitch at shoulder height  making a noise like a partridge  check with nature notes correspondence on whether i have the correct simile  .  the ball has hit mr charlie    big boy    barton in the stomach with such force as to carry him into the back of the net .  what a display .  and this would appear to be a goal .  at least one goal  i should think .  and the crowd are on their feet  though technically most of them were there already  anyhow  he wrote conscientiously  with a journalist   s well known desire to get things right  .  and yes  they are celebrating the hero of the moment and the refrain coming from the lips of the academicals    supporters in their unique patois seems to be     one makaronah  there   s only one makaronah  one makaro naah .      no  no .  something seems to be happening  macarona has left the pitch and is talking animatedly to the crowd .  he appears to be haranguing them .  those he has been talking to look subdued .     at this point  one of the editor   s assistants hurried over with a brief digest of what had transpired on the other side of the pitch .  de worde wrote quickly  hoping that his home made shorthand would not fail him       with that hot blooded resolve that is so lovably typical of the native genuan  professor macarona is apparently insisting that any celebratory chanting should include his full name and full list of honours and is helpfully writing them down .  there also appears to be a bit of a hiatus around united   s goal as some of charlie barton   s team mates help him find his pipe and also  it transpires  the editor of the times liked the word transpire   the other half of the pork pie it transpired he had been eating at the time the goal was scored .  it appears that  not unlike many of us  he had underestimated the speed of the new ball .   and now the ball appears to be back in the centre of the pitch where there is another argument going on .        but they   ve just scored a goal .     said mr hoggett .      yes  quite so     said the former dean  wheezing gently .     that means that they get to kick off next .         that means we don   t  but we   ve just lost a goal .         yes  but that   s what the rules say .         but that   s not fair  we want a kick  they kicked it last .         but it   s not about the kicks  mister hoggett  it   s what you do with them .          and archchancellor ridcully runs towards the ball .  he turns swiftly and has kicked the ball towards his own goal .     the editor wrote furiously       almost all of united   s team are running up to take advantage of this strange faux pas  not entirely cognisant  the editor liked that word  too  it was so much better than aware  but the famous librarian of unseen university has just       he stopped  blinked and grabbed one of his assistants who had turned up with a full list of bengo macarona   s honours and pushed him down in the chair .      write down everything that i say .     he shouted .     and i hope your shorthand is better than mine  and if it isn   t you   ll be sacked in the morning .  this is insane .          they did it on purpose  i   ll swear they did it on purpose .  he kicked the ball directly at his own goalkeeper  knowing  i swear  that he could take advantage of the librarian   s renowned upper body strength to throw the ball almost the entire length of the pitch .  and there is bengo macarona  more or less unnoticed by his opponents  heading towards the missile while united have streamed away from their citadel  like the ill fated maranids during the first prodostian war  the editor liked to think of himself as a classicist  .        i   ve never seen anything like it .     he shouted at his almost deafened assistant .     they   ve got united all in the wrong place .          and there goes macarona .  the ball appears to be attached to his feet .  and there ahead of him appears to be the only member of the luckless united squad that knows what   s going on .  mr charles    big boy    barton  who nevertheless is staggering out of the goalmouth  like the giant octopal  upon seeing the hordes of the mormidons .     the editor fell silent  forgetting everything as the ground between the two men shortened by the moment .     oh  no .     he said .   there was a huge cheer from the crowd .     what happened .     said the assistant  pencil poised .      didn   t you see it .  didn   t you see it .     said the editor .  his hair was dishevelled and he looked like a man nearing madness .     macarona ran round him .  i don   t know how the ball stayed at his feet .         do you mean he dodged past him  sir .     said the assistant .   the noise of the crowd would have been incandescent had it been visible .     another goal     said the editor slumping .     two goals in as many minutes .  no  he didn   t dodge him  he ran around him .  twice .  and i   ll swear  ended up going faster .         ah  yes     said the assistant  still writing .     i went to a lecture about that sort of thing  once .  it was about how things don   t hit the world turtle  sir .  it was like a slingshot effect  he may have picked up additional speed as he rounded the goalkeeper   s enormous girth  sir .         and listen to the crowd roar .     said the editor .     and write it down .         yes  sir  that would be  one professor macarona d .  thau  bug   d

clustering around the referee and what would i give to be a fly on that wall .         there is no wall  sir .         it would seem       and the editor stopped dead .     who is that .         what is that  sir .         look over there at the stands .  the upper class stands  i might add  to which we were not invited .      the sun usefully took this opportunity to appear from behind the clouds and the bowl of the hippo seemed to fill with light .      that   s the micromail girl  sir     said the assistant .   even some of the protesting united team were looking up at the stands now .  she hurt the eyes  but they were dragged towards it again .      i   ve got her picture on my bedroom wall     said the assistant .     everyone has been looking for her .     he coughed .     they say it doesn   t chafe  you know .        now  all the footballers on the field  bar the unfortunate charlie barton  who was having a dizzy spell  were clustered around the referee  who said     i repeat  it was a perfectly acceptable goal .  a trifle unkind and showy  perhaps  but nevertheless entirely within the rules .  you   ve watched the unseen lads training .  the game moves about .  it doesn   t send you a clacks to tell you what   s happening next .      a voice a little lower down said     it is an elementary mistake to believe that even the most doughty keeper of the net can single handedly defend against the full might of the opposing team .     this was nutt .      mister nutt  you are not supposed to tell them that sort of thing     said ridcully .   mr hoggett looked downcast .  a man betrayed by team  history and expectations .     i can see we   ve got a lot to learn     he said .   trev pulled nutt off to one side .     and this is where it all goes bad     he said .      oh  come now  mister trev .  we   re doing very well .  bengo is  anyway .         i   m not watching him .  i   m watching andy and andy is watchin    bengo .  they   re bidin    their time .  they   re lettin    the poor old buggers get into a hell of a fix and then they   ll just take over .      and then trev was given a short lesson in why wizards are wizards .      i have a modest proposal and i wonder if you will hear me out  referee .  while we at unseen university are absolute novices  we have had rather more time to get to grips with the new football than our current opponents have .  therefore  i propose to give them one of our goals     said ridcully .      you can   t do that  sir .     said ponder .      why  is it against the rules .     ridcully   s tone deepened and became noticeably more pompous .     i ask you  are good sportsmanship  fellowship and generosity against the rules  pray .     by the end of the sentence  his voice was audible nearly to the very back of the stadium .      well  of course there is nothing against it  sir .  there isn   t a rule stopping you washing your laundry during the middle of the game and that is because no one would do it .         right .  mister hoggett .  one of our goals is now yours .  we are  as it were  level .      hoggett  transfixed  looked around at his fellow players     well  er  if you insist  sir .         wouldn   t dream of taking no for an answer     said ridcully expansively .      what in the world made him do that .     said the editor of the times  as an exhausted runner brought him the news .      it was a very generous gesture .         why did you do it .     said ponder to ridcully .      i am totally transparent  stibbons .  generous to a fault  that   s me .  it   s not my fault that they do not know they are inferior and this will play on their minds for the rest of the game .         that   s rather   cunning  sir .         yes  it is  isn   t it .  i   m rather proud of it .  and once again  we get to kick first .  no wonder this is such a popular game .         that was a remarkable piece of psychology there     said nutt to trev as they walked back to the sidelines .     somewhat cruel  possibly  but clever .      trev said nothing .  there was the shrill call of the whistle for the game to resume  followed instantly by the referee screaming     a little bit of hail won   t hurt you  boy  it   s healthy and will do you good .         that   s magic     said trev .     should that be happening .         no     said ponder stibbons behind him .     it   s just possession .         yes  the game is all about possession  mister trev     said nutt .   trev looked up again at the stand .  there was the shining shape of juliet  only a few feet away from vetinari himself and flanked by glenda and pepe .  she could be a goddess .  it   s never going to happen  is it .  he said to himself .  not her and a boy from the candle vats .   not really going to happen .  not now .   and then bengo screamed and it seemed as though every voice in the stadium joined in one communal    oooooh .      and the whistle blew again .      what happened  sir .     said the editorial assistant .      can   t exactly be sure .  they got the ball to macarona again and then he collided with a couple of united players and they all ended up in a heap .        nutt  the first to reach the stricken macarona  looked up at trev gravely .     both patellas dislocated     he said .     we   ll need a couple of men to take him down to the lady sybil .      the former dean looked around at the clustered footballers .     so  what happened here  mister shank .     he said as perspiration dripped off his chin .   andy momentarily lifted a finger to his forelock .      well  sir  i was rushing forward according to the rules to tackle mister macarona and i had no idea at all that jimmy the spoon  here  had got exactly the same idea and was coming from a different direction and suddenly we were all there together going arse over tip  if you would excuse my klatchian .      trev glowered .   the look on andy   s face was transparent .  he was lying .  he knew he was lying .  he knew everyone else knew he was lying and he didn   t care .  in fact  he rather enjoyed the situation .  andy   s boots looked heavy enough to moor a boat .      they got    im like the meat in a sandwich  sir     trev complained to the referee .      can you substantiate that  young man .         well  you can see what   s happened to the poor bugger .         yes  but do you have any evidence of collusion .      trev went blank and nutt supplied in a whisper     can you prove it was a set up .         can anyone .     said the referee  looking around the players .  no one could .  trev wondered how many might  were it not for the fact that andy was standing there  innocent as a shark .     i am the referee  gentlemen  and i can only referee what i see and i saw nothing .         yes  because they made sure of that     said trev .     anyway  listen to the crowd .  they all saw it .         look .  they   ve got boots on them that could strip bark     ridcully protested .      yes  indeed  mustrum  i mean  sorry  captain  but as yet there are no rules about which boots should be worn and at the very least these are the boots that have been traditionally worn for the game of foot the ball .         but they are man traps .         i can certainly see what you are getting at  but what would you like me to do .     said henry .     i have a suspicion that if i cancel this match at this point you and i would not get out of here alive  because even if we ourselves did escape the wrath of the crowd  we would by no means escape the wrath of vetinari .  the game will continue .  unseen academicals can play a substitute and i will  let me see       he pulled out a notebook .     ah  yes  i will award a free kick at the very point where this unfortunate incident took place .  and may i add that i will look askance at any future    incidents    .  mister hoggett  i trust that you will make this clear to your team .         blow that for a game of soldiers .     trev yelled .     they just took out our best player an    you   re gonna let    em walk away grinning .      but the referee was  after all  the former dean .  a man used to head to head confrontations with mustrum ridcully .  he gave trev a chilly look and turned very deliberately to the archchancellor and said     and i trust you  too  captain  will impress upon your team that my decisions are final .  there will be a five minute interlude for you to do this and can some of you fellows take poor professor macarona off the field and see if you can find some quack to look at him .      a voice behind him bellowed     you have one right here  sir .     they turned .  a figure slightly larger than life  wearing a top hat and carrying a small bag  nodded at them .      doctor lawn     said ridcully .     i wouldn   t have expected to see you here .         really .     said the doctor .     wouldn   t have missed it for the world .  now some of you men drag him over to that corner and i   ll take a look at him .  i   ll send my bill to you  shall i  mustrum .         wouldn   t you like to take him somewhere nice and quiet .     said the referee .      no fear .  i want to keep my eye on the play .         they   re gettin    away with it     said trev  as he walked back to the line .     everyone knows they   re gettin    away with it .         we still have the rest of the team  mister trev     said nutt  lacing up his boots .  he had  of course  made them himself .  they looked like foot gloves .     and me of course  i am the first substitute .  i promise that i will do my best  mister trev .        thus far  it had been a rather boring afternoon for the librarian after his one little moment in the sun .  it really was rather dull between the goal posts and he was getting hungry and so was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of a large banana in front of the goal .  it was later agreed that  in a footballing context  mysteriously appearing fruit should have been greeted with a certain amount of caution .  but he was hungry  it was a banana and the metaphysics were sound .  he ate it .   glenda  up in the stand  wondered if she was the only one to have seen the startlingly yellow fruit in its trajectory and then saw  looking up at her from the crowd  with a big grin on her face  mrs atkinson  mother of tosher  himself something of an unguided weapon .  anyone who had ever been in the shove knew her as a perpetrator of all kinds of inventive assaults .  she had always got away with it because no one in the shove would hit an old lady  especially one standing next to tosher .      excuse me     said glenda  standing up .     i   ve got to get down there right now .         not a chance  love     said pepe .     it   s shoulder to shoulder .  a shove and a half .         look after juliet     said glenda .  she leaned forward and tapped on the shoulder of the nearest man .     i   ve got to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible .  mind if i jump .      he looked past her at the glittering figure of juliet and said     not at all  if you get your girlfriend to give me a big kiss .         no  but i   ll give you one .         er  don   t trouble yourself  miss  but come on then  give me your hand .      it was a reasonably fast descent  as she was passed from hand to hand  accompanied by ribaldry  much genial horseplay and a definite feeling of satisfaction on glenda   s part that she was wearing her biggest and most impenetrable pants .    elbowing and kicking people out of the way  she reached the goal just as the banana was consumed in one gulp and stood panting helplessly in front of the librarian .  he gave her a wide smile  looked thoughtful for a moment and went over backwards .   high up in the stand  lady margolotta turned to vetinari .     is that part of the game .         i fear not     he said .   ladyship yawned .     well  it relieves the boredom  at least .  they   ve spent far more time arguing than playing .      vetinari smiled .     yes  madam .  it does look as if football is very much like diplomacy  short periods of fighting followed by long periods of negotiation .      glenda prodded the librarian .     hello .  are you all right .     all she could hear was a gurgling .  she cupped her hands     man   er  someone down  here .      to another chorus of boos  and  because this was ankh morpork  cheers  the travelling committee  which was what the game had now become  hastened over to the unseen academicals    goal .      someone threw a banana and i saw who did it and i think it   s poisoned     said glenda  all in one breath .      he   s breathing very heavily     said ridcully .  the comment was unnecessary as the snores were making the goal rattle .   he crouched down and put his ear to the librarian   s chest .     i don   t think he   s been poisoned     he said .      why   s that  archchancellor .     said ponder .      because if anyone has poisoned our librarian     said ridcully     then  although i am not  by nature  a vindictive man  i will see to it that this university hunts down the poisoner by every thaumic  mystic and occult means available and makes the rest of their life not only as horrible as they can imagine it  but as horrible as i can imagine it .  and you can depend on it  gentlemen  that i have already started work on it .      ponder looked around until he saw rincewind .     professor rincewind .  you were  i mean you are  his friend  can   t you stick your fingers down his throat or something .         well  no     said rincewind .     i am very attached to my fingers and i like to think of them as attached to me .      the noise of the crowd was getting louder .  they were here to see football  not a debate .      but doctor lawn is still here     rincewind volunteered .     he makes a living out of sticking his hand in things .  he   s got the knack .         ah  yes     said the referee .     perhaps we can impose upon him to take another patient .     he turned to ridcully .     you must play your other substitute .         that would be trevor likely     said the archchancellor .      no .     blurted out trev .     i promised my ol    mum .         i thought you were part of the team .     said ridcully .      well  yes  sir  sort of   helpin    out and all that   i promised my ol    mum  sir  after dad died .  i know i was down on the list  but who would have thought it would have turned out like this .      ridcully stared at the sky .     well  it seems to me  gentlemen  that we cannot ask a man to break a promise made to an old mum .  that would be a crime more heinous than murder .  we will have to play with ten men .  it appears that we will have to go without .        up in his ramshackle box  the editor of the times picked up his notebook and said     i   m going down there .  it   s ridiculous to sit up here like this .         you   re going on the pitch  sir .         yes .  at least that way i can see what   s happening .         i don   t think the referee will allow that  sir .           you   re not going to play  trev .     said glenda .      i told you .  how many times do i need to tell people .  i promised my ol    mum .         but you are part of the team  trev .         i promised my ol    mum .         yes  but i am sure she   d understand .         that   s easy for you to say .  we   ll never know  will we .         not necessarily     said a voice cheerfully .      oh  hello  doctor hix     said glenda .      i couldn   t help overhearing your conversation  and if mister likely could tell me where his mother is buried  and the referee was to give us a little leeway in regard to time  well it could be possible that i           don   t you put a shovel anywhere near my ol    mum .     trev screamed  tears rolling down his face .      i   m sure we all understand  trev     said glenda .     it   s always difficult with old mums     and she added  not really thinking what she was saying     and i think juliet will understand .      she took him by the hand and towed him off the pitch .  trev had been right .  it was all going wrong .  the buoyant certainties of the beginning of the game were fading .      you gave away a goal  sir     said ponder as he and ridcully lined up for the next encounter .      i have great faith in mister nutt in goal     said ridcully .     and i   ll show them what happens to people who try to poison a wizard .      the whistle blew .      get down and give me twenty .  i   m sorry  gentlemen  i don   t quite know why i said that          what happens to people who try to poison a wizard  at least in the short run  is that they have an advantage in a game of football .  the absence of professor macarona was a deadly blow .  he had been the pillar around which the university strategy had been built .  emboldened  united went for the kill .   even so  the editor of the times thought  as he lay down at the very edge of the pitch alongside his iconographer  the wizards were just about managing to hold their own .  he scribbled as fast as he could  trying hard to ignore the gentle shower of pie wrappings  banana skins  empty greasy pea bags and the occasional beer bottle being tossed on to the pitch .  and who is that with the ball now .  he glanced at the little crib sheet of numbers he had managed to jot down .  ah  right .  united had broken into the uu side of the field and there was andy shank  an unpleasant man by all accounts and   surely that wasn   t a normal footballing procedure .  other players had lined up around him .  so he was running in the middle of a group of bodyguards .  even the other team members themselves did not seem to know what was going on  but mr shack nevertheless managed a creditable strike at the goal  which was expertly snatched out of the air by   mister nutt .  he glanced at his crib sheet  ah yes  the orc  and added in his notebook     who is clearly adept at grasping big round objects    .  but then he felt ashamed and crossed it out .  despite where we are lying  he said to himself  we are not the gutter press .     the orc .   nutt danced back and forth outside his goal  trying to find someone who looked in a position to be able to do something with a ball .      can   t hang around all day  orc     said andy  staying in front of him .     got to let it go soon  orc .  not much help for you now  is there  orc .  they say you   ve got claws .  show us your claws  orc .  that will bust your ball .         i believe that you are a man with unresolved issues  sir .         what .      nutt dropkicked the ball over andy   s head and somewhere in the mob that fought for it there was a crunch  which was followed by a yell  which was followed by the whistle and the whistle was followed by the chant .  it began somewhere in the region of mrs atkinson  but spread oh so quickly     orc .  orc .  orc .  orc .  orc .  orc .  orc .      ridcully got to his feet  standing unsteadily .     the buggers have got me  henry     he yelled  in a voice that could hardly be heard over the chant .     kneecap .  bloody kneecap .         who did it .     the referee demanded .      how should i know .  it   s a bloody mess  just like the old game .  and can   t you get them to stop that bloody chant .  that   s not the sort of thing we want to hear .      archchancellor henry raised his megaphone .     mister hoggett .      the captain of united pushed his way through the rabble  looking very sheepish .      can   t you control your fans .      hoggett shrugged .     sorry about that  sir  but what can you do .      henry looked around the hippo .  what could anyone do .  it was the mob .  the shove .  no one was in charge .  it hadn   t an arse to kick  a wrist to be slapped or even an address .  it was just there and it was shouting because everybody else was .      well  then can you at least control your team .     he said .  to his surprise mr hoggett looked down .      not entirely  sir .  sorry about that  sir  it   s how things are .         one more incident of this kind and i will cancel the match .  i suggest you leave the field of play  mustrum .  who is the substitute captain .         me .     said ridcully     but under the circumstances i appoint mister nobbs as my deputy .         not nobby nobbs .     exclaimed the former dean .      no relation     said bledlow nobbs very quickly .      well  that was a good choice at least     said trev  sighing .     nobbsy is a clogger at heart .         but it   s not supposed to be about clogging     said glenda .     and you know what .     she added  raising her voice against the steel roar of the crowd .     whatever the old dean thinks he can   t stop the game  now .  this place would just blow up .         you think so .     said trev .      listen     said glenda .     yes  i think you   re right .  you ought to get out of here .         me .  not a chance .         but you could make yourself useful and get juliet out .  get her as far as vimesy and his lot .  i bet they   re waiting right outside the gates .  do it right now while you can still get down the steps .  won   t get a chance once they start to play again .      as he left  glenda walked unheeded down the touchline  to the little area where dr lawn was standing guard over his patients .      you know that little bag you brought with you  sir .         yes .         i think you   re going to need a bigger bag .  how   s professor macarona .      the professor was lying on his back  staring at the sky and wearing an expression of bland happiness .     sorted him out easily enough     said the doctor .     he won   t be playing again any time soon .  i   ve given him a little something to make him happy .  correction  i have given him a big something to make him happy .         and the librarian .         well  i got a couple of lads to help me turn him upside down and he   s been throwing up a lot .  he   s still pretty groggy  but i don   t think it   s too bad .  he   s as sick as a parrot .          this wasn   t how it was supposed to go  you know     said glenda out of a feeling that she should defend the bloody mess .      it generally isn   t     said the doctor .   they turned as the noise of the nearby crowd changed .  juliet was coming down the steps glittering .  the silence followed her like a lovesick dog .  so did pepe and the reassuring bulk of madame sharn  who might be a useful barricade in case the hippo became a cauldron .  trev  tagging along behind them  seemed like an afterthought in comparison .      all right  dear  what   s this all about .     said pepe .      i ain   t going     said juliet     not while trev   s in here .  i ain   t leaving without trev .  pepe says he   s going to win the match .         what have you been saying .     said glenda .      he   ll win     said pepe  winking .     he   s got a star in his hand .  you want to see him do it  missy .         what are you playin    at .     said trev  angrily .      oh  i   m a bit of a conjurer  me .  or maybe a fairy godmother .     pepe gestured around the arena .     see that lot .  their ancestors screamed to see men killing one another and beasts tearing decent folks apart .  men with spears fighting men with nets and all that kind of ugly shite .         and they have cart tail sales here every other sunday     added glenda .      it   s always been the same     said pepe .     it   s one big creature .  never dies .  crying and screaming and loving and hating all down the generations and you can   t tame it and you can   t stop it .  just for you  young lady  and for the soul of mister trev  i   m going to throw it a bone .  won   t take a mo    .      his slim and slightly spidery form disappeared back up the steps just as the whistle blew .  glenda made out bledlow nobbs taking the kick  but ridcully had made the mistake of thinking that a man who was as big as he was was as clever as he was .  and there it was  it was the old game all over again .  united were stampeding down the pitch  the old cloggers making way for andy   s army as they bore down against nutt .  the kick took him in the chest and lifted him into the back of the goal .  the whistle blew and was followed by     don   t touch that  boyo .  you don   t know where it   s been .     which was followed by     i really am very sorry about that  i don   t know why it happens     which was followed by   absolute silence .   which was broken by one voice     likely .  likely .  likely .     it started up in the stand  somewhere near where pepe had gone .   the beast had forgotten the name    orc     but certainly remembered the name    likely     a name that had fed it so often  a name it had given birth to and eaten  a name that was football  the very heart of the beast .  and here  on this broken field  it was a name to conjure with .     likely .  likely .  likely .     hardly a grown man hadn   t seen him .  he was the legend .  even after all these years  it was a name that cut through other loyalties .  you told your grandchildren about him .  you told them how he lay there bleeding and maybe how you dipped your handkerchief in his blood and kept it for a souvenir .      likely     intoned the baritone of madame sharn .      likely     whispered glenda and then    likely .     she could see the little figure running along the top of the stands  the chant tailing after it .   tears streamed down trev   s face .  mercilessly  glenda looked him in the eye .     likely .  likely .         but my ol    mum .     trev wept .   then juliet leaned over and kissed him and for a moment  the tears were silver .     likely .      trev stood clutching and unclutching his hands as the chant went on  then he gave a sort of shrug .  then he took his battered tin can out of his jacket pocket and handed it to glenda  before turning to face the pitch again .     i   m sorry  mum     he said  taking off his jacket     but this is football .  and i don   t even have a jersey .         we thought of that     said glenda .     when they were being made .     she pulled one out of the depths of her bag .      number four .  that was my dad   s number .         yes     said glenda .     we know .  listen to    em cheering  trev .      trev looked like someone trying to find an escape clause .     i   ve never even trained with the new football .  you know me  it   s always been the tin can .         it   s a football .  it   s just a football     said nutt .     you   ll get the hang of it in a second .      the former dean strode up .     well  this is all very gratifying with a touch of welcome pathos  ladies and gentlemen  but it is time we continued this football match and i would be very grateful if all non players could stand back behind the touchlines     he said  shouting to make himself heard above the noise of the crowd .   trev left nutt at the goal .     don   t you worry  mister trev     said the orc  grinning .     with me saving and you striking we can   t lose .  they won   t get me the same way a second time .     he lowered his voice and grabbed trev   s shoulder .     when it starts to get hot down this end  run like stink towards the other and i   ll make sure you get the ball .     trev nodded and walked across the turf to the cheers of the crowd .   the editor of the times later reported as follows       at this point  united seemed to feel that they had a working strategy and poured every resource into the university side in a m  l  e that was clearly beyond the referee to control .   the plucky orc custodian had also learned a lesson and two or three times recovered the day with magnificent saves  on one occasion kicking the ball  in our opinion  directly at the head of one of the milling opponents  stunning him and then catching it upon the rebound  dropping it on to the boot and sending it far into the opposing half where trevor likely  son of the famous football hero  ran pell mell towards the goal where mr charlie barton had happily been provided with a chair  a table  a late lunch and two stalwart defenders  whose clear purpose it was to see that none shall pass .   all breathing in the park surely ceased as the young paladin fired off a tremendous shot  which was  alas  out by a few inches and only served to rattle the woodwork and rebounded towards the defenders .  nevertheless  likely tackled like a man possessed and spirits lifted once again as the two defenders got in each other   s way just sufficiently for the boy to once again power the sphere back towards its intended resting place .   your correspondent believes that even the supporters of united joined in the groan as once again this second shot failed to find a slot and this time rebounded almost to the feet of h .  capstick  who lost no time in sending it screaming towards the academicals    end before it could do more harm .   once again  the indefatigable mr nutt warded off a number of attacks while the rather pathetic remnant of the university boys    defence proved that prowess with the magic wand is of little avail if you do not know what your feet are for .   at this point  master of the dark arts dr j .  hix was summarily dismissed from the field after the crowd   s persistent chant of    who   s the bastard in the black .     alerted the referee to his attempts at endeavouring to strike down f .  brisket  one of the notorious brisket boys  with the soul eating dagger of the deadly vampyre spider queen .  which  as it transpired  turned out to be neither magical nor  as it turned out  made of metal  but one of a number of similar items available in boffo   s joke emporium  tenth egg street .  ranting apparently fearful oaths about university statute  dr hix had to be dragged from the field by members of his own team  leaving our spirited magicians in an even more depleted spell of difficulty  probably wishing they had a magic carpet to get them out of there .     at least dr hix   s tirade and attempts to drag the ground with him bought them some time .  glenda ran on to the pitch to a dishevelled and downcast trev .      what happened  trev .     she said .     you had it right there in front of you .  you had it in your hands  well  on your boot  anyway .         it doesn   t do what i want     said trev .      you   re supposed to make it do what you want .  it   s just a football .         yeah  but i   m tryin    to learn with all of this goin    on .         well  at least you nearly did it .  we haven   t lost yet and it   s still only the first half .      when play was resumed  according to the editor of the times       a certain amount of backbone had been retrieved by the men in pointy hats and captain nobbs led a concerted attack in an attempt to further interfere with charlie barton   s lunch  but to the dismay of all  the son of dave likely still appeared to have only a nodding acquaintance with the art of goal scoring and it appeared very much that his only chance of putting one away would be to have the ball wrapped up and sent via the post office .   and then  to the shock of all  the occult gang appeared to prove that they were far better at billiards than football when another of likely   s powerful  but directionless  attempts rebounded again off the goal on to the head of professor rincewind  who was  in fact  running in the opposite direction  and was in the back of the goal before anyone  including charlie  knew where it was .   this got a cheer  but only because the game now appeared  in our opinion  to be a comedy routine .  alas  there was no comedy about the fact that in several parts of the hippo  fights were breaking out between gangs of rival supporters  doubtless inspired by some of the shameful performances on the pitch       as the two sides trooped or hobbled back to their places  the referee called the captains together .     gentlemen  i   m not quite sure what we are doing here  but i am quite certain that it   s not exactly football and i look forward to the inquiry later on .  in the meantime  before anyone else is injured and especially before the crowd start to tear this place apart and eat one another  i will tell you that the next goal scored will be the last one  even though we are still only in the first half .     he looked meaningfully at hoggett and said     i sincerely hope that some players will examine their consciences .  if i may coin a phrase  gentlemen  it   s sudden death either way .  i will give you a few minutes to impress this upon your teams .         i am sorry  sir     said hoggett  looking around     some of my lads are not people i would have chosen  if you get my drift .  i   ll give them a good talking to .         in my opinion that would only work if you were hitting them with a hammer at the same time  mister hoggett .  they are a disgrace .  and do you also understand me  mister nobbs .         i think we   d like to carry on  too .  never say die .         and i would not like to see death here  either  but i suspect that your request for extra time is in the hope that mister likely will learn how to play football  but i fear that will not happen in a month of sundays .         well  yes  sir  but can   t you       hoggett began .      mister hoggett  i have spoken and i am the referee and right now i am the nearest thing to the gods .      i am the nearest thing to the gods .  it came back as an echo .  softer .  brighter .  he looked around     what .  did you chaps say something .     nearest thing to the gods .  there was a sound like gloing .  but the ball was still in his hands  wasn   t it .  he stared at it .  and was it just him  or was there something in the air .  something   in the air   the silveryness of fine winter days .       trev did an embarrassingly jiggly little run on the spot as he waited .  when he looked up  there was andy shank watching him .      your dear old dad must be    aving a fit     said andy cheerfully .      i know you  andy     said trev wearily     i know what you do .  you corner some poor tosser and taunt    im until    e loses    is rag and so    e starts it  doesn   t    e .  i   m not risin    to it  andy .         not risin    to anythin    very much  are you .         not listenin     andy     said trev .      oh  i reckon you are .      trev sighed again .     i   ve been watchin    you .  you and your chums are bloody masters at stickin    the boot in when the ref ain   t lookin    and what    e don   t see    e can   t do nothin    about .      andy lowered his voice .     well  i can do something about you  trev .  you won   t be walking out of this place  i swear it .  you   ll be carried out .      there was the sound of the whistle  followed by the unstoppable    any boy who has not brought his kit will play in his pants .         sudden death     the former dean said and the sides collided  andy emerging with the ball at his feet and his dishonour guard flanking him at either side .   ponder stibbons  in the path of their advance  calculated quite a lot of things very quickly  such as speed  wind direction and the likelihood of being physically trodden into the turf .  he made an effort at any rate  but ended up flat on his back after the collision .  as the editor of the times put it  in this scene of despair  dismay and disarray  one lone defender  nutt  stood in the way of united   s winning goal     there was a roar immediately behind nutt .  he daren   t look round  but someone landed on top of the goal  making it shake  dropped down and indicated by means of one huge and horny thumb that mr nutt   s assistance was no longer required .  there was a green crust around the librarian   s mouth  but this was nothing to the fire in his eyes .   at this point  according to the editor of the times       seemingly nonplussed by the return of the wizards    famous man of the forest  shank essayed another attempt at the winning score  which was stopped one handed by the librarian and effortlessly thrown back into united   s turf .  with everything to play for  it seemed to us that every man on the pitch was chasing the ball as if they were a pack of boys  scuffling in the gutter for the traditional tin can .  however  mr nobbs  who we are assured is no relation  was able to make some space to give the unlucky mr likely another attempt at following in his father   s footsteps  which he failed to do by the width  from our estimation  of about half of one inch and the ball was snatched up by big boy barton who then collapsed  choking  having stuffed  we understand  a considerable amount of pie into his face to keep his hands free .        it shouldn   t be like this     said glenda  and the thought echoed back in her head  it shouldn   t be like this .     trev has to win  it can   t go any other way .     and her voice came back again  could you get echoes in your own head .  they were going to lose  weren   t they .  they were going to lose because andy knew how to break the rules .   the rules .   i am the rules .   she looked around  but apart from the doctor and his groaning or  in ridcully   s case  cursing charges  there was no one near her apart from juliet who was watching the game with her normal  faint smile .      good heavens .  all he needs is to get only one goal     said glenda aloud .   i am the goal  said the quiet voice from nowhere .      did you hear that .     said glenda .      wot .     said juliet .  she turned and glenda could see that she was crying .     trev   s going to lose .      i am the ball .   this time it had come from her pocket  and she pulled out trev   s tin can .     as doctor lawn gave a groan and hurried back up the pitch towards the choking charlie  as the times later put it   she followed him and caught up with mr nobbs .     if you ever want a cup of tea and a piece of cake again in your life  mr nobbs  you kick the ball towards me .  you will know where i am  because i will be screaming and acting silly .  do what i say  okay .      do what she says  okay .  he heard her voice echo .     and what will you do  throw it back .         something like that     said glenda .      and what good is this going to do .         it   s going to win you the match  that   s what .  can you remember rule     .      she left him wondering and then hurried along to mrs whitlow and the cheerleaders who  right now  had nothing to cheer about .     i think we should give the boys a really good display at this time     she suggested .     don   t you agree  juliet .      juliet  who had been dutifully following her said     yes  glenda .      yes  glenda .  and there it was again .  one sentence .  two voices .   mrs whitlow was not the sort of person who would take an instruction from the head of the night kitchen  but glenda leaned forward and said     it   s the archchancellor   s special request .      the resurrection of big boy barton was not an easy job and there were possibly fewer volunteers for putting their fingers down his throat than there had been for the librarian .  and his emptying and cleaning up took a little more time .   as the referee summoned the teams back into position  glenda arrived out of breath and handed him a piece of paper .     what   s this .         it   s the rules  sir  but you will see that i have put a ring around one of them .      he glanced at it  and said dismissively     looks like a lot of nonsense to me .         it   s not  sir  not if you look at it a bit at a time  sir  it   s the rules  sir .      archchancellor henry shrugged and stuffed the paper into his pocket .   for a moment  bledlow nobbs glanced at glenda  defiantly out of place amongst the cheerleaders .  glenda was known to be generous to her friends and she made the best tea in the university .  this wasn   t about football  this was about a hot mug of tea and possibly a doughnut .  he leaned down to nutt .     glenda says i   ve got to remember rule         he said .   nutt   s face brightened .     clever idea and of course it will work .  did she tell you to kick the ball out of the pitch .         yes  that   s right .  are we going to cheat .     said bledlow nobbs .      no .  we are going to stick to the rules .  and the thing about sticking to the rules is that it   s sometimes better than cheating .      nobbs   s chance came soon enough  surprisingly with an obviously misdirected pass from hoggett .  had hoggett been standing very close when they had been talking .  and had he just said    go for it .     it sounded very much like it .  he kicked the ball straight towards the cheerleaders  where glenda snatched it out of the air and pushed it into the folds of mrs whitlow   s skirt .     you haven   t seen this  ladies  you haven   t seen where it is and you   re not moving for anyone  okay .      as the crowd booed and cheered  she pulled the tin can out of her bag and held it up in the air .     ball lost .     she yelled .     substitute ball .     and threw the can directly towards the bledlow  who was quick enough to flick it on to nutt .  before any other player had moved  it landed with a little gloing .  sound on the end of trev likely   s boot       according to the editor of the times       we have been assured that no magic was used on the day of the match and it is not my place to contradict the honourable faculty of unseen university .  all your correspondent will say is that trevor likely kicked the    ball     against all probability  towards the academicals    goal  where he stood  apparently waiting for the stampede of the enraged united squad .  what followed  your correspondent must declare  was not just a goal  but it was a punishment and it was a retribution .  it was writing the name likely  for the second time  in the annals of football history  as trevor  famous son of a famous father  wiped the floor with united  wrung them out and did it all over again .  running .  dodging .  sometimes obligingly kicking the    ball    directly towards a defender who then found it heading off in quite a different direction  which just happened to be where likely was now .  he taunted them .  he played with them .  he caused them to collide with one another as they both went for a ball that  inexplicably  was no longer where they were sure it had been .  and it must have come as a relief to the more steady members of united when he relented and skipped the    ball    over the head of their standby keeper  micky pulford  latterly of the whopping street wanderers  and into the net  where it circled and then returned to land precisely on the tip of likely   s boot .  the silence          spread like warm butter .  glenda was sure she could hear distant birdsong or  possibly  the noise of worms under the turf  but definitely the sound from dr lawn   s impromptu field hospital  the sound of    big boy    barton chucking up again .   and then  where silence had reigned  sound poured like the gush of water from a broken dam .  it was physical and it was complex .  here and there the spectators started chanting .  all the chants of all the teams  united and harmonizing in one perfect moment .   glenda watched in amazement as juliet   it was like the fashion show all over again .  she seemed to light up from the inside  bars of golden light floating away from the micromail .  she started to run towards trev  tearing off her beard  and  glenda could see  gradually rising from the ground as though she was running up a stairway .   it was a strange and wonderful sight  and not even charlie barton  still throwing up  could detract from it .          scuse me     said mister hoggett .     that was a goal  wasn   t it .         yes  mister hoggett  i think it was     said the referee .   hoggett was pushed out of the way by andy shank .     no .  it went to one side .  are you bloody blind  or what .  and it was a tin can .         no  mister shank  it was not .  gentlemen  can you not see what   s happening in front of your faces .  look  everything that happened was perfectly legal under the rules of the game  rule      to be precise .  it   s a fossil  but it is a rule  and i can assure you that no magic was used .  but right now  gentlemen  can you not see the golden lady floating up in the air .         yeah  right  that   s just more weird kids    stuff  just like that goal .         this is football  mister shank  it   s all weird kids    stuff .         so the game is over     said mr hoggett .      yes  mister hoggett  it is .  apart from  and i insist on drawing your attention to it  a beautiful golden lady floating over the pitch .  am i the only one seeing this .      hoggett glanced towards the rising juliet .     yeah  right  very pretty  but we   ve lost  have we .         yes  mister hoggett  you have clearly and emphatically lost .         and  just to be precise     said hoggett     there are no more  like  rules  are there .         no  mister hoggett  you are no longer subject to the rules of football .         thank you for that clarification  your worship  and may i also thank you on behalf of united for the way you handled the trying events of this afternoon .      with this  he turned and punched andy full in the face .  mister hoggett was a mild man  but years of lifting a pig carcass in each hand meant that he had a punch that even andy   s thick skin had to reckon with .  even so  after andy had blinked a few times he managed to say     you bastard .         you lost us the game     said hoggett .     we could have won fair and square  but you had to muck it up .     and those around him felt able to murmur in support of the accusation .      me .  it wasn   t me .  it was that bloody trev likely and his little orc chum .  they was using magic .  you can   t say that wasn   t magic .         just skill  i assure you     said the former dean .     amazing skill  certainly  but he is well known for his prowess with the tin can  which itself is a veritable icon of football .         where is that bloody likely  anyway .      glenda  eyes fixed on the centre of the pitch  said in the voice of someone half hypnotized     he   s rising up in the air as well .         look  you can   t tell me that   s not magic     andy insisted .      no     said glenda .     you know what  i think it   s religion .  can   t you hear .         i can   t hear anything  dear  with all the noise from the crowd     said the former dean .      yes     said glenda .     listen to the crowd .      he did .  it was a roar  a great sky filling roar  old and animal and coming up from the gods knew where  but inside it  travelling like a hidden message  he made out the words .  they swam into focus  if indeed the ear could focus and if he was actually hearing them with his ears .  they might have been coming through his bones         if the striker thinks he scores  or if the keeper cries in shame  they understand not the crowd   s applause  i make  and hear and earn again  for i am the crowd and i am the ball  i am the triumph and the blame  i am the turf  the pies  the all  always and ever  i am the game .   it matters not who won or lost  nothing is the score you made  fame is a petal that curls in the frost  but i will remember how you played .     and it stays there  glenda thought  like sound in a banner .  everybody one part of it .   juliet and trev began to float down  hand in hand  turning gently until they landed lightly on the turf  still kissing .  a sort of reality began to leak back into the arena  and there are some people who  even when hearing the voice of the nightingale  will say    what   s that bloody noise .         cheatin    bastard     said andy and launched himself directly at trev  covering the ground at speed as the boy stood there with a very bemused but happy expression on his face .  he did not notice the hell bent andy until a huge boot kicked him squarely in the groin  so hard that the eyes of all male watchers watered in sympathetic pain .   for the second time in twenty four hours  trev felt the micromail sing as the thousands of links moved and just as quickly settled down again .  it was as if a little breeze had blown up his pants .  apart from that  he hadn   t felt a thing .   andy  on the other hand  had .  he was lying on the ground  bent double  making a sort of whistling noise through his teeth .   someone slapped trev on the back .  it was pepe .      you did put my pants on  didn   t you .  well  obviously not my pants .  you   d have to be suicidal to want to put my pants on .  anyway  i   ve come up with a name for the stuff  i   m going to call it retribushium .  can   t ever say it will be an end to war     cos i can   t imagine anything putting an end to war  but it sends the force back the way it came .  didn   t chafe either  did it .         no     said trev  amazed .      well  it did for him .  my word  though  he   s a game one .  that reminds me  i   ll need a picture of you in them .      andy was rising slowly  elevating himself to the vertical almost by willpower alone .  pepe grinned  and somehow it seemed obvious to trev that anyone who was going to get up and try any threats with pepe grinning at him was more than suicidal .      got a knife  have you  you little squirt .     said andy .      no  andy     said nutt behind him .     no more .  the game is over .  fortune has favoured unseen academicals and i believe the traditional ending is to exchange shirts in an atmosphere of good fellowship .         but not pants     said pepe under his breath .      what do you know about that sort of thing .     growled andy .     you   re a bloody orc .  i know all about you people .  you can tear arms and legs off .  you   re black magic .  i   m not scared of you .     he came at nutt with commendable speed for a man in such pain .   nutt dodged .     i believe there is a peaceful solution to the obvious enmity between us .         you what .  .      pepe and some of the footballers were closing in .  andy had not been making friends .  nutt waved them away .      i   m sure i could help you  andy .  yes  you are right  i am an orc  but doesn   t an orc have eyes .  doesn   t an orc have ears .  doesn   t an orc have arms and legs .         yeah  at the moment     said andy  and leaped .   what happened next happened so fast that trev didn   t see the middle of it .  it started with andy jumping and finished with him sitting on the ground with nutt   s hands clamped around his head  claws out .     let me see now     nutt mused as the man struggled in vain .     twisting the skull with enough force to snap the spine and spinal column should not present much difficulty since it is a non rotating joint .  and  of course  the ear holes and eye sockets allow for extra grip in the manner of a bowling ball     he added happily .   there was a horrified hush as he continued .     using the unit of measurement of force invented by sir rosewood bunn  i should think that a mere     bunns should do the trick .  but  of course  and possibly surprisingly  it is the tearing of the skin  tendons and muscles that would present me with some difficulty .  you are a young man and the tensile strength would be quite high .  i imagine the skin alone would require a force of about a thousand bunns .      andy yelped as his head was gently twisted .      oh  i say .  look here now .     said ridcully .     a joke is a joke and all that  but           from then on it gets rather messy     said nutt .     muscle would tear off the bones comparatively easily .      andy gave another strangled yelp .      but taking it all in all  i would think a force of between three to five kilobunns should do the trick .     he paused .     just my little joke  andy .  i know you like a laugh .  i would also  i believe  be quite capable of putting one hand down your throat and pulling out your stomach .         go ahead     croaked andy .   and around the arena of the hippo  the beast smelled blood .  after all  it wasn   t just horse racing that had taken place in the hippo over the centuries .  the comparatively small amount of blood that had been shed today was nothing compared with the oceans of the centuries gone by  but the beast knew blood when it smelled it .  the cheering and the chanting now picked up  and the words grew louder and louder as people rose to their feet  orc .  orc .  orc .   nutt stood impassively and then turned to the former dean .     could i please ask everyone else to leave .  this may become messy .         oh  come on .     said trev .     no way .         ah  well     said nutt     maybe just the ladies .         not likely     said glenda .      in that case  would you please be so kind as to lend me your megaphone  referee  and i would be grateful if you would instruct some of the stronger players on the field to restrain mister shank who is  i believe  sadly not in his right mind .      wordlessly it was handed over .  nutt took it as the storm of orc .  orc .  grew louder  walked a little way from the rest of the group and stood there impassively with his arms folded until the taunting stopped out of sheer lack of momentum .  with every eye watching him  he raised the megaphone to his lips and said     gentlemen .  yes  indeed  i am an orc and will always be one .  and may i say that it   s been a privilege to play here today and to see you all .  but i do gather now that being an orc in this city may be seen as something of a problem to some of you .     he paused .     so i would ask you to excuse me if i request that this matter be sorted out between us now .      there was laughter and some jeers from various parts of the ground  but also  it seemed to glenda  the beast was calling upon itself for silence .  in that pin drop silence the thud of the megaphone hitting the ground could be heard in every corner .  then nutt rolled up his sleeves and lowered his voice so that people had to strain to listen .   he said     come on if you think you   re hard enough .      first there was shock and then the silence of disbelief and the whisper of every head turning to every other head and saying     did he really say that .     and then someone high in the stands started to clap  at first slowly and then at an accelerating tempo  as it reached the crowd   s tipping point  when not clapping would be unthinkable .  ceasing to clap was also unthinkable and within a minute the applause was a storm .   nutt turned back to the rest of the team with tears streaming down his face .     do i have worth .     he said to glenda .   she ran towards him and hugged him .     you always did .         then when the match is over there are things we have to do .         but it   s been over for ages     said glenda .      no  it   s not over until the referee blows his whistle .  everyone knows that .         by io he   s right     said ridcully .     go on  dean .  give it the works .      the archchancellor of brazeneck university felt gracious enough to let that one pass .  he put the gigantic whistle to his lips  filled his lungs with air and sent the pea rattling .  despite everything  the shade of evans the striped had the last word     no boy is to fiddle about in the showers .      as the crowd streamed down from the stands  trampling the now sacred turf  ridcully tapped a gloomy mr hoggett on the shoulder and said     it would be my privilege to change shirts with you  sir .     he dropped his hat on the ground  pulled off his shirt and revealed a chest so hairy that it looked like two sleeping lions .  the united shirt he received in return was somewhat of a tight fit  but that was unimportant because  as andy had predicted  the unseen academicals were indeed picked up by the yelling crowd  except for mrs whitlow who fought back  and carried in glory through the city .  it was a triumph .  whether you won or lost  it was still a triumph .        you think it   s all over .       the wizards of unseen university knew how to party .  pepe and madame sharn  were impressed .  however  business was business and they had to think about juliet .     i can   t see her anywhere     said madame .      i think i saw two of her a while ago     said pepe .     these fellows do themselves well   i have never seen such a large cheeseboard .  it almost makes celibacy seem worthwhile .         oh  do you think so .         no .  by the way  have you noticed that very tall wizard giving you the eye  my dear .         that   s professor bengo macarona .  do you think he       madame began .      without a shadow of a doubt  my dear .  i know he   s hurt his legs  but i doubt if that would be a problem .      once again  madame craned to search the crowd for the glittering figure .     i do hope our young model is not getting involved in any hanky panky .         how could she .  she   s totally surrounded by admirers .         it   s still possible .      in fact  juliet and trev were sitting in the darkness of the night kitchen .     i   ll find somethin    to do     said trev .     i   ll go wherever you go .         you ought to stay here and play football     said juliet .     you know what some people said when we were drinking .  they said dave likely was your father .         well  yes  that   s true .         yes     said juliet     but they used to say you were his son .         well  maybe a bit of football     trev conceded     but i don   t think i   ll get away with the tin can again .      they kissed .   there and then  that was all that appeared necessary .   however       glenda and nutt had also wanted to find a place a little out of the way and  if possible  dark .  fortuitously she had pulled out of her pocket a pair of tickets  placed there by dr hix in his attempt to spread darkness and despondency throughout the world by the means of amateur dramatics  to the dolly sisters players    production of starcrossed by hwel the playwright .  they sat hand in hand  watching it solemnly  feeling the ripples move them  then discussed it as they walked back through the city  carefully skirting the chanting bands of happy  drunken supporters .      what did you think .     said nutt  after a while .     about the play  i mean .         i don   t see that it was that romantic     said glenda .     to be honest  i thought it was a bit silly .         it is widely regarded as one of the great romantic plays of the last fifty years     said nutt .      really .  but what type of example are they setting .  first of all  didn   t anyone in genua  even in those days  know how to take a pulse .  is a little first aid knowledge too much to expect .  even a hand mirror would have helped and there are quite a number of respectable places where you can take a pulse .         i think that   s because neither of them were thinking about themselves  perhaps     said nutt .      neither of them was thinking at all     said glenda     and they certainly weren   t thinking about each other as people .  a little common sense and they would be alive .  it   s made up  like books .  i don   t think anyone sensible would act like that .      he squeezed her hand .     sometimes you speak like ladyship     he said     and that reminds me .         reminds you of what .         it   s time for me to meet my maker .        andy shank walked unsteadily among the night time alleys  secure in the knowledge that they contained nothing worse than him  a belief which  as it happened  was in error .      mister shank .         who   s asking .     he said  turning around and reaching instinctively into his coat for his new cutlass .   but another knife  silver and thin  sliced twice and a foot expertly stamped the length of his shin and forced him to the ground .     me .  i   m the happy ending .  you can call me the good fairy .  don   t worry  you   ll be able to see by the time you wipe the blood out of your eyes and  as they say  now you won   t have to pay for a drink in any bar in this town  though i suspect you never have .      his attacker leaned nonchalantly against the wall .      and the reason i am doing this  mister shank  is that i am a bastard .  i am an old bugger .  i am a sod .  they let you get away with it because they were nice people and  you know  the world needs someone like me to set the balance square .  since before you were born i have known people like you .  tormentors  bullies and thieves .  ah yes  thieves .  thieves of other people   s self respect .  thieves of their peace of mind .  now mister nutt  he   s an orc and i   ve heard that he can talk people better .  well  so be it  say i .  if it works  he   s a genius  but that don   t square things  not in my book  so i thought you ought to meet pepe  just to say hello .  if i ever see you again  they   ll never find all the pieces  but just to show that i have a decent streak  here   s something to put on your wounds .      something landed softly near andy   s groping hand .   andy  dripping blood and snot on to the pavement  reached around quickly as the trim little footsteps disappeared  thinking only of getting the blood out of his eyes and revenge and retribution out of his heart .  and in the circumstances  therefore  he should not have wiped the half lemon across his face .       you think it   s all over .       it is a regrettable fact that when two people are dining at a very large and impressive dining table they sit at the opposite ends of the long axis .  this is incredibly stupid and makes conversation difficult and the passing of food impossible  but even lord vetinari and lady margolotta had apparently signed up to the idea .   on the other hand  they both ate very little and so there wasn   t very much to pass .      your secretary seems to be getting on very well with my librarian     said lady margolotta .      yes     observed vetinari .     apparently they are comparing ring binders .  he has invented a new one .         well  for the proper working of the world     said lady margolotta     it is essential that ring binders are important to at least one person .     she put down her glass and looked towards the door .      you seem nervous     said vetinari .     are you wondering how he will come .         he has had a very long day and a remarkably successful one .  and you say he   s gone to an amateur dramatics performance .         yes  with that very forthright young lady who makes the pies     said vetinari .      i see     said lady margolotta .     he must know i am here and he   s gone off with a cook .      there was just a trace of a smile on vetinari   s lips .     not any cook .  a genius amongst cooks .         well  i must admit to being surprised     said her ladyship .      and upset .     said vetinari .     a little jealous  perhaps .         havelock  you go too far .         would you expect otherwise .  besides  you must surely realize that his triumph is yours too .         did i tell you that i   ve seen some of them .     said margolotta after a while .      the orcs .         yes .  they really are wretched .  of course  people say that about the goblins and while it is true that they religiously save their own snot  and  frankly  just about everything else  at least there is a logic to it .         well  a religious logic  at least     murmured vetinari .     they tend to be quite stretchable .         the igors made them from men  did you know .      vetinari  still holding his glass  walked to the other end of the table and picked up the pepperpot .     no .  however  now you tell me  it   s patently obvious .  goblins would not have been nearly ferocious enough .         and they had nothing     said margolotta .     no culture  no legends  no history   he could give them those .         everything they are not  he is     said vetinari  adding     but that   s an enormous weight you   re putting on his shoulders .         how much is on mine .  how much of a weight is on yours .         it   s rather like being a carthorse     said vetinari .     after a while one ceases to notice  it   s just the way of life .         they deserve their chance and it must be taken now  while the world is at peace .         peace .     said vetinari .     ah  yes  defined as a period of time to allow for preparation for the next war .         where did you learn such cynicism  havelock .      vetinari spun around and began his absent minded walk along the length of the table again .     well  mostly from you  madam  though i have to say that the credit is not all yours  since i have had an extended period of further education as tyrant of this city .         i think you allow them too much freedom .         oh  yes  i do .  that   s why i am still tyrant of this city .  the way to retain power  i have always thought  is to ensure the absolute unthinkability of oneself not being there .  i shall help you in any way i can  of course .  there should be no slaves  even slaves to instinct .         one person can make a difference     said margolotta .     look at mister shine who is now diamond king of trolls .  look at yourself .  if men can fall        vetinari gave a sharp laugh .     oh  they can  indeed .            then orcs can rise     said margolotta .     if that is not true then the universe is not true .      there was a velvet like knock at the double doors and drumknott entered .     mister nutt is here  sir .     he added with a certain disdain     and he   s with that   woman  who cooks in the university .      vetinari glanced at margolotta .     yes     he said .     i think we should see him in the main hall .      drumknott coughed .     i think i should tell you  sir  that mister nutt acquired entrance to the building through gates that were securely locked .         did he tear them off their hinges .     asked vetinari with apparent enthusiastic interest .      no  sir  he lifted the gates bodily off their hinges and stacked them neatly against the wall .         ah  then there is still hope for the world .         and the guards .      drumknott glanced for a moment at lady margolotta .     i have taken the precaution of stationing some of them inconspicuously in the great hall gallery with crossbows .         stand them down     said vetinari .      stand them down .     said margolotta .      stand them down     said vetinari again  directly to drumknott .  he extended his arm to her ladyship .     i think the term is  as they put it  alea iacta est .  the die  your ladyship  is cast  and we should both see how it falls .           will you get into trouble for that .     said glenda  staying close to nutt as they walked up the steps .   the main hall of the palace was an intimidating place when empty  because it had been designed for exactly that purpose .      why didn   t you just knock like everyone else .         my dear glenda  i am not like anyone else and neither are you .         then what are you going to do .         i don   t know .  what will ladyship do .  i have no idea  although i am becoming aware of how she thinks and there are a few possibilities i have in mind .      they watched two figures coming down the broad staircase that extended up into the rest of the building .  it had been built to accommodate hundreds  the two people coming down looked uncharacteristically small .      ah  mister nutt     said vetinari as they had almost reached the bottom step     and miss sugarbean .  i must add my congratulations to the pair of you on the wonderful  albeit surprising  success of unseen academicals .         i think you are going to have to make a lot of changes to the rules  sir     said nutt .      such as .     said vetinari .      i think you need assistants for the referee .  his eyes can   t be everywhere     said nutt     and there do need to be some more rules .  although mister hoggett did the honourable thing  i think .         and professor rincewind might make a very capable attacker  if only you could persuade him to take the ball with him     said vetinari .      i would never tell the archchancellor this  my lord  but i think he may be better in a more defensive role .         who would you suggest as an alternative .     said vetinari .      well  charlie  the animated skeleton who works in the department of post mortem communications  did very well in trials .  and  after all     he paused for a moment     yes  after all  none of us can help how we   re made .      they turned at a tap  tap  tapping behind them .  it was lady margolotta   s foot .   nutt gave a little bow .     ladyship .  i trust i find you in adequate health .         and you likewise  nutt     said lady margolotta .   nutt turned to glenda .     what was that term you used once .         in the pink     said glenda .      yes  that   s right  i am deeply in the pink     said nutt .     and it   s mister nutt  if you please  your ladyship .         would the two of you care to join us upstairs for a late supper .     asked vetinari  watching them both very carefully .      no  i don   t think we will impose  but thank you very much .  i have a lot to do .  lady margolotta .         yes .         would you come here  please .      glenda watched the expressions  vetinari   s faint smile  her look of affront  nutt   s confidence .  the rustle of her long  black dress was an audible intoxication as she walked the last few steps towards the orc and stopped .     do i have worth .     asked nutt .      yes  nutt  you do .         thank you     said nutt     but i am learning that worth is something that must be continuously accumulated .  you asked me to be becoming .  have i become .         yes  nutt  you have become .         and what is it you want me to do now .         find the orcs that still live in far uberwald and bring them back out of the dark .         then there are more orcs  like me .     said nutt .      a few dozen  perhaps     said margolotta     but in truth i could hardly say they are like you .  they are a sorry bunch .         is it they who should be sorry .     said nutt .   glenda watched the faces .  amazingly  lady margolotta looked taken aback .      many bad things were done under the evil empire     she said .     the best we can do now is undo them .  will you assist in this endeavour .         in every way that i can     said nutt .      i would like you to teach them civilized behaviour     said ladyship coldly .   he appeared to consider this .     yes  of course  i think that would be quite possible     he said .     and who would you send to teach the humans .      there was a brief outburst of laughter from vetinari  who immediately cupped his hand over his mouth .     oh  i do beg your pardon     he said .      but since it falls to me     continued nutt     then  yes  i shall go into far uberwald .         pastor oats will be very pleased to see you  i   m sure     said margolotta .      he   s still alive .     said nutt .      oh  yes  indeed  he is still quite young after all  and walks with forgiveness at his side .  i think he would feel it very appropriate if you were to join him .  in fact  he has told me on one of his all too infrequent visits that he would be honoured to pass the rate of forgiveness on to you .         nutt doesn   t need forgiveness .     glenda burst out .   nutt smiled and patted her hand .     uberwald is a wild country for a man to travel in     he said     even a holy man .  forgiveness is the name of pastor oats   s double headed battle axe .  for mister oats the crusade against evil is not a metaphor .  forgiveness cut through my chains .  i will gladly carry it .         the kings of the trolls and the dwarfs will give you all the help that they can     said ladyship .   nutt nodded .     but first i have a small favour to ask you  my lord     he said to vetinari .      by all means  ask .         i know the city has a number of golem horses .  i wonder if i could borrow one of them .         be my guest     said the patrician .   nutt turned to glenda .     miss sugarbean .  juliet told me that you secretly want to ride through quirm on a warm summer   s evening  feeling the wind in your hair .  we could leave now .  i have saved money .      all kinds of reasons why she shouldn   t foamed in glenda   s head .  everywhere were responsibilities  commitments and the never ending clamour of wanting .  there were a thousand and one reasons why she should say no .      yes     she said .      in that case  then  we will not take up any more of your valuable time  my lord  my lady  and will head off to the stables .         but       lady margolotta began .      i think all that needs to be said has been     said nutt .     i will  we will  of course  visit you shortly when i have settled my affairs here and i look forward very much to doing so .     he nodded to them and  with glenda walking on air beside him  went back the way they had come .      wasn   t that nice .     said vetinari .     did you see that they held hands all the time .      at the doorway  nutt turned round .     oh  just one more thing .  thank you for not posting archers up in the gallery .  that would have been so   embarrassing .         i shall drink to your success  margolotta     said vetinari as their footsteps died away .     you know  i seriously intended to proposition miss sugarbean to be my cook .     he sighed again .     still  what is a pie to a happy ending .          you think it   s all over .       the following morning ponder stibbons was at work in the high energy magic building when ridcully limped in .  there was a glowing silver band around his knee .     grapeshot   s therapeutic squeezer     he announced .     a simple little spell .  i   ll be right as rain in no time .  mrs whitlow wanted me to put a stocking on it  but i told her that i   m not interested in that sort of thing .         i   m glad to see that you   re in such good spirits  archchancellor     said ponder  working his way down a long calculation .      have you had a chance to see the papers yet this morning  mister stibbons .         no  sir .  what with the football business  i   m a little behind with my work .         it may interest you to know that late last night a seventy foot high chicken broke out of what they are pleased to call the higher energy magic building at brazeneck and is apparently rampaging through pseudopolis while being pursued by most of the faculty  who  i assume  would be quite capable of terrorizing the city all by themselves .  henry has just had a frantic clacks and has had to rush off .         oh  that is very disturbing  sir .         yes  it is  isn   t it .     said ridcully .     apparently it   s laying eggs very fast .         ah  that sounds like a quasi expansion blit phenomenon adapting itself to a living organism     said ponder .  he turned the page  his pencil moving neatly across the column of figures .      the former dean has egg all over his face     said ridcully .      well  i   m sure that professor turnipseed will be able to bring things back under control     said ponder .  the tone of his voice was entirely unchanged .   there was a busy little silence and ridcully said     how long do you think we should give him to get it under control .         what size are the eggs .         eight or nine feet high  apparently     said ridcully .      with calcium shells .         yes  quite thick  so i   m told .      ponder looked thoughtfully at the ceiling .     hmm  that   s not too bad  then .  if you   d said steel it would have been rather worrying .  it sounds very much like a blit devolution  possibly caused by   lack of experience .         i thought you taught mister turnipseed everything you know     said ridcully  looking happier than ponder had seen him in a very long time .      well  sir  perhaps there was something he didn   t quite grasp .  are people at risk .         the wizards have told everyone to stay indoors .         well  sir  i think if i got some of my equipment together we could leave about teatime .         i   ll come  too  of course     said ridcully .  he looked at ponder .     and           what .     said ponder .  he looked at ridcully   s grin .     yes  it might be a good idea if one of the gentlemen from the times came along to take pictures .  they might be very good for instructional purposes .         an extremely good plan  mister stibbons  and i think we should take the senior faculty as well .  they will lend some much needed       he snapped his fingers .     what   s the word .         confusion     said ponder .      no  not that     said ridcully .      appetite .     said ponder .     weight .         something like that   ah  gravitas .  oh  yes  lots of gravitas .  we aren   t the kind of fellows who run around chasing strange birds .  i   ll see you after lunch .  and now i have other matters to deal with .         yes  archchancellor     said ponder .     oh  and  um   what about the proposed football match .         regrettably  it appears that it will have to wait until they have rebuilt the university .         that   s a shame  archchancellor     said ponder .   he carried on with the calculation until the very last figures danced into place  made sure the archchancellor had left  gave a very small smile  which you might not have noticed had you not expected it  and then pulled another ledger towards him .   it was another good day .       it is now .       about the author     terry pratchett   s novels have sold more

ankh morpork is a tyranny  which is not always the same thing as a monarchy  and in fact even the post of tyrant has been somewhat redefined by the incumbent  lord vetinari  as the only form of democracy that works .  everyone is entitled to vote  unless disqualified by reason of age or not being lord vetinari .   and yet it does work .  this has annoyed a number of people who feel  somehow  that it should not  and who want a monarch instead  thus replacing a man who has achieved his position by cunning  a deep understanding of the realities of the human psyche  breathtaking diplomacy  a certain prowess with the stiletto dagger  and  all agree  a mind like a finely balanced circular saw  with a man who has got there by being born .      however  the crown has hung on anyway  as crowns do   on the post office and the royal bank and the mint and  not least  in the sprawling  brawling  squalling consciousness of the city itself .  lots of things live in that darkness .  there are all kinds of darkness  and all kinds of things can be found in them  imprisoned  banished  lost or hidden .  sometimes they escape .  sometimes they simply fall out .  sometimes they just can   t take it any more .           a third proposition  that the city be governed by a choice of respectable members of the community who would promise not to give themselves airs or betray the public trust at every turn  was instantly the subject of music hall jokes all over the city .         that is to say glenda officially sleeps in the old iron bedstead  in reality most of her sleeping is done in a huge and ancient armchair in the night kitchen  where she has very nearly mastered the art of doing without proper sleep altogether .  so many crumbs  spoons  bits of pie dough  books and spilt drinks have gone down the sides of the cushions of that chair that it might well now harbour a small  thriving civilization .         strictly speaking  dr hix  spelled with an x  was the son of mr and mrs hicks  but a man who wears a black robe with nasty symbols on it and has a skull ring would be mad  or let us say even madder  to pass up the chance to have an x in his name .         the egregious professor of grammar and usage would have corrected this to    she was not she     which would have caused the professor of logic to spit out his drink .         employing professional dribblers might seem extravagant for a body like unseen university .  nothing could be further from the truth .  no traditional wizard worth his pointy hat could possibly work by the light of pure  smooth  dare one say virgin undribbled candles .  it would just not look right .  the ambience would be totally shattered .  and when it did happen  the luckless wizard would mess about  as people do  with matchsticks and bent paperclips  to try to get nice little dribbles and channels of wax  as nature intended .  however  this sort of thing never really works and invariably ends with wax all over the carpet and the wizard setting himself on fire .  candle dribbling  it has been decreed  is a job for a dribbler .         originally the explorers    society until lord vetinari forcibly insisted that most of the places    discovered    by the society   s members already had people living in them  who were already trying to sell snakes to the newcomers .         there are those who say that sherry should not be drunk early in the morning .  they are wrong .         in short  every wizard knew that  whatever you did  you   d get some wizards creeping off to do weird and messy magic in some cave somewhere .         hix had flatly refused to wear trousers .  no self disrespecting dark wizard would dream of wearing such common garb as a trouser  he declared .  it totally spoiled the effect .         in fact  juliet   s rising from beneath the cart passed relatively unnoticed by all except an art student who was almost blinded by the light at the spectacle  and many years later painted the picture known as beauty arising from the pease pudding cart attended by cherubs carrying hot dogs and pies .  it was widely regarded as a masterpiece  although no one could ever work out exactly what the hell it was all about .  but it was beautiful and so it was true .         but you   d got another eye  right .  and now you had solid proof that you were a hard man  especially if you got one of those scars that run across the eye and down the cheek .  get a black eye patch  and you would never have to wait to be served at a bar ever again .         dwarfs have a straightforward approach to alcoholic drink  beer  mead  wine  sherry   one large size fits all .         you didn   t get anywhere at unseen university without being able to understand the vast number of meanings that can be carried by the word ook .         this diagram was devised to chart the tendency of wizards  who start out small and pale  to progress through the craft getting bigger and cholerically redder until at last they swell up and explode in a cloud of pomposity .         this may not be true .  wizards tend to think it   s a long time to the next meal  right up until they are consuming it .         it is said that if you want to stand up to someone you should picture them naked .  in the case of mrs whitlow this would be  as ponder stibbons might put it  contra indicated .         contrary to popular belief and hope  people don   t usually come running when they hear a scream .  that   s not how humans work .  humans look at other humans and say     did you hear a scream .     because the first scream might just have been you screaming inside your head  or a horse backfiring .         one other reason that you could call them faces was that crude drawings of them appeared on watch posters  with hopeful messages asking people to let the watch know if said person had been seen around and about .         an archbishop in a house of negotiable affection might have looked a little more puzzled than nutt right now  but the amount of said puzzlement depends on how many archbishops you know .         policemen have a way of pronouncing the word    sir     as if they would really like to spell it    cur    .         i . e .   up to something .         in his seat  the university   s master of the music fumbled for his notebook and wrote down rapidly  macarona unum est .  certes macarona est .  and couldn   t wait to get back to the choir .         this was slightly modified when she realized that none of the spectators had tried any hanky panky whatsoever .         according to fletcher   s avian nausea index  parrot sickness stands at number five in the    wishing yourself dead    index .  the highest level of sickness is that suffered by the great combovered eagle which can vomit over three countries at once .         it is traditional on these occasions for the conquering heroes to spray bottles of champagne on the crowd .  this did not happen .  if a wizard succeeds in getting the cork out of a champagne bottle  he certainly does not intend to pour it away .         who was the same shape as most of the wizards and felt doubly at home .
