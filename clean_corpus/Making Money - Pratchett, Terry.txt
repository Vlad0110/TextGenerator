making money   a novel of discworld     terry pratchett    copyright         by terry and lyn pratchett      chapter       waiting in darkness a bargain sealed  the hanging man golem with a blue dress on  crime and punishment a chance to make real money  the chain of goldish no unkindness to bears  mr .  bent keeps time      they lay in the dark  guarding .  there was no way of measuring the passage of time  nor any inclination to measure it .  there was a time when they had not been here  and there would be a time  presumably  when they would  once more  not be here .  they would be somewhere else .  this time in between was immaterial .   but some had shattered and some  the younger ones  had gone silent .   the weight was increasing .   something must be done .   one of them raised his mind in song .   it was a hard bargain  but hard on whom .  that was the question .  and mr .  blister the lawyer wasn   t getting an answer .  he would have liked an answer .  when parties are interested in unprepossessing land  it might just pay for smaller parties to buy up any neighboring plots  just in case the party of the first part had heard something  possibly at a party .   but it was hard to see what there was to know .   he gave the woman on the other side of his desk a suitable concerned smile .      you understand  miss dearheart  that this area is subject to dwarf mining law .  that means all metals and metal ore are owned by the low king of the dwarfs .  you will have to pay him a considerable royalty on any that you remove .  not that there will be any  i   m bound to say .  it is said to be sand and silt all the way down  and apparently it is a very long way down .      he waited for any kind of reaction from the woman opposite  but she just stared at him .  blue smoke from her cigarette spiraled toward the office ceiling .      then there is the matter of antiquities     said the lawyer  watching as much of her expression as could be seen through the haze .     the low king has decreed that all jewelry  armor  ancient items classified as devices  weaponry  pots  scrolls  bones extracted by you from the land in question will also be subject to a tax or confiscation .      miss dearheart paused as if to compare the litany against an internal list  stubbed out her cigarette  and said     is there any reason to believe that there are any of those things there .         none whatsoever     said the lawyer  with a wry smile .     everyone knows that we are dealing with a barren waste  but the king is insuring against    what everyone knows    being wrong .  it so often is .         he is asking for a lot of money for a very short lease .         which you are willing to pay .  this makes dwarfs nervous  you see .  it   s very unusual for a dwarf to part with land  even for a few years .  i gather he needs the money because of all this koom valley business .         i   m paying the sum demanded .         quite so  quite so .  but i           will he honor the contract .         to the letter .  that at least is certain .  dwarfs are sticklers in such matters .  all you need to do is sign and  regrettably  pay .      miss dearheart reached into her bag and placed a thick sheet of paper on the table .      this is a banker   s note for five thousand dollars  drawn on the royal bank of ankh morpork .      the lawyer smiled .     a name to trust     he said  and added     traditionally  at least .  do sign where i   ve put the crosses  will you .      he watched carefully as she signed  and she got the impression he was holding his breath .      there     she said  pushing the contract across the desk .      perhaps you could assuage my curiosity  madam .     he said .     since the ink is drying on the lease .      miss dearheart looked around the room conspiratorially  as if the heavy old bookcases concealed a multitude of ears .      can you keep a secret  mr .  blister .         oh  indeed  madam .  indeed .      she looked around cautiously .      even so  this should be said quietly     she hissed .   he nodded hopefully  leaned forward  and for the first time in many years felt a woman   s breath in his ear      so can i     she said .   that was nearly three weeks ago         some of the things you could learn up a drainpipe at night were surprising .  for example  people paid attention to small sounds   the click of a window catch  the clink of a lock pick   more than they did to big sounds  like a brick falling into the street or even  for this was  after all  ankh morpork  a scream .   these were loud sounds  which were  therefore  public sounds  which  in turn  meant they were everyone   s problem and  therefore  not mine .  but small sounds were nearby and suggested such things as stealth betrayed  and were  therefore  pressing and personal .   therefore  he tried not to make little noises .   below him  the coach yard of the central post office buzzed like an overturned hive .  they   d got the turntable working really well now .  the overnight coaches were arriving and the new   berwald flyer was gleaming in the lamplight .  everything was going right  which was  to the nighttime climber  why everything was going wrong .   the climber thrust a brick key into soft mortar  shifted his weight  moved his foo     damn pigeon .  it flew up in panic  his other foot slipped  his fingers lost their grip on the drainpipe  and when the world had stopped churning  he was owing the postponement of his meeting with the distant cobbles to his hold on a brick key  which was  let   s face it  nothing more than a long  flat nail with a t piece grip .   and you can   t bluff a wall  he thought .  if you swing  you might get your hand and foot on the pipe  or the key might come out .   oh   kay     he had other keys and a small hammer .  could he knock one in without losing his grip on the other .   above him  the pigeon joined its colleagues on a higher ledge .   the climber thrust the nail into the mortar with as much force as he dared  pulled the hammer out of his pocket  and  as the flyer departed below with clattering and jingling  dealt the nail one massive blow .   it went in .  he dropped the hammer  hoping the sound of its impact would be masked by the general bustle  and grabbed the new hold before it had hit the ground .   oh   kay .  and now i am   stuck .   the pipe was less than three feet away .  fine .  this would work .  move both hands onto the new hold  swing gently  get his left hand around the pipe  and he could drag himself across the gap .  then it would be just     the pigeon was nervous .  for pigeons  it   s the default state of being .  it chose this point to lighten the load .   oh   kay .  correction  two hands were now gripping the suddenly very slippery nail .   damn .   and at this point  because nervousness runs through pigeons faster than a streaker through a convent  a gentle patter began .   there are times when    it does not get any better than this    does not spring to mind .   and then a voice from below said     who   s up there .      thank you  hammer .  they can   t possibly see me  he thought .  people look up from the well lit yard with their night vision in shreds .  but so what .  they know i   m here now .   oh   kay .      all right  it   s a fair cop  guv     he called down .      a thief  eh .     said the voice below .      haven   t touched a thing  guv .  could do with a hand up  guv .         are you thieves    guild .  you   re using their lingo .         not me  guv .  i always use the word guv  guv .      he wasn   t able to look down very easily now  but sounds below indicated that hostlers and off duty coachmen were strolling over .  that was not going to be helpful .  coachmen met most of their thieves out on lonely road  where the highwaymen seldom bothered to ask sissy questions like    your money or your life .     when one was caught  justice and vengeance were happily combined by means of a handy length of lead pipe .   there was a muttering beneath him  and it appeared that a consensus had been reached .      right  mister post office robber     a cheery voice bellowed .     here   s what we   re gonna do  okay .  we   re gonna go into the building  right  and lower you a rope .  can   t say fairer   n that  right .         right  guv .      it had been the wrong kind of cheery .  it had been the cheery of the word pal in    you lookin    at me  pal .     the guild of thieves paid a twenty dollar bounty fee for a nonaccredited thief brought in alive  and there were oh  so many ways of still being alive when you were dragged in and poured out on the floor .   he looked up .  the window of the postmaster general   s apartment was right above him .   oh   kay .   his hands and arms were numb yet painful at the same time .   he heard the rattle of the big freight elevator inside the building  the thud of a hatch being slapped back  the footsteps across the roof  felt the rope hit his arm .      grab it or drop     said a voice  as he flailed to grasp it .     it   s all the same in the long run .     there was laughter in the dark .   the men heaved hard at the rope .  the figure dangled in the air  then kicked out and swung back .  glass shattered  just below the guttering  and the rope came up empty .   the rescue party turned to one another .      all right  you two  front and back doors right now .     said a coachman who was faster on the uptake .     head him off .  go down in the elevator .  the rest of you  we   ll squeeze him out  floor by floor .      as they clattered back down the stairs and ran along the corridor  a man in a dressing gown poked his head out of one of the rooms  stared at them in amazement  and then snapped     who the hell are you lot .  go on  get after him .         oh yeah .  and who are you .     said a hostler  slowing down and glaring at him .      he   s mr .  moist von lipwick  he is .     said a coachman at the back .     he   s the postmaster general .         someone came crashing through the window  landed right between   i mean  nearly landed on me .     shouted the man in the dressing gown .     he ran off down the corridor .  ten dollars a man if you catch him .  and it   s lipwig  actually .      that would have restarted the stampede  but the hostler said  in a suspicious voice     here  say the word guv  will you .         what are you on about .     said the coachman .      he doesn   t half sound like that bloke     said the hostler .     and he   s out of breath .         are you stupid .     said the coachman .     he   s the postmaster .  he   s got a bloody key .  he   s got all the keys .  why the hell would he want to break into his own post office .         i reckon we ought to take a look in that room     said the hostler .      really .  well  i reckon what mr .  lipwig does to get out of breath in his own room is his own affair     said the coachman  giving moist a huge wink .     an    i reckon ten dollars a man is running away from me    cos of you being a tit .  sorry about this  sir     he said to moist     he   s new and he ain   t got no manners .  we will now be leaving you  sir     he added  touching where he thought his forelock was     with further apologies for any inconvenience which may have been caused .  now get cracking  you bastards .      when they were out of sight  moist went back into his room and carefully bolted the door behind him .   well  at least he had some skills .  that slight hint that there was a woman in his room had definitely swung it .  anyway  he was the postmaster general and he did have all the keys .   it was only an hour before dawn .  he   d never get to sleep again .  he might as well arise formally and enhance a reputation for keenness .   they might have shot him right off the wall  he thought  as he sorted out a shirt .  they could have left him to hang there and taken bets on how long it   d be before he lost his grip  that would be the ankh morpork way .  it was just his good luck that they   d decided to give him a righteous smack or two before posting him through the guild   s letter box .  and luck came to those who left a space for it     there was a heavy yet somehow still polite knock on the door .      are you decent  mr .  lipwig .     a voice boomed .   regrettably  yes  thought moist  but said aloud     come in  gladys .      the floorboards creaked and furniture rattled on the other side of the room as gladys entered .   gladys was a golem  a clay man  or  for the sake of not having an argument  a clay woman  nearly seven feet tall .  she   well  with a name like gladys    it    was unthinkable and    he    just didn   t do the job   wore a very large blue dress .   moist shook his head .  the whole silly business had been a matter of etiquette  really .  miss maccalariat  who ruled the post office counters with a rod of steel and lungs of brass  had objected to a male golem cleaning the ladies    privies .  how miss maccalariat had arrived at the conclusion that they were male by nature rather than custom was a fascinating mystery  but there was no profit in arguing with such as her .   and thus  with the addition of one extremely large cotton print dress  a golem became female enough for miss maccalariat .   the odd thing was that gladys was female now  somehow .  it wasn   t just the dress .  she tended to spend time around the counter girls  who seemed to accept her into the sisterhood despite the fact that she weighed half a ton .  they even passed their fashion magazine on to her  although it was hard to imagine what winter skin care tips would mean to someone a thousand years old  with eyes that glowed like holes into a furnace .   and now she was asking him if he was decent .  how would she tell .   she   d brought him a cup of tea and the city edition of the times  still damp from the press .  both were placed  with care  on the table .   and   oh gods  they   d printed his picture .  his actual picture .  him and vetinari and various notables last night  all looking up at the new chandelier .  he   d managed to move slightly so that the picture blurred a little  but it was still the face that looked out at him from the shaving mirror every morning .  all the way to genua there were people who   d been duped  fooled  swindled  and cheated by that face .  the only thing he hadn   t done was hornswoggle  and that was only because he hadn   t found out how to .   okay  he did have the kind of all purpose face that reminded you of lots of other faces  but it was a terrible thing to see it nailed down in print .  some people thought that pictures could steal your soul  but it was liberty that was on moist   s mind .   moist von lipwig  pillar of the community .  hah     something made him look closer .  who was that man behind him .  he seemed to be staring over moist   s shoulder .  fat face  small beard which looked like lord vetinari   s  but whereas the patrician   s was a goatee  the same style on that other man looked like the result of haphazard shaving .  someone from the bank  right .  there   d been so many faces  so many hands to shake  and everyone wanted to get into the picture .  the man looked hypnotized  but having your picture taken often did that to people .  just another guest at just another function     and they   d only used the picture on page one because someone had decided that the main story  which was about another bank going bust and a mob of angry customers trying to hang the manager in the street  did not merit illustration .  did the editor have the common decency to print a picture of that and put a sparkle in everyone   s day .  oh no  it had to be a picture of moist von bloody lipwig .   and the gods  once they   ve got a man against the ropes  can   t resist one more thunderbolt .  there  lower down the front page  was the headline    stamp forger will hang .     they were going to execute owlswick jenkins .  and for what .  for murder .  for being a notorious banker .  no  just for knocking out a few hundred sheets of stamps .  quality work  too  the watch would never have had a case if they hadn   t burst into his attic and found half a dozen sheets of halfpenny reds hanging up to dry .   and moist had testified  right there in the court .  he   d had to .  it was his civic duty .  forging stamps was held to be as bad as forging coins  and he couldn   t dodge .  he was the postmaster general  after all  a respected figure in the community .  he   d have felt a tiny bit better if the man had sworn or glared at him  but he   d just stood in the dock  a little figure with a wispy beard  looking lost and bewildered .   he   d forged halfpenny stamps  he really had .  it broke your heart  it really did .  oh  he   d done higher values too  but what kind of person takes all that trouble for half a penny .  owlswick jenkins was  and now he was in one of the condemned cells down in the tanty  with a few days to ponder on the nature of cruel fate before he was taken out to dance on air .   been there  done that  moist thought .  it all went black   and then i got a whole new life .  but i never thought being an upstanding citizen was going to be this bad .      er   thank you  gladys     he said to the figure looming genteelly over him .      you have an appointment now with lord vetinari     said the golem .      i   m sure i don   t .         there are two guards outside who are sure you do  mr .  lipwig     gladys rumbled .   oh  moist thought .  one of those appointments .      and the time of this appointment would be right now  would it .         yes  mr .  lipwig .      moist grabbed his trousers  and some relic of his decent upbringing made him hesitate .  he looked at the mountain of blue cotton in front of him .      do you mind .     he said .   gladys turned away .   she   s half a ton of clay  moist thought glumly  as he struggled into his clothes .  and insanity is catching .   he finished dressing and hurried down the back stairs and out into the coach yard that had so recently threatened to be his penultimate resting place .  the quirm shuttle was pulling out  but he leaped up beside the coachman  gave the man a nod  and rode in splendor down widdershins broadway until he could jump down outside the palace   s main entrance .   it would be nice  he reflected as he ran up the steps  if his lordship would entertain the idea that an appointment was something made by more than one person .  but he was a tyrant  after all .  they had to have some fun .   drumknott  the patrician   s secretary  was waiting by the door of the oblong office  and quickly ushered him into the seat in front of his lordship   s desk .   after nine seconds of industrious writing  lord vetinari looked up from his paperwork .      ah  mr .  lipwig     he said .     not in your golden suit .         it   s being cleaned  sir .         i trust the day goes well with you .  up until now  that is .      moist looked around  sorting hastily through the post office   s recent little problems .  apart from drumknott  who was standing by his master with an attitude of deferential alertness  they were alone .      look  i can explain     he said .   lord vetinari lifted an eyebrow with the care of one who  having found a piece of caterpillar in his salad  raises the rest of the lettuce .      pray do     he said  leaning back .      we got a bit carried away     said moist .     we were a bit too creative in our thinking .  we encouraged mongooses to breed in the posting boxes to keep down the snakes        lord vetinari said nothing .      er   which  admittedly  we introduced into the letter boxes to reduce the numbers of toads        lord vetinari repeated himself .      er   which  it   s true  staff put in the posting boxes to keep down the snails        lord vetinari remained unvocal .      er   these  i must in fairness point out  got into the boxes of their own accord  in order to eat the glue on the stamps     said moist  aware that he was beginning to burble .      well  at least you were saved the trouble of having to introduce them yourselves     said lord vetinari cheerfully .     as you indicate  this may well have been a case where chilly logic should have been replaced by the common sense of  perhaps  the average chicken .  but that is not the reason i asked you to come here today .         if it   s about the cabbage flavored stamp glue       moist began .   vetinari waved a hand .     an amusing incident     he said     and i believe nobody actually died .         er   the second issue   p stamp .     moist ventured .      the one they call    the lovers    .     said vetinari .     the league of decency did complain to me  yes  but           our artist didn   t realize what he was sketching .  he doesn   t know much about agriculture .  he thought the young couple were sowing seeds .         ahem     said vetinari .     but i understand that the offending affair can only be seen in any detail with quite a large magnifying glass  and so the offense  if such it be  is largely self inflicted .     he gave one of his slightly frightening little smiles .     i understand the few copies in circulation among the stamp collectors are affixed to a plain brown envelope .     he looked at moist   s blank face  and sighed .      tell me  mr .  lipwig  would you like to make some real money .      moist gave this some thought and then said  very carefully     what will happen to me if i say yes .         you will start a new career of challenge and adventure  mr .  lipwig .      moist shifted uneasily .  he didn   t need to look around to know that  by now  someone would be standing by the door .  someone heavily but not grotesquely built  in a cheap black suit  and with absolutely no sense of humor .      and  just for the sake of argument  what will happen if i say no .         you may walk out of that door over there  and the matter will not be raised again .      it was a door in a different wall .  he had not come in by it .      that door over there .     moist stood up and pointed .      indeed so  mr .  lipwig .      moist turned to drumknott .     may i borrow your pencil  mr .  drumknott .  thank you .      he walked over to the door and opened it .  then he cupped one hand to his ear  theatrically  and dropped the pencil .      let   s see how dee        clik .  the pencil bounced and rolled on some quite solid looking floorboards .  moist picked it up and stared at it  and then walked slowly back to his chair .      didn   t there used to be a deep pit full of spikes  down there .     he said .      i can   t imagine why you would think that     said lord vetinari .      i   m sure there was     moist insisted .      can you recall  drumknott  why our mr .  lipwig should think that there used to be a deep pit full of spikes behind that door .     said vetinari .      i can   t imagine why he would think that  my lord     drumknott murmured .      i   m very happy at the post office  you know     said moist  and realized that he sounded defensive .      i   m sure you are .  you make a superb postmaster general     said vetinari .  he turned to drumknott .     now i   ve finished this i   d better deal with the overnights from genua     he said  and carefully folded the letter into an envelope .      yes  my lord     said drumknott .   the tyrant of ankh morpork bent to his work .  moist watched blankly as vetinari took a small but heavy looking box from a desk drawer  removed a stick of black sealing wax from it  and melted a small puddle of the wax onto the envelope with an air of absorption that moist found infuriating .      is that all .     he said .   vetinari looked up and appeared surprised to see him still there .      why  yes  mr .  lipwig .  you may go .     he laid aside the stick of wax and took a black signet ring out of the box .      i mean  there   s not some kind of problem  is there .         no  not at all .  you have become an exemplary citizen  mr .  lipwig     said vetinari  carefully stamping a v into the cooling wax .     you rise each morning at eight  you are at your desk at thirty minutes past .  you have turned the post office from a calamity into a smoothly running machine .  you pay your taxes and a little bird tells me that you are tipped to be next year   s chairman of the merchants    guild .  well done  mr .  lipwig .      moist stood up to leave  but hesitated .      what   s wrong with being chairman of the merchants    guild  then .     he said .   with slow and ostentatious patience  lord vetinari slipped the ring back into its box and the box back into the drawer .     i beg your pardon  mr .  lipwig .         it   s just that you said it as though there was something wrong with it     said moist .      i don   t believe i did     said vetinari  looking up at his secretary .     did i use a derogatory inflection  drumknott .         no  my lord .  you have often remarked that the traders and shopkeepers of the guild are the backbone of the city     said drumknott  handing him a thick file .      i shall get a very nearly gold chain     said moist .      he will get a very nearly gold chain  drumknott     observed vetinari  paying attention to a new letter .      and what   s so bad about that .     moist demanded .   vetinari looked up again with an expression of genuinely contrived puzzlement .      are you quite well  mr .  lipwig .  you appear to have something wrong with your hearing .  now run along  do .  the central post office opens in ten minutes and i   m sure you would wish  as ever  to set a good example to your staff .      when moist had departed  the secretary quietly laid a folder in front of vetinari .   it was labeled  albert spangler moist von lipwig .      thank you  drumknott  but why .     he said .      the death warrant on albert spangler is still extant  my lord     drumknott murmured .      ah .  i understand     said lord vetinari .     you think that i will point out to mr .  lipwig that under his nomme de felonie of albert spangler he could still be hanged .  you think that i might suggest to him that all i would need to do is inform the newspapers of my shock at finding that our honorable mr .  lipwig is none other than the master thief  forger  and confidence trickster who over the years has stolen many hundreds of thousands of dollars  breaking banks and forcing honest businesses into penury .  you think i will threaten to send in some of my most trusted clerks to audit the post office   s accounts and  i am certain  uncover evidence of the most flagrant embezzlement .  do you think that they will find  for example  that the entirety of the post office pension fund has gone missing .  you think i will express to the world my horror at how the wretch lipwig escaped the hangman   s noose with the aid of persons unknown .  do you think  in short  that i will explain to him how easily i can bring a man so low that his former friends will have to kneel down to spit on him .  is that what you assumed  drumknott .      the secretary stared up at the ceiling .  his lips moved for twenty seconds or so  while lord vetinari got on with the paperwork .  then he looked down and said     yes  my lord .  that about covers it  i believe .         ah  but there is more than one way of racking a man  drumknott .         face up or face down  my lord .         thank you  drumknott .  i value your cultivated lack of imagination  as you know .         yes  sir .  thank you  sir .         in fact  drumknott  you get him to build his own rack  and let him turn the screw all by himself .         i   m not sure i   m with you there  my lord .      lord vetinari laid his pen aside .     you have to consider the psychology of the individual  drumknott .  everyone may be considered as a sort of lock  to which there is a key .  i have great hopes for mr .  lipwig in the coming skirmish .  even now  he still has the instincts of a criminal .         how can you tell  my lord .         oh  there are all sorts of little clues  drumknott .  but i think a most persuasive one is that he has just walked off with your pencil .          there were meetings .  there were always meetings .  and they were dull  which is part of the reason they were meetings .  dull likes company .   the post office wasn   t going places anymore .  it had gone to places .  it had arrived at places .  now those places required staff  and staff rosters  and wages  and pensions  and building maintenance  and cleaning staff to come in at night  and collection schedules  and discipline  and investment  and on  and on     moist stared disconsolately at a letter from a ms .  estressa partleigh of the campaign for equal heights .  the post office  apparently  was not employing enough dwarfs .  moist had pointed out  very reasonably  he thought  that one third of the staff were dwarfs .  she had replied that this was not the point .  the point was that since dwarfs were on average two thirds the height of humans  the post office  as a responsible authority  should employ one and one third dwarfs for every human employee .  the post office must reach out to the dwarf community  said ms .  partleigh .   moist picked up the letter between his thumb and forefinger and dropped it on the floor .  it   s reach down  ms .  partleigh  reach down .   there had also been something about core values .   he sighed .  it had come to this .  he was a responsible authority  and people could use terms like    core values    at him with impunity .   nevertheless  moist was prepared to believe that there were people who found a quiet contentment in contemplating columns of figures .  their numbers did not include him .   it had been weeks since he   d last designed a stamp .  and much longer since he   d had that tingle  that buzz  that feeling of flying that meant a scam was cooking gently and he was getting the better of someone who thought they were getting the better of him .   everything was all so   worthy .  and it was stifling .   then he thought about this morning  and smiled .  okay  he   d got stuck  but the shadowy nighttime climbing fraternity reckoned the post office to be particularly challenging .  and he   d talked his way out of the problem .  all in all  it was a win .  for a while there  in between the moments of terror  he   d felt alive and flying .   a heavy tread in the corridor indicated that gladys was on the way with his mid morning tea .  she entered with her head bent down to avoid the lintel and  with the skill of something massive yet possessed of incredible coordination  put the cup and saucer down without a ripple .  she said     lord vetinari   s carriage is waiting outside  sir .      moist was sure there was more treble in gladys   s voice these days .      but i saw him an hour ago .  waiting for what .     he said .      you  sir .     gladys dropped a curtsy  and when a golem drops a curtsy you can hear it .   moist looked out of his window .  a black coach was outside the post office .  the coachman was standing next to it  having a quiet smoke .      does he say i have an appointment .     he said .      the coachman said he was told to wait     said gladys .      ha .      gladys curtsied again before she left .   when the door had shut behind her  moist returned his attention to the pile of paperwork in his in tray .  the top sheaf was headed    minutes of the meeting of the traveling post offices subcommittee     but they looked more like hours .   he picked up the mug of tea .  on it was printed  you don   t have to be mad to work here but it helps .  he stared at it  and then absentmindedly picked up a thick black pen and drew a comma between here and but .  he also crossed out the exclamation mark .  he hated that exclamation mark  hated its manic  desperate cheeriness .  it meant  you don   t have to be mad to work here .  we   ll see to that .   he forced himself to read the minutes  realizing that his eye was skipping whole paragraphs in self defense .   then he started on the district offices    weekly reports .  after that  the accidents and medical committee sprawled its acres of words .   occasionally  moist would glance at the mug .   at twenty nine minutes past eleven the alarm on his desk clock went bing .  moist got up  put his chair under the desk  walked to the door  counted to three  opened it  said    hello  tiddles    as the post office   s antique cat padded in  counted to nineteen as the cat did its circuit of the room  said    good bye  tiddles    as it plodded back into the corridor  shut the door  and went back to his desk .   you just opened the door for an elderly cat who   s lost hold of the concept of walking around things  he told himself  as he rewound the alarm .  you do it every day .  do you think that   s the action of a sane man .  okay  it   s sad to see him standing for hours with his head up against a chair until someone moves it  but now you get up every day to move the chair for him .  this is what honest work does to a person .   yes  but dishonest work nearly got me hanged .  he protested .   so .  hanging only lasts a couple of minutes .  the pension fund committee lasts a lifetime .  it   s all so boring .  you   re trapped in chains of goldish .   moist had ended up near the window .  the coachman was eating a cookie .  when he caught sight of moist  he gave a friendly wave .   moist almost jumped back from the window .  he sat down hurriedly and countersigned fg   requisition forms for fifteen minutes straight .  then he went out into the corridor  which on its far side opened to the big hall  and looked down .   he   d promised to get the big chandeliers back  and now they both hung there  glittering like private star systems .  the big  shiny counter gleamed in its polished splendor .  there was the hum of purposeful and largely efficient activity .   he   d done it .  it all worked .  it was the post office .  and it wasn   t any fun anymore .   he went down into the sorting rooms  he dropped into the postmen   s locker room to have a convivial cup of tar like tea  he wandered around the coach yard and got in the way of people who were trying to do their jobs  and last he plodded back to his office  bowed under the weight of the humdrum .   he just happened to glance out of the window  as anyone might .   the coachman was eating his lunch .  his damn lunch .  he had a little folding chair on the pavement  with his meal on a little folding table .  it was a large pork pie and a bottle of beer .  there was even a white tablecloth .   moist went down the main stairs like a maddened tap dancer and ran out through the big double doors .  in one crowded moment  as he hurried toward the coach  the meal  table  cloth  and chair were stowed in some unnoticeable compartment  and the man was standing by the invitingly open door .      look  what is this about .     moist demanded  panting for breath .     i don   t have all           ah  mr .  lipwig     said lord vetinari   s voice from within     do step inside .  thank you  houseman  mrs .  lavish will be waiting .  hurry up  mr .  lipwig  i am not going to eat you .  i have just had an acceptable cheese sandwich .      what harm can it do to find out .  it   s a question that left bruises down the centuries  even more than    it can   t hurt if i only take one    and    it   s all right if you only do it standing up .      moist climbed into the shadows .  the door clicked behind him  and he turned suddenly .      oh  really     said lord vetinari .     it   s just shut  it isn   t locked  mr .  lipwig .  do compose yourself .     beside him  drumknott sat primly with a large leather satchel on his lap .      what is it you want .     said moist .   lord vetinari raised that eyebrow .     i .  nothing .  what do you want .         what .         well  you got into my coach  mr .  lipwig .         yes  but i was told it was outside .         and if you had been told it was black  would you have found it necessary to do anything about it .  there is the door  mr .  lipwig .         but you   ve been parked out here all morning .         it is a public street  sir     said lord vetinari .     now sit down .  good .      the coach jerked into motion .      you are restless  mr .  lipwig     said vetinari .     you are careless of your safety .  life has lost its flavor  has it not .      moist didn   t reply .      let us talk about angels     said lord vetinari .      oh yes  i know that one     said moist bitterly .     i   ve heard that one .  that   s the one you got me with after i was hanged        vetinari raised an eyebrow .     only mostly hanged  i think you   ll find .  to within an inch of your life .         whatever .  i was hanged .  and the worst part of that was finding out i only got two paragraphs in the tanty bugle .  two paragraphs  may i say  for a life of ingenious  inventive  and strictly nonviolent crime .  i could have been an example to youngsters .  page one got hogged by the dyslectic alphabet killer  and he only managed a and w .         i confess the editor does appear to believe that it is not a proper crime unless someone is found in three alleys at once  but that is the price of a free press .  and it suits us both  does it not  that albert spangler   s passage from this world was   unmemorable .         yes  but i wasn   t expecting an afterlife like this .  i have to do what i   m told for the rest of my life .         correction  your new life .  that is a crude summary  yes     said vetinari .     let me rephrase things  however .  ahead of you  mr .  lipwig  is a life of respectable quiet contentment  of civic dignity  and  of course  in the fullness of time  a pension .  not to mention  of course  the proud goldish chain .      moist winced at this .     and if i don   t do what you say .         hmm .  oh  you misunderstand me  mr .  lipwig .  that is what will happen to you if you decline my offer .  if you accept it  you will survive on your wits against powerful and dangerous enemies  with every day presenting fresh challenges .  someone may even try to kill you .         what .  why .         you annoy people .  a hat goes with the job  incidentally .         and this job makes real money .         nothing but money  mr .  lipwig .  it is  in fact  that of master of the royal mint .         what .  banging out pennies all day .         in short  yes .  but it is traditionally attached to a senior post at the royal bank of ankh morpork  which will occupy most of your attention .  you can make money  as it were  in your spare time .         a banker .  me .         yes  mr .  lipwig .         but i don   t know anything about running a bank .         good .  no preconceived ideas .         i   ve robbed banks .         capital .  just reverse your thinking     said lord vetinari  beaming .     the money should be on the inside .      the coach slowed to a stop .      what is this about .     said moist .     actually about .         when you took over the post office  mr .  lipwig  it was a disgrace .  now it works quite efficiently .  efficiently enough to be boring  in fact .  why  a young man might find himself climbing by night  perhaps  or picking locks for the thrill of it  or even flirting with extreme sneezing .  how are you finding the lock picks  by the way .      it had been a poky little shop in a poky alley  and there had been no one in there but the little old lady who   d sold him the picks .  he still didn   t know exactly why he   d bought them .  they were only geographically illegal  but it gave him a little thrill to know they were in his jacket .  it was sad  like those businessmen who came to work in serious clothes but wore colorful ties in a mad  desperate attempt to show there was a free spirit in there somewhere .   oh gods  i   ve become one of them .  but at least he doesn   t seem to know about the blackjack .      i   m not too bad     he said .      and the blackjack .  you  who have never struck another man .  you clamber on rooftops and pick the locks on your own desks .  you   re like a caged animal  dreaming of the jungle .  i   d like to give you what you long for .  i   d like to throw you to the lions .      moist began to protest  but vetinari held up a hand .      you took our joke of a post office  mr .  lipwig  and made it a solemn undertaking .  but the banks of ankh morpork  sir  are very serious indeed .  they are serious donkeys  mr .  lipwig .  there have been too many failures .  they   re stuck in the mud  they live in the past  they are hypnotized by class and wealth  they think gold is important .         er   isn   t it .         no .  and thief and swindler that you are   pardon me  once were   you know it  deep down .  for you  it was just a way of keeping score     said vetinari .     what does gold know of true worth .  look out of the window and tell me what you see .         um   a small  scruffy dog watching a man taking a piss in an alley     said moist .     sorry  but you chose the wrong time .         had i been taken less literally     said lord vetinari  giving him a look     you would have seen a large  bustling city  full of ingenious people spinning wealth out of the common clay of the world .  they construct  build  carve  bake  cast  mold  forge  and devise strange and inventive crimes .  but they keep their money in old socks .  they trust their socks better than they trust banks .  coinage is in artificially short supply  which is why your postage stamps are now a de facto currency .  our serious banking system is a mess .  a joke  in fact .         it   ll be a bigger joke if you put me in charge     said moist .   vetinari gave him a brief little smile .     will it .     he said .     well  we all need a chuckle sometimes .      the coachman opened the door  and they stepped out .   why temples .  thought moist  as he looked up at the facade of the royal bank of ankh morpork .  why do they always build banks to look like temples  despite the fact that several major religions  a  are canonically against what they do inside and  b  bank there .   he   d looked at it before  of course  but had never really bothered to see it until now .  as temples of money went  this one wasn   t bad .  the architect at least knew how to design a decent column  and also knew when to stop .  he had set his face like flint against any prospect of cherubs  although above the columns was a high minded frieze showing something allegorical involving maidens and urns .  most of the urns and  moist noticed  some of the young women  had birds nesting in them .  an angry pigeon looked down at moist from a stony bosom .   moist had walked past the place many times .  it never looked very busy .  and behind it was the royal mint  which never showed any signs of life at all .   it would be hard to imagine an uglier building that hadn   t won a major architectural award .  the mint was a gaunt brick and stone block  its windows high  small  many  and barred  its doors protected by portcullises  its whole construction saying to the world  don   t even think about it .   up until now moist hadn   t even thought about it .  it was a mint .  that sort of place held you upside down over a bucket and shook you hard before they let you out .  they had guards and doors with spikes .   and vetinari wanted to make him the boss of it .  there was going to have to be a huge razor blade in a stick of cotton candy this big .      tell me  my lord     moist said carefully     what happened to the man who used to occupy the post .         i thought you would ask  so i looked it up .  he died aged ninety  of a schism of the heart .      that didn   t sound too bad  but moist knew enough to probe further .     anyone else died lately .         sir joshua lavish  the chairman of the bank .  he died six months ago in his own bed  aged eighty .         a man can die in some very unpleasant ways in his own bed     moist pointed out .      so i believe     said lord vetinari .     in this case  however  it was in the arms of a young woman called honey after a very large meal of deviled oysters .  how unpleasant that was i suppose we shall never know .         she was his wife .  you said it was his own           he had an apartment in the bank     said lord vetinari .     a traditional perk that was useful when he was       here vetinari paused for a fraction of a second       working late .  mrs .  lavish was not present at the time .         if he was a sir  shouldn   t she be a lady .     said moist .      it is rather characteristic of mrs .  lavish that she does not like being a lady     said lord vetinari smoothly .     and i bow to her wishes .         did he often    work    late .     said moist  carefully quoting .  no lady  eh .  he thought .      with astonishing regularity for his age  i understand     said vetinari .      oh  really .     said moist .     you know  i think i recall the obituary in the times .  but i don   t remember any of that sort of detail .         yes  what is the press coming to  one wonders .      vetinari turned and surveyed the building .      of the two  i prefer the honesty of the mint     he said .     it growls at the world .  the tax gatherers used to have the top two floors  which may help engender a certain worried feeling .  what do you think  mr .  lipwig .         what   s that round thing i always see poking out of the roof .     said moist .     it makes it look like a piggy bank with a big coin stuck in the slot .         oddly enough  it did used to be known as the bad penny     said vetinari .     it is a large treadmill that provides power for the coin stamping and so forth .  powered by prisoners once upon a time  when    community service    wasn   t just a word .  or even two .  it was considered cruel and unusual punishment  however  which does rather suggest a lack of imagination .  shall we go in .         look  sir  what is it you would want me to do .     said moist  as they climbed the marble steps .     i know a bit about banking  but how do i run a mint .      vetinari shrugged .     i have no idea .  people turn handles  i assume .  someone tells them how often  and when to stop .         and why will anyone want to kill me .         i couldn   t say  mr .  lipwig .  but there was at least one attempt on your life when you were innocently delivering letters  so i expect your career in banking will be an exciting one .      they reached the top of the steps .  an elderly man in what might have been the uniform of a general in one of the more unstable kinds of armies held open the door for them .   lord vetinari gestured for moist to enter first .      i   m just going to have a look around  all right .     said moist  stumbling through the doorway .     i really haven   t had time to think about this .         that is understood     said vetinari .      i   m committing myself to nothing by it  right .         nothing     said vetinari .  he strolled to a leather sofa and sat down  beckoning moist to sit beside him .  drumknott  ever attentive  hovered behind them .      the smell of banks is always pleasing  don   t you think .     said vetinari .     a mix of polish and ink and wealth .         and ursery     said moist .      that would be cruelty to bears .  you mean usury  i suspect .  the churches don   t seem to be so much against it these days .  incidentally  only the current chairman of the bank knows my intentions .  to everyone else here today  you are merely carrying out a brief inspection on my behalf .  it is just as well you are not wearing the famous gold suit .      there was a hush in the bank  mostly because the ceiling was so high that sounds were just lost  but partly because people lower their voices in the presence of large sums of money .  red velvet and brass were much in evidence .  there were pictures everywhere  of serious men in frock coats .  sometimes footsteps echoed briefly on the white marble floor and were suddenly swallowed when their owner stepped onto an island of carpet .  and the big desks were covered with sage green leather .  ever since he was small  sage green leather covered desks had been wealth to moist .  red leather .  pah .  that was for parvenus and wannabes .  sage green meant that you   d got there  and that your ancestors got there too .  it should be a little bit worn  for the best effect .   on the wall above the counter a big clock  supported by cherubs  ticked away .  lord vetinari was having an effect on the bank .  staff were nudging one another and pointing with their expressions .   in truth  moist realized  they were not a readily noticeable pair .  nature had blessed him with the ability to be a face in the background  even when he was standing only a few feet away .  he wasn   t ugly  he wasn   t handsome  he was just so forgettable he sometimes surprised himself while shaving .  and vetinari wore black  not a forward color at all  but nevertheless his presence was like a lead weight on a rubber sheet .  it distorted the space around it .  people didn   t immediately see him  but they sensed his presence .   now people were whispering into speaking tubes .  the patrician was here and no one was formally greeting him .  there would be trouble .      how is miss dearheart .     said vetinari  apparently oblivious of the growing stir .      she   s away     said moist bluntly .      ah  the trust has located another buried golem  no doubt .         yes .         still trying to carry out orders given to it thousands of years ago .         probably .  it   s out in the wilderness somewhere .         she is indefatigable     said vetinari happily .     those people are resurrected from darkness to turn the wheels of commerce  for the general good .  just like you  mr .  lipwig .  she is doing the city a great service .  and the golem trust  too .         yes     said moist  letting the whole resurrection thing pass .      but your tone says otherwise .         well       moist knew he was squirming  but squarm anyway .     she   s always rushing off because they   ve traced another golem in some ancient sewer or something           and not rushing off after you  as it were .         and she   s been away for weeks on this one     said moist  ignoring the comment because it was probably accurate     and she won   t tell me what it   s about .  she just says it   s very important .  something new .         i think she   s mining     said vetinari .  he began to tap his cane on the marble  slowly .  it made a ringing sound .     i have heard that golems appear to be mining on dwarf land this side of chimeria  near the coach road .  much to the interest of the dwarfs  i might add .  the king leased the land to the trust and wants to make certain he gets a look at what is dug up .         is she in trouble .         miss dearheart .  no .  knowing her  the king of the dwarfs might be .  she   s a very   composed young lady  i   ve noticed .         hah .  you don   t know the half of it .      moist made a mental note to send adora belle a message as soon as this was over .  the whole situation with golems was heating up once more  what with the guilds complaining about them taking jobs .  she was needed in the city   by the golems  obviously .   he became aware of a subtle noise .  it came from below  and sounded very much like air bubbling through liquid  or maybe water being poured out of a bottle with the familiar blomp blomp sound .      can you hear that .     he said .      yes .         do you know what it is .         the future of economical planning  i understand .     lord vetinari looked if not worried then at least unaccustomedly puzzled .      something must have happened     he said .     mr .  bent is normally oiling his way across the floor within seconds of my entrance .  i hope nothing unamusing has happened to him .      a pair of big elevator doors opened at the far end of the hall  and a man stepped through .  for just a moment  probably unnoticed by anyone who had never had to read faces for a living  he was anxious and upset  but it passed with speed as he adjusted his cuffs and set his face in the warm  benevolent smile of someone who is about to take some money off you .   mr .  bent was in every way smooth and uncreased .  moist had been expecting a traditional banker   s frock coat  but instead there was a very well cut black jacket above pinstripe trousers .  mr .  bent was also silent .  his feet  soundless even on the marble  were unusually large for such a dapper man  but the shoes  black and polished  mirror shiny  were very well made .  perhaps he wanted to show them off  because he walked like a dressage horse  lifting each foot very deliberately off the ground before setting it on the ground again .  apart from that incongruity  mr .  bent had the air about him of one who stands quietly in a cupboard when not in use .      lord vetinari  i am so sorry .     he began .     i   m afraid there was unfinished business        lord vetinari got to his feet .     mr .  mavolio bent  allow me to present mr .  moist von lipwig     he said .     mr .  bent is the chief cashier here .         ah  the inventor of the revolutionary unsecured one penny note .     said bent  extending a thin hand .     such audacity .  i   m very pleased to meet you  mr .  lipwig .         one penny note .     said moist  mystified .  mr .  bent  despite his protestation  did not look pleased at all .      did you not listen to what i was saying .     said vetinari .     your stamps  mr .  lipwig .         a de facto currency     said bent  and light dawned on moist .  well  it was true  he knew it .  he   d meant stamps to be stuck to letters  but people had decided  in their untutored way  that a penny stamp was nothing more than a very light  government guaranteed penny and  moreover  one that you could put on an envelope .  the advertising pages were full of businesses that had sprouted on the back of the beguilingly transferable postage stamps     learn the uttermost secrets of the cosmos .  send   penny stamps for booklet .     a lot of stamps wore out as currency without ever seeing the inside of a posting box .   something in bent   s smile annoyed moist  though .  it was not quite as kind when seen close .      what do you mean by    unsecured    .     he said .      how do you validate its claim to be worth a penny .         er  if you stick it on a letter you get a penny   s worth of travel .     said moist .     i don   t see what you   re getting at           mr .  bent is one of those who believe in the preeminence of gold  mr .  lipwig     said vetinari .     i   m sure you   ll get along exactly like a house on fire .  i shall leave you now  and await your decision with  ah  compound interest .  come  drumknott .  perhaps you will drop in to see me tomorrow  mr .  lipwig .      moist and bent watched them go .  then bent glared at moist .     i suppose i must show you around   sir     he said .      i have a feeling that we haven   t quite hit it off  mr .  bent     said moist .   bent shrugged  an impressive maneuver on that gaunt frame .  it was like watching an ironing board threatening to unfold .      i know nothing to your discredit  mr .  lipwig .  but i believe the chairman and lord vetinari have a dangerous scheme in mind  and you are their cat   s paw  mr .  lipwig  you are their implement .         this would be the new chairman .         that is correct .         i don   t particularly want or intend to be an implement     said moist .      good for you  sir .  but events are eventuating        there was a crash of broken glass from below  and a faint  muffled voice shouted     damn .  there goes the balance of payments .         let   s have that tour  shall we .     said moist brightly .     starting with what that was .         that abomination .     bent gave a little shudder .     i think we should leave that until hubert has cleaned up .  oh  will you look at that .  it really is terrible        mr .  bent strode across the floor until he was under the big  solemn clock .  he glared at it as if it had mortally offended him  and snapped his fingers  but a junior clerk was already hurrying across the floor with a small stepladder .  mr .  bent mounted the steps  opened the clock  and moved the second hand forward by two seconds .  the clock was slammed shut  the steps dismounted  and the accountant returned to moist  adjusting his cuffs .   he looked moist up and down .     it loses almost a minute a week .  am i the only person who finds this offensive .  it would appear so  alas .  let   s start with the gold  shall we .         ooo  yes     said moist .     let   s .          chapter       the promise of gold the men of the sheds  the cost of a penny and the usefulness of widows  overheads underfoot security  the importance thereof  a fascination with transactions a son of many fathers  alleged untrustworthiness in a case of flaming underwear  the panopticon of the world and the blindness of mr .  bent an arch comment         somehow i was expecting something   bigger     said moist  looking through the steel bars into the little room that held the gold .  the metal  in open bags and boxes  gleamed dully in the torchlight .      that is almost ten tons of gold     said bent reproachfully .     it does not have to look big .         but all the ingots and bags put together aren   t much bigger than the desks out there .         it is very heavy  mr .  lipwig .  it is the one true metal  pure and unsullied     said bent .  his left eye twitched .     it is the metal that never fell from grace .         really .     said moist  checking that the door out of there was still open .      and it is also the only basis of a sound financial system     mr .  bent went on  while the torchlight reflected from the bullion and gilded his face .     there is value .  there is worth .  without the anchor of gold  all would be chaos .         why .         who would set the value of the dollar .         our dollars are not pure gold  though  are they .         aha  yes .  gold colored  mr .  lipwig     said bent .     less gold than seawater .  gold ish .  we adulterated our own currency .  infamy .  there can be no greater crime .     his eye twitched again .      er   murder .     moist ventured .  yep  the door was still open .   mr .  bent waved a hand .     murder only happens once     he said     but when the trust in gold breaks down  chaos rules .  but it had to be done .  the abominable coins are  admittedly  only goldish  but they are at least a solid token of true gold in the reserves .  in their wretchedness  they nevertheless acknowledge the primacy of gold and our independence from the machinations of government .  we ourselves have more gold than any other bank in the city  and only i have a key to that door .  and the manager has one too  of course     he added  very much as a grudging and unwelcome afterthought .      i read somewhere that the coins represent a promise to hand over a dollar   s worth of gold     said moist helpfully .   mr .  bent steepled his hands in front of his face and turned his eyes upward  as though praying .      in theory  yes     he said after a few moments .     i would prefer to say that it is a tacit understanding that we will honor our promise to exchange it for a dollar   s worth of gold  provided we are not  in point of fact  asked to .         so   it   s not really a promise .         it certainly is  sir  in financial circles .  it is  you see  about trust .         you mean  trust us  we   ve got a big expensive building .         you jest  mr .  lipwig  but there may be a grain of truth there .     bent sighed .     i can see you have a lot to learn  and at least you   ll have me to teach you .  and now  i think  you would like to see the mint .  people always like to see the mint .  it   s twenty seven minutes and thirty six seconds past one  so they should have finished their lunch hour .          it was a cavern .  moist was pleased about that  at least .  a mint should be lit by flames .   its main hall was three stories high  and picked up some gray daylight from the rows of barred windows .  and  in terms of primary architecture  that was it .  everything else was sheds .   sheds were built onto the walls and even hung like swallows    nests up near the ceiling  accessed by unsafe looking wooden stairs .  the uneven floor itself was a small village of sheds  placed any old how  no two alike  each one carefully roofed against the nonexistent prospect of rain .  wisps of smoke spiraled gently through the thick air .  against one wall a forge glowed  providing the dark orange glow that gave the place the right stygian atmosphere .  the place looked like the after death destination for people who had committed small and rather dull sins .   this was  however  just the background .  what dominated the hall was the bad penny .  the treadmill was   strange .   moist had seen treadmills before .  there had been one in the tanty  wherein inmates could invigorate their cardiovascular systems whether they wanted to or not .  moist had taken a turn or two before he worked out how to play the system .  it had been a brute of a thing  cramped  heavy  and depressing .  the bad penny was much larger but hardly seemed to be there at all .  there was a metal rim that  from here  looked frighteningly thin .  it was hard to see the spokes  until moist realized that there were no spokes  just hundreds of thin wires .      all right  i can see it must work  but       he began  staring up at the huge gearbox .      it works very well  i gather     said bent .     they have a golem to power it when needed .         but surely it should fall to bits .         should it .  i am not in a position to say  sir .  ah  here comes everyone        figures were heading toward them from various sheds and from the door at the far end of the building .  they walked slowly and deliberately and with one purpose  rather like the living dead .   in the end  moist kept thinking of them as the men of the sheds .  they weren   t  all of them  that old  but even the young ones  most of them  appeared to have donned the mantle of middle age very early .  apparently  to get a job in the mint  you had to wait until someone died  it was a case of dead men   s sheds .  illuminating the bright side  however  was the fact that when your prospective vacancy became available you got the job even if you were only slightly less dead than the previous incumbent .   the men of the sheds ran the linishing shed  the milling shed  the finishing shed  the foundry  two sheds   the security  one shed  but quite a big one   and the storage shed  which had a lock moist could have opened with a sneeze .  the other sheds were a mystery  but presumably had been built in case someone needed a shed in a hurry .   the men of the sheds had what passed within the sheds as names  alf  young alf  gobber  boy charlie  king henry   but the one who was  as it were  the designated speaker to the world beyond the sheds  had a whole name .      this is mr .  shady the eighteenth  mr .  lipwig     said bent .     mr .  lipwig is   just visiting .         the eighteenth .     said moist .     there are another seventeen of you .         not anymore  sir     said shady  grinning .      mr .  shady is the hereditary foreman  sir     bent supplied .      hereditary foreman       moist repeated blankly .      that   s right  sir     said shady .     does mr .  lipwig want to know the history  sir .         no     said bent firmly .      yes     said moist  seeing his firmly and raising him an emphatically .      oh it appears that he does     sighed bent .  mr .  shady smiled .   it was a very full history  and took some telling .  at one point moist was sure it was time for an ice age .  words streamed past him like sleet but  like sleet  some stuck .  the post of hereditary foreman had been created hundreds of years before  when the post of master of the mint was a sinecure handed to a drinking pal of the current king or patrician  who used it as a piggy bank and did nothing more than turn up now and again with a big sack  a hangover  and a meaningful look .  the foremanship was instituted because it was dimly realized that someone ought to be in charge and  if possible  sober .      so you actually run it all .     said moist quickly  to stem the flow of really interesting facts about money .      that   s right  sir .  pro tem .  there hasn   t been a master for a hundred years .         so how do you get paid .      there was a moment   s silence  and then mr .  shady said  like a man talking to a child     this is a mint  sir .         you make your own wages .         who else is going to  sir .  but it   s all official  isn   t that right  mr .  bent .  he gets all the dockets .  we cut out the middleman  really .         well  at least you   re in a profitable business     said moist cheerfully .     i mean  you must be making money hand over fist .         we manage to break even sir  yes     said shady  as if it was a close run thing .      break even .  you   re a mint .     said moist .     how can you not make a profit by making money .         overheads  sir .  there   s overheads wherever you look .         even underfoot .         there too  sir     said shady .     it   s ruinous  sir  it really is .  y   see  it costs a ha   penny to make a farthin    an    nearly a penny to make a ha   penny .  a penny comes in at a penny farthin    .  sixpences cost tuppence farthin     so we   re in pocket there .  half a dollar cost seven pence .  and it   s only sixpence to make a dollar  a definite improvement  but that   s    cos we does    em here .  the real buggers are the mites     cos they   re worth half a farthin    but cost sixpence    cos it   s fiddly work  bein    so small and have got that hole in the middle .  the thrupenny bit  sir  we   ve only got a couple of people makin    those  a lot of work which runs out at seven pence .  and don   t ask me about the tupenny piece .         what about the tupenny piece .         i   m glad you asked me that  sir .  fine work  sir  tots up to seven and one one sixteenth pence .  and  yes  there   s one sixteenth of a penny  sir  the elim .         i   ve never heard of it .         well  no  sir  you wouldn   t  a gentleman of class like yourself  but it has its place  sir  it has its place .  nice little thing  sir  lot of tiny detail  made by widow women according to tradition  costs a whole shilling    cos the engraving is so fine .  takes the old girls days to do one  what with their eyesight and everything  but it makes    em feel they   re bein    useful .         but a sixteenth of a penny .  one quarter of a farthing .  what can you buy with that .         you   d be amazed  sir  down some streets .  a candle stub  a small potato that   s only a bit green     said shady .     maybe a apple core that ain   t been entirely et .  and of course it   s handy to drop in the charity box .  it makes a clink .      and gold is the anchor  is it .  moist thought .   he looked around at the huge space .  there were about a dozen people working there  if you included the golem  who moist had learned to think of as part of a species to be treated as    human for a given value of human     and the pimply boy who made the tea  who he hadn   t .      you don   t seem to need many people     he said .      ah  well  we only do the silver and gold           goldish     mr .  bent intervened quickly .         goldish coins here  you see .  and unusual stuff  like medals .  we make the blanks for the copper and brass  but the outworkers do the rest .         outworkers .  a mint with outworkers .         that   s right  sir .  like the widows .  they work at home .  huh  you couldn   t expect the old dears to totter in here  most of    em   d need two sticks to get about .         the mint   that is  the place that makes money   employs people who work at home .  i mean  i know it   s fashionable  but i mean   well  don   t you think it   s odd .         gods bless you  sir  there are families out there who   ve been making a few coppers every evening for generations .     said shady happily .     dad doing the basic punching  mum chasing and finishing  the kids cleanin    and polishin      it   s traditional .  our outworkers are like one big family .         okay  but what about security .         if they steal so much as a farthing they can be hanged     said bent .     it counts as treason  you know .         what kind of families are you used to .     said moist  aghast .      i must point out that no one ever has  though  because they   re very loyal     said the foreman  glaring at bent .      it used to be a hand cut off  for a first offense     said mr .  bent the family man .      do they make a lot of money .     said moist  carefully getting between the two men .     i mean  in terms of wages .         about fifteen dollars a month .  it   s detailed work     said shady .     some of the old ladies don   t get as much .  we get a lot of bad elims .      moist stared up at the bad penny .  it rose up through the central well of the building and looked gossamer frail for something so big .  the lone golem plodding along inside had a slate hanging around its neck  which meant it was one of those that couldn   t talk .  moist wondered if the golem trust knew about it .  they had amazing ways of finding golems .   as he watched  the wheel swung gently to a halt .  the silent golem stood still .      tell me     said moist     why bother with goldish coins .  why not just  well  make the dollars out of gold .         very fast way to lose gold  sir .         did you get a lot of clipping and sweating .         i   m surprised a gentleman like you knows them names  sir     said the foreman  taken aback .      i take a keen interest in the criminal mind     said moist  slightly faster than he   d intended .  it was true .  all you needed was a talent for introspection .      good for you  sir .  oh  yes  we   ve had them tricks and a lot more  oh yes .  i swear we   ve seen    em all .  and painting an    plating an    plugging .  even recasting  sir  adulterated with copper  very neat .  i swear  sir  there are people out there that will spend two days scheming and fiddling to make the amount of money they could earn by honest means in one day .         no .  really .         as i stand here  sir     said shady .     and what kind o    sane mind does that .      well  mine  once upon a time  moist thought .  it was more fun .     i really don   t know     he said .      so the city council said the dollars were to be goldish  mostly navy brass  to tell you the truth     cos it shines up nice .  oh  they still forge  sir  but it   s hard to get right and the watch comes down heavily on    em and at least no one   s nicking the gold     said shady .     is that all  sir .  only we   ve got stuff to finish before our knocking off time  you see  and if we stay late we have to make more money to pay our overtime  and if the lads is a bit tired we ends up earning the money faster   n we can make it  which leads to a bit of what i can only call a conundrum           you mean that if you do overtime you have to do more overtime to pay for it .     said moist  still pondering how illogical logical thinking can be if a big enough committee is doing it .      that   s right  sir     said shady .     and down that road madness lies .         it   s a very short road     said moist  nodding .     but one last thing  if i may .  what do you do about security .      bent coughed .     the mint is impossible to get into from outside the bank once it is locked  mr .  lipwig .  by arrangement with the watch  off duty officers patrol both buildings at night  with some of our own guards .  they wear proper bank uniforms in here  of course  because the watch is so shabby  but they ensure a professional approach  you understand .      well  yes  thought moist  who suspected that his experience of coppers was rather more in depth than that of bent .  the money is probably safe  but i bet you get through a hell of a lot of coffee and pens .      i was thinking about   during the day     he said .  the men of the sheds were watching him with blank stares .      oh  that     said mr .  shady .     we do that ourselves .  we take turns .  boy charlie   s the security this week .  show him your truncheon  charlie .      one of the men pulled a large stick from inside his coat and shyly held it up .      there used to be a badge  too  but it got lost     said shady .     but that doesn   t matter much    cos we all know who he is .  and when we   re leaving  he   s sure to remind us not to steal anything .      silence followed .      well  that seems to cover it nicely     said moist  rubbing his hands together .     thank you  gentlemen .      and they filed away  each man to his shed .      probably very little     said mr .  bent  watching them go .      hmm .     said moist .      you were wondering how much money is walking out with them  i believe .         well  yes .         very little  i think .  they say that after a while the money becomes just   stuff     said the chief cashier  leading the way back into the bank .      it costs more than a penny to make a penny     moist murmured .     is it just me  or is that wrong .         but  you see  once you have made it  a penny keeps on being a penny     said mr .  bent .     that   s the magic of it .         it is .     said moist .     look  it   s a copper disc .  what do you expect it to become .         in the course of a year  just about everything     said mr .  bent smoothly .     it becomes some apples  part of a cart  a pair of shoelaces  some hay  an hour   s occupancy of a theater seat .  it may even become a stamp and send a letter  mr .  lipwig .  it might be spent three hundred times and yet   and this is the good part   it is still one penny  ready and willing to be spent again .  it is not an apple  which will go bad .  its worth is fixed and stable .  it is not consumed .     mr .  bent   s eyes gleamed dangerously  and one of them twitched .     and this is because it is ultimately worth a tiny fraction of the everlasting gold .         but it   s just a lump of metal .  if we used apples instead of coins  you could at least eat the apple     said moist .      yes  but you can only eat it once .  a penny is  as it were  an everlasting apple .         which you can   t eat .  and you can plant an apple tree .         you can use money to make more money     said bent .      yes  but how do you make more gold .  the alchemists can   t  the dwarfs hang on to what they   ve got  the agateans won   t let us have any .  why not go on the silver standard .  they do that in bhangbhangduc .         i imagine they would  being foreign     said bent .     but silver blackens .  gold is the one untarnishable metal .     and once again there was that tic  gold clearly had a tight hold on the man .     incidentally  sir  i of course know that the depraved would clip slivers of metal from a coin  but what is    sweating    .         for the really depraved  i   m sorry to say     said moist .     you have a leather lining in your pocket  you put your gold coins in there  and you  well  you jingle them as often as you can .  the gold dust builds up .  small profits but fairly safe  and some people just can   t help wanting to jingle .         i will treasure the image     said bent gravely .     have you seen enough  mr .  lipwig .         slightly too much for comfort  i think .         then let us go and meet the chairman .          moist followed bent   s jerky walk up two flights of marble stairs and along a corridor .  they halted in front of a pair of dark wooden doors and mr .  bent knocked  not once  but with a sequence of taps that suggested a code .  then he pushed the door open  very carefully .   the chairman   s office was large  and simply furnished with very expensive things .  bronze and brass were much in evidence .  probably the last remaining tree of some rare  exotic species had been hewn to make the chairman   s desk  which was an object of desire and big enough to bury people in .  it gleamed a deep  deep green  and spoke of power and probity .  moist assumed  as a matter of course  that it was lying .   there was a very small dog sitting in a brass in tray  but it was not until bent said    mr .  lipwig  madam chairman    that moist realized that the desk also had a human occupant .  the head of a very small  very elderly  gray haired woman was peering over the top of it at him .  resting on the desk on either side of her  gleaming silver steel in this world of gold colored things  were two loaded crossbows  fixed on little swivels .  the lady   s thin little hands were just drawing back from the stocks .      oh yes  how nice     she trilled .     i am mrs .  lavish .  do take a seat  mr .  lipwig .      he did so  as much out of the current field of the bows as possible  and the dog leaped down from the desk and onto his lap with happy  scrotum crushing enthusiasm .   it was the smallest and ugliest dog moist had ever seen .  it resembled those goldfish with the huge bulging eyes that looked as though they were about to explode .  its nose  on the other hand  looked stoved in .  it wheezed  and its legs were so bandy that it must sometimes trip over its own feet .      that   s mr .  fusspot     said the old woman .     he doesn   t normally take to people  mr .  lipwig .  i am impressed .         hello  mr .  fusspot     said moist .  the dog gave a little yappy bark and then covered moist   s face in all that was best in dog slobber .      he likes you  mr .  lipwig     said mrs .  lavish approvingly .     can you guess at the breed .      moist had grown up with dogs and was pretty good at breeds  but with mr .  fusspot there was no place to start .  he plumped for honesty .      all of them .     he suggested .   mrs .  lavish laughed  and the laugh sounded at least sixty years younger than she was .      quite right .  his mother was a spoon hound  very popular in royal palaces in the olden days .  but she got out one night and there was an awful lot of barking and i fear mr .  fusspot is the son of many fathers  poor thing .      mr .  fusspot turned two soulful eyes on moist  and his expression began to become a little strained .      bent  mr .  fusspot is looking rather uncomfortable     said mrs .  lavish .     please take him for his little walk in the garden  will you .  i really don   t think the young clerks give him enough time .      a brief spell of thundery weather passed across the chief cashier   s face  but he obediently took a red leash from a hook .   the little dog began to growl .   bent also took down a pair of heavy leather gloves and deftly put them on .  as the growling increased  he picked up the dog very carefully and held it under one arm .  without uttering a word  he left the room .      ah  so you are the famous postmaster general     said mrs .  lavish .  the man in the golden suit  no less .  but not this morning  i note .  come here  dear boy .  let me look at you in the light .      moist advanced  and the old lady got awkwardly to her feet by means of a pair of ivory handled walking sticks .  then she dropped one and grabbed moist   s chin .  she stared intently at him  turning his head this way and that .      hmm     she said  stepping back .     it   s as i thought       the remaining walking stick caught moist a whack across the back of the legs  scything him over like a straw .  as he lay stunned on the thick carpet  mrs .  lavish went on  triumphantly     you   re a thief  a trickster  a charlie artful  and an all round bunco artist .  admit it .         i   m not .     moist protested weakly .      liar  too     said mrs .  lavish cheerfully .     and probably an impostor .  oh  don   t waste that innocent look on me .  i said you are a rogue  sir .  i wouldn   t trust you with a bucket of water if my knickers were on fire .      then she prodded moist in the chest  hard .     well  are you going to lie there all day .     she snapped .     get up  man .  i didn   t say i didn   t like you .      head spinning  moist got cautiously to his feet .      give me your hand  mr .  lipwig     said mrs .  lavish .     postmaster general .  you are a work of art .  put it here .         what .  oh       moist grasped the old woman   s hand .  it was like shaking hands with cold parchment .   mrs .  lavish laughed .     ah  yes .  just like the forthright and reassuring grasp of my late husband .  no honest man has a handshake as honest as that .  how in the world has it taken you so long to find the financial sector .      moist looked around .  they were alone  his calves were sore  and there was no fooling some people .  what we have here  he told himself  is a mk .   feisty old lady  turkey neck  embarrassing sense of humor  a gleeful pleasure in mild cruelty  direct way of speaking that flirts with rudeness and  more important  also flirts with flirting .  likes to think she   s    no lady .     game for anything that doesn   t carry the risk of falling over and with a look in her eye that says    i can do what i like  because i am old .  and i have a soft spot for rascals .     old ladies like that were hard to fool  but there was no need to .  he relaxed .  sometimes it was a sheer relief to drop the mask .      i   m not an impostor  at least     he said .     moist von lipwig is my given name .         yes  i can   t imagine that you would have had any choice in the matter     said mrs .  lavish  heading back to her seat .     however  you seem to be fooling all of the people all of the time .  sit down  mr .  lipwig .  i shall not bite .     this last was said with a look that transmitted     but give me half a bottle of gin and five minutes to find my teeth and we shall see .     she indicated a chair next to her .      what .  i thought i was being dismissed .     said moist  playing along .      really .  why .         for being all those things you said .         i didn   t say i thought you were a bad person     said mrs .  lavish .     and mr .  fusspot likes you and he is a remarkably good judge of people .  besides  you   ve done wonders with our post office  just as havelock says .     mrs .  lavish reached down beside her and pulled a large bottle of gin onto the desktop .     a drink  mr .  lipwig .         er   not at this time .      mrs .  lavish sniffed .     i don   t have much time  sir  but fortunately i have a lot of gin .     moist watched her pour a marginally sublethal measure into a tumbler .      do you have a young lady .     she asked  raising the glass .      yes .         does she know what you   re like .         yes .  i keep telling her .         doesn   t believe you  eh .  ah  such is the way of a woman in love     sighed mrs .  lavish .      i don   t think it worries her  actually .  she   s not your average girl .         ah  and she sees your inner self .  or perhaps the carefully constructed inner self you keep around for people to find .  people like you       she paused and went on        people like us always keep at least one inner self for inquisitive visitors  don   t we .      moist didn   t rise to this .  talking to mrs .  lavish was like standing in front of a magic mirror that stripped you to your marrow .  he just said     most of the people she knows are golems .         oh .  great big clay men who are utterly trustworthy and don   t have anything to declare in the trouser department .  what does she see in you  mr .  lipwig .     she prodded him with a finger like a cheese straw .   moist   s mouth dropped open .      a contrast  i trust     said mrs .  lavish  patting him on the arm .     and now havelock has sent you here to tell me how to run my bank .  you may call me topsy .         well  i       tell her how to run her bank .  it hadn   t been put like that .   topsy leaned forward .     i never minded about honey  you know     she said  slightly lowering her voice .     quite a nice girl  but thick as a yard of lard .  she wasn   t the first  either .  not by a long way .  i was joshua   s mistress once myself .         really .     he knew he was going to hear it all  whether he wanted to or not .      oh  yes     said mrs .  lavish .     people understood more then .  it was all quite acceptable .  i used to take tea with his wife once a month to sort out his schedule  and she always said she was glad to have him out from under her feet .  of course  a mistress was expected to be a woman of some accomplishment in those days .     she sighed .     now  of course  the ability to spin upside down around a pole seems to be sufficient .         standards are falling everywhere     said moist .  it was a pretty good bet .  they always were .      banking is really rather similar     said topsy  as though thinking aloud .      pardon .         i mean the mere physical end in view is going to be the same  but style should count for something  don   t you think .  there should be flair .  there should be inventiveness .  there should be an experience rather than a mere function .  havelock says you understand these things .     she gave moist a questioning look .     after all  you have made the post office an almost heroic enterprise  yes .  people set their watches by the arrival of the genua express .  they used to set their calendars .         the clacks still makes a loss     said moist .      a marvelously small one  while enriching the commonality of mankind in all sorts of ways  and i   ve no doubt that havelock   s tax men take their share of that .  you have the gift of enthusing people  mr .  lipwig .         well  i   well  i suppose i do     he managed .     i know if you want to sell the sausage you have to know how to sell the sizzle .         well and good  well and good     said topsy     but i hope you know that however gifted you are as a sizzle salesman  sooner or later you must be able to produce the sausage  hmm .     she gave him a wink which would have got a younger woman jailed .      incidentally     she went on     i recall hearing that the gods led you to the treasure trove that helped you to rebuild the post office .  what really happened .  you can tell topsy .      he probably could  he decided  and noticed that although her hair was indeed thinning and almost white  it still held a pale trace of orange that hinted of more vivid reds in the past .     it was my stashed loot from years of swindling     he said .   mrs .  lavish clapped her hands .     wonderful .  a sausage indeed .  that is so   satisfying .  havelock has always had an instinct for people .  he has plans for the city  you know .         the undertaking     said moist .     yes  i know .         underground streets and new docks and everything     said topsy     and for that a government needs money and money needs banks .  unfortunately  people have rather lost their faith in banks .         why .         because we lost their money  usually .  mostly not on purpose .  we have been badly buffeted in recent years .  the crash of     the crash of     the crash of      although that one was more of a ding .  my late husband was a man who loaned unwisely  so we must carry bad debts and other results of questionable decisions .  now we   re where little old ladies keep their money because they always have done and the nice young clerks are still polite and there   s still a brass bowl by the door for their little dogs to drink out of .  could you do anything about this .  the supply of old ladies is running out  as i   m well aware .         well  er  i may have a few ideas     said moist .     but it   s all still a bit of a shock .  i don   t really understand how banks work .         you   ve never put money in a bank .         not in  no .         how do you think they work .         well  you take rich people   s money and lend it to suitable people at interest  and give as little as possible of the interest back .         yes  and what is a suitable person .         someone who can prove they don   t need the money .         oh  you cynic .  but you have got the general idea .         no poor people  then .         not in banks  mr .  lipwig .  no one with an income under a hundred and fifty dollars a year .  that is why socks and mattresses were invented .  my late husband always said that the only way to make money out of poor people is by keeping them poor .  he was not  in his business life  a very nice man .  do you have any more questions .         how did you become the bank   s chairman .     said moist .      chairman and manager     said topsy proudly .     joshua liked to be in control .      oh  yes  didn   t he just     she added  as if to herself .     and i am now both of them because of a little bit of ancient magic called    being left fifty percent of the shares .            i thought that bit of magic was fifty one percent of the shares     said moist .     couldn   t the other shareholders force        an inner door opened at the far side of the room and a tall woman in white entered  carrying a tray with its contents concealed by a cloth .      it really is time for your medicine  mrs .  lavish     she said .      it does me no good at all  sister .     snapped the old woman .      now  you know the doctor said no more alcohol     said the nurse .  she looked accusingly at moist .     she   s to have no more alcohol     she repeated  on the apparent assumption that he had a few bottles on his person .      well i say no more doctor .     said mrs .  lavish  winking conspiratorially at moist .     my so called stepchildren are paying for this  can you believe it .  they   re out to poison me .  and they tell everyone i   ve gone mad        there was a knock at the door  less a request to enter than a declaration of intent .  mrs .  lavish moved with impressive speed and the bows were already swiveling when the door swung open .   mr .  bent came in  with mr .  fusspot under his arm  still growling .      i said five times  mr .  bent .     mrs .  lavish yelled .     i might have shot mr .  fusspot .  can   t you count .         i do beg your pardon     said bent  placing mr .  fusspot carefully in the in tray .     and i can count .         who   s a little fusspot then .     said mrs .  lavish  as the little dog almost exploded with mad excitement at seeing someone he   d last seen at least ten minutes ago .     has oo been a good boy .  has he been a good boy  mr .  bent .         yes  madam .  excessively .     the venom of a snake ice cream could not have been chillier .     may i return to my duties now .         mr .  bent thinks i don   t know how to run a bank  doesn   t he  mr .  fusspot     mrs .  lavish crooned to the dog .     he   s a silly mr .  bent  isn   t he .  yes  mr .  bent  you may go .      moist recalled an old bhangbhangduc proverb     when old ladies talk maliciously to their dog  that dog is lunch .     it seemed amazingly appropriate at a time like this  and a time like this was not a good time to be around .      well  it   s been nice meeting you  mrs .  lavish     he said  standing up .     i shall   think things over .         has he been to see hubert .     said mrs .  lavish  apparently to the dog .     he must see hubert before he goes .  i think he is a little confused about finance .  take him to see hubert  mr .  bent .  hubert is so good at explaining .         as you wish  madam     said bent  glaring at mr .  fusspot .     i   m certain that having heard hubert explain the flow of money he will no longer be a little confused .  please follow me  mr .  lipwig .      bent was silent as they walked downstairs .  he lifted his oversized feet with care  like a man walking across a floor strewn with pins .      mrs .  lavish is a jolly old stick  isn   t she .     moist ventured .      i believe she is what is known as a    character     sir     said bent somberly .      a bit tiresome at times .         i will not comment  sir .  mrs .  lavish owns fifty one percent of the shares in my bank .      his bank  moist noted .      that   s strange     he said .     she just told me she owned only fifty percent .         and the dog     said bent .     the dog owns one share  a legacy from the late sir joshua  and mrs .  lavish owns the dog .  the late sir joshua had what i understand is called a puckish sense of humor  mr .  lipwig .      and the dog owns a piece of the bank  thought moist .  what a jolly people the lavishes are  indeed .     i can see that you might not find it very funny  mr .  bent     he said .      i am pleased to say i find nothing funny  sir     bent replied as they reached the bottom of the stairs .     i have no sense of humor whatsoever .  none at all .  it has been proven by phrenology .  i have nichtlachen keinwortz syndrome  which for some curious reason is considered a lamentable affliction .  i  on the other hand  consider it a gift .  i am happy to say that i regard the sight of a fat man slipping on a banana skin as nothing more than an unfortunate accident that highlights the need for care in the disposal of household waste .         have you tried       moist began  but bent held up a hand .     please .  i repeat  i do not regard it as a burden .  and may i say it annoys me when people assume it is such .  do not feel impelled to try to make me laugh  sir .  if i had no legs  would you try to make me run .  i am quite happy  thank you .      he paused by another pair of doors  calmed down a little  and gripped the handles .      and now  perhaps  i should take this opportunity to show you where the   may i say serious work is done  mr .  lipwig .  this used to be called the counting house  but i prefer to think of it as       he pulled at the doors  which swung open majestically       my world .      it was impressive .  and the first impression it gave moist was  this is hell on the day they couldn   t find the matches .   he stared at the rows of bent backs  scribbling frantically .  no one looked up .      i will not have abacuses  calculating bones  or other inhuman devices under this roof  mr .  lipwig     said bent  leading the way down the central aisle .     the human brain is capable of infallibility in the world of numbers .  since we invented them  how should it be otherwise .  we are rigorous here  rigorous       in one swift movement bent pulled a sheet of paper from the out tray of the nearest desk  scanned it briefly  and dropped it back again with a little grunt that signified either his approval that the clerk had got things right or his own disappointment that he had not found anything wrong .   the sheet had been crammed with calculations  and surely no mortal could have followed them at a glance .  but moist would not have bet a penny that bent hadn   t accounted for every line .      here in this room we are at the heart of the bank     said the chief cashier proudly .      the heart     said moist blankly .      here we calculate interest and charges and mortgages and costs and   everything  in fact .  and we do not make mistakes .         what  never .         well  hardly ever .  oh  some individuals occasionally make an error     bent conceded with distaste .     fortunately  i check every calculation .  no errors get past me  you may depend upon it .  an error  sir  is worse than a sin  the reason being that a sin is often a matter of opinion or viewpoint or even of timing but an error is a fact and it cries out for correction .  i see you are not sneering  mr .  lipwig .         i   m not .  i mean  no .  i   m not .     said moist .  damn .  he   d forgotten the ancient wisdom  take care  when you are closely observing  that you are not closely observed .      but you are appalled  nevertheless     said bent .     you use words  and i   m told you do it well  but words are soft and can be pummeled into different meanings by a skilled tongue .  numbers are hard .  oh  you can cheat with them but you cannot change their nature .  three is three .  you cannot persuade it to be four  even if you give it a great big kiss .     there was a very faint snigger from somewhere in the hall  but mr .  bent apparently did not notice .     and they are not very forgiving .  we work very hard here  at things that must be done     he said .     and this is where i sit  at the very center        they   d reached the big stepped dais in the center of the room .  as they did so  a skinny woman in a white blouse and long black skirt edged respectfully past them and carefully placed a wad of paper in a tray that was already piled high .  she glanced at mr .  bent  who said     thank you  miss drapes .     he was too busy pointing out the marvels of the dais  on which a semicircular desk of complex design had been mounted  to notice the expression that passed across her pale little face .  but moist did  and read a thousand words  probably written in her diary and never ever shown to anyone .      do you see .     said the chief cashier impatiently .      hmm .     said moist  watching the woman scurry away .      see here  you see .     said bent  sitting down and pointing with what almost seemed like enthusiasm .     by means of these treadles i can move my desk to face anywhere in the room .  it is the panopticon of my little world .  nothing is beyond my eye .     he pedaled furiously and the whole dais began to rumble around on its turntable .     and it can turn at two speeds  too  as you can see  because of this ingenious           i can see that almost nothing is beyond your eye     said moist  as miss drapes sat down .     but i   m sorry to interrupt your work .      bent glanced at the in tray and gave a little shrug .      that pile .  that will not take me long     he said  setting the hand brake and standing up .     besides  i think it important that you see what we are really about at this point  because i must now take you to meet hubert .     he gave a little cough .      hubert is not what you   re about .     moist suggested  and then headed back to the main hall .      i   m sure he means well     said bent  leaving the words hanging in the air like a noose .       out in the hall a dignified hush prevailed .  a few people were at the counters  an old lady watched her little dog drink from the brass bowl inside the door  and any words that were uttered were spoken in a suitably hushed voice .  moist was all for money  it was one of his favorite things  but it didn   t have to be something you mentioned very quietly in case it woke up .  if money talked in here  it whispered .   the chief cashier opened a small and not very grand door behind the stairs and half hidden by some potted plants .      please be careful  the floor is always wet here     he said  and led the way down some wide steps into the grandest cellar moist had ever seen .  fine stone vaulting supported beautifully tiled ceilings  stretching away into the gloom .  there were candles everywhere  and in the middle distance something was sparkling and filling the colonnaded space with a blue white glow .      this was the undercroft of the temple     said bent  leading the way .      are you telling me this place doesn   t just look like a temple .         it was built as a temple  yes  but never used as one .         really .     said moist .     which god .         none  as it turned out .  one of the kings of ankh commanded it to be built about nine hundred years ago     said bent .     i suppose it was a case of speculative building .  that is to say  he had no god in mind .         he hoped one would turn up .         exactly  sir .         like blue tits .     said moist  peering around .     this place was a kind of celestial bird box .      bent sighed .     you express yourself colorfully  mr .  lipwig  but i suppose there is some truth there .  it didn   t work  anyway .  then it got used as storage in case of siege  became an indoor market  and so on  and then jocatello la vice got the place when the city defaulted on a loan .  it is all in the official history .  isn   t the fornication wonderful .      after quite a lengthy pause  moist ventured     is it .         don   t you think so .  there   s more here than anywhere else in the city  i   m told .         really .     said moist  looking around nervously .     er   do you have to come down here at some special time .         well  during banking hours usually  but we let groups in by appointment .         you know     said moist     i think this conversation has somehow got away from me        bent waved vaguely at the ceiling .      i refer to the wonderful vaulting     he said .     the word derives from fornix  meaning    arch .            ah .  yes .  right .     said moist .     you know  i wouldn   t be surprised if not many people knew that .      and then moist saw the glooper  glowing among the arches .       chapter       the glooper a proper hubert  one very big mattress some observations on tourism  gladys makes a sandwich the blind letter office  mrs .  lavish   s posterity an ominous note flight planning  an even more ominous note  and certainly  more ominous than the first note  mr .  lipwig boards the wrong coach      moist had seen glass being bent and blown  and marveled at the skill of the people who did it  marveled as only a man can marvel whose skill is only in bending words .  some of those geniuses had probably worked on this .  but so had their counterparts from the hypothetical other side  glassblowers who had sold their souls to some molten god for the skill to blow glass into spirals and intersecting bottles and shapes that seemed to be quite close but some distance away at the same time .  water gurgled  sloshed  and  yes  glooped along glass tubing .  there was a smell of salt .   bent nudged moist  pointed to an improbable wooden hat stand  and wordlessly handed him a long yellow oilskin coat and a matching rain hat .  he had already donned a similar outfit  and had magically procured an umbrella from somewhere .      it   s the balance of payments     he said  as moist struggled into the coat .     he never gets it right .     there was a crash from somewhere  and water droplets rained down on them .     see .     bent added .      what   s it doing .     said moist .   bent rolled his eyes .     hell knows  heaven suspects     he said .  he raised his voice .     hubert .  we have a visitor .      a distant splashing grew louder and a figure appeared around the edge of the glassware .   rightly or wrongly  hubert is one of those names you put a shape to .  there may well be tall  slim huberts  moist would be the first to agree  but this hubert was shaped like a proper hubert  which is to say  stubby and plump .  he had red hair   unusual  in moist   s experience  in the standard model hubert .  it grew thickly  straight up from his head  like the bristles of a brush  about five inches up  someone had apparently cut it short with the aid of shears and a spirit level .  you could have stood a cup and saucer on it .      a visitor .     said hubert nervously .     wonderful .  we don   t get many down here .         really .     said moist .  hubert wore a long  white coat  with a breast pocket full of pencils .      hubert  this is mr .  lipwig     said bent .     he is here to   learn about us .         i am moist     said moist  stepping forward with his best smile and an extended hand .      oh  i   m sorry .  we should have hung the raincoats nearer the door     said hubert .  he looked at moist   s hand as if it was some interesting device  and then shook it carefully .      you   re not seeing us at our best  mr .  lipwick     he said .      really .     said moist  still smiling .  how does the hair stay up like that  he wondered .  does he use glue  or what .      mr .  lipwig is the postmaster general  hubert     said bent .      is he .  oh .  i don   t get out of the cellar very much these days     said hubert .      really     said moist  his smile now a bit glassy .      no  we   re so close to perfection  you see     said hubert .     i really think we   re nearly there           mister hubert believes that this   device is a sort of crystal ball for showing the future     said bent  and rolled his eyes .      possible futures .  would mr .  lipstick like to see it in operation .     said hubert  vibrating with enthusiasm and eagerness .  only a man with a heart of stone would have said no  so moist made a wonderful attempt at indicating that all his dreams were coming true .      i   d love to     he said     but what does it actually do .      too late  he saw the signs .  hubert grasped the lapels of his jacket  as if addressing a meeting  and swelled with the urge to communicate  or at least talk at length in the belief that it was the same thing .      the glooper  as it is affectionately known  is what i call a quote    analogy machine    unquote .  it solves problems not by considering them as a numerical exercise but by actually duplicating them in a form we can manipulate  in this case  the flow of money and its effects within our society becomes water flowing through a glass matrix  the glooper .  the geometrical shape of certain vessels  the operation of valves  and  although i say so myself  ingenious tipping buckets and flow rate propellers enable the glooper to simulate quite complex transactions .  we can change the starting conditions  too  to learn the rules inherent in the system .  for example  we can find out what happens if you halve the labor force in the city  by the adjustment of a few valves  rather than going out into the streets and killing people .         a big improvement .  bravo .     said moist desperately  and started to clap .   no one joined in .  he shoved his hands in his pockets .      er   perhaps you would like a less  um  dramatic demonstration .     hubert volunteered .   moist nodded .     yes     he said .     show me   show me what happens when people get fed up with banks     he said .      ah  yes  a familiar one .  igor  set up program five .     hubert shouted to some figure in the forest of glassware .  there was the sound of squeaky screws being turned and the glug of reservoirs being topped up .      igor .     said moist .     you have an igor .         oh  yes     said hubert .     that   s how i get this wonderful light .  they know the secret of storing lightning in jars .  but don   t let that worry you  mr .  lipspick .  just because i   m employing an igor and working in a cellar doesn   t mean i am some sort of madman  ha ha ha .         ha ha     agreed moist .      ha hah hah .     said hubert .     hahahahahaha .  .  ahahahahaha hhhhh .  .  .  .  .         bent slapped him on the back .  hubert coughed .     sorry about that  it   s the air down here     he mumbled .      it certainly looks very   complex  this thing of yours     said moist  striking out for normality .      er  yes     said hubert  a little bit thrown .     and we are refining it all the time .  for example  floats coupled to ingenious spring loaded sluice gates elsewhere on the glooper can allow changes in the level in one flask to automatically adjust flows in several other places in the system           what   s that for .     said moist  pointing at random to a round bottle suspended in the tubing .      phase of the moon valve     said hubert promptly .      the moon affects how money moves around .         we don   t know .  it might .  the weather certainly does .         really .         certainly .     hubert beamed .     and we   re adding fresh influences all the time .  indeed  i will not be satisfied until my wonderful machine can completely mimic every last detail of our great city   s economic cycle .     a bell rang  and he went on     thank you  igor .  let it go .      something clanked  and colored waters began to foam and slosh along the bigger pipes .  hubert raised not only his voice but also a long pointer .      now  if we reduce public confidence in the banking system   watch that tube there   you will see here a flow of cash out of the banks and into flask     currently designated    the old sock under the mattress .     even quite rich people don   t want their money outside their control .  see the mattress getting fuller  or perhaps i should say   thicker .         that   s a lot of mattresses     moist agreed .      i prefer to think of it as one mattress a third of a mile high .         really .     said moist .   slosh .  valves opened somewhere  and water rushed along a new path .      now see how bank lending is emptying as the money drains into the sock .     gurgle .     watch reservoir     over there .  that means business expansion is slowing   there it goes  there it goes       drip .     now watch bucket    .  it   s tipping  it   s tipping   there .  the scale on the left of flask    shows collapsing businesses  by the way .  see flask   beginning to fill .  that   s foreclosures .  job losses is flask     and there goes the valve on flask     as the socks are pulled out .     flush .     but what is there to buy .  over here we see that flask    has also drained       drip  except for the occasional gurgle  the aquatic activity subsided .      and we end up in a position where we can   t move because we   re standing on our own hands  as it were     said hubert .     jobs vanishing  people without savings suffering  wages low  farms going back to wilderness  rampaging trolls coming down from the mountains           they   re here already     said moist .     some of them are even in the watch .         are you sure .     said hubert .      yes  they   ve got helmets and everything .  i   ve seen them .         then i expect they   ll be wanting to rampage back to the mountains     said hubert .     i think i would  if i were them .         you believe all that could really happen .     said moist .     a bunch of tubes and buckets can tell you that .         they are correlated to events very carefully  mr .  lipswick     said hubert  looking hurt .     correlation is everything .  did you know it is an established fact that hemlines tend to rise in times of national crisis .         you mean    .     moist began  not at all certain how the sentence was going to end .      women   s dresses get shorter     said hubert .      and that causes a national crisis .  really .  how high do they go .      mr .  bent coughed a leaden cough .     i think perhaps we should go  mr .  lipwig     he said .     if you have seen all you want  no doubt you are in a hurry to leave .     there was a slight inflection on leave .      what .  oh   yes     said moist .     i probably should be getting along .  well  thank you  hubert .  it has been an education and no mistake .         i just can   t get rid of the leaks     said the little man  looking crestfallen .     i   ll swear that every joint is watertight  but we never end up with the same amount of water that we started with .         of course not  hubert     said moist  patting him on the shoulder .     and that   s because you   re close to achieving perfection .         i am .     said hubert  wide eyed .      certainly .  everyone knows that at the end of the week you never have quite as much money as you think you should .  it   s a well known fact .      the sunrise of delight dawned on hubert   s face .  topsy was right  moist told himself .  i am good with people .      now demonstrated by the glooper .     hubert breathed .     i shall write a paper on it .         or you could write it on paper .     said moist  shaking him warmly by the hand .     okay  mr .  bent  let us tear ourselves away .      when they were walking up the main stairs moist said     what relation is hubert to the current chairman .         nephew     said bent .     how did you    .         i   m always interested in people     said moist  smiling to himself .     and there   s the red hair  of course .  why does mrs .  lavish have two crossbows on her desk .         family heirlooms  sir     lied bent .  it was a deliberate  flagrant lie  and he must have meant it to be seen as such .  family heirlooms .  and she sleeps in her office .  all right  she   s an invalid  but people usually do that at home .   she doesn   t intend to step out of the room .  she   s on guard .  and she   s very particular about who comes in .      do you have any interests  mr .  bent .         i do my job with care and attention  sir .         yes  but what do you do in the evenings .         i double check the day   s totals in my office  sir .  i find counting very   satisfying .         you   re very good at it  yes .         more than you can imagine  sir .         so if i save ninety three point forty seven dollars a year for seven years at two and a quarter percent  compound  how           eight hundred and thirty five point thirteen dollars calculated once annually  sir     said bent calmly .   yes  and twice you   ve known the exact time  thought moist .  and you didn   t look at a watch .  you are good with numbers .  inhumanly good  perhaps        no holidays .     he said aloud .      i did a walking tour of the major banking houses of   berwald last summer  sir .  it was most instructive .         that must have taken weeks .  i   m glad you felt able to tear yourself away .         oh  it was easy  sir .  miss drapes  who is the senior clerk  sent a coded clacks of the day   s business to each of my lodging houses at the close of business every day .  i was able to review it over my after dinner strudel and respond instantly with advice and instructions .         is miss drapes a useful member of the staff .         indeed .  she performs her duties with care and alacrity .     he paused .  they were at the top of the stairs .  bent turned and looked directly at moist .      i have worked here all my life  mr .  lipwig .  be careful of the lavish family .  mrs .  lavish is the best of them  a wonderful woman .  the others   are used to getting their own way .      old family  old money .  that kind of family .  moist felt a distant call  like the song of the skylark .  it came back to taunt him every time  for example  he saw an out of towner in the street with a map and a perplexed expression  crying out to be relieved of his money in some helpful and hard to follow way .      dangerously so .     he said .   bent looked a little affronted at this directness .     they are not at home to disappointment  sir .  they have tried to declare mrs .  lavish insane  sir .         really .     said moist .     compared to who .          the wind blew through the town of big cabbage  which liked to call itself the green heart of the plains .   it was called big cabbage because it was home to the biggest cabbage in the world  and the town   s inhabitants were not very creative when it came to names .  people traveled miles to see this wonder  they   d go inside its concrete interior and peer out through the windows  buy cabbage leaf bookmarks  cabbage ink  cabbage shirts  captain cabbage dolls  musical boxes carefully crafted from kohl rabi and cauliflower  which played    the cabbage eater   s song     cabbage jam  kale ale  and green cigars made from a newly developed species of cabbage and rolled on the thighs of local maidens  presumably because they liked it .   then there was the excitement of brassica world  where very small children could burst into terrified screams at the huge head of captain cabbage himself  along with his friends cauliflower the clown and billy broccoli .  for older visitors there was  of course  the cabbage research institute  over which a green pall always hung and downwind of which plants tended to be rather strange and sometimes turned to watch you as you passed .   and then   what better way to record the day of a lifetime than pose at the behest of the black clad man with the iconograph  who took a picture of the happy family and promised a framed  colored result  sent right to their home  for a mere three dollars  s h included  one dollar deposit to cover expenses  if you would be so good  sir  and may i say what wonderful children you have there  madam  they are a credit to you and no mistake  oh  and did i say that if you are not delighted with the framed picture then send no further money and we shall say no more about it .   the kale ale was generally pretty good  and there   s no such thing as too much flattery where mothers are concerned  and  all right  the man had rather strange teeth  which seem determined to make a break from his mouth  but none of us is perfect and what was there to lose .   what there was to lose was a dollar  and they add up .  whoever said you can   t fool an honest man wasn   t one .   around about the seventh family a watchman started taking a distant interest  so the man in dusty black made a show of taking the last name and address and strolled into an alley .  he tossed the broken iconograph back on the pile of junk where he had found it   it was a cheap one and the imps had long since evaporated   and was about to set off across the fields when he saw the newspaper being bowled along by the wind .   to a man traveling on his wits  a newspaper was a useful treasure .  stuck down your shirt  it kept the wind off your chest .  you could use it to light fires .  for the fastidious  it saved a daily resort to dockweed  burdock  or other broad leaved plants .  and  as a last resort  you could read it .   this evening  the breeze was getting up .  he gave the front page of the paper a cursory glance  and tucked it under his vest .   his teeth tried to tell him something  but he never listened to them .  a man could go mad  listening to his teeth .       when he got back to the post office  moist looked up the lavish family in whom   s whom .  they were indeed what was known as    old money     which meant that it had been made so long ago that the black deeds which had originally filled the coffers were now historically irrelevant .  funny  that  a brigand for a father was something you kept quiet about  but a slave taking pirate for a great great great grandfather was something to boast of over the port .  time turned the evil bastards into rogues  and rogue was a word with a twinkle in its eye and nothing to be ashamed of .   they   d been rich for centuries .  the key players in the current crop of lavishes  apart from topsy  were her brother in law marko lavish and his wife  capricia lavish  daughter of a famous trust fund .  they lived in genua  as far away from other lavishes as possible  which was a very lavish thing to do .  then there were topsy   s stepchildren  the twins cosmo and pucci  who had  the story ran  been born with their little hands around each other   s throats  like true lavishes .  there were also plenty more cousins  aunts  and genetic hangers on  all watching one another like cats .  from what he   d heard  the family business was traditionally banking  but the recent generations  buoyed by a complex network of long term investments and ancient trust funds  had diversified into disinheriting and suing one another  apparently with great enthusiasm and a commendable lack of mercy .  he recalled pictures of them in the times    society pages  getting in or out of sleek black coaches and not smiling very much  in case the money escaped .   there was no mention of topsy   s side of the family .  they were turvys  apparently not grand enough to be whoms .  topsy turvy   there was a music hall sound to it  and moist could believe that .   moist   s in box had been topped up in his absence .  it was all unimportant stuff  and really didn   t need anything from him  but it was this newfangled carbon paper that was the trouble .  he got copies of everything  and they took up time .   it wasn   t that he wasn   t good at delegating .  he was extremely good at delegating .  but the talent requires people on the other end of the chain to be good at being delegated onto .  they weren   t .  something about the post office discouraged original thinking .  the letters went in the slots  okay .  there was no room for people who wanted to experiment with sticking them in their ear  up the chimney  or down the privy .  it   d do them good to     he spotted the flimsy pink clacks among the other stuff and tugged it out quickly .   it was from spike .   he read     success .  returning day after tomorrow .   all will be revealed .  s .       moist put it down carefully .   obviously she   d missed him terribly and was desperate to see him again  but she was stingy about spending golem trust money .  also  she   d probably run out of cigarettes .   moist drummed his fingers on the desk .  a year ago he   d asked adora belle dearheart to be his wife  and she   d explained that  in fact  he was going to be her husband .   it was going to be   well  it was going to be sometime in the near future  when mrs .  dearheart finally lost patience with her daughter   s busy schedule and arranged the wedding herself .   but he was a nearly married man  however you looked at it .  and nearly married men didn   t get mixed up with the lavish family .  a nearly married man was steadfast and dependable and always ready to hand his nearly wife an ashtray .  he had to be there for his oneday children  and make sure they slept in a well ventilated nursery .   he smoothed out the message .   and he would stop the night climbing  too .  was it grownup .  was it sensible .  was he a tool of vetinari .  no .   but a memory stirred .  moist got up and went over to his filing cabinet  which he normally avoided at all costs .   under    stamps    he found the little report he   d had two months ago from stanley howler  the head of stamps .  it noted in passing the continued high sales of one and two dollar stamps  which was higher than even stanley had expected .  maybe    stamp money    was more prevalent than he   d thought .  after all  the government backed it  right .  it was even easy to carry .  he   d have to check on exactly how much they     there was a dainty knock at the door  and gladys entered .  she bore with extreme care a plate of ham sandwiches  made very  very thin  as only gladys could make them  which was to put one ham between two loaves and bring her shovel sized hand down on it very hard .      i anticipated that you would have had no lunch  postmaster     she rumbled .      thank you  gladys     said moist  mentally shaking himself .      and lord vetinari is downstairs     gladys went on .     he says there is no rush .      the sandwich stopped an inch from moist   s lips .      he   s in the building .         yes  mr .  lipwig .         wandering about by himself .     said moist  horror mounting .      currently he is in the blind letter office  mr .  lipwig .         what is he doing there .         reading the letters  mr .  lipwig .      no rush  thought moist grimly .  oh  yes .  well  i   m going to finish my sandwiches that the nice lady golem has made for me .      thank you  gladys     he said .   when she was gone  moist took a pair of tweezers out of his desk drawer  opened the sandwich  and began to disembowel it of the bone fragments caused by gladys   s drop hammer technique .   it was a little over three minutes later that the golem reappeared  and stood patiently in front of the desk .      yes  gladys .     said moist .      his lordship desired me to inform you that there is still no rush .      moist ran downstairs and lord vetinari was indeed sitting in the blind letter office with his boots on a desk  a sheaf of letters in his hand  and a smile on his face .      ah  lipwig     he said  waving the grubby envelopes .     wonderful stuff .  better than the crossword .  i like this one     duzbuns hopsit pfarmerrsc .     i   ve put the correct address underneath .     he passed the letter over to moist .   he had written     k .  whistler  baker    pigsty hill .         there are three bakeries in the city that could be said to be opposite a pharmacy     said vetinari     but whistler does those rather good curly buns that regrettably look as though a dog has just done his business on your plate and somehow managed to add a blob of icing .         well done  sir     said moist weakly .  at the other end of the room  frank and dave  who spent all their time deciphering the illegible  misspelled  misdirected  or simply insane mail that sleeted through the blind letter office every day  were watching vetinari in shock and awe .  in the corner  drumknott appeared to be brewing tea .      i think it is just a matter of getting into the mind of the writer     vetinari went on  looking at a letter covered with grubby fingerprints and what looked like the remains of someone   s breakfast .  he added     in some cases  i imagine  there is a lot of room .         frank and dave manage to sort out five out of every six     said moist .      they are veritable magicians     said vetinari .  he turned to the men  who smiled nervously and backed away  leaving the smiles hanging awkwardly in the air  as protection .  he added     but i think it is time for their tea break .      the two looked at drumknott  who was pouring tea into two cups .      somewhere else .     vetinari suggested .   no express delivery had ever moved faster than frank and dave .  when the door had shut behind them  vetinari went on     you have looked around the bank .  your conclusions .         i think i   d rather stick my thumb in a mincing machine than get involved with the lavish family     said moist .     oh  i could probably do things with it  and the mint needs a good shaking .  but the bank needs to be run by someone who understands banks .         people who understand banks got it into the position it is in now     said vetinari .     and i did not become ruler of ankh morpork by understanding the city .  like banking  the city is depressingly easy to understand .  i have remained ruler by getting the city to understand me .         i understood you  sir  when you said something about angels  remember .  well  it worked .  i am a reformed character and i will act like one .         even as far as the goldish chain .     said vetinari  as drumknott handed him a cup of tea .      damn right .         mrs .  lavish was very impressed with you .         she said i was an out and out crook .         high praise indeed  coming from topsy     said vetinari .  he sighed .     well  i can   t force such a reformed person as you to       he paused as drumknott leaned down to whisper in his ear  and then continued        well  clearly i can force you  but on this occasion i don   t think i will .  drumknott  take this down  please .     i  moist von lipwig  wish to make it clear that i have no desire or intention to run or be involved in the running of any bank in ankh morpork  preferring instead to devote my energies to the further improvement of the post office and the clacks system .     leave a space for mr .  lipwig   s signature and the date .  and then           look  why is this necessary       moist began .         continue     i  havelock vetinari  etc .  confirm that i have indeed discussed the future of the ankh morpork banking system with mr .  lipwig and fully accept his express wish to continue his fine work at the post office  freely and without hindrance or penalty .     space for signature  etc .  thank you  mr .  lipwig .         what is all that about .     said moist  bewildered .      the times seems to think i intend to nationalize the royal bank     said vetinari .      nationalize .     said moist .      steal     vetinari translated .     i don   t know how these rumors get about .         i suppose even tyrants have enemies .     said moist .      well put as usual  mr .  lipwig     said vetinari  giving him a sharp look .     give him the memorandum to sign  drumknott .      drumknott did so  taking care to retrieve the pencil afterward with a rather smug look .  then vetinari stood up and brushed off his robe .      i well recall our interesting conversation about angels  mr .  lipwig  and i recall telling you that you only get one     he said  a little stiffly .     do bear that in mind .             it would appear that the leopard does change his shorts  sir     mused drumknott  as the evening mist drifted  waist high  along the street .      it would appear so  indeed .  but moist von lipwig is a man of appearances .  i   m sure he believes everything he said  but one must look beyond the surface to the lipwig beneath  an honest soul with a fine criminal mind .         you have said something similar before  sir     said the secretary  holding open the coach door     but it seems that honesty has got the better of him .      vetinari paused with his foot on the step .      indeed  but i take some heart  drumknott  from the fact that  once again  he has stolen your pencil .         in fact he has not  sir  because i was most careful to put it in my pocket .     said drumknott  in some triumph .      yes     said vetinari happily  sinking into the creaking leather as drumknott started to pat himself down with an increasing desperation     i know .          there were guards in the bank at night .  they patrolled the corridors in a leisurely way  whistling under their breath  safe in the knowledge the very best locks kept miscreants out and all the ground floor was paved with marble which  in the long  silent watches of the night  rang like a bell at every step .  some dozed  standing upright with their eyes half open .   but someone ignored the locks of iron  passed through the bars of brass  trod soundlessly on the ringing tiles  moved under the very noses of the slumbering men .  nevertheless  when the figure walked through the big doors to the chairman   s office  two crossbow bolts passed through it and splintered the fine woodwork .      well  you can   t blame a body for trying     said mrs .  lavish .   i am not concerned with your body  mrs .  topsy lavish  said death .      it   s been quite a while since anyone was     sighed topsy .   this is the reckoning  mrs .  lavish .  the final accounting .      do you always use banking allusions at a time like this .     said topsy  standing up .  something remained slumped in the chair  but it wasn   t mrs .  lavish anymore .   i try to acknowledge the ambience  mrs .  lavish .      the    closing of the ledger    would have the right ring  too .      thank you .  i shall make a note .  and now  you must come with me .     i made my will just in time  it seems     said topsy  letting her white hair down .   one should always take care of one   s posterity  mrs .  lavish .     my posterity .  the lavishes can kiss my bum  sir .  i   ve fixed    em for good .  oh yes .  now what  mr .  death .      now .  said death .  now  you could say  comes    the audit .      oh .  there is one  is there .  well  i   m not ashamed .      that counts .      good .  it should     said topsy .   she took death   s arm and walked with him through the doors and onto the black desert under the endless night .   after a while mr .  fusspot sat up and started to whine .       there was a small article about the banking business in the times next morning .  it used the word crisis quite a lot .   ah  here we are  thought moist  when he got to paragraph four .  or  rather  here i am .     lord vetinari told the times     it is true that  with the permission of the bank   s chairman  i discussed with the postmaster general the possibility of him offering his services to the royal bank in these difficult times .  he has declined  and the matter ends there .  it is not the business of the government to run banks .  the future of the royal bank of ankh morpork is in the hands of its directors and shareholders .          and gods help it  thought moist .   he tackled the in tray with vigor .  he threw himself at the paperwork  checking figures  correcting spelling  and humming to himself to drown out the inner voice of temptation .   lunchtime arrived  and with it a plate of one foot wide cheese sandwiches delivered by gladys  along with the midday copy of the times     mrs .  lavish had died in the night .  moist stared at the news .  it said she had passed away quietly in her sleep  after a long illness .   he dropped the paper and stared at the wall .  she   d seemed like someone hanging together by sheer grit and gin .  even so  that vitality  that spark   well  she couldn   t hold on forever .  so what would happen now .  ye gods  he was well out of it .   and it was probably not a good day to be mr .  fusspot .  he   d looked a waddly sort of dog  so he   d better learn to run really quickly .   the latest post that gladys had brought up contained a long and thoroughly secondhand envelope addressed to him    personly    in thick black letters .  he slit it open with the letter opener and shook it out into the waste bin  just in case .   there was a folded newspaper inside .  it was  it turned out  the times from yesterday  and there was moist von lipwig on the front page .  circled .   moist turned it over .  on the other side  in tiny  neat handwriting  were the words     dear sir  i have took the small precawtion of loging certain affe davids with trusted associates .  you will here from me again    a friend    take it slowly  take it slowly   it can   t be from a friend .  everyone i think of as a friend can spell .  this must be some kind of con  yes .  but there were no skeletons in his closet     oh  all right  if you were going for the fine detail  there were  in fact  enough skeletons in his closet to fill a big crypt  with enough left over to equip a fun fair house of horrors and maybe also make a macabre but mildly amusing ashtray .  but they   d never been associated with the name lipwig .  he   d been careful about that .  his crimes had died with albert spangler .  a good hangman knows exactly how much rope to give a man  and had dropped him out of one life and into another .   could anyone have recognized him .  but he was the least recognizable person in the world when he wasn   t wearing his golden suit .  when he was young  his mother sometimes went home from school with the wrong child .   and when he wore the suit  people recognized the suit .  he hid by being conspicuous     it had to be a scam of some kind .  yes  that was it .  the old    guilty secret    job .  probably no one got to a position like this without accumulating some things they   d rather not see made public .  but it was a nice touch to include the bit about affidavits .  it was there to set a nervous man to wondering .  it suggested that the sender knew something so dangerous that you  the recipient  might try to silence him  and he was in a position to set the lawyers on you .   hah .  and he was being given some time in which  presumably  to stew .  him .  moist von lipwig .  well  they might just find out how hot a stew could get .  for now  he shoved the paper in a bottom drawer .  hah .   there was a knock at the door .      come in  gladys     he said  rummaging in the in tray again .   the door opened and the worried  pale face of stanley howler appeared around it .      it   s me  sir .  stanley  sir     it said .      yes  stanley .         head of stamps at the post office  sir     stanley added  in case pin point identification was required .      yes  stanley  i know     said moist patiently .     i see you every day .  what is it that you want .         nothing  sir     said stanley .  there was a pause  and moist adjusted his mind to the world as seen through the brain of stanley howler .  stanley was very   precise  and as patient as the grave .      what is the reason for you  coming here  to see me  today  stanley .     moist tried  enunciating carefully in order to deliver the sentence in bite size chunks .      there is a lawyer downstairs  sir     stanley announced .      but i   ve only just read the threatening       moist began  and then relaxed .      a lawyer .  did he say why .     he said .      a matter of great importance  he said .  there   s two watchmen with him  sir .  and a dog .         really .     said moist calmly .     well  you   d better show them up  then .      he glanced at his watch .   oh   kay   not good .   the lancre flyer would be leaving in forty five seconds .  he knew he could be down that damn drainpipe in eleven seconds .  stanley was on his way below to bring them up here  call that thirty seconds  maybe .  get them off the ground floor  that was the thing .  scramble onto the back of the coach  jump off when it slowed down for the hubwards gate  pick open the tin chest he   d got stashed in the beams of the old stable in lobbin clout  get changed and adjust his face  stroll across the city to have a coffee in that shop near the main watch house  keep an eye on the clacks traffic for a while  stroll over to hen and chickens court  where he had another trunk stored with    i don   t know    jack  get changed  leave with his little bag and his tweed cap  which he   d change for the old brown bowler in the bag in some alley  just in case jack had a sudden attack of memory brought on by excessive money   and he   d mosey down to the slaughterhouse district and step into the persona of jeff the drover and hang out in the huge  fetid bar of the butcher   s eagle  which was where the drovers traditionally damped down the road dust .  there was a vampire in the watch these days and they   d had a werewolf for years  too .  well  let those famously sharp noses snuff up the mixed cocktail stink of manure  fear  sweat  offal  and urine and see how they liked it .  and that was just in the bar   if anything  it was worse in the slaughterhouses .   then maybe he   d wait until evening to hitch a lift on one of the steaming dung carts heading out of the city  along with the other drunk drovers .  the gate guards never bothered to check them .  on the other hand  if his sixth sense was still squawking  then he   d run the thimble game with some drunk until he   d got enough for a little bottle of perfume and a cheap but decent thirdhand suit at some shonky shop and repair to mrs .  eucrasia arcanum   s lodging house for respectable working men  where with a tip of a hat and some wire rimmed spectacles he   d be mr .  trespass hatchcock  a wool salesman who stayed there every time his business brought him to the city and who brought her a little gift suitable for a widow of the age she   d like people to think she was .  yes  that   d be a better idea .  at mrs .  arcanum   s the food was solid and plentiful .  the beds were good and you seldom had to share .   then he could make real plans .   the itinerary of evasion wound across his inner eye at the speed of flight .  the outer eye alighted on something less pleasing .  there was a copper in the coach yard  chatting to a couple of the drivers .  moist recognized sergeant fred colon  whose chief duty appeared to be ambling around the city  chattering to elderly men of the same age and demeanor as himself .   the watchman spotted moist at the window and gave him a little wave .   no  it was going to get complicated and messy if he ran .  he   d have to bluff it out up here .  it wasn   t as though he   d done anything wrong  technically .  the letter had thrown him  that   s all it was .   moist was sitting at his desk looking busy when stanley came back  ushering in mr .  slant  the city   s best known and  at three hundred and fifty one  probably also its oldest lawyer .  he was accompanied by sergeant angua and corporal nobbs  widely rumored to be the watch   s secret werewolf .  corporal nobbs was accompanied by a large wicker hamper and sergeant angua  carrying a large bag and a squeaky rubber bone  which she occasionally  in an absentminded way  squeaked .  things were looking up but strange .   the exchanged pleasantries were not that pleasant  this close to nobby nobbs and the lawyer  who smelled of embalming fluid  but when they were over  mr .  slant said     i believe you visited mrs .  topsy lavish yesterday  mr .  lipwig .         oh  yes .  er   when she was alive     said moist  and cursed himself and the unknown letter writer .  he was losing it  he really was .      this is not a murder investigation  sir     said the sergeant calmly .      are you sure .  in the circumstances           we   ve made it our business to be sure  sir     said the sergeant     in the circumstances .         don   t think it was the family  then .         no  sir .  or you .         me .     said moist  suitably open mouthed at the suggestion .      mrs .  lavish was known to be very ill     said mr .  slant .     and it seems that she took quite a shine to you  mr .  lipwig .  she has left you her little dog  mr .  fusspot .         and also a bag of toys  rugs  tartan coats  little booties  eight collars including one set with diamonds and  oh  a vast amount of other stuff     said sergeant angua .  she squeaked the rubber bone again .   moist   s mouth shut .      the dog     he said  in a hollow voice .     just the dog .  and the toys .         you were expecting something more .     said angua .      i wasn   t expecting even that .     moist looked at the hamper .  it was suspiciously silent .      i give him one of his little blue pills     said nobby nobbs helpfully .     they knocks him out for a little while .  don   t work on people though .  they tastes of aniseed .         all this is a bit   odd  isn   t it .     said moist .     why   s the watch here .  the diamond collar .  anyway  i thought the will wasn   t read until after the funeral        mr .  slant coughed .  a moth flew out of his mouth .      yes indeed .  but knowing the contents of her will  i thought it prudent to hasten to the royal bank and deal with the most        there was a very long pause .  for a zombie  the whole of life is a pause  but it seemed that he was looking for the right word .         problematical bequests immediately     he finished .      yes  well  i suppose the little doggie needs feeding     said moist     but i wouldn   t have thought that           the    .     .  problem  if such it be  is in fact his paperwork     said mr .  slant .      wrong pedigree .     said moist .      not his pedigree     said mr .  slant  opening his briefcase .     you may be aware that the late sir joshua left one percent share in the bank to mr .  fusspot .      a cold  black wind began to blow through moist   s mind .      yes     he said .     i am .         the late mrs .  lavish has left him another fifty percent .  that  by the customs of the bank  means that he is the new chairman  mr .  lipwig .  and you own him .         hold on  an animal can   t own           oh  but it can  mr .  lipwig  it can .     said slant  with lawyerly glee .     there is a huge body of case law .  there was even  once  a donkey who was ordained and a tortoise who was appointed a judge .  obviously the more difficult trades are less well represented .  no horse has yet held down a job as a carpenter  for example .  but dog as chairman is relatively usual .         this makes no sense .  she hardly knows me .     and his mind chimed in with  oh yes she does .  she had you bang to rights in a blink .      the will was dictated to me last night  mr .  lipwig  in the presence of two witnesses and mrs .  lavish   s physician  who declared her very sound of mind if not of body .     mr .  slant stood up .     the will  in short  is legal .  it does not have to make sense .         but how can he  well  chair meetings .  all he does with chairs is sniff the legs .         i assume he will act as chairman through you     said the lawyer .  there was a squeak from sergeant angua .      and what happens if he dies .     said moist .      ah  thank you for reminding me     said mr .  slant  taking another document from the thin and rather battered briefcase .     yes  it says here  the shares will be distributed among any remaining members of the family .         any remaining members of the family .  what  his family .  i don   t think he   s had much of a chance to have one .         no  mr .  lipwig     said slant     the lavish family .      moist felt the winds grow colder .     how long does a dog live .         an ordin   ry dog .     said nobby nobbs .     or a dog who stands between a bunch of lavishes and another fortune .         corporal nobbs  that was a pertinent remark .     snapped sergeant angua .      sorry  sarge .         ahem .     a cough from mr .  slant liberated another moth .      mr .  fusspot is used to sleeping in the manager   s suite at the bank  mr .  lipwig     he said .     you will sleep there too .  it is a condition of the bequest .      moist stood up .     i don   t have to do any of this     he snapped .     it   s not like i   ve committed a crime .  you can   t run people   s lives from beyond the grav   well  you can  sir  no problem there  but she can   t just        a further envelope was produced from the briefcase .  mr .  slant was smiling  which is never a good sign .      mrs .  lavish also wrote this personal heartfelt plea to you     he said .     and now  sergeant  i think we should leave mr .  lipwig alone .      they departed  although after a few seconds sergeant angua walked back in and  without saying a word or catching his eye  went over to the bag of toys and dropped the squeaky rubber bone .   moist walked over to the basket and lifted the lid .  mr .  fusspot looked up  yawned  and then reared up on his cushion and begged .  his tail wagged uncertainly once or twice and his huge eyes filled with hope .      don   t look at me  kid     said moist  and turned his back .   mrs .  lavish   s letter was drenched in lavender water  slightly spiced with gin .  she wrote in a very neat  old lady hand     dear mr .  lipwig     i feel that you are a dear  sweet man who will look after my little mr .  fusspot .  please be kind to him .  he has been my only friend in difficult times .  money is such a crude thing in these circumstances  but the sum of         annually will be paid to you  in arrears  for performing this duty  which i beg you to accept .     if you do not  or if he dies of unnatural causes  your arse will belong to the guild of assassins .           is lodged with lord downey  and his young gentlemen will hunt you down and gut you like the weasel you are  smart boy .     may the gods bless you for your kindness to a widow in distress .       moist was impressed .  stick and carrot .  vetinari just used the stick  or hit you over the head with the carrot .   vetinari .  now there was a man with some questions to answer .   the hairs on the back of his neck  trained by decades of dodging in any case and suddenly made extra sensitive with mrs .  lavish   s words still bouncing in his skull  bristled in terror .  something came through the window and thunked .  into the wall .  but moist was already diving for the carpet when the glass broke .   shuddering in the door was a black arrow .   moist crawled across the carpet  reached up  grabbed the arrow  and ducked down again .   in exquisite white writing  like the inscription on some ancient ring  on the arrow were the words        guild of assassins    when style matters .           it had to be a warning shot  right .  just a little grace note  yes .  a sort of emphasis .  just in case .   mr .  fusspot took this opportunity to leap out of his basket and lick moist   s face .  mr .  fusspot didn   t care who he was or what he   d done  he just wanted to be friends .      i think     said moist  giving in     that you and me ought to go walkies .      the dog gave an excited little yip and went and tugged at the bag of accessories until it fell over .  he disappeared inside  tail wagging madly  and came out dragging a little red velvet doggie coat on which the word tuesday was embroidered .      lucky guess  boy     said moist as he buckled it up .  this was difficult  because he was being washed by dog goo all the while .      er  you wouldn   t know where your lead is  would you .     moist ventured  trying not to swallow .  mr .  fusspot bounced off to the bag and returned again with a red leash .      oh   kay     said moist .     this is going to be the fastest walky in the history of walkies .  it is  in fact  going to be a runny        as he reached up for the door handle  the door opened anyway .  moist found himself staring up at two terra cotta colored legs that were as thick as tree trunks .      i hope you are not looking up my dress  mr .  lipwig .     rumbled far above .   at what  exactly .  moist thought .      ah  gladys     he said .     would you just go and stand at the window .  thank you .      there was a little tick .  sound and gladys turned around  holding another black arrow between her thumb and forefinger .  its sudden deceleration in gladys   s grasp had caused it to catch fire .      someone has sent you an arrow  mr .  lipwig     she noted .      really .  just blow it out and put it in the in tray  will you .     said moist  crawling out of the door .     i   m just going to see a man about a dog .      he picked up mr .  fusspot and hurried down the stairs  through the thronged hall  down the stone steps   and there  pulling up to the curb  was a black coach .  ha .  the man was always one jump ahead  right .   he wrenched open the door as the coach came to a stop  landed heavily in an unoccupied seat  with mr .  fusspot barking happily in his arm  glared across the carpet  and said        oh   sorry  i thought this was lord vetinari   s coach        a hand slammed the door shut .  it was wearing a large  black  and very expensive glove  with jet beads embroidered into it .  moist   s gaze followed it up an arm to a face  which said      no  mr .  lipwig .  my name is cosmo lavish .  i was just coming to see you .  how do you do .          chapter       the dark ring an unusual chin    a job for life but not for long    getting started fun with journalism it   s all about the city a mile in his shoes a lavish occasion      the man     made things .  he was an unsung craftsman  because the things he made never ended up with his name on them .  no  they usually bore the names of dead men on them  men who were masters of their craft .  he  in his turn  was the master of one craft .  it was the craft of seeming .      do you have the money .         yes .     the man in the brown robe indicated the stolid troll next to him .      why did you bring that .  can   t abide    em .         five hundred dollars is a lot to carry  mr .  morpeth .  and a lot to pay for jewelry that isn   t even silver  i may add     said the young man  whose name was heretofore .      yes  well  that   s the trick  ain   t it .     said the old man     i know this ain   t exactly proper  what you   re doing .  an    i told you stygium   s rarer than gold .  it just don   t sparkle   well  unless you do things wrong .  believe me  i could sell all i could get to the assassins .  those fine gentlemen do like their black  so they do .  they love it to bits .         it   s not illegal .  no one owns the letter v .  look  we   ve been through this .  let me see it .      the old man gave heretofore a look  then opened a drawer and put a small box on top of his desk .  he adjusted the reflectors on the lamps and said     okay  open it .      the young man lifted the lid  and there it was  black as night  the serifed v a deeper  sharper shadow .   he took a deep breath  reached out for the ring  and dropped it in horror .      it   s warm .      there was a snort from the maker of things that seemed .      that   s stygium  that is .  it drinks the light .  if you was out in full daylight you   d be sucking your fingers and yellin    .  keep it in a box when it   s bright outside  right .  or wear a glove over it if you   re a swanker .         it   s perfect .         yes .  it is .     the old man snatched the ring back  and heretofore began to tumble into his own private hell .     it   s just like the real thing  ain    it     growled the seemer .     oh  don   t look surprised .  you think i don   t know what i   ve made .  i   ve seen the real one a coupla    times  and this   d fool vetinari hisself .  that takes a lot of forgetting .         i don   t know what you mean .     heretofore protested .      you are stupid  then .         i told you  no one owns the letter v .         you   ll tell that to his lordship  will you .  no  you won   t .  but you   ll pay me another five hundred .  i   m thinking of retiring anyway  and a little extra will get me a long way away .         we had an agreement .         an    now we   re having another one     said morpeth .     this time you   re buying forgetfulness .     the maker of things that seemed beamed happily .  the young man looked unhappy and uncertain .      this is priceless to someone  right .     morpeth prompted .      all right  five hundred  damn you     said heretofore .      except it   s a thousand now     said the old man .     see .  you were too fast .  you didn   t haggle .  someone really needs my little toy  right .  fifteen hundred all in .  you try to find anyone else in this city who can work like me .  an    if you open your mouth to say anything but    yes    it   ll be two thousand .  have it my way .      there was a longer pause  and heretofore said     yes .  but i   ll have to come back with the rest .         you do that  mister .  i   ll be here waiting .  there  that wasn   t too hard  was it .  nothing personal  it   s just business .      the ring went back in the box  the box went back in the drawer .  at a signal from the young man the troll dropped the bags on the floor and  job done  wandered off into the night .   heretofore turned suddenly  and the seemer   s right hand flew down behind the desk .  it relaxed when the young man said     you   ll be here later  yes .         me .  i   m always here .  see yourself out .         you   ll be here .         i just said yes  didn   t i .      in the darkness of the stinking hallway the young man opened the door  his heart thumping .  a black clad figure stepped inside .  he couldn   t see the face behind the mask  but he whispered     box is in the top left drawer .  some kind of weapon on the right side .  keep the money .  just don   t   hurt him  okay .         hurt .  that   s not why i   m here .     hissed the dark figure .      i know  but   do it neatly  all right .      and then heretofore was shutting the door behind him .   it was raining .  he went in the doorway opposite .  it was hard to hear noises over the rain and the sound of overflowing gutters  but he fancied he heard  above all this  a faint thump .  it may have been his imagination  because he did not hear the door open  or the approach of the killer  and he nearly swallowed his tongue when the man loomed in front of him  pressed the box into his hand  and vanished into the rain .   a smell of peppermint drifted out onto the street  the man was thorough  and had used a peppermint bomb to cover his scent .   you stupid  stupid old fool .  heretofore said  in the turmoil of his skull .  why didn   t you take the money and shut up .  i had no choice .  he wouldn   t risk you telling anyone .   heretofore felt his stomach heave .  he   d never meant it to be like this .  he   d never meant for anyone to die .  and then he threw up .   that was last week .  things hadn   t got any better .       lord vetinari has a black coach .   other people also have black coaches .   therefore  not everyone in a black coach is lord vetinari .   it was an important philosophical insight that moist  to his regret  had forgotten in the heat of the moment .   there was no heat now .  cosmo lavish was cool  or at least making a spirited effort to be so .  he wore black  of course  as people do to show how rich they are  but the real giveaway was the beard .   it was  technically  a goatee similar to that of lord vetinari .  a thin line of black hair came down each cheek  made a detour to loop equally thinly under the nose  and met in a black triangle just below the lip  thus giving what cosmo must have thought was a look of menacing elegance .  and indeed  on vetinari it did .  on cosmo the elegant facial topiary floated unhappily on blue jowls glistening with little tiny beads of sweat  and gave the effect of a pubic chin .   some master barber had to deal with it  hair by hair  every day  and his job wouldn   t have been made any easier by the fact that cosmo had inflated somewhat since the day he adopted the style .  there is a time in a thoughtless young man   s life when his six pack becomes a keg  but in cosmo   s case it had become a tub of lard .   and then you saw the eyes  and they made up for everything .  they had the faraway look of a man who can already see you dead     but probably not those of a killer himself  moist hazarded .  he probably bought death when he needed it .  true  on fingers that were slightly too pudgy for them were ostensibly knobbly poison rings  but surely anyone really in the business wouldn   t have so many  would they .  real killers didn   t bother to advertise .  and why was the elegant black glove on the other hand .  that was an assassins    guild affectation .  yep  guild school trained  then .  lots of upper class kids went there for the education but didn   t do the black syllabus .  he probably had a note from his mother saying he was excused from stabbing .   mr .  fusspot was trembling with fear or  perhaps  rage .  in moist   s arms he was growling like a leopard .      ah  my stepmother   s little dog     said cosmo  as the coach began to move .     how sweet .  i do not waste words .  i will give you ten thousand dollars for him  mr .  lipwig .      he held out a piece of paper in the ungloved hand .      my note of hand for the money .  anyone in this city will accept it .      the voice of cosmo was a kind of modulated sigh  as if talking was somehow painful .   moist read   please pay the sum of ten thousand dollars to moi .  von lipwig  and it was signed across a one penny stamp by cosmo lavish  with many a flourish .   signed across a stamp   where had that come from .  but you saw it more and more in the city  and if you asked anyone why  they said        cos it makes it legal  see .     and it was cheaper than lawyers  and so it worked .   and here it was  ten thousand dollars pointing directly at him .   how dare he try to bribe me  thought moist .  in fact  that was his second thought  that of the soon to be wearer of a goldish chain .  his first thought  courtesy of the old moist  was  how dare he try to bribe me so small .      no     he said .     anyway  i   ll get more than that for looking after him for a few months .         ah yes  but my offer is less   risky .         you think .      cosmo smiled .     come now  mr .  lipwig .  we   re men of the world              you and i  yes .     moist finished .     that   s so predictable .  besides  you should have offered me more money first .      at this point something happened in the vicinity of cosmo   s forehead .  both eyebrows began to twist like mr .  fusspot   s when he was puzzled .  they writhed for a moment  and then cosmo saw moist   s expression  whereupon he slapped his brow and his momentary glare indicated that instant death would reward any comment .   he cleared his throat and said     for what i can get free .  we are making a very good case that my stepmother was insane when she made that will .         she seemed sharp as a tack to me  sir     said moist .      with two loaded crossbows on her desk .         ah  i see your point .  yes  if she was really sane  she   d have hired a couple of trolls with big  big clubs .      cosmo gave moist a long  appraising look  or what he clearly thought was one  but moist knew that tactic .  it was supposed to make the lookee think they were being weighed up for a serious kicking  but it could just as easily mean    i   ll give him the ol    hard eyeball while i   m wondering what to do next .     cosmo might be a ruthless man  but he wasn   t a stupid one .  a man in a gold suit gets noticed  and someone would remember whose coach he got into .      i fear that my stepmother has landed you into a lot of trouble     said cosmo .      i   ve been in trouble before     said moist .      oh .  when was that .     and this came sharp and sudden .   ah .  the past .  not a good place to go .  moist tried to avoid it .      very little is known about you  mr .  lipwig     cosmo went on .     you were born in   berwald  and you became our postmaster general .  in between           i   ve managed to survive     said moist .      an enviable achievement indeed     said cosmo .  he tapped on the side of the coach and it began to slow .     i trust it will continue .  in the meantime  let me at least give you this        he tore the bill in half  and dropped the half that very emphatically did not carry his seal or signature onto moist   s lap .      what is this for .     said moist  picking it up while trying to restrain the frantic mr .  fusspot with the other hand .      oh  just a declaration of good faith     said cosmo  as the coach stopped .     one day you might feel inclined to ask me for the other half .  but understand me  mr .  lipwig  i don   t usually take the trouble to do things the hard way .         don   t bother to do so on my account  please     said moist  wrenching the door open .  sator square was outside  full of carts and people and embarrassingly potential witnesses .   for a moment  cosmo   s forehead did that   eyebrow thing again .  he gave it a slap  and said     mr .  lipwig  you misunderstand .  this was the hard way .  good bye .  my regards to your young lady .      moist spun on the cobbles  but the door had slammed shut and the coach was speeding away .      why didn   t you add    we know where your children will go to school    .     he shouted after it .   what now .  hell   s bells  he had been dropped right in it .   a little way up the street  the palace beckoned .   vetinari had some questions to answer .  how had the man arranged it .  the watch said she   d died of natural causes .  but he   d been trained as an assassin  yes .  a real one  specializing in poisons  maybe .   he strode in through the open gates  but the guards stopped him at the building itself .  moist knew them of old .  there was probably an entrance exam for them .  if they answered the question    what is your name .     and got it wrong  they were hired .  there were trolls that could outthink them .   but you couldn   t fool them  or talk them round .  they had a list of people who could walk right in  and another of people who needed an appointment .  if you weren   t on either  you didn   t get in .   however  one of their captains  bright enough to read large type  did recognize    postmaster general    and    chairman of the royal bank    and sent one of the lads knuckling off to see drumknott  carrying a scribbled note .  to moist   s surprise  ten minutes later  he was being ushered into the oblong office .   seats around the big conference table at one end of the room were fully occupied .  moist recognized a few guild leaders  but quite a few were average looking citizens  working men  men who looked ill at ease indoors .  maps of the city were strewn across the table .  he   d interrupted something .  or  rather  vetinari had interrupted something for him .   lord vetinari got up as soon as moist entered  and beckoned him forward .      please excuse me  ladies  gentlemen  but i do need some time with the postmaster general .  drumknott  do take everyone through the figures again  will you .  mr .  lipwig  this way if you please .      moist thought he heard muffled laughter behind them as he was ushered into what he at first thought was a high ceilinged corridor  but which turned out to be a sort of an art gallery .  vetinari shut the door behind them .  the click seemed  to moist  to be very loud .  his anger was draining fast  to be replaced by a very chilly feeling .  vetinari was a tyrant  after all .  if moist was never seen again  his lordship   s reputation would only be enhanced .      do put down mr .  fusspot     said vetinari .     it will do the little chap good to run about .      moist lowered the dog to the ground .  it was like dropping a shield .  and now he could take in what it was this gallery exhibited .   what he   d thought were carved stone busts were faces  made of wax .  and moist knew how and when they were made  too .   they were death masks .      my predecessors     said vetinari  strolling down the gallery .     not a complete collection  of course .  in some cases the head could not be found or was  as you might say  in a rather untidy state .      there was a silence .  foolishly  moist filled it .      it must be strange  having them look down on you every day     he managed .      oh  do you think so .  i have to say i   d rather look down on them .  gross men  for the most part  greedy  venal  and clumsy .  cunning can do duty for thought up to a point  and then you die .  most of them died rich  fat  and terrified .  they left the city the worse for their incumbency and the better for their death .  but now the city works  mr .  lipwig .  we progress .  we would not do so if the ruler was the kind of man who would kill elderly ladies  do you understand .         i never said           i know exactly what you never said .  you refrained from saying it very loudly .     vetinari raised an eyebrow .     i am extremely angry  mr .  lipwig .         but i   ve been dropped right in it .         not by me     said vetinari .     i can assure you that if i had  as your ill assumed street patois has it     dropped you in it     you would fully understand all meanings of    drop    and have an unenviable knowledge of    it .            you know what i mean .         dear me  is this the real moist von lipwig speaking  or is it just the man looking forward to his very nearly gold chain .  topsy lavish knew she was going and simply changed her will .  i salute her for it .  the staff will accept you more easily  too .  and she   s done you a great favor .         favor .  i was shot at .         that was just the assassins    guild dropping you a note to say they are watching you .         there were two shots .         possibly for emphasis .     said vetinari  sitting down on a velvet covered chair .      look  banking is supposed to be dull .  numbers  pensions  a job for life .         for life possibly  but apparently not for long     said vetinari  clearly enjoying this .      can   t you do something .         about cosmo lavish .  why should i .  offering to buy a dog is not illegal .         but the whole family is   how did you know that .  i didn   t tell you .      vetinari waved a hand dismissively .     know the man  know the method .  i know cosmo .  in this sort of situation he will not resort to force if money will work .  he can be very personable when he wants to be .         but i   ve heard about the rest of them .  they sound a pretty poisonous bunch .         i couldn   t possibly comment .  however  topsy has helped you there .  the assassins    guild won   t take out a second contract on you .  conflict of interests  you see .  i suppose technically they could accept a contract on the chairman  but i doubt if they will .  killing a lapdog .  it would not look good on anyone   s r  sum   .         i didn   t sign up to deal with something like this .         no  mr .  lipwig  you signed up to die     snapped vetinari  his voice suddenly as cold and deadly as a falling icicle .     you signed up to be justly hanged by the neck until dead for crimes against the city  against the public good  against the trust of man for man .  and you were resurrected  because the city required you to be .  this is about the city  mr .  lipwig .  it is always about the city .  you know  of course  that i have plans .         it was in the times .  the undertaking .  you want to build roads and drains and streets under the city .  there   s some dwarf machine we   ve got hold of  called a device .  and the dwarfs can make waterproof tunnels .  the artificers    guild is very excited about it all .         i gather by your somber tones that you are not .      moist shrugged .  engines of any sort had never interested him .     i don   t think much about it one way or another .         astonishing     said vetinari  taken aback .     well  mr .  lipwig  you can at least guess at what we will need in very large amounts for this project .         shovels .         finance  mr .  lipwig .  and i would have it  if we had a banking system suitable for the times .  i have every confidence in your ability to   shake things up a little .      moist tried one last throw .     the post office needs me       he began .      at the moment it does not  and you chafe at the thought     said vetinari .     you are not a man for the humdrum .  i hereby grant you leave of absence .  mr .  groat has been your deputy  and while he may not have your   flair  let us say  he will  i am sure  keep things moving along .      he stood up  indicating that the audience was at an end .     the city bleeds  mr .  lipwig  and you are the clot i need .  go away and make money .  unlock the wealth of ankh morpork .  mrs .  lavish gave you the bank in trust .  run it well .         it   s the dog that   s got the bank  you know .         and what a trusting little face he has     said vetinari  ushering moist to the door .     don   t let me detain you  mr .  lipwig .  remember   it   s all about the city .          there was another protest march going on when moist walked to the bank .  you got more and more of them lately .  it was a funny thing  but everyone seemed to want to live under the despotic rule of the tyrannical lord vetinari .  they poured into the city whose streets were apparently paved with gold .   it wasn   t gold .  but the influx was having an effect  no doubt about it .  wages were falling  to start with .   this march was against the employment of golems  who uncomplainingly did the dirtiest jobs  worked around the clock  and were so honest they paid their taxes .  but they weren   t human and they had glowing eyes  and people could get touchy about that sort of thing .   mr .  bent must have been waiting behind a pillar .  moist was no sooner through the doors of the bank  mr .  fusspot tucked happily under his arm  when the chief cashier was by his side .      the staff are very concerned sir     he said  piloting moist toward the stairs .     i took the liberty of telling them that you would speak to them later .      moist was aware of the worried stares .  and of other things  too  now that he was looking with an almost proprietorial eye .  yes  the bank had been built well  out of fine materials  but get past that and you could see the neglect and the marks of time .  it was like the now inconveniently large house of a poor old widow who just couldn   t see the dust anymore .  the brass was rather tarnished  the red velvet curtains frayed and a little bald in places  the marble floor was only erratically shiny        what .     he said .     oh  yes .  good idea .  can you get this place cleaned up .         sir .         the carpets are mucky  the plush ropes are unraveled  the curtains have seen better centuries  and the brass needs a jolly good scrub .  the bank should look smart  mr .  bent .  you might give money to a beggar but you wouldn   t lend it to him  eh .      bent   s eyebrows rose .     and that   s the chairman   s view  is it .     he said .      the chairman .  oh  yes .  mr .  fusspot   s very keen on clean .  isn   t that right  mr .  fusspot .      mr .  fusspot stopped growling at mr .  bent long enough to bark a couple of times .      see .     said moist .     when you don   t know what to do  comb your hair and clean your shoes .  words of wisdom  mr .  bent .  jump to it .         i shall elevate myself to the best of my ability  sir     said bent .     meanwhile  a young lady has called  sir .  she seemed reluctant to give her name but said you would be pleased to see her .  i have ushered her into the small boardroom .         did you have to open a window .     said moist hopefully .      no  sir .      that ruled out adora belle  then  to replace her with a horrifying thought .     she   s not one of the lavish family  is she .         no  sir .  and it   s time for mr    .  it   s time for the chairman   s lunch  sir .  he has cold  boned chicken because of his stomach .  i   ll have it sent along to the small boardroom  shall i .         yes  please .  could you rustle up something for me .         rustle  sir .     bent looked puzzled .     you mean steal .      ah  that kind of man  moist thought .      i meant find me something to eat     he translated .      certainly  sir .  there is a small kitchen in the suite and we have a chef on call .  mrs .  lavish has lived here for some time .  it will be interesting to have a master of the royal mint again .         i like the sound of master of the royal mint     moist said .     how about that  mr .  fusspot .      on cue  the chairman barked .      hmm     said bent .     one final thing  sir .  could you please sign these .     he indicated a pile of paperwork .      what are they .  they   re not minutes  are they .  i don   t do minutes .         they are various formalities  sir .  basically  they add up to you signing a receipt for the bank on the chairman   s behalf  but i am advised that mr .  fusspot   s paw mark should appear in the places ticked .         does he have to read all this .     said moist .      no  sir .         then i won   t .  it   s a bank .  you   ve given me the big tour .  it   s not as though it   s got a wheel missing .  just show me where to sign .         just here  sir .  and here .  and here .  and here .  and here .  and here .   and here            the lady in the conference room was certainly an attractive woman  but since she worked for the times  moist felt unable to award her total ladylike status .  ladies didn   t fiendishly quote exactly what you said but didn   t exactly mean  or hit you around the ear with unexpectedly difficult questions .  well  come to think of it  they did  quite often  but she got paid for it .   but  he had to admit  sacharissa cripslock was fun .      sacharissa .  this is a should have been expected surprise .     he declared  as he stepped into the room .      mr .  lipwig .  always a pleasure .     said the woman .     so you are a dog   s body now .      that kind of fun .  a bit like juggling knives .  you were instantly on your toes .  it was as good as a workout .      writing the headlines already  sacharissa .     he said .     i am merely carrying out the terms of mrs .  lavish   s will .     he put mr .  fusspot on the polished tabletop and sat down .      so you are now chairman of the bank .         no  mr .  fusspot here is the chairman     said moist .     bark circumspectly at the nice lady with the busy pencil  mr .  fusspot .         woof     said mr .  fusspot .      mr .  fusspot is the chairman     said sacharissa  rolling her eyes .     of course .  and you take orders from him  do you .         yes .  i am master of the royal mint  by the way .         a dog and his master     said sacharissa .     how nice .  and i expect you can read his thoughts because of some mystic bond between dog and man .         sacharissa  i could not have put it better .      they smiled at each other .  this was only round one .  both knew they were barely warming up .      so  i take it that you would not agree with those who say that this is one last ruse by the late mrs .  lavish to keep the bank out of the hands of the rest of her family  believed by some to be totally incapable of running it anywhere but further into the ground .  or would you confirm the opinion of many that the patrician has every intention of bringing the city   s uncooperative banking industry to heel  and finds in this situation the perfect opportunity .         some who believe  those who say   who are these mysterious people .     said moist  trying to raise an eyebrow as good as vetinari   s .     and how is it that you know so many of them .      sacharissa sighed .     and you wouldn   t describe mr .  fusspot as really little more than a convenient sock puppet .         woof .     said the dog at the mention of his name .      i find the very question offensive .     said moist .     and so does he .         moist  you are just no fun anymore .     sacharissa closed her notebook .     you   re talking like   well  like a banker .         i   m glad you think so .     remember  just because she   s shut the notebook doesn   t mean you can relax .      no dashing around on mad stallions .  nothing to make us cheer .  no wild dreams .     said sacharissa .      well  i   m already tidying up the foyer .      sacharissa   s eyes narrowed .     tidying the foyer .  who are you  and what have you done with the real moist von lipwig .         no  i   m serious .  we have to clean up ourselves before we can clean up the economy     said moist  and felt his brain shift seductively into a higher gear .     i intend to throw out what we don   t need .  for example  we have a room full of useless metal in the vault .  that   ll have to go .      sacharissa frowned .     are you talking about the gold .      where had that come from .  well  don   t try to back away  or she   ll go for the throat .  tough it out .  besides  it   s good to see her looking astonished .      yes     he said .      you can   t be serious .      the notebook was instantly flipped open  and moist   s tongue began to gallop .  he couldn   t stop it .  it would have been nice if it had talked to him first .  taking over his brain  it said      dead serious .  i am recommending to lord vetinari that we sell it all to the dwarfs .  we do not need it .  it   s a commodity and nothing more .         but what   s worth more than gold .         practically everything .  you  for example .  gold is heavy .  your weight in gold is not very much gold at all .  aren   t you worth more than that .      sacharissa looked momentarily flustered  to moist   s glee .     well  in a manner of speaking           the only manner of speaking worth talking about     said moist flatly .     the world is full of things worth more than gold .  but we dig the damn stuff up and then bury it in a different hole .  where   s the sense in that .  what are we  magpies .  is it all about the gleam .  good heavens  potatoes are worth more than gold .         surely not .         if you were shipwrecked on a desert island  what would you prefer  a bag of potatoes or a bag of gold .         yes  but a desert island isn   t ankh morpork .         and that proves gold is only valuable because we agree it is  right .  it   s just a dream .  but a potato is always worth a potato  anywhere .  add a knob of butter and a pinch of salt and you   ve got a meal  anywhere .  bury gold in the ground and you   ll be worrying about thieves forever .  bury a potato and in due season you could be looking at a dividend of a thousand percent .         can i assume for a moment that you don   t intend to put us on the potato standard .     said sacharissa sharply .   moist smiled .     no  it won   t be that .  but in a few days i shall be giving away money .  it doesn   t like to stand still  you know .  it likes to get out and make new friends .     the bit of moist   s brain that was trying to keep up with his mouth thought  i wish i could make notes about this  i   m not sure i can remember it all .  but the conversations of the last day were banging together in his memory and making a kind of music .  he wasn   t sure he had all the notes yet  but there were bits he could hum .  he just had to listen to himself for long enough to find out what he was talking about .      by giving away you mean       said sacharissa .      hand over .  make a gift of .  seriously .         how .  why .         all in good time .         you are smirking at me  moist .      no  i   ve frozen because i   ve just heard what my mouth said  moist thought .  i don   t have a clue  i   ve just got some random thoughts .  it   s        it   s about desert islands     he said .     and why this city isn   t one .         and that   s it .      moist rubbed his forehead .     miss cripslock  miss cripslock   this morning i got up with nothing in mind but to seriously make headway with the paperwork and maybe lick the problem of that special   p cabbage green stamp .  you know  the one that   ll grow into a cabbage if you plant it .  how can you expect me to come up with a new fiscal initiative by teatime .         all right  but           it   ll take me at least until breakfast .      he saw her write that down .  then she tucked the notebook in her handbag .      this is going to be fun  isn   t it     she said  and moist thought  never trust her when she   s put her notebook away  either .  she   s got a good memory .      seriously  i think this is an opportunity for me to do something big and important for my adopted city     said moist  in his sincere voice .      that   s your sincere voice     she said .      well  i   m being sincere     said moist .      but since you raise the subject  moist  what were you doing with your life before the citizens of ankh morpork greeted you with open palms .         surviving     said moist .     in   berwald the old empire was breaking up .  it was not unusual for a government to change twice over lunch .  i worked at anything i could to make a living .  by the way  i think you meant    arms    back there     he added .      and when you got here you impressed the gods so much that they led you to a treasure trove so that you could rebuild our post office .         i   m very humble about that     said moist  trying to look it .      ye ess .  and the gods given gold was all in used coinage from the plains cities           you know what  i   ve often lain awake wondering about that myself     said moist     and i reached the conclusion that the gods  in their wisdom  decided that the gift should be instantly negotiable .     i can go on like this for as long as you like  he thought  and you   re trying to play poker with no cards .  you can suspect all you like  but i gave that money back .  okay  i stole it in the first place  but giving it back counts for something  doesn   t it .  the slate is clean  isn   t it .  well  acceptably grubby  yes .   the door opened slowly  and a young and nervous woman crept in  holding a plate of cold  boned chicken .  mr .  fusspot brightened up as she placed it in front of him .      sorry  can we get you a coffee or something .     said moist  as the girl headed back toward the door .   sacharissa stood up .     thank you  but no .  i   m on a deadline  mr .  lipwig .  i   m sure we   ll be talking again very soon .         i   m certain of it  miss cripslock     said moist .   she took a step toward him and lowered her voice .      do you know who that girl was .         no  i hardly know anyone yet .         so you don   t know if you can trust her .         trust her .      sacharissa sighed .     this is not like you  moist .  she   s just given a plate of food to the most valuable dog in the world .  a dog that some people might like to see dead .         why shouldn   t       moist began .  they both turned to mr .  fusspot  who was already licking the empty plate up the length of the table with an appreciative gronf gronf noise .      er   can you see yourself out .     said moist  hurrying toward the sliding plate .      if you   re in any doubt  stick your fingers down his throat .     said sacharissa from the door with what moist considered an inappropriate amount of amusement .   he grabbed the dog and hurried through the far door  after the girl .  it led to a narrow and not particularly well decorated corridor with a green door at the end  from which came the sound of voices .   moist barged through it .   in the small  neat kitchen beyond  a tableau greeted him .  the young woman was backed against a table  and a bearded man in a white suit was wielding a big knife .  they looked shocked .      what   s going on .     moist yelled .      er  er   you just ran through the door and shouted .     said the girl .     was something wrong .  i always give mr .  fusspot his appetizer about now .         and i   m doing his entr  e     said the man  bringing the knife down on a tray of offal .     it   s chicken necks stuffed with giblets  with his special toffee pudding for afters .  and who   s asking .         i   m the   i   m his owner     said moist  as haughtily as he could manage .   the chef removed his white hat .     sorry  sir  of course you are .  the gold suit and everything .  this is peggy  my daughter .  i   m aimsbury  sir .      moist had managed to calm down a little .     sorry     he said .     i was just worried that someone might try to poison mr .  fusspot           we were just talking about that     said aimsbury .     i thought that   hold on  you don   t mean me  do you .         no  no  certainly not .     said moist to the man still holding a knife .      well  all right     said aimsbury  mollified .     you   re new  sir  you   re not to know .  that cosmo kicked mr .  fusspot once .         he   d poison anyone  he would     said peggy .      but i go down to the market every day  sir  and select the little dog   s food myself .  and it   s stored downstairs in the cool room  and i have the only key .      moist relaxed .     you couldn   t knock out an omelet for me  could you .     he said .   the chef looked panicky .      that   s eggs  right .     he said nervously .     never really got involved with cooking eggs  sir .  he has a raw one in his steak tartare on fridays and mrs .  lavish used to have two raw ones in her gin and orange juice every morning  and that is about it between me n    eggs .  i   ve got a pig   s head sousing if you   d fancy some of that .  got tongue  hearts  marrowbone  sheep   s head  nice bit o    dewlap  melts  slaps  lights  liver  kidneys  beccles        in his youth  moist had been served a lot off that menu .  it was exactly the sort of food that one should serve to kids if one wanted them to grow up skilled in the arts of bare faced lying  sleight of hand  and camouflage .  as a matter of course  moist had hidden those strange  wobbly meats under his vegetables  on one occasion achieving a potato twelve inches high .   light dawned .      did you cook much for mrs .  lavish .     said moist .      nossir .  she lived on gin  vegetable soup  her morning pick me up  and           gin     said peggy firmly .      so you   re basically a dog chef .         canine  sir  if it   s all the same to you .  you may have read my book .  cooking with brains .     aimsbury said this rather hopelessly  and rightly so .      unusual path to follow     said moist .      well  sir  it enables me to   it   s safer   well  the truth is  i have an allergy  sir .     the chef sighed .     show him  peggy .      the girl nodded  and pulled a grubby card out of her pocket .      please don   t say this word  sir     she said  and held it up .   moist stared .      you just can   t avoid it in the catering business  sir     said aimsbury miserably .   this wasn   t the time  really wasn   t the time .  but if you weren   t interested in people  then you didn   t have the heart of a trickster .      you   re allergic to g   this stuff .     he said  correcting himself just in time .      no  sir .  the word  sir .  i can handle the actual alium in question  i can even eat it  but the sound of it  well        moist looked at the word again  and shook his head sadly .      so i have to shun restaurants  sir .         i can see that .  how are you with the word   leek .         yes  sir  i know where you   re going  i   ve been there .  far leek  tar lick   no effect at all .         just garlic  then   oh  sorry        aimsbury froze  with a distant expression on his face .      gods  i   m so sorry  i honestly didn   t mean       moist began .      i know     said peggy wearily     the word just forces its way out  doesn   t it .  he   ll be like this for fifteen seconds  then he   ll throw the knife straight ahead of him  and then he   ll speak in fluent quirmian for about four seconds  and then he   ll be fine .  here       she handed moist a bowl containing a large brown lump       you go back in there with the sticky toffee pudding and i   ll hide in the pantry .  i   m used to it .  and i can do you an omelet  too .     she pushed moist through the door and shut it behind him .   he put down the bowl  to the immediate and fully focused interest of mr .  fusspot .   watching a dog try to chew a large piece of toffee is a pastime fit for gods .  mr .  fusspot   s mixed ancestry had given him a dexterity of jaw that was truly awesome .  he somersaulted happily around the floor  making faces like a rubber gargoyle in a washing machine .   after a few seconds moist distinctly heard the twang of a knife vibrating in woodwork  followed by a scream of     nom d   une bouilloire .  pourquoi est ce que je suis hardiment ri sous cape    par les dieux .      there was a knock at the double doors  followed instantly by the entry of bent .  he was carrying a large  round box .      the suite is now ready for you  master     he announced .     that is to say  for mr .  fusspot .         the suite .         oh  yes .  the chairman has a suite .         oh  that suite .  he has to live above the shop  as it were .         indeed .  mr .  slant has been kind enough to give me a copy of the conditions of the legacy .  the chairman must sleep in the bank every night           but i   ve got a perfectly good apartment in the           ahem .  they are the conditions  sir     said bent .     you can have the bed  of course     he added generously .     mr .  fusspot will sleep in his in tray .  he was born in it  as a matter of interest .         i have to stay locked up here every night .      in fact  when moist saw the suite the prospect looked much less like a penance .  he had to open four doors even before he found a bed .  it had a dining room  a dressing room  a bathroom  a separate flushing privy  a spare bedroom  a passage to the office  which was a kind of public room  and a little private study .  the master bedroom contained a huge oak four poster with damask hangings  and moist fell in love with it at once .  he tried it for size .  it was so soft that it was like lying in a huge  warm puddle     he sat bolt upright .     did mrs .  lavish       he began  panic rising .      she died sitting at her desk  master     said bent soothingly  as he untied the string on the big round box .     we have replaced the chair .  by the way  she is to be buried tomorrow .  small gods  at noon  family members only  by request .         small gods .  that   s a bit down market for a lavish  isn   t it .         i believe a number of mrs .  lavish   s ancestors are buried there .  she did once tell me in a moment of confidence that she would be damned if she was going to be a lavish for all eternity .     there was a rustle of paper  and bent added     your hat  sir .         what hat .         for the master of the royal mint .     bent held it up .   it was a black silk hat .  once it had been shiny .  now it was mostly bald .  old tramps wore better hats .   it could have been designed to look like a big pile of dollars  it could have been a crown  it could have been set with small  jeweled scenes depicting embezzlement through the ages  the progression of negotiable currency from snot to little white shells and cows and all the way to gold .  it could have said something about the magic of money .  it could have been good .   a black top hat .  no style .  no style at all .      mr .  bent  can you arrange for someone to go over to the post office and get them to bring my stuff over here .     said moist  looking glumly at the wreck .      of course  master .         i think    mr .  lipwig    will be fine  thank you .         yes  sir .  of course .      moist sat down at the enormous desk and ran his hands lovingly across the worn green leather .   vetinari  damn him  had been right .  the post office had made him cautious and defensive .  he   d run out of challenges  run out of fun .   thunder grumbled  away in the distance  and the afternoon sun was being threatened by blue black clouds .  one of those heavy all night storms was rolling in from the plains .  there tended to be more crimes on rainy nights these days  according to the times .  apparently it was because of the werewolf in the watch  rain made smells hard to track .   after a while peggy brought him an omelet containing absolutely no mention of the word garlic .  and shortly after that  gladys arrived with his wardrobe .  all of it  including the door  carried under one arm .  it bounced off the walls and ceiling as she lumbered across the carpet and dropped it in the middle of the big bedroom floor .   moist went to follow her  but she held up her huge hands in horror .      no  sir .  let me come out first .      she clumped past him into the hallway .     that was nearly very bad     she said .   moist waited to see if anything more was going to be forthcoming  and then prompted     why  exactly .         a man and a young woman should not be in the same bedroom     said the golem with solemn certitude .      er   how old are you  gladys .     said moist carefully .      one thousand and fifty four years  mr .  lipwig .         er   right .  and you are made of clay .  i mean  everyone   s made of clay  in a manner of speaking  but  as a golem  you are  as it were  er   very made of clay           yes  mr .  lipwig  but i am not married .      moist groaned .     gladys  what did the counter girls give you to read this time .     he said .      it is lady deirdre waggon   s prudent advice for young women     said gladys .     it is most interesting .  it is how things are done .      she pulled a slim book out of the huge pocket in her dress .  it had a chintzy look .  moist sighed .  it was the kind of old fashioned etiquette book that   d tell you ten things not to do with your parasol .      i see     moist said .   he didn   t know how to explain .  even worse  he didn   t know what he   d be explaining .  golems were   golems .  big lumps of clay with the spark of life in them .  clothes .  what for .  even the male golems in the post office just had a lick of blue and gold paint to make them look smart   hold on  he was getting it now .  there were no male golems .  golems were golems  and had been happy to be just golems for thousands of years .  and now they were in modern ankh morpork  where all kinds of races and people and ideas were shaken up and it was amazing what dripped out of the bottle .   without a further word  gladys clumped across the hallway  turned around  and stood still .  the glow in her eyes settled down to a dull red .  and that was it .  she had decided to stay .   in his in tray  mr .  fusspot snored .   moist took out the half note that cosmo had given him .   desert island .  desert island .  i know i think best when i   m under pressure  but what exactly did i mean .   on a desert island gold is worthless .  food gets you through times of no gold much better than gold gets you through times of no food .  if it comes to that  gold is worthless in a gold mine  too .  the medium of exchange in a gold mine is the pickax .   hmm .  moist stared at the bill .  what does it need to make it worth ten thousand dollars .  the seal and signature of cosmo  that   s what .  everyone knows he   s good for it .  good for nothing but money  the bastard .   banks use these all the time  he thought .  any bank in the plains would give me the cash  withholding a commission  of course  because banks skim you top and bottom .  still  it   s much easier than lugging bags of coins around .  of course i   d have to sign it too  otherwise it wouldn   t be secure .   i mean  if it was blank after    pay     anyone could use it .   desert island  desert island   on a desert island a bag of vegetables is worth more than gold  in the city gold is more valuable than the bag of vegetables .   this is a sort of equation  yes .  where   s the value .   he stared .   it   s in the city itself .  the city says  in exchange for that gold  you will have all these things .  the city is the magician  the alchemist in reverse .  it turns worthless gold into   everything .   how much is ankh morpork worth .  add it all up .  the buildings  the streets  the people  the skills  the art in the galleries  the guilds  the laws  the libraries   billions .  no .  no money would be enough .   the city was one big gold bar .  what did you need to back the currency .  you just needed the city .  the city says a dollar is worth a dollar .   it was a dream  but moist was good at selling dreams .  and if you could sell the dream to enough people  no one dared to wake up .   in a little rack on the desk was an ink pad and two rubber stamps  showing the city   s coat of arms and the seal of the bank .  but in moist   s eyes  there was a haze of gold around these simple things  too .  they had value .      mr .  fusspot .     said moist .  the dog sat up in his tray  looking expectant .   moist pushed his sleeves back and flexed his fingers .      shall we make some money  mr .  chairman .     he said .   the chairman expressed unconditional agreement by means of going    woof .         pay the bearer the sum of one dollar    moist wrote on a piece of crisp bank paper .   he stamped the paper with both stamps  and gave the result a long  critical look .  it needed something more .  you had to give people a show .  the eye was everything .   it needed   a touch of gravitas  like the bank itself .  who   d bank in a wooden hut .   hmm .   ah  yes .  it was all about the city  right .  underneath  he wrote  in large ornate letters   ad urbem pertinet  and  in smaller letters  after some thought       promitto fore ut possessori postulanti nummum unum solvem  an apte satisfaciam .   signed moist von lipwig pp the chairman .        excuse me  mr .  chairman     he said  and lifted the dog up .  it was the work of a moment to press a front paw on the damp pad and leave a neat little footprint beside the signature .   moist went through this a dozen or more times  tucked five of the resulting bills under the blotter  and took the new money  and the chairman  for walkies .       cosmo lavish glared at his reflection in the mirror .   often he got it right in the glass three or four times in a row  and then   oh  the shame   he   d try it in public and people  if they were foolish enough to mention it  would say     have you got something in your eye .      he   d even had a device constructed that pulled at one eyebrow repeatedly  by means of clockwork .  he   d poisoned the man who made it  there and then  as he took delivery  chatting with him in his smelly little workshop while the stuff took hold .  he   d been nearly eighty and cosmo had been very careful  so it never came to the attention of the watch .  anyway  at that age it shouldn   t really count as murder  should it .  it was more like a favor  really .  and obviously he couldn   t risk the old fool blabbing happily to someone after cosmo had become patrician .   on reflection  he thought  he should have waited until he was certain that the eyebrow training machine was working properly .  it had given him a black eye before he   d made a few hesitant adjustments .   how did vetinari do it .  it was what had got him the patricianship  cosmo was sure .  well  a couple mysterious murders had helped  admittedly  but it was the way the man could raise an eyebrow that kept him there .   cosmo had studied vetinari for a long time .  it was easy enough  at social gatherings .  he   d cut out every picture that appeared in the times  too .  what was the secret that kept the man so powerful and unscathed .  how might he be understood .   and then one day he   d read in some book or other     if you want to understand a man  walk a mile in his shoes .      and he   d had a great and glorious idea     he sighed happily  and tugged at the black glove .   he   d been sent to the assassins    school as a matter of course .  it was the natural destination for young men of a certain class and accent .  he   d survived  and had made study of poisons  because he believed that was vetinari   s specialty  but the place had bored him .  it was so stylized now .  they   d got so wrapped up in some ridiculous concepts of honor and elegance that they seemed to forget what it was an assassin was supposed to do     the glove came free  and there it was .   oh yes     heretofore had done magnificently .   cosmo stared at the wondrous thing  moving his hand so that it caught the light .  light did strange things to stygium  sometimes it reflected silver  sometimes an oily yellow  sometimes it remained resolutely black .  and it was warm  even here .  in direct sunlight it would burst into flame .  it was a metal that might have been intended for those who move in shadow     the ring of vetinari .  vetinari   s signet ring .  such a small thing  and yet so powerful .   it was entirely without ornamentation  unless you counted the tiny border to the cartouche that surrounded the sharply incised and serifed single letter     v    he could only guess at all the things his secretary had to do to get it .  he   d had a replica made     reverse devised     whatever that was  from the wax seals it had so impressively stamped .  and there had been bribes  expensive ones  and hints of hasty meetings and cautious exchanges and last minute changes to get the replica exactly right     and here the real one was  on his finger .  very much on his finger  in fact .  from cosmo   s point of view  vetinari also had very small fingers for a man  and getting the ring over the knuckle had been a real effort .  heretofore had fretted about getting it enlarged  foolishly not realizing that this would completely ruin it .  the magic   and surely vetinari had a magic all his own   would leak out .  it wouldn   t be totally the real thing anymore .   yes  it had hurt like hell for a few days  but now he was floating above the pain  in a clear blue sky .   he prided himself on being no fool .  he   d have known at once if his secretary had tried to palm off a mere copy on him .  the shock that went up his arm when he slid the ring   all right  forced the ring over the knuckle   was enough to tell him that he had got the real thing .  already he could feel his thoughts getting sharper and faster .   he brushed a forefinger across the deeply cut v and looked up at drumk   at heretofore .      you seem concerned  heretofore     he said kindly .      the finger has gone very white  sir .  almost pale blue .  are you sure it doesn   t hurt .         not a bit .  i feel   utterly in control .  you seem very   worried lately  heretofore .  are you well .         um   fine  sir     said heretofore .      you must understand i sent mr .  cranberry with you for the best of reasons     said cosmo .     morpeth would have told someone  sooner or later  however much you paid him .         but the boy in the hat shop           exactly the same situation .  and it was a fair fight .  was that not so  cranberry .      cranberry   s shiny bald head looked up from his book .     yes  sir .  he was armed .         bu       heretofore began .      yes .     said cosmo calmly .      er   nothing  sir .  you are right  of course .     in possession of a small knife and very drunk .  heretofore wondered how much that counted against a professional killer .      i am  aren   t i     said cosmo in a kindly voice     and you are excellent at what you do .  as is cranberry .  i shall have another little quest for you soon  i feel it .  now do go and get your supper .      as heretofore opened the door  cranberry glanced up at cosmo  who shook his head almost imperceptibly .  unfortunately for heretofore  he had excellent peripheral vision .   he   s going to find out  he   s going to find out  he   s going to find oouuuttt .  .  .  he moaned to himself  as he scurried along the corridors .  it   s the damn ring  that   s what it is .  it   s not my fault vetinari has thin fingers .  he would have smelled a rat if the bloody thing had fitted .  why didn   t he let me have it made bigger .  hah  and if i had he   d have sent cranberry along later to murder the jeweler .  i know he   ll send him after me  i know it .   cranberry frightened heretofore .  the man was soft spoken and modestly dressed .  and when cosmo did not require his services he sat and read books all day .  that upset heretofore .  if the man was an illiterate thug  things would  in some strange way  have been better  more   understandable .  the man apparently had no body hair  either  and the gleam from his head could blind you in sunlight .   and it had all begun with a lie .  why had cosmo believed him .  because he was mad  but regrettably not all the time  he was a sort of hobby madman .  he had this   thing about lord vetinari .   heretofore didn   t spot that at first  he just wondered why cosmo had fussed about his height at the job interview .  and when heretofore had told him he   d worked at the palace  he was hired on the spot .   and that was the lie  right there  although heretofore preferred to think of it as an unfortunate conjunction of two truths .   heretofore had indeed been employed for a while at the palace  and thus far cosmo had not found out that this was as a gardener .  he had been a minor secretary at the armorers    guild before that  which was why he   d felt confident in saying    i was a minor secretary and i was employed at the palace     a phrase that he felt lord vetinari would have examined with more care than the delighted cosmo had done .  and now here he was  advising a very important and clever man on the basis of as much rumor as he could remember or  in desperation  make up .  and he was getting away with it .  in his everyday business dealings  cosmo was cunning  ruthless  and sharp as a tack  but when it came to anything to do with vetinari  he was as credulous as a child .   heretofore noticed that his boss occasionally called him by the name of the patrician   s secretary  but he was being paid fifty dollars a month  food and his own bed thrown in  and for that kind of money he   d answer to    daisy .     well  perhaps not daisy  but certainly clive .   and then the nightmare had begun  and in the way of nightmares  everyday objects took on a sinister importance .   cosmo had asked for an old pair of vetinari   s boots .   that had been a poser .  heretofore had never been inside the actual palace  but he   d got into the grounds that night by scaling the fence next to the old green garden gate  met one of his old mates  who had to stay up all night to keep the hothouse boilers going  had a little chat  and the following night returned for a pair of old but serviceable black boots  size eight  and information from the boot boy that his lordship wore down the left heel slightly more than the right .   heretofore couldn   t see any difference in the boots presented  and no one was actually claiming as a fact that these were the fabled boots of vetinari  but well worn but still useful boots floated down from the upper floors to the servants    quarters on a tide of noblesse oblige  and if these weren   t the boots of the man himself then they had almost certainly  at the very least  sometimes been in the same room as his feet .   heretofore handed over ten dollars for them and spent an evening wearing down the left heel enough to be noticeable .  cosmo paid him fifty dollars without flinching  although he did wince when he tried them on .      if you want to understand a man  walk a mile in his shoes     he   d said  hobbling the length of his office .  what insight he   d glean if they were the man   s under butler   s shoes  heretofore couldn   t guess at  but after half an hour  cosmo rang for a basin of cold water and some soothing herbs and the shoes had not made an appearance since .   and then there had been the black skullcap .  that one had been the one stroke of luck in this whole business .  it was even genuine .  it was a safe bet that vetinari bought them from bolters in the maul  and heretofore had cased the place  entered when the senior partners were at lunch  spoke to the impecunious youth who worked the steamy cleaning and stretching machines in the back room   and found that one had been sent in for cleaning .  heretofore walked out with it  uncleaned  leaving the young man extremely pecunious and with instructions to wash a new cap for return to the palace .   cosmo was beside himself  and wanted to know all the details .   next evening  it turned out that the pecunious youth spent the evening in a bar and died outside in a drunken brawl around midnight  short of money and even shorter of breath .  heretofore   s room was next to cranberry   s .  on reflection  he   d heard the man come in late that night .   and now there was the signet ring .  heretofore had told cosmo that he could get a replica made and use his contacts   his very expensive contacts   at the palace to get it swapped for the real thing .  he   d been paid five thousand dollars .   five thousand dollars .   and the boss was overjoyed .  overjoyed and mad .  he   d got a fake ring but he swore it had the spirit of vetinari flowing in it .  perhaps it did  because cranberry became part of the arrangement .  if you got drawn into cosmo   s little hobby  heretofore realized too late  you died .   he reached his room  darted inside  and shut the door .  then he leaned on it .   he ought to run  right now .  his savings by now could buy a lot of distance .  but the fear subsided a little as he collected his thoughts .   they told him  relax  relax .  the watch hadn   t come knocking yet  had they .  cranberry was a professional  and the boss was full of gratitude .   so   why not one last trick .  make some real money .  what could he    obtain    that the boss would pay him another five thousand for .   something simple but impressive  that would be the trick  and by the time he found out   if he ever did   heretofore would be on the other side of the continent  with a new name and suntanned beyond recognition .   yes   the very thing         the sun was hot  and so were the dwarfs .  they were mountain dwarfs and were not at home under open skies .   and what were they here for .  the king wanted to know if anything valuable was taken out the hole that the golems were digging for the mad smoking woman  but they weren   t allowed to set foot on it  because that would be trespassing .  so they sat in the shade and sweated  while  about once a day  the mad smoking woman who smoked all the time came and laid   things on a crude trestle table in front of them .  the things had this in common  they were dull .   there was nothing to mine here  everyone knew .  it was barren silt and sand all the way down .  there was no fresh water .  such plants as survived here stored winter rain in swollen  hollow roots  or lived off the moisture in the sea mist .  the place contained nothing of interest .  and what came out of the long sloping tunnel bore this out to the point of boredom .   there were bones of old ships  and occasionally the bones of old sailors .  there were a couple of coins  one silver  one gold  which were not dull enough and were duly confiscated .  there were broken pots and pieces of statue  which were puzzled over  part of an iron cauldron  an anchor with a few links of chain .   it was clear  the dwarfs considered as they sat in the shade  that nothing came here but by boat .  but remember  in matters of commerce and gold  never trust anyone who could see over your helmet .   and then there were the golems .  they hated golems  because they moved silently  for all their weight  and looked like trolls .  they arrived and departed all the time  fetching timbers from who knew where  marching down into the dark     and then one day golems came pouring out of the hole  there was a lengthy discussion  and the smoking woman marched over to the watchers .  they watched her nervously  as fighters do when approached by a self confident civilian they know they   re not allowed to kill .   in broken dwarfish she told them that the tunnel had collapsed  and she was going to leave .  everything they   d dug out  she said  were gifts for the king .  and she left  taking the wretched golems with her .   that was last week .  since then the tunnel had completely fallen in and the blowing sand had covered everything .       the money looked after itself .  it sailed down the centuries  buried in paperwork  hidden behind lawyers  groomed  invested  diverted  converted  laundered  dried  ironed and polished  and kept safe from harm and taxes  and  above all  kept safe from the lavishes themselves .  they knew their descendents   they   d raised them  after all   and so  the money came with bodyguards of trustees  managers  and covenants  disgorging only a measured amount of itself to the next generation  enough to maintain the lifestyle with which their name had become synonymous and with a bit left over for them to indulge in the family tradition of fighting among themselves over  yes  the money .   now they were arriving  each family branch and often each individual with their own lawyer and bodyguards  being careful about who they deigned to notice  just in case they inadvertently smiled at someone they were currently suing .  as a family  people said  the lavishes got along like a bagful of cats .  cosmo had watched them at the funeral  and they spent all their time watching one another  very much like cats  each one waiting for someone else to attack .  but even so  it would have been a decently dignified occasion if only that moron nephew the old bitch had allowed to live in the cellar hadn   t turned up in a grubby white coat and a yellow rain hat and kept on blubbing all through the ceremony .  he had completely spoiled the occasion for everyone .   but now the funeral was over and the lavishes were doing what they always did after funerals  which was talk about the money .   you couldn   t sit lavishes around a table .  cosmo had set out small tables in a pattern that represented to the best of his knowledge the current state of the alliances and minor fratricidal wars  but there was a lot of shifting and scraping and threats of legal action before people settled down .  behind  the alert ranks of their lawyers paid careful attention  earning a total of a dollar every four seconds .   apparently  the only relative that vetinari had was an aunt  cosmo mused .  that man had all the luck .  when he was vetinari  there would have to be a culling .      ladies and gentlemen     he said  when the hissing and name calling had died away     i am so glad to see so many of you here today           liar .         especially you  pucci     said cosmo  smiling at his sister .  vetinari didn   t have a sister like pucci  either .  no one did  cosmo was prepared to bet .  she was a fiend in vaguely human shape .      you   ve still got something wrong with your eyebrow  you know     said pucci .  she had a table by herself  a voice like a saw encountering a nail  with a slight additional touch of foghorn  and was always referred to as    a society beauty     which showed just how rich the lavishes were .  cut in half  she might make two society beauties  but not  at that point  very beautiful ones .  while it was said that men she had spurned jumped off bridges in despair  the only person known to have said this was pucci herself .      i   m sure you all know       cosmo began .      thanks to your side of the family   s total incompetence you have lost us the bank .      that came from the far corner of the room  but it triggered a rising chorus of complaint .      we are all lavishes here  josephine     he said sternly .     some of us were even born a lavish .      that didn   t work .  it ought to have done .  it would have done for vetinari  cosmo was sure .  but for cosmo  it only upset people .  the growls of objection got louder .      some of us make a better job of it .     snapped josephine .  she was wearing a necklace of emeralds  and they reflected a greenish light on her face .  cosmo was impressed .   whenever possible  lavishes married distant cousins  but it wasn   t uncommon for a few  every generation  to marry outside  in order to avoid the whole    three thumbs    situation .  the women found handsome husbands who did what they were told  while the men found wives who  amazingly  were remarkably good at picking up the petulance and shaved monkey touchiness that was the mark of a true lavish .   josephine sat down with a poisonous look of satisfaction at the muttered chorus of agreement .  she sprang up again  for an encore     and what do you intend to do about this unforgivable situation .  your branch has put a mountebank in control of our bank .  again .      pucci spun in her seat .     how dare you say that about father .         and how dare you say that about mr .  fusspot .     said cosmo .   it would have worked for vetinari  he knew it .  it would have made josephine look silly and raised cosmo   s stock in the room .  it would have worked for vetinari  who could raise his eyebrow like a visual rim shot .      what .  what .  what are you talking about .     said josephine .     don   t be so silly  child .  i   m talking about this lipwig creature .  he   s a postman  for goodness    sake .  why haven   t you offered him money .         i have     said cosmo  and added for his inner ear  i   ll remember    child     you whey faced old boot .  when i am a master of the eyebrow we shall see what you say then .      and .         i believe he is not interested in money .         nonsense .         what about the little doggie .     said an elderly voice .     what happens if it passes away  gods forbid .         the bank comes back to us  aunt careful     said cosmo to a very small old lady in black lace  who was engaged in some embroidery .      no matter how the little doggie dies .     said aunt carefulness lavish  paying fastidious attention to her needlework .     there is always the option of poison  i am sure .      with an audible woosh  aunt careful   s lawyer rose to his feet and said     my client wishes to make it clear that she is merely referring to the general availability of noxious substances in general and this is not intended to be and in no way should be taken as an espousal of any illegal course of action .      he sat down again  fee earned .      regrettably  the watch would be all over us like cheap chain mail     said cosmo .      watchmen in our bank .  shut the door on them .         times have moved on  auntie .  we can   t do that anymore .         when your great grandfather pushed his brother over the balcony the watch even took the body away for five shillings and a pint of ale all round .         yes  auntie .  lord vetinari is the patrician now .         and he   d allow watchmen to clump around in our bank .         without a doubt  auntie .         then he is no gentleman     the aunt observed sadly .      he lets vampires and werewolves into the watch     said miss tarantella lavish .     it   s disgusting  the way they   re allowed to walk the streets like real people .         and something went ping .  in cosmo   s memory .   he   s just like real people  said the voice of his father .      this is your problem  cosmo lavish .     said josephine  unwilling to see targets switched .     it was your wretched father who           shut up     said cosmo calmly .     shut up .  and those emeralds do not suit you  by the way .      this was unusual .  lavishes might sue and conspire and belittle and slander  but there was such a thing as good manners  after all .   in cosmo   s head there was another ping  and his father saying  and he   s managed to hide what he is so well and at great pain .   what he was is probably not even there anymore .  but you   d better know  in case he starts acting funny        my father rebuilt the business of the bank     said cosmo  the voice still ringing in his head as josephine drew breath for a tirade     and you all let him .  yes  you let him .  you didn   t care what he did so long as the bank was available to you for all your little schemes  the ones we so carefully conceal and don   t talk about .  he bought out all the small shareholders  and you didn   t mind so long as you got your dividends .  it was just a shame that his choice in chums was flawed           not as bad as his choice of that upstart music hall girl .     said josephine .         although his choice in his last wife was not     cosmo went on .     topsy was cunning  devious  ruthless  and merciless .  the problem i have is simply that she was better at all this than you are .  and now i must ask you all to leave .  i am going to get our bank back .  do see yourselves out .      he got up  walked to the door  shut it carefully behind  and then ran like hell for his study  where he stood with his back to the door and gloated  an exercise he had just the face for .   good old dad .  of course  that little talk had been back when he was ten  and didn   t have his own lawyer yet  and hadn   t fully embraced the lavish tradition of prickly and guarded involvement .  but dad had been sensible .  he hadn   t just been giving cosmo advice  he   d been giving him ammunition which could be used against the others .  what else was a father for .   mr .  bent was   not just mr .  bent .  he was something out of nightmares .  at the time the revelation had scared young cosmo  and later on he   d been ready to sue his father over those sleepless nights  in the very best lavish tradition  but he   d hesitated and that was just as well .  it would all have come out in court and he   d have thrown away a wonderful gift .   so the lipwig fellow thought he controlled the bank  did he .  well  you couldn   t run the bank without mavolio bent  and by this time tomorrow he  cosmo lavish  would own mr .  bent .  hmm  yes   leave it perhaps a little longer .  another day of dealing with lipwig   s bizarre recklessness would wind up poor mr .  bent to the point where cranberry   s special powers of persuasion would hardly be required .  oh  yes .   cosmo pushed his eyebrow up .  he was getting the hang of it  he was sure .  he   d been just like vetinari out there  hadn   t he .  yes  he had .  the look on the family   s face when he   d told josephine to shut up .  even the recollection made his spine tingle     was this the time .  yes  just for a minute  perhaps .  he deserved it     he unlocked a drawer in his desk  reached inside  and pressed the hidden button .  on the other side of his desk a secret compartment slid out .  from it  cosmo took a small black skullcap that seemed as good as new .  heretofore was a genius .   cosmo lowered the cap onto his head with great solemnity .   someone knocked on the study door .  this was pointless  since they then slammed it open .      locking yourself in your room again  bro .     said pucci triumphantly .   at least cosmo had strangled the impulse to snatch the cap from his head as if he   d been caught doing something dirty .      it was not  in fact  locked  as you see     he said     and you are forbidden to come within fifteen yards of me .  i have an injunction .         and you are not allowed to be within twenty yards of me  so you broke it first     said pucci  pulling up a chair .  she straddled it heavily and rested her arms on the back .  the wood creaked .      i wasn   t the one who moved  i think .         well  cosmically it   s all the same     said pucci .     you know  that   s a dangerous obsession you have there .      now cosmo took off the cap .      i   m simply trying to get inside the man     he said .      a very dangerous obsession .         you know what i mean .  i want to know how his mind works .         and this .     pucci said  waving a hand at the large picture that hung on the wall opposite the desk .      william pouter   s man with dog .  it   s a painting of vetinari .  notice how the eyes follow you around the room .         the dog   s nose follows me around the room .  vetinari has a dog .         had .  wuffles .  died some time ago .  there   s a little grave in the palace grounds .  he goes there alone once a week and puts a dog biscuit on it .         vetinari does that .         yes .         vetinari the cool  heartless  calculating tyrant .     said pucci .      indeed .         you   re lying to your sweet dear sister  yes .         you can choose to believe that if you wish .     cosmo exulted  deep inside .  he loved to see that irate chicken expression of furious curiosity on his sister   s face .      information like that is worth money     she said .      indeed .  and i   m only telling you because it   s useless unless you know where he goes  at what time  and on which day .  it just may be  dear sweet pucci  that what you call my obsession is  in fact  of great practical use .  i watch  study  and learn .  and i believe that moist von lipwig and vetinari must share some dangerous secret which could even           but you just weighed in and offered lipwig a bribe .     you could say this about pucci  she was easy to confide in  because she never bothered to listen .  she used the time to think about what to say next .      a ridiculously small one .  and a threat  too .  and so now he thinks he knows all about me     said cosmo  not even trying not to look smug .     and i know nothing about him  which is even more interesting .  how did he turn up out of nowhere and immediately get one of the highest jobs in           what the hell is that .     demanded pucci  whose massive inquisitiveness was also hampered by the attention span of a kitten .  she was pointing at the little diorama in front of the window .      that .  oh           looks like an ornamental window box .  is it toytown .  what   s that all about .  tell me right now .      cosmo sighed .  he didn   t actually dislike his sister   well  not more than the natural basic feeling of irksomeness all lavishes felt for one another   but it was hard to like that loud  nasal  perpetually irritated voice  which treated anything pucci didn   t immediately understand  which was practically everything  as a personal affront .      it is an attempt to achieve  by means of scale models  a view similar to that seen from the oblong office by lord vetinari     he explained .     it helps me think .         that   s crazy .  what kind of dog biscuit .     said pucci .   information also traveled through pucci   s apprehension at different speeds .  it must be all that hair  thought cosmo .      tracklement   s yums     he said .     the bone shaped ones that come in five different colors .  but he never leaves a yellow one  because wuffles didn   t like them .         you know they say vetinari is a vampire .     said pucci  going off on a tangent to a tangent .      do you believe it .     said cosmo .      because he   s tall and thin and wears black .  i think it takes a bit more than that .         and is secretive and calculating .     said cosmo .      you don   t believe it  do you .         no  and it wouldn   t make any real difference if he was  would it .  but there are other people with more   dangerous secrets .  dangerous to them  i mean .         mr .  lipwig .         he could be one  yes .      pucci   s eyes lit up .     you know something  don   t you .         not exactly  but i think i know where there is something to be known .         where .         do you really want to know .         of course i do .         well  i have no intention of telling you     said cosmo  smiling .     don   t let me detain you .     he added  as pucci stormed out of the room .   don   t let me detain you .  what a wonderful phrase vetinari had devised .  the jangling double meaning set up undercurrents of uneasiness in the most innocent of minds .  the man had found ways of bloodless tyranny that put the rack to shame .   what a genius .  and there  but for an eyebrow  went cosmo lavish .   he would have to make good the failings of cruel nature .  the mysterious lipwig was the key to vetinari  and the key to lipwig     it was time to talk to mr .  bent .       chapter       spending spree inadvisability of golem back rubs giving away money some observations on the nature of trust mr .  bent has a visitor one of the family      where do you test a bankable idea .  not in a bank  that was certain .  you needed to test it where people paid far more attention to money  and juggled their finances in a world of constant risk where a split second decision meant the difference between triumphant profit or ignominious loss .  generically it was known as the real world  but one of its proprietary names was tenth egg street .   the boffo novelty and joke shop  in tenth egg street  j .  proust prop .   was a haven for everyone who thought that fart powder was the last word in humor  which in many respects it is .  it had caught moist   s eye  though  as a source of material for disguises and other useful things .   moist had always been careful about disguises .  a mustache that could come off at a tug had no place in his life .  but since he had the world   s most forgettable face  a face that was still a face in the crowd even when it was by itself  it helped  sometimes  to give people something to tell the watch about .  spectacles were an obvious choice  but moist achieved very good results with his own design of nose and ear wigs .  show a man a pair of ears that small songbirds had apparently nested in  watch the polite horror in his eyes  and you could be certain that would be all he would remember .   now  of course  he was an honest man  but part of him felt it necessary that he should keep his hand in  just in case .   today he bought a pot of glue and a large jar of fine gold sprinkles  because he could see a use for them .      that will be   p  mr .  lipwig     said mr .  proust .     any new stamps coming along .         one or two  jack     said moist .     how   s ethel .  and little roger     he added  after only a moment   s shuffle through the files in his head .      very well  thank you for asking .  can i get you anything else .     proust added hopefully  in case moist might have a sudden recollection that life would be considerably improved by the purchase of a dozen false noses .   moist glanced at the array of masks  scary rubber hands  and joke noses  and considered his needs satisfied .      only my change  jack     he said  and carefully laid one of his new creations on the counter .     just give me half a dollar .      proust stared at it as if it might explode or vent some mind altering gas .      what   s this  sir .         a note for a dollar .  a dollar bill .  it   s the latest thing .         do i have to sign it or anything .         no  that   s the interesting bit .  it   s a dollar .  it can be anyone   s .         i   d like it to be mine  thank you .         it is  now     said moist .     but you can use it to buy things .         there   s no gold in it     said the shopkeeper  picking it up and holding it away from his body  just in case .      well  if i paid in pennies and shillings there would be no gold in them either  right .  as it is  you   re fifteen pence ahead  and that   s a good place to be  agreed .  and that note is worth a dollar .  if you take it along to my bank  they   ll give you a dollar for it .         but i   ve already got a dollar .  er   haven   t i .     proust added .      good man .  so why not go out in the street and spend it right now .  come on  i want to see how it works .         is this like the stamps  mr .  lipwig .     said proust  scrambling for something he could understand .     people sometimes pay me in stamps  me doing a lot of mail order           yes .  yes .  exactly .  think of it as a big stamp .  look  i   ll tell you what  this is an introductory offer .  spend that dollar and i   ll give you another bill for a dollar  so that you   ll still have a dollar .  so what are you risking .         only if this is  like  one of the first dollar bills  right   well  my lad bought some of the first stamps you did  right  and now they   re worth a mint  so if i hang on to it  it   ll be worth money someday           it   s worth money now .     moist wailed .  that was the trouble with slow people .  give him a fool any day .  slow people took some time to catch up  but when they did they rolled right over you .      yes  but  see      and here the shopkeeper grinned what he probably thought was an artful grin  which  in fact  made him look like mr .  fusspot halfway through a toffee      you   re a sly one with them stamps  mr .  lipwig  bringin    out different ones all the time .  my granny says if it   s true a man   s got enough iron in his blood to make a nail then you   ve got enough brass in your neck to make a doorknob  no offense meant  she speaks her mind does my granny           i   ve made the mail run on time  haven   t i .         oh  yes  gran says you may be a slippery jim but you get things done  no doubt about it           right .  let   s spend the damn dollar  then  shall we .     is it some kind of duplex magical power i have  he wondered  that lets old ladies see right through me but like what they see .   and thus mr .  proust decided to hazard his dollar in the shop next door  on an ounce of jolly sailor pipe tobacco  some mints  and a copy of what novelty .  and mr .     natty    poleforth  once the exercise was explained to him  accepted the note and took it across the road to mr .  drayman the butcher  who cautiously accepted it  after having things set out fair and square for him  in payment for some sausages and also gave moist a bone    for your little doggie .     it was more than likely that mr .  fusspot had never seen a real bone before .  he circled it carefully  waiting for it to squeak .   tenth egg street was a street of small traders who sold small things in small quantities for small sums on small profits .  in a street like that  you had to be small minded .  it wasn   t the place for big ideas .  you had to look at the detail .  these were men who saw far more farthings than dollars .   some of the other shopkeepers were already pulling down the shutters and closing up for the day .  drawn by the ankh morporkian   s instinct for something interesting  the traders drifted over to see what was going on .  they all knew one another .  they all dealt with one another .  and everyone knew moist von lipwig  the man in the gold suit .  the notes were examined with much care and solemn discussion .      it   s just an iou or marker  really .         all right  but supposing you needed the money .         but  correct me if i   m wrong  isn   t the iou the money .         all right then  who owes it to you .         er   jack here  because   no  hang on   it is the money  right .      moist grinned as the discussion wobbled back and forth .  whole new theories of money were growing here like mushrooms  in the dark and based on bullshit .  but these were men who counted every half farthing and slept at night with the cash box under their bed .  they   d weigh out flour and raisins and rainbow sprinkles with their eyes ferociously focused on the scale   s pointer  because they were men who lived in the margins .  if he could get the idea of paper money past them then he was home and  if not dry  then at least merely moist .      so you think these might catch on .     he said  during a lull .   the consensus was  yes  they could  but should look    fancier     in the words of natty poleforth      you know  with more fancy lettering and similar .      moist agreed  and handed a note to every man  as a souvenir .  it was worth it .      and if it all goes wahoonie shaped     said mr .  proust     you   ve still got the gold  right .  locked up down there in the cellar .         oh  yes  you   ve got to have the gold     said mr .  drayman .   there was a general murmur of agreement  and moist felt his spirits slump .      but i thought we   d all agreed that you don   t need the gold .     he said .  in fact  they hadn   t  but it was worth a try .      ah  yes  but it   s got to be there somewhere     said mr .  drayman .      it keeps banks honest     said mr .  poleforth  in the tone of plonking certainty that is the hallmark of that most knowledgeable of beings  the man in the pub .      but i thought you understood     said moist .     you don   t need the gold .         right  sir  right     said mr .  poleforth soothingly .     just so long as it   s there .         er   do you happen to know why it has to be there .     said moist .      keeps banks honest     said mr .  poleforth  on the basis that truth is achieved by repetition .  and with nods all round  this was the feeling of tenth egg street .  so long as the gold was somewhere  it kept banks honest and everything was okay .  moist felt humbled by such faith .  if the gold was somewhere  herons would no longer eat frogs  either .  but  in fact  there was no power in the world that could keep a bank honest if it didn   t want to be .   still  not a bad start to his first day  even so .  he could build on it .   it began to rain  not hard  but the kind of fine rain where you can almost get away without an umbrella .  no cabs bothered to trawl tenth egg street for trade  but there was one at the curb in losing street  the horse sagging in the harness  the driver hunched into his greatcoat  the lamps flickering in the dusk .  with the rain getting to the blobby  soaking stage  it was a sight for damp feet .   he hurried over  climbed in  and a voice in the gloom said     good evening  mr .  lipwig .  it   s so nice to meet you at last .  i   m pucci .  i   m sure we will be friends               now  you see  that was good     said sergeant colon of the watch  as the figure of moist von lipwig disappeared around the corner  still accelerating .     he went right through the cab window without touching the sides and bounced off that bloke creepin    up .  very nice roll as he landed  i thought  and he still had hold of the little dog the whole time .  done it before  i shouldn   t wonder .  nevertheless  i   m forced  on balance  to consider him a twit .         the first cab     said corporal nobbs  shaking his head .     oh dear  oh dear  oh dear .  i would not have thought it of a man like him .         my point exactly     said colon .     when you know you   ve got enemies at large  never  ever get in the first cab .  fact of life .  even things what live under rocks know it .      they watched the former creeper gloomily picking up the remains of his iconograph  while pucci screamed at him from the coach .      i bet when the first cab was built  no one dared to get into it  eh  sarge .     said nobby happily .     i bet the first cabby used to go home every night starvin    on account of everyone knowin     right .         oh  no  nobby  people with no enemies at large would be okay  nobby .  now let   s go and report .         what does it mean    at large     anyway     said nobby as they ambled toward the chitling street watch house and the certain prospect of a cup of hot  sweet tea .      it means large enemies  nobby .  it   s as clear as the nose on your face .  especially yours .         well  she   s a large girl  that pucci lavish .         and nasty enemies to have  that family     colon opined .     what   s the odds .         odds  sarge .     said nobby innocently .      you   re runnin    a book  nobby .  you always run a book .         can   t get any takers  sarge .  for   gone conclusion     said nobby .      ah  right .  sensible .  lipwig goin    to be found lyin    in chalk by sunday .         no  sarge .  everyone thinks he   ll win .          moist woke up in the big  soft bed and strangled a scream .   pucci .  aaagh .  and in a state of what the delicately inclined called    dishabille .     he   d always wondered what dishabille looked like  but he   d never expected to see so much of it in one go .  even now  some of his memory cells were still trying to die .   but he wouldn   t be moist von lipwig if a certain amount of insouciance didn   t rise to heal the wounds .  he   d got away  after all .  oh  yes .  it wasn   t as though it was the first window he   d jumped through .  and the sound of pucci   s scream of rage was almost as loud as the crack the man   s iconograph made as it hit the cobbles .  the ol    honey trap game .  hah .  but it really was time he did something illegal  just to get his mind back to crooked .  he wouldn   t have got into the first cab a year ago  that was for sure .  mind you  it would be a strange jury that believed he could be attracted to pucci lavish  he couldn   t see that standing up in court .   he got up  dressed  and listened hopefully for signs of life from the kitchen .  in their absence  he made himself some black coffee .   armed with this  he made his way into the office  where mr .  fusspot dozed in his in tray and the official top hat sat  accusingly black .   ah  yes  he was going to do something about that  wasn   t he .   he reached into his pocket and pulled out the little pot of glue  which was one of the convenient ones with a brush in the lid  and after some careful spreading began to pour the glittering flakes as smoothly as he could .   he was still engrossed in this exercise when gladys loomed in his vision like an eclipse of the sun  holding what turned out to be a bacon and egg sandwich two feet long and one eighth of an inch thick .  she   d also picked up his copy of the times .   he groaned .   he   d made the front page .  he usually did .  it was his athletic mouth .  it ran away with him whenever he saw a notebook .   er   he   d made page two  as well .  oh  and the lead editorial .  bugger  even the political cartoon  too  the one that was never much of a laugh .     first urchin     why ain   t ankh morpork like a desert island .          second urchin        cos when yer on a desert island the sharks can   t bite yer .          it was side splitting .   his bleary eyes strayed back to the editorial .  they  on the other hand  could be quite funny  since they were based on the assumption that the world would be a much better place if it was run by journalists .  they were     what .  what was this .     time to consider the unthinkable   a wind of change blowing through the vaults at last   undoubted success of the new post office   stamps already a de facto currency   fresh ideas needed   youth at the helm       youth at the helm .  this from william de worde  who was almost certainly the same age as moist but wrote editorials that suggested his bum was stuffed with tweed .   it was sometimes hard to tell in all the ponderousness what de worde actually thought about anything  but it appeared through the rolling fog of polysyllables that the times believed moist von lipwig to be  on the whole and all things considered  taking the long view and one thing with another  probably the right man in the right job .   he was aware of gladys behind him when red light glinted off the brasswork on the desk .      you are very tense  mr .  lipwig     she said .      yeah  right     said moist  reading the editorial again .  ye gods  the man really did write as though he was chipping the letters in stone .      there was an interesting article about back rubs in the ladies    own magazine     gladys went on .  later on  moist felt that perhaps he should have heeded the hopeful tone in her voice .  but he was thinking  not just carved  but with big serifs  too .      they are very good at relieving tension caused by the hurly burly of modern life     gladys intoned .      well  we certainly don   t want any of that     said moist  and everything went black .   the strange thing was  he thought  when peggy and aimsbury had brought him round and clicked his bones back into the appropriate sockets  that he actually felt a lot better .  perhaps that was the idea .  perhaps the hideous white hot pain was there to make you realize that there were worse things in the world than the occasional twinge .      i am very sorry     said gladys .     i did not know that was going to happen .  it said in the magazine that the recipient would experience a delightful frisson .         i don   t think that means you should be able to see your own eyeball     said moist  rubbing his neck .  gladys   s eyes dimmed so much that he was moved to add     i feel much better now  though .  it   s so nice to look down and not see my heels .         don   t you listen to him  it wasn   t that bad     said peggy  with sisterly fellow feeling .     men always make a big fuss over a little pain .         they are just big cuddly babies  really     said gladys .  that caused a thoughtful pause .      where did that come from .     said moist .      the information was imparted to me by glenda at the stamp counter .         well  from now on i don   t want you to        the big doors swung open .  they let in a hubbub from the floors below  and riding the noise  like some kind of aural surfer  was mr .  bent  saturnine and far too shiny for this time of the morning .      good morning  master     he said icily .     the street outside is full of people .  and might i take this opportunity to congratulate you on disproving a theory currently much in vogue at unseen university .         huh .     said moist .      there are  some risible people like to suggest  an infinite number of universes  in order to allow everything that may happen a place to happen in .  this is  of course  nonsense  which they entertain only because they believe words are the same as reality .  now  however  i can disprove the theory  since in such an infinity of worlds there would have to be one where i would applaud your recent actions and  let me assure you  sir  infinity is not that big .     mr .  bent drew himself up .     people are hammering on the doors .  they want to close their accounts .  i told you banking was about trust and confidence .         oh dear     said moist .      they are asking for gold .         i thought that   s what you prom           it is only a metaphorical promise .  i told you  it is based on the understanding that no one will actually demand it .         how many people want to withdraw their money .     said moist .      nearly twenty .         then they are making a lot of noise  aren   t they .      mr .  bent looked uncomfortable .      well  there are some others     he said .     a few misguided people are seeking to open accounts  but           how many .         about two or three hundred  but           opening accounts  you say .     said moist .  mr .  bent was squirming .      only for trifling sums  a few dollars here and there     he said dismissively .     it would appear that they think you have    something up your sleeve .        the inverted commas shuddered  like a well bred girl picking up a dead vole .   some of moist recoiled .  but part of him began to feel the wind on his face .      well  let   s not disappoint them  shall we .     he said  picking up the gold top hat  which was still a bit sticky .  bent glared at it .      the other banks are furious  you know     he said  high stepping hurriedly after moist as the master of the royal mint headed for the stairs .      is that good or bad .     said moist over his shoulder .     listen  what   s the rule about bank lending .  i heard it once .  it   s about interest .         do you mean    borrow at one half  lend at two  go home at three    .     said bent .      right .  i   ve been thinking about that .  we could shave those numbers  couldn   t we .         this is ankh morpork .  a bank has to be a fortress .  that is expensive .         but we could alter them a bit  couldn   t we .  and we don   t pay interest on balances of less than a hundred dollars  correct .         yes  that is so .         well  from now on anyone can open an account with five dollars and we   ll start paying interest a lot earlier .  that   ll smooth out the lumps in the mattresses  won   t it .         master  i protest .  banking is not a game .         dear mr .  bent  it is a game .  and it   s an old game  called    what can we get away with .         a cheer went up .  they had reached an open landing that overlooked the hall of the bank like a pulpit overlooks the sinners  and a field of faces stared up at moist in silence for a moment .  then someone called out     are you going to make us all rich  mr .  lipwig .      oh damn  thought moist  why are they all here .      well  i   m going to do my best to get my hands on your money .     he promised .   this got a cheer .  moist wasn   t surprised .  tell someone you were going to rob them and all that happened was that you got a reputation as a truthful man .   the waiting ears sucked at his tongue  and his common sense went and hid .  it heard his mouth add     and so i can get more of it  i think   that is to say  the chairman thinks   that we should be looking at one percent interest on all accounts that have five dollars in them for a whole year .      there was a choking sound from the chief cashier  but no great stir from the crowd  most of whom were of the sock under the mattress persuasion .  in fact  the news did not appear to please .  then someone raised his hand and said     that   s a lot to pay just to have you stick our money in your cellar  isn   t it .         no  it   s what i   ll pay you to let me stick your money in my cellar for a year     said moist .      you will .         certainly .  trust me .      the inquirer   s face twisted into the familiar mask of a slow thinker trying to speed up .      so where   s the catch .     he managed .   everywhere  thought moist .  for one thing  i won   t be storing it in my cellar  i   ll be storing it in someone else   s pocket .  but you really don   t need to know that right now .      no catch     he said .     if you put a hundred dollars on deposit  then after a year it   ll be worth one hundred and one dollars .         that   s all very well for you to say  but where would the likes of me get a hundred dollars .         right here  if you invest just one dollar and wait for   how long  mr .  bent .      the chief cashier snorted .     four hundred and sixty one years .         okay  it   s a bit of a wait  but your great great great etc .  grandchildren will be proud of you     said moist  above the laughter .     but i   ll tell you what i   ll do  if you open an account here today for  oh  five dollars  we   ll give you a free dollar on monday .  a free dollar to take away  ladies and gentlemen  and where are you going to get a better deal than           a real dollar  pray  or one of these fakes .      there was a commotion near the door  and pucci lavish swept in .  or  at least  tried to sweep .  but a good sweep needs planning  and probably a rehearsal .  you shouldn   t just go for it and hope .  all you get is a lot of shoving .   the two heavies  there to clear a path through the press of people  got defeated by sheer numbers  which meant that the rather slimmer young men leading her exquisitely bred blond hounds got stuck behind them .  pucci had to shoulder her way through .   it could have been so good  moist felt .  it had all the right ingredients  the black clad bruisers so menacing  the dogs so sleek and blond .  but pucci herself had been blessed with beady  suspicious little eyes and a generous upper lip which combined to the long neck to put the honest observer in mind of a duck who   d just been offended by a passing trout .   someone should have told her that black was not her color  that the expensive fur could have looked better on its original owners  that if you were going to wear high heels then this week   s fashion tip was    don   t wear sunglasses at the same time     because when you walked out of the bright sunlight into the relative gloom of  say  a bank  you would lose all sense of direction and impale the foot of one of your own bodyguards .  someone should have told her  in fact  that true style comes from innate cunning and mendacity .  you can   t buy it .      miss pucci lavish  ladies and gentlemen .     said moist  starting to clap as pucci whipped her sunglasses off and advanced on the counter with murder in her eye .     one of the directors who will join us all in making money .      there was some clapping from the crowd  most of whom had never seen pucci before but wanted the free show .      i say .  listen to me .  everyone listen to me     she commanded .  she waved what seemed to moist to look very much like his experimental dollar bills .     this is just worthless paper .  this is what he will be giving you .         no  it   s the same as an open check or a banker   s draft     said moist .      really .  we shall see .  i say .  good people of ankh morpork .  do any of you think this piece of paper could be worth a dollar .  would anyone give me a dollar for it .     pucci waved the paper dismissively .      dunno .  what is it .     said someone  and there was a buzz from the crowd .      an experimental bank note     said moist  over the growing hubbub .     just to try out the idea .         how many of them are there  then .     said the inquiring man .      about twelve     said moist .   the man turned to pucci .     i   ll give you five dollars for it  how about that .         five .  it says it   s worth one .     said pucci  aghast .      yeah  right .  five dollars  miss .         why .  are you insane .         i   m as sane as the next man  thank you  young lady .         seven dollars here .     said the next man  raising a hand .      this is madness .     wailed pucci .      mad .     said the next man .  he pointed a finger at moist .     if i   d bought a pocketful of the black penny stamps when that feller brought them out last year  i   d be a rich man .         anyone remember the triangular blue .     said another bidder .     fifty pence it cost .  i put one on a letter to my aunt  by the time it got there it was worth fifty dollars .  and the ol    baggage wouldn   t give it back .         it   s worth a hundred and sixty now     said someone behind him .     auctioned at dave   s stamp and pin emporium last week .  ten dollars is my bid  miss .         fifteen here .      moist had a good view from the stairs .  a small consortium had formed at the back of the hall  working on the basis that it was better to have small shares than none at all .   stamp collecting .  it had started on day one  and then ballooned like some huge   thing  running on strange  mad rules .  was there any other field where flaws made things worth more .  would you buy a suit just because one arm was shorter than the other .  or because a bit of spare cloth was still attached .  of course  when moist had spotted this  he   d put in flaws on purpose  as a matter of public entertainment  but he certainly hadn   t planned for lord vetinari   s head to appear upside down just once on every sheet of blues .  one of the printers had been about to destroy them when moist brought him down with a flying tackle .   the whole business was unreal  and unreal was moist   s world .  back when he   d been a naughty boy he   d sold dreams  and the big seller in that world was the one where you got very rich by a stroke of luck .  he   d sold glass as diamonds because greed clouded men   s eyes .  sensible  upright people  who worked hard every day  nevertheless believed  against all experience  in money for nothing .  but the stamp collectors   they believed in small perfections .  it was possible to get one small part of the world right .  and even if you couldn   t get it right  you at least knew what was missing .  it might be  f   rinstance  the flawed   p triangular blue  but there were still six of them out there  and who knew what piece of luck might attend the dedicated searcher .   rather a lot of luck would be needed  moist had to admit  because four of them were safely tucked away for a rainy day in a little lead box under the floorboards in moist   s office .  even so  two were out there somewhere  perhaps destroyed  lost  eaten by snails  or   and here hope lay thick as winter snow   were in some unregarded bundle of letters at the back of a drawer somewhere .      and miss pucci simply didn   t know how to work a crowd .  she stomped and demanded attention and bullied and insulted and it didn   t help that she   d called them    good people     because no one likes an outright liar .  and now she was losing her temper  because the bidding had reached thirty four dollars .  and now        she   d torn it up .      that   s what i think of this silly money .     she announced  throwing the pieces in the air .  then she stood there  panting and looking triumphant  as if she   d done something clever .   a kick in the teeth to everyone there .  it made you want to cry  it really did .  oh  well .   he pulled one of the new notes out of his pocket and held it up .      ladies and gentlemen .     he announced     i have here one of the increasingly rare first generation one dollar notes      he had to pause for the laughter      signed by myself and the chairman .  bids over forty dollars  please .  all proceeds to the little kiddies .      he ran it up to fifty  bouncing a couple of bids off the wall .  pucci stood ignored and steaming with rage for a while and then flounced out .  it was a good flounce  too .  she had no idea how to handle people and she tried to make self esteem do the work of self respect  but the girl could flounce better than a fat turkey on a trampoline .   the lucky winner was already surrounded by his unlucky fellow bidders by the time he reached the bank   s doors .  the rest of the crowd surged toward the counters  not sure what was going on but determined to have a piece of it .   moist cupped his hand and shouted     and this afternoon  ladies and gentlemen  mr .  bent and myself will be available to discuss bank loans .     this caused a further stir .      smoke and mirrors  mr .  lipwig     said bent  turning away from the balustrade .     nothing but smoke and mirrors           but done without smoke and in a total absence of a mirror  mr .  bent .     said moist cheerfully .      and the    kiddies    .     said bent .      find some .  there   s bound to be an orphanage that needs fifty dollars .  it   ll have to be an anonymous donation  of course .      bent looked surprised .     really  mr .  lipwig .  i   ll make no bones about saying that you seem to me to be the sort of man who makes a great razz arm ma tazz about giving money to charity .     he made razzmatazz sound like some esoteric perversion .      well  i   m not .  do good by stealth  that is my watchword .     it   ll get found out soon enough  he added to himself  and then i   m not only a jolly good chap but a decently modest one  too .   i wonder   am i really a bastard or am i just really good at thinking like one .   nothing nudged at his mind .  tiny hairs on the back of his neck were twitching .  something was wrong  out of place   dangerous .   he turned and looked down again at the hall .  people were milling around  forming into lines  talking in groups     in a world of movement  the eye is drawn to stillness .  in the middle of the banking hall  unheeded by the throng  a man was standing as if frozen in time .  he was all in black  with one of those flat  wide hats often worn by the more somber omnian sects .  he just   stood .  and watched .   just another gawker along to see the show  moist told himself  and knew at once that he was lying .  the man was causing a weight in his world .   i have lodged affidavits     him .  about what .  moist had no past .  oh  a dozen aliases had managed a pretty busy and eventful past between them  but they had evaporated along with albert spangler  hanged by the neck until not quite dead and awoken by lord vetinari  who   d offered moist von lipwig a life all shiny and new     ye gods  he was getting jumpy  just because some old guy was looking at him with a funny little smile .  no one knew him .  he was mr .  forgettable .  if he walked around the town without the gold suit on  he was just another face .     are you all right  mr .  lipwig .      moist turned and looked into the face of the chief cashier .      what .  oh   no .  i mean yes .  er   have you ever seen that man before .         what man would that be .      moist turned back to point out the man in black  but he was gone .      looked like a preacher     he mumbled .     he was   well  he was looking at me .         well  sir  you do rather invite it .  perhaps you   d agree that the golden hat was a mistake .         i like the hat .  there   s no other hat like it .      bent nodded .     fortunately  this is true  sir .  oh  dear .  paper money .  a practice used only by the heathen agateans           heathen .  they   ve got far more gods than us .  and over there gold is worth less than iron .      moist relented .  bent   s face  usually so controlled and aloof  had crumpled like a piece of paper .     look  i   ve been reading .  the banks issue coins to four times the amount of the gold they hold .  that   s a nonsense we could do without .  it   s a dream world .  this city is rich enough to be its own gold bar .         they   re trusting you for no good reason     said bent .     they trust you because you make them laugh .  i do not make people laugh  and this is not my world .  i don   t know how to smile like you do and talk like you do .  don   t you understand .  there must be something which has a worth that goes beyond fashion and politics  a worth that endures .  are you putting vetinari in charge of my bank .  what guarantees the savings that those people are thrusting over our counter .         not what  who .  it   s me .  i am personally going to see that this bank does not fail .         you .      yes .         oh yes  the man in the gold suit     said bent sourly .     and if all else fails  will you pray .         it worked last time     said moist calmly .   bent   s eye twitched .  for the first time since moist had met him  he seemed   lost .      i don   t know what you want me to do .      it was almost a wail .  moist patted him on the shoulder .      run the bank  like you always have .  i think we should set up some loans  with all this cash coming in .  are you a good judge of character .         i thought i was     said bent .     now .  i have no idea .  sir joshua  i am sorry to say  was not .  mrs .  lavish was very  very good  in my opinion           better than you could possibly know     said moist .     good .  i shall take the chairman for his walkies  and then   we   ll spread some money around .  how about that .      mr .  bent shuddered .       the times did an early afternoon edition with a big picture on the front page  of the queue of customers winding out of the bank .  most of them wanted to get in on the act  whatever the act turned out to be  and the rest were queuing on the basis that there might be something interesting at the other end .  there was a boy selling the paper  and people were buying it to read the story entitled    huge queue swamps bank     which seemed a bit odd to moist .  they were in the queue  weren   t they .  was it only real if they read about it .      there are already some   people wishing to inquire about loans  sir     said bent  behind him .     i suggest you let me deal with them .         no  we both will  mr .  bent     said moist  turning away from the window .     show them into the downstairs office  please .         i really think you should leave this to me  sir .  some of them are rather new to the idea of banking     bent persisted .     in fact  i don   t think some of them have ever been in a bank before  except perhaps during the hours of darkness .         i would like you to be present  of course  but i will make the final decision     said moist  as loftily as he could manage .     aided by the chairman  naturally .         mr .  fusspot .         oh yes .         he is an expert judge  is he .         oh yes .      moist picked up the dog and headed for the office .  he could feel the chief cashier glaring at his back .   but bent had been right .  some of the people waiting hopefully to see him about a loan were thinking in terms of a couple of dollars until friday .  they were easy enough to deal with .  and then there were others        mr .  dibbler  isn   t it .     said moist .  he knew it was  but you had to speak like that when you sat behind a desk .      that   s right  sir  man and boy     said mr .  dibbler  who had a permanently eager  rodent like cast to his countenance .     i could be someone else if you like .         and you sell pork pies  sausages  rat on a stick           er  i pervay them  sir     dibbler corrected him     on account of being a perveyor .      moist looked at him over the paperwork .  claude maximillian overton transpire dibbler  a name bigger than the man himself .  everyone knew c . m . o . t .  dibbler .  he sold pies and sausages off a tray  usually to people who were the worse for drink  who then became the worse for pies .   moist had eaten the odd pork pie and occasional sausage in a bun  however  and that very fact interested him .  there was something about the stuff that drove you back for more .  there had to be some secret ingredient  or maybe the brain just didn   t believe what the taste buds told it  and wanted to feel once again that flood of hot  greasy  not entirely organic  slightly crunchy substances surfing across the tongue .  so  you bought another one .   and  it had to be said  there were times when a dibbler sausage in a bun was just what you wanted .  sad  yet true .  everyone had moments like that .  life brought you so low that for a vital few seconds that charivari of strange greases and worrying textures was your only friend in all the world .      do you have an account with us  mr .  dibbler .         yessir  thankyousir     said dibbler  who had refused an invitation to put down his tray and sat with it held defensively in front of him .  the bank seemed to make the streetwise trader nervous .  of course  it was meant to .  that was the reason for all the pillars and marble .  it was there to make you feel out of place .      mr .  dibbler has opened an account with five dollars     said bent .      and i have brought along a sausage for your little doggie     said dibbler .      why do you need a loan  mr .  dibbler .     said moist  watching mr .  fusspot sniff the sausage carefully .      i want to expand the business  sir     said dibbler .      you   ve been trading for more than thirty years     said moist .      yessir  thankyousir .         and your products are  i think i can say  unique           yessir  thankyousir .         so i imagine that now you need our help to open a chain of franchised caf  s trading on the dibbler name  offering a variety of meals and drinks bearing your distinctive likeness .     said moist .   mr .  fusspot jumped down from the desk with the sausage held gently in his mouth  dropped it in the corner of the office  and tried industriously to kick the carpet over it .   dibbler stared at moist  and then said     yessir  if you insist  but actually i was thinking about a barrow .         a barrow .     said bent .      yessir .  i know where i can get a nice little secondhand one with an oven and everything .  painted up nice  too .  wally the gimp is quitting the jacket potato business    cos of stress and he   ll let me have it for fifteen dollars  cash down .  a not to be missed opportunity  sir .     he looked nervously at mr .  bent and added     i could pay you back at a dollar a week .         for twenty weeks     said bent .      seventeen     said moist .      but the dog just tried to       bent began .   moist waved away the objection .     so we have a deal  mr .  dibbler .         yessir  thankyousir     said dibbler .     that   s a good idea you   ve got there  about the chain and everything  though  and i thank you .  but i find that in this business it pays to be mobile .      mr .  bent counted out fifteen dollars with bad grace and began to speak as soon as the door closed behind the trader .      even the dog wouldn   t           but humans will  mr .  bent     said moist .     and therein lies genius .  i think he makes most of his money on the mustard  but there   s a man who can sell sizzle  mr .  bent .  and that is a seller   s market .      the last prospective borrower was heralded first by a couple of muscular men who took up positions on either side of the door  and then by a smell that overruled even the persistent odor of a dibbler sausage .  it wasn   t a particularly bad smell  it put you in mind of old potatoes or abandoned tunnels   it was what you got when you started out with severely foul stink and then scrubbed hard but ineffectually  and it surrounded king like an emperor   s cloak .   moist was astonished .  king of the golden river  they called him  because the foundation of his fortune was the daily collection of the urine his men made from every inn and pub in the city .  the customers paid him to take it away  and the alchemists  tanners  and dyers paid him to bring it to them .   but that was only the start .   harry king   s men took away everything .  you saw their carts everywhere  especially around dawn .  every rag and bone man and rubbish picker  every dunnikin diver  every gongfermor  every scrap metal merchant   you worked for harry king  they said  because a broken leg was bad for business  and harry king was all about business .  they said that if a dog in the street looked even a bit strained  a king   s man would be there in a flash to hold a shovel under its arse  because prime dog muck fetched  p a bucket from the high class tanners .  they paid harry .  the city paid harry .  everyone paid harry .  and what he couldn   t sell back to them in more fragrant form went to feed his giant compost heaps downriver  which on frosty days sent up such great plumes of steam that kids called them the cloud factories .   apart from his hired help  harry was accompanied by a skinny young man clutching a briefcase .      nice place you got here     said harry  sitting down in the chair opposite moist .     very sound .  the wife   s been on at me to get curtains like that .  i   m harry king  mr .  lipwig .  i   ve just put fifty thousand dollars in your bank .         thank you very much  mr .  king .  we shall do our best to look after it .         you do that .  and now i   d like to borrow one hundred thousand  thank you     said harry  pulling out a fat cigar .      have you got any security  mr .  king .     said bent .   harry king didn   t even look at him .  he lit the cigar  puffed it into life  and waved it in the general direction of bent .      who   s this  mr .  lipwig .         mr .  bent is our chief cashier     said moist  not daring to look at bent   s face .      a clerk  then     said harry king dismissively     an    that was a clerk   s question .      he leaned forward .     my name is harry king .  that   s your security  right there  an    it should be good for a hundred grand in these parts .  harry king .  everyone knows me .  i pay what   s owing an    i take what   s owed  my word  don   t i just .  my handshake is my fortune .  harry king .      he slammed his huge hands down on the table .  except for the pinkie of his left hand  which was missing  there was a heavy gold ring on each of them  and each ring was incised with a letter .  if you saw them coming at you  as for instance in an alley  because you   d been skimming something off the take  the last name you would see would be h a r r y k i n g .  it was a fact worth keeping in the forefront of your brain  in the interests of keeping the forefront of your brain .   moist looked up into the man   s eyes .      we shall need a lot more than that     growled bent  from somewhere above moist .   harry king didn   t bother to look up .  he said     i only talks to the organ grinder .         mr .  bent  could you step outside for a few minutes     said moist brightly     and perhaps mr .  king   s   associates will do the same .      harry king nodded almost imperceptibly .      mr .  lipwig  i really           please  mr .  bent .      the chief cashier snorted  but followed the thugs out of the office .  the young man with the briefcase made as if to leave as well  but harry waved him back into his seat .      you want to watch that bent     he said to moist .     there   s something funny about him .         odd  maybe  but he wouldn   t like to be called funny .  so  why does harry king need money  mr .  king .  everyone knows you   re rich .  has the bottom dropped out of the dog muck business .  or vice versa .         i   m cons sol id ating     said king  grinning .     this undertaking business   there   s going to be a few opportunities for a man in the right place .  there   s land to buy  palms to grease   you know how it is .  but them other banks  they won   t lend to king of the golden river  for all it   s my lads what keeps their cesspits fragrant as a violet .  them stuck up ponces   d be up to their ankles in their own piss if it weren   t for me  but they holds their noses when i walks by  oh yeah .     he stopped  as if a thought had occurred to him  and went on .     well most people do  o   course  it   s not like a man can take a bath every five bloody minutes  but that bunch of bankers still gives me the cold shoulder even when the wife has scrubbed me raw .  how dare they .  i   m a better risk than most of their smarmy customers  you can bet on that .  i employs a thousand people in this city  mister  one way or another .  that   s a thousand families lookin    to me for their dinner .  i might be about muck  but i don   t muck about .      he   s not a crook  moist reminded himself .  he pulled himself out of the gutter and beat his way to the top in a world where a length of lead pipe was the standard negotiating tool .  that world wouldn   t trust paper .  in that world  reputation was all .      a hundred thousand is a lot of money     he said aloud .      you   ll give it to me  though     said king  grinning .     i knows you will     cos you   re a chancer  same as me .  i can smell it on you .  i smell a lad who   s done a thing or two in his time  eh .         we all have to eat  mr .  king .            course we do .     course we do .  an    now we can sit back like a coupla judges an    be pillows of the community  eh .  so we   ll shake hands on it like the gentlemen we ain   t .  this here     he went on  laying a huge hand on the shoulder of the young man     is wallace  my clerk what does the sums for me .  he   s new  on account of the last one i had i caught fiddlin    me .  that was a laugh  as you can imagine .     wallace didn   t smile .      i probably can     said moist .  harry king guarded his various premises with creatures that could only be called dogs because wolves aren   t that insane .  and they were kept hungry .  there were rumors  and harry king was probably happy about that .  it paid to advertise .  you didn   t double cross harry king .  but it worked both ways .      wallace can talk numbers with your monkey     said harry  standing up .     you   ll want to squeeze me  right enough .  business is business  and don   t i know it .  what do you say .         well i   d say we have an agreement  mr .  king     moist said .  then he spat on his hand  and held it out .   it was worth it to see the look on the man   s face .      i didn   t know bankers did that     said harry .      they don   t often shake hands with harry king  then     said moist .  that was probably overdoing it  but king winked  spat on his own hand  and grasped moist   s .  moist had been prepared  but even so  the man   s grip ground his finger bones together .      you   re more full of bullshit than a frightened herd on fresh pasture  mr .  lipwig .         thank you  sir .  i take that as a compliment .         and just to keep your monkey happy  i   ll deposit the deeds of the paper mill  the big yard  and a few other properties     said harry .     give    em to the man  wallace .         you should have said that in the first place  mr .  king     said moist  as some impressive scrolls were handed over .      yeah  but i didn   t .  wanted to make sure of you .  when can i have my money .         soon .  when i   ve printed it .      harry king wrinkled his nose .     oh  yeah  the paper stuff .  me  i like money that clinks  but wallace here says paper   s the coming thing .     he winked .     and it   s not like i can complain  since ol    spools buys his paper off    f me these days .  can   t turn me nose up at me own manufacture now  can i .  good day to you  sir .      mr .  bent strode back into the office twenty minutes later  his face like a tax demand  to find moist staring vaguely at a sheet of paper on the worn green leather of the desk .      sir  i must protest           did you nail him down to a good rate .     said moist .      i pride myself that i did  but the way you           we will do well out of harry king  mr .  bent  and he will do well out of us .         but you   re turning my bank into some sort of           not counting our friend harry  we took in more than four thousand dollars today     said moist briskly .     most of them were from what you   d call poor people  but there   s far more of them than rich people .  we can set that money to work .  and we won   t lend to scoundrels this time  don   t you worry about that .  i   m a scoundrel  and i can spot them a mile off .  please pass on our compliments to the counter staff .  and now  mr .  bent  mr .  fusspot and i are going to see a man about making money .          teemer and spools had gone up in the world because of the big stamp contract .  they   d always done the best printing work in any case  but now they had the men and muscle to bid for all the big contracts .  and you could trust them .  moist always felt rather guilty when he went into the place  teemer and spools seemed to represent everything that he only pretended to be .   there were plenty of lights on when he went in .  and mr .  spools was in his office  writing in a ledger .  he looked up and  when he saw moist  smiled the smile you save for your very best customer .      mr .  lipwig .  what can i do for you .  do take a seat .  we don   t see so much of you these days .      moist sat and chatted  because mr .  spools liked to chat .   things were difficult .  things were always difficult .  there were a lot more presses around these days .  t s were staying ahead of the game by staying on top of it .  regrettably  said mr .  spools  with a straight face  their    friendly    rivals  the wizards at unseen university press  had come a cropper with their talking books        talking books .  that sounds a good idea     said moist .      quite possibly     said spools  with a sniff .     but these weren   t meant to talk  and certainly not to complain about the quality of their glue and the hamfistedness of the typesetter .  and of course now the university can   t pulp them .         why not .         think of the screaming .  no  i pride myself that we are still riding the wave .  er   was there something special you wanted .         what can you do with this .     said moist  putting one of the new dollars on the table .   spools picked it up and read it carefully .  then  in a faraway voice  he said     i did hear something .  does vetinari know you   re planning this .         mr .  spools  i   ll bet he knows my shoe size and what i had for breakfast .      the printer put down the bill as if it were ticking .      i can see what you are doing .  such a small thing  and yet so dangerous .         can you print them .     said moist .     oh  not that one .  i made up a batch just to test the idea .  i meant high quality bank notes  if i can find an artist to draw them .         oh  yes .  we are a byword for quality .  we   re building a new press to keep pace with demand .  but what about security .         what  in here .  no one has ever bothered you so far  have they .         no  they haven   t .  but up until now we haven   t had lots of money lying around  if you see what i mean .      spools held the note up and let it go .  it wafted gently from side to side until it landed on the desk .      so light  too     he went on .     a few thousand dollars would be no problem to carry .         but kind of hard to melt down .  look  build the new press in the mint .  there   s a lot of space .  end of problem .         well  yes  that would make sense .  but a press is a big thing to move  you know .  it   ll take days to shift it .  are you in a hurry .  of course you are .         hire some golems .  four golems will lift anything .  print me dollars by the day after tomorrow and the first thousand you print are a bonus .         why are you always in such a hurry  mr .  lipwig .         because people don   t like change .  but make the change happen fast enough and you go from one type of normal to another .         well  we could hire some golems  i suppose     said the printer .     but i fear there are other difficulties less easy to overcome .  do you realize that if you start printing money then you will get forgeries .  it   s not worth the trouble  maybe  for a   p stamp  but if you want  say  a ten dollar note    .     he raised his eyebrows .      probably  yes .  problems .         big ones  my friend .  oh  we can help .  decent linen paper with a pattern of raised threads  watermarks  a good spirit ink  change the plates often to keep it sharp  little tricks with the design   and make it complex  too .  that   s important .  yes  we could do it for you .  they will be expensive .  i strongly suggest you find an engraver as good as this        mr .  spools unlocked one of the lower drawers of his desk and tossed a sheet of   p green    tower of art    stamps onto the blotter .  then he handed moist a large magnifying glass .      that   s top quality paper  of course     the printer said as moist stared .      you   re getting very good .  i can see every detail     moist breathed  poring over the sheet .      no     said spools  with some satisfaction .     in fact  you cannot .  you might  though  with this .     he unlocked a cupboard and handed moist a heavy brass microscope .      he   s put in more detail than we did     he said  as moist focused .     it   s at the very limit of what metal and paper can be persuaded to do .  it is  i declare  a work of genius .  he would be your salvation .         amazing     said moist .     well  we   ve got to have him .  who does he work for now .         no one  mr .  lipwig .  he is in prison  awaiting the noose .         owlswick jenkins .         you testified against him  mr .  lipwig     said spools mildly .      well   yes  but only to confirm that they were our stamps he was copying  and how much we might be losing .  i didn   t expect he   d be hanged .         his lordship is always touchy when it   s a case of treason against the city  as he describes it .  i think jenkins was badly served by his lawyer .  after all  his work made our stamps look like the real forgeries .  you know  i got the impression the poor chap didn   t really realize what he was doing was wrong .      moist recalled the watery  frightened eyes and the expression of helpless puzzlement .      yes     he said .     you may be right .         could you perhaps use your influence with vetinari to           no .  it wouldn   t work .         ah .  are you sure .         yes     said moist flatly .      well  you see  there   s only so much we can do .  we can even number the bills automatically now .  but the artwork must be of the finest kind .  oh dear .  i   m sorry .  i wish i could help .  we owe you a great debt  mr .  lipwig .  so much official work is coming in now that we   d need the space in the mint .  my word  we   re practically the government   s printer .         really .     said moist .     that   s very   interesting .          it rained ungracefully .  the gutters gargled and tried to spit .  occasionally the wind caught the cascading overflow from the rooftops and slapped a sheet of water across the face of anyone who looked up .  but this was not a night to look up .  this was a night to scurry  bent double  for home .   raindrops hit the windows of mrs .  cake   s boardinghouse  specifically the one in the rear room occupied by mavolio bent  at the rate of twenty seven a second  plus or minus fifteen percent .   mr .  bent liked counting .  you could trust numbers  except perhaps for pi  but he was working on that in his spare time and it was bound to give in sooner or later .   he sat on his bed  watching the numbers dance in his head .  they   d always danced for him  even in the bad times .  and the bad times had been so very bad .  now  perhaps  there were more ahead .   someone knocked at his door .  he said     come in  mrs .  cake .      the landlady pushed open the door .      you always know it   s me  don   t you  mr .  bent     said mrs .  cake  who was more than a trifle nervous about her best lodger .  he paid his rent on time   exactly on time   and he kept his room scrupulously clean and  of course  he was a professional gentleman .  all right  he had a haunted look about him and there was that odd business with him carefully adjusting the clock before he went to work every day  but she was prepared to put up with that .  there was no shortage of lodgers in this crowded city  but clean ones who paid regularly and never complained about the food were thin enough on the ground to be worth cherishing  and if they put a strange padlock on their wardrobe  well  least said soonest mended .      yes  mrs .  cake     said bent .     i always know it   s you because there is a distinctive one point four seconds between the knocks .         really .  fancy .     said mrs .  cake  who rather liked the sound of distinctive .     i always say you   re the man for the adding up .  er   there is going to be three gentlemen downstairs asking after you           when .         in about two minutes     said mrs .  cake .   bent stood up in one unfolding moment  like a jack in the box .      men .  what will they be wearing .         well  er  just  you know  clothes .     said mrs .  cake uncertainly .     black clothes .  one of them will give me his card  but i won   t be able to read it because i   ll have my wrong spectacles on .  of course  i could go and put the right ones on  obviously  but i get such a headache if i don   t let a premonition go right .  er   and now you   re going to say     please let me know when they arrive  mrs .  cake .        she looked at him expectantly .     sorry  but i had a premonition that i   d come up to tell you i had a premonition  so i thought i   d better .  it   s a bit silly  but none of us can change how we   re made  i always say .         please let me know when they arrive  mrs .  cake     said bent .  mrs .  cake gave him a grateful look before hurrying away .   mr .  bent sat down again .  life with mrs .  cake   s premonitions could get a little intricate at times  especially now they were getting recursive  but it was part of the elm street ethos that you were charitable toward the foibles of others in the hope of a similar attitude to your own .  he liked mrs .  cake  but she was wrong .  you could change how you were made .  if you couldn   t  there was no hope .   after a couple of minutes he heard the ring of the bell  the muted conversation  and went through the motions of surprise when she knocked on his door .   bent inspected the visiting card .      mr .  cosmo .  oh .  how strange .  you had better send them up .     he paused  and looked around .  subdivision was rife in the city now .  the room was exactly twice the size of the bed  and it was a narrow bed .  three people in here would have to know one another well .  four would know one another well whether they wanted to or not .  there was a small chair  but bent kept it on top of the wardrobe  out of the way .      perhaps just mr .  cosmo     he suggested .   the man was proudly escorted in a minute later .      well  this is a wonderful little hideaway  mr .  bent     cosmo began .     so handy for  um           nearby places     said bent  lifting the chair off the wardrobe .     there you are  sir .  i don   t often have visitors .         i   ll come straight to the point  mr .  bent     said cosmo  sitting down .     the directors do not like the  ha  direction things are going .  i   m sure you don   t  either .         i could wish for them to be otherwise  sir  yes .         he should have held a director   s meeting .         yes  sir  but bank rules say he needn   t do so for a week  i   m afraid .         he will ruin the bank .         we are  in fact  getting many new customers  sir .         you can   t possibly like the man .  not you  mr .  bent .         he is easy to like  sir .  but you know me  sir .  i do not trust those who laugh too easily .  the heart of a fool is in the house of mirth .  he should not be in charge of your bank .         i like to think about it as our bank  mr .  bent     said cosmo generously     because  in a very real way  it is ours .         you are too kind  sir     said bent  staring down at the floorboards visible through the hole in the cheap oilcloth which was itself laid bare  in a very real way  by the bald patch in the carpet which  in a very real way  was his .      you joined us quite young  i believe     cosmo went on .     my father himself gave you a job as trainee clerk  didn   t he .         that is correct  sir .         he was very   understanding  my father     said cosmo .     and rightly so .  no sense in dredging up the past .     he paused for a little while to let this sink in .  bent was intelligent  after all .  no need to use a hammer when a feather would float down with as much effect .      perhaps you could find some way that will allow him to be removed from office without fuss or bloodshed .  there must be something     he prompted .     no one just steps out of nowhere .  but people know even less about his past than they do about  for the sake of argument  yours .      another little reminder .  bent   s eye twitched .      but mr .  fusspot will still be chairman     he mumbled  while the rain rattled on the glass .      oh yes .  but i   m sure he will then be looked after by someone who is  shall we say  better capable of translating his little barks along more traditional lines .         i see .         and now i must be going     said cosmo  standing up .     i   m sure you have a lot of things to       he looked around the barren room which showed no sign of real human occupation  no pictures  no books  no debris of living  and concluded        do .         i will go to sleep shortly     said mr .  bent .      tell me  mr .  bent  how much do we pay you .     said cosmo  glancing at the wardrobe .      forty one dollars per month  sir     said bent .      ah  but of course you get wonderful job security .         so i had hitherto believed  sir .         i just wonder why you choose to live here .         i like the dullness  sir .  it expects nothing of me .         well  time to go     said cosmo  slightly faster than he really should .     i   m sure you can be of help  mr .  bent .  you have always been a great help .  it would be such a shame if you could not be of help at this time .      bent stared at the floor .  he was trembling .      i speak for all of us when i say that we think of you as one of the family     cosmo went on .  he rethought this sentence with reference to the peculiar charms of the lavishes and added     but in a good way .          chapter       jailbreak the prospect of a kidney sandwich the barber surgeon   s knock suicide by paint  inadvisability of angels at one remove igor goes shopping the use of understudies at a hanging  reflections on places suitable for putting a head moist awaits the sunshine tricks with your brain    we   re going to need some bigger notes    fun with root vegetables the lure of clipboards the impossible cabinet      on the roof of the tanty  the city   s oldest jail  moist was more than moist .  he   d reached the point where he was so wet that he should be approaching dryness from the other end .   with care  he lifted the last of the oil lamps from the little semaphore tower on the flat roof  and tossed its contents into the howling night .  they had been only half full  in any case .  it was amazing that anyone had even bothered to light them on a night like this .   he felt his way back to the edge of the roof and located his grapnel  moving it gently around the stern crenellation and then letting out more rope to lower it down to the invisible ground .  now he had the rope around the big stone bulk he slid down holding on to both lengths and pulled the rope down after him .  he stashed both grapnel and rope among the debris in an alley  it would be stolen within an hour or so .   right  then .  now for it     the watch armor he   d lifted from the bank   s locker room fitted like a glove .  he   d have preferred it to fit like a helmet and breastplate .  but  in truth  it probably didn   t look any better on its owner  currently swanking along the corridors in the bank   s own shiny but impractical armor .  it was common knowledge that the watch   s approach to uniforms was one size doesn   t exactly fit any body  and that commander vimes disapproved of armor that didn   t have that kicked by trolls look .  he liked armor to state clearly that it had been doing its job .   he took some time to get his breath back  and then walked around to the big black door and rang the bell .  the mechanism rattled and clanked .   they wouldn   t rush  not on a night like this .   he was as naked and exposed as a baby lobster .  he hoped he   d covered all the angles  but angles were  what did they call it  he   d gone to a lecture at the university   ah  yes .  angles were fractal .  each one was full of smaller angles .  you couldn   t cover them all .  the watchman at the bank might be called back to work and find his locker empty  someone might have seen moist take it  jenkins might have been moved   the hell with it .  when time was pressing you just had to spin the wheel and be ready to run .   or  in this case  lift the huge door knocker in both hands and bring it down sharply  twice  on the nail .   he waited until  with difficulty  a small hatch in the big door was pulled aside .      what .     said a petulant voice in a shadowy face .      prisoner pickup .  name of jenkins .         what .  it   s the middle of the bleedin    night .         got a signed form        said moist stolidly .   the little hatch slammed shut .   he waited in the rain again .  this time it was three minutes before it opened .      what .     said a new voice  marinated in suspicion .   ah  good .  it was bellyster .  moist was glad of that .  what he was going to do tonight was going to make one of the wardens a very uncomfortable screw  and some of them were decent enough  especially on death row .  but bellyster was a real old school screw  a craftsman of small evils  the kind of bully that would take every opportunity to make a prisoner   s life misery .  it wasn   t just that he   d gob in your bowl of greasy skilly  but he wouldn   t even have the common decency to do it where you couldn   t see him .  he picked on the weak and frightened  too .  and there was one good thing .  he hated the watch  and the feeling was mutual .  a man could use that .      come for a pris   ner     moist complained .     an    i been standing in the rain for five minutes .         and you shall continue to do so  my son  oh  yes indeed  until i   m ready .  show me the docket .         says here jenkins  owlswick     said moist .      let me see it  then .         they said i has to hand it over when you give me the pris   ner     said moist  a model of stolid insistence .      oh  we have a lawyer here  do we .  all right  abe  let my learned friend in .      the little hatch slid back and  after some more clanking  a wicket door opened .  moist stepped through .      have i seen you before .     said bellyster  his head on one side .      only started last week     said moist .  behind him  the gate was locked again .  the slamming of the bolts echoed in his head .      why   s there only one of you .     bellyster demanded .      don   t know  sir .  you   d have to ask my mum and dad .         don   t you be funny with me .  there should be two on escort duty .      moist gave a wet and weary shrug of pure disinterest .      should there .  don   t ask me .  they just told me he   s a little piece of piss who   ll be no trouble .  you can check if you like .  i heard the palace wants to see him right away .      the palace .  that changed the gleam in the warden   s nasty little eyes .  a sensible man didn   t get in the way of the palace .  and sending out some dim newbie to do a thankless task on a wild night like this made sense  it was exactly what bellyster would have done .   he held out his hand and demanded     docket .      moist handed over the flimsy paper .  the man read it  lips perceptibly moving  clearly willing it to be wrong in some way .  there   d be no problem there  however much the man glared  moist had pocketed a handful of the forms while mr .  spools was making him a cup of coffee .      he   s goin    to hang in the morning     bellyster said  holding the sheet up to the lantern .     what d   they want him for now .         dunno     said moist .     get a move on  will you .  i   m on my break in ten minutes .      the warden leaned forward .     just for that  friend  i will go and check .  just one escort .  can   t be too careful  can i .  enjoy the rain .      oh   kay  thought moist .  all going according to plan .  he   ll be ten minutes having a nice cup of tea  just to teach me a lesson  five minutes to find out the clacks isn   t working  about one second to decide that he   d be blowed if he was going to sort out the fault on a night like this  another second to think  the paperwork was okay  he   d checked for the watermark  and that was the main thing   call it twenty minutes  give or take .   of course  he could be wrong .  anything could happen .  bellyster could be rounding up a couple of his mates right now  or maybe he   d get someone to run out the back way and find a real copper .  the future was uncertain .  exposure could be a few seconds away .   it didn   t get any better than this .   bellyster left it for twenty two minutes .  footsteps approached  slowly  and jenkins appeared  tottering under the weight of the irons  with bellyster prodding him occasionally with his stick .  there was no way the little man could have gone any faster  but he was going to get prodded anyway .      i don   t think i   m going to need the shackles     said moist quickly .      you ain   t getting    em     said the warden .     the reason bein     you buggers never bring    em back .         okay     said moist .     c   mon  it   s freezing out here .      bellyster grunted .  he was not a happy man .  he bent down  unlocked the shackles  and stood up with his hand once again on the man   s shoulder .  his other hand thrust out  holding a clipboard .      sign .     he commanded .  moist did .   and then came the magic bit .  it was why the paperwork was so important in the greasy world of turnkeys  thief takers  and bang beggars  because what really mattered at any one moment was habeas corpus  whose hand is on the collar .  who is responsible for this corpus .   moist had been through this before as the body in question  and knew the drill .  the prisoner moved on a trail of paper .  if he was found without a head  then the last person to have signed for a prisoner whose hat was not resting on his neck might well have to answer some stern questions .   bellyster pushed the prisoner forward and spake the time honored words .      to you  sir .     he barked .     habby arse corparse .      moist thrust the clipboard back at him and laid his other hand on owlswick   s other shoulder .      from you  sir .     he replied .     i habby his arse all right .      bellyster grunted  and removed his hand .  the deed was done  the law was observed  honor was satisfied  and owlswick jenkins        looked up sadly at moist  kicked him hard in the groin  and went off down the street like a hare .   as moist bent double  all he was aware of outside his little world of pain was the sound of bellyster laughing himself silly and shouting     your bird  milord .  you habbyed him all right .  ho yus .          moist had managed to walk normally by the time he got back to the little room he rented from    i don   t know    jack .  he struggled into the golden suit  dried off the amor  bundled it into the bag  stepped out into the alley  and hurried back to the bank .   it was harder to get it back in than it had been to get it out .  the guards changed over at the same time as the staff left  and in the general milling about  moist  wearing the tatty gray suit he wore when he wanted to stop being moist von lipwig and turn into the world   s most unmemorable man  had strolled out unquestioned .  it was all in the mind  the night guards started guarding when everyone had gone home  right .  so people going home were no problem  or  if they were  they were not mine .   the guard who finally turned up to see who was struggling to unlock the front door gave him a bit of trouble until a second guard  who was capable of modest intelligence  pointed out that if the chairman wanted to get into the bank at midnight then that was fine .  he was the damn boss  wasn   t he .  don   t you read the papers .  see gold suit .  and he had a key .  so what if he had a big fat bag .  he was coming in with it  right .  if he was leaving with it  might be a different matter  ho ho  just my little joke  sir  sorry about that sir     it was amazing what you could do if you had the nerve to try  thought moist  as he bid the men good night .  f   rinstance  he   d been so theatrically working the key in the lock because it was a post office key .  he didn   t have one for the bank yet .   even putting the armor back in the locker was not a problem .  the guards still walked set routes and the buildings were big and not very well lit .  the locker room was empty and unregarded for hours at a time .   a lamp was still alight in his new suite .  mr .  fusspot was snoring on his back in the middle of the in tray .  a night light was burning by the bedroom door .  in fact there were two  and they were the red  smoldering eyes of gladys .     would you like me to make you a sandwich  mr .  lipwig .         no thank you  gladys .         it would be no trouble .  there are kidneys in the ice room .         thank you  but no  gladys .  i   m really not hungry     said moist  carefully shutting the door .   moist lay on the bed .  up here  the building was absolutely silent .  he   d grown used to his bed in the post office  where there was always noise drifting up from the yard .   but it was not the silence that kept him awake .  he stared up at the ceiling and thought  stupid  stupid  stupid .  in a few hours there would be a shift change at the tanty .  people wouldn   t get too worried about the missing owlswick until the hangman turned up  looking busy  and then there would be a nervous time when they decided who was going to go to the palace to see if there was any chance of being allowed to hang their prisoner this morning .   the man would be miles away by now  and not even a vampire or a werewolf could smell him on a wet and windy night like this .  they couldn   t pin anything on moist  but in the cold  wet light of two a . m .   he could imagine bloody commander vimes worrying at this  picking away at it in that thick headed way of his .   he blinked .  where would the little man run to .  he wasn   t part of a gang  according to the watch .  he   d just made his own stamps .  what kind of a man goes to the trouble of forging a ha   penny stamp .   what kind of a man     moist sat up .   could it be that easy .   well  it might be .  owlswick was crazy enough in a mild  bewildered sort of way .  he had the look of one who   d long ago given up trying to understand the world beyond his easel  a man for whom cause and effect had no obvious linkage .  where would a man like that hide .   moist lit the lamp and walked over to the battered wreckage of his wardrobe .  once again he selected the tatty gray suit .  it had sentimental value  he had been hanged in it .  and it was an unmemorable suit for an unmemorable man  with the additional advantage  unlike black  of not showing up in the dark .  thinking ahead  he went into the kitchen  too  and stole a couple of dust rags from a cupboard .   the corridor was reasonably well lit by the lamps every few yards .  but lamps create shadows  and in one of them  beside a huge ping dynasty vase from hunghung  moist was just a patch of gray on gray .   a guard walked past  treacherously silent on the thick carpet .  when he   d gone  moist hurried down the flight of marble steps and tucked himself behind a potted palm that someone had thought necessary to put there .   the floors of the bank all opened onto the main hall which  like the one in the post office  went from ground floor to roof .  sometimes  depending on the layout  a guard on a floor above could see the floor below .  sometimes  the guards walked over uncarpeted marble .  sometimes  on the upper floors  they crossed patches of fine tiling  which rang like a bell .   moist stood and listened  trying to pick up the rhythm of the patrols .  there were more than he   d expected .  come on lads  you   re working security  what about the traditional all night poker game .  don   t you know how to behave .   it was like a wonderful puzzle .  it was better than night climbing  better even than extreme sneezing .  and the really good thing about it was this  if he was caught  why  he was just testing the security .  well done  lads  you found me     but he mustn   t be caught .   a guard came upstairs  walking slowly and deliberately .  he leaned against the balustrade and  to moist   s annoyance  lit the stub of a cigarette .  moist watched from between the fronds while the man leaned comfortably on the marble  looking down at the floor below .  he was sure that guards weren   t supposed to do this .  and smoking  too .   after a few reflective drags  the guard dropped the butt  trod on it  and continued up the stairs .   two thoughts struggled for dominance in moist   s mind .  screaming slightly louder was  he had a crossbow .  do they shoot first to avoid having to ask questions later .  but also there  vibrating with indignation  was a voice saying  he stubbed out that damn cigarette right there on the marble .  those tall brass wossnames with the little bowls of white sand are there for a reason  you know .   when the man had disappeared above him  moist ran down the rest of the flight  slid across the polished marble on his dust rag covered boots  found the door that led down to the basement  opened it quickly  and remembered just in time to close it quietly behind him .   he shut his eyes and waited for cries or sounds of pursuit .   he opened his eyes .   there was the usual brilliant light at the far end of the undercroft  but there was no rushing of water .  only the occasional drip demonstrated the depth of the otherwise all pervading silence .   moist walked carefully past the glooper  which tinkled faintly  and into the unexplored shadows beneath the wonderful fornication .   if we build it  wilt thou comest .  he thought .  but the hoped for god never came .  it was sad but  in some celestial way  a bit stupid .  well  wasn   t it .  moist had heard that there were maybe millions of little gods floating around in the world  living under rocks  blown about like tumbleweeds  clinging to the topmost branches of trees   they awaited the big moment  the lucky break that might end up with a temple and a priesthood and worshipers to call your own .  but they hadn   t come here  and it was easy to see why .   gods wanted belief  not rational thinking .  building the temple first was like giving a pair of wonderful shoes to a man with no legs .  building a temple didn   t mean you believed in gods  it just meant you believed in architecture .   something akin to a workshop had been built on the end wall of the undercroft  around a huge and ancient fireplace .  an igor was working over an intense  blue white flame  carefully bending a piece of glass pipe .  behind him  green liquid surged and fizzed in giant bottles  igors seemed to have a natural affinity with lightning .   you could always recognize an igor .  they went out of their way to be recognized .  it wasn   t just the musty dusty old suits  or even the occasional extra digit or mismatched eyes .  it was that you could probably stand a ball on the top of their head without it falling off .   the igor looked up .      good morning  thur .  and you are    .         moist von lipwig     said moist .     and you would be igor .         got it in one  thur .  i have heard many good thingth about you .         down here .         i alwayth keep an ear to the ground  thur .      moist resisted the impulse to look down .  igors and metaphors didn   t go well together .      well  igor   the thing is   i want to bring someone into the building without troubling the guards  and i wonder if there was another door down here .      what he did not say  but what passed between them on the ether  was  you   re an igor  right .  and when the mob are sharpening their sickles and trying to break down the door  the igor is never there .  igors were masters of the unobtrusive exit .      there ith a thmall door we ueth  thur .  it can   t be opened from the outthide tho itth never guarded .      moist looked longingly at the rainwear on its stand .      fine .  fine .  i   m just popping out  then .         you   re the bothth  thur .         and i shall be popping back shortly with a man .  er   a gentleman who is not anxious to meet civic authority .         quite  thur .  give them a pitchfork and they think they own the bloody plathe  thur .         but he   s not a murderer or anything .         i   m an igor  thur .  we don   t athk quethtionth .         really .  why not .         i don   t know  thur .  i didn   t athk .      igor took moist to a small door that opened into a grimy  trash filled stairwell  half flooded by the unremitting rain .  moist paused on the threshold  the water already soaking into the cheap suit .      just one thing  igor           yeth  thur .         when i walked past the glooper just now  there was water in it .         oh  yeth  thur .  ith that a problem .         it was moving  igor .  should that be happening at this time of night .         that .  oh  jutht thyphonic variableth  thur .  it happenth all the time .         oh  the old syphonics  eh .  ah  well  that   s a relief           jutht give the barber thurgeon   th knock when you return  thur .         what is the        the door closed .   igor went back to his workbench and fired up the gas again .   some of the little glass tubes lying beside him on a piece of green felt looked   odd  and reflected the light in disconcerting ways .   the point about igors   the thing about igors     well  most people looked no further than the musty suit  lank hair  cosmetic clan scars  and stitching  and the lisp .  and this was probably because  apart from the lisp  this was all there was to see .   and people forgot  therefore  that most of the people who employed igors were not conventionally sane .  ask them to build a storm attractor and a set of lightning storage jars and they would laugh at you .  they needed  oh  how they needed  someone in possession of a fully working brain  and every igor was guaranteed to have at least one of those .  igors were  in fact  smart  which was why they were always elsewhere when the fiery torches hit the windmill .   and they were perfectionists .  ask them to build you a device and you wouldn   t get what you asked for .   you   d get what you wanted .   in its web of reflections  the glooper glooped .  water rose in a thin glass tube and dripped into a little glass bucket  which tipped into a tiny see saw and caused a tiny valve to open .       owlswick jenkins   s recent abode  according to the times  was short alley .  there wasn   t a house number  because short alley was only big enough for one front door .  the door in question was shut  but hanging by one hinge .  a scrap of black and yellow rope indicated  for those who hadn   t spotted the clue of the door  that the place had come to the recent attention of the watch .   the door fell off the hinge when moist pushed at it  and landed in the stream of water that was gushing down the alley .   it wasn   t much of a search  because owlswick hadn   t bothered to hide .  he was in a room on the first floor  surrounded by mirrors and candles  a dreamy look on his face  peacefully painting .   he dropped the brush when he saw moist  grabbed a tube that lay on a bench  and held it in front of his mouth  ready to swallow .      don   t make me use this .  don   t make me use this .     he warbled  his whole body trembling .      is it some kind of toothpaste .     said moist .  he sniffed the very lived in air of the studio and added     that could help  you know .         this is uba yellow  the most poisonous paint in the world .  stand back or i will die horribly .     said the forger .     er   in fact  the most poisonous paint is probably agatean white  but i   ve run out of that  it is most vexing .     it occurred to owlswick that he had lost the tone slightly  and he quickly raised his voice again .     but this is pretty poisonous  all the same .      a gifted amateur picks up a lot  and moist had always found poisons interesting .      an arsenical compound  eh .     said moist .  everyone knew about agatean white .  he hadn   t heard of uba yellow  but arsenic came in many inviting shades .  just don   t lick your brush .      it   s a horrible way to die     he said .     you more or less melt over several days .         i   m not going back .  i   m not going back .     squeaked owlswick .      they used to use it to make skin whiter     said moist  moving a little closer .      get back .  i   ll use it .  i swear i   ll use it .         that   s where we get the phrase    drop dead gorgeous        said moist  closing in .   he snatched at owlswick  who rammed the tube in his mouth .  moist tugged it out  pushing the forger   s clammy little hands out of the way  and examined it .      just as i thought     he said  pocketing the tube .     you forgot to take the cap off .  it   s the kind of mistake amateurs always make .      owlswick hesitated  and then said     you mean there   s people who commit suicide professionally .         look  mr .  jenkins  i   m here to       moist began .      i   m not going back to that jail .  i   m not going back .     said the little man  backing away .      that   s fine by me .  i want to offer you a           they watch me  you know     owlswick volunteered .     all the time .      ah .  this was slightly better than suicide by paint  but only just .      er   you mean in jail .     said moist  just to make sure .      they watch me everywhere .  there   s one of them right behind you .      moist stopped himself from turning  because that way madness lay .  mind you  quite a lot of it was standing right here in front of him .      i   m sorry to hear that  owlswick     said moist .     that   s why        moist hesitated  and thought    not .  it had worked on him .      that   s why i   m going to tell you about angels     he said .       people said there were more thunderstorms now that igors were living in the city .  there was no more thunder now  but the rain fell as if it had got all night .   some of it swirled over the top of moist   s boots as he stood in front of the bank   s unobtrusive side door and tried to remember the barber surgeon   s knock .   oh  yes .  it was the old one that went rat tat a tat tat tat tat .   or  to put it another way  shave and a haircut   no legs .   the door opened instantly .      i would like to apologithe about the lack of creak  thur  but the hingeth jutht don   t theem to           just give me a hand with this lot  will you .     said moist  bent under the weight of two heavy boxes .     this is mr .  jenkins .  can you make up a bed for him down here .  and is there any chance you could change what he looks like .         more than you could poththibly imagine  thur     said igor happily .      i was thinking of  well  a shave and a haircut .  you can do that  can   t you .      igor gave moist a pained look .      it is true that technically thurgeonth can perform tonthorial operations           no no  don   t touch his throat  please .         that meanth yeth  i can give him a haircut  thur     igor sighed .      i have had my tonsils out when i was ten     said owlswick .      would you like thome more .     said igor  looking for some bright edge to the situation .      this is wonderful light .     owlswick exclaimed  ignoring the offer .     it   s like day .         jolly good     said moist .     now get some sleep  owlswick .  remember what i told you .  in the morning  you are going to design the first proper one dollar bank note  understand .      owlswick nodded  but his mind was already elsewhere .      you   re with me on this  are you .     said moist loudly .     a note so good that no one else could do it .  i showed you my attempt  yes .  i know you can do better  of course .      he looked nervously at the little man .  he wasn   t insane  moist was sure  but it was clear that mostly  for him  the world happened elsewhere .   owlswick paused in the act of unpacking his box .      um   i can   t make things up     he said .      what do you mean .     said moist .      i don   t know how to make things up     said owlswick  staring at a paintbrush as if expecting it to whistle .      but you   re a forger .  your stamps look better than ours .         er   yes .  but i don   t have your   i don   t know how to get started   i mean  i need something to work from   i mean  once it   s there  i can        it must be about four o   clock  thought moist .  four o   clock .  i hate it when there are two four o   clocks in the same day     he snatched a piece of paper from owlswick   s box  and pulled out a pencil .      look     he said     you start with        what .      richness     he told himself  aloud     richness and solidarity  like the front of the bank .  lots of ornate scrolling  which is hard to copy .  a   panorama  a cityscape   yes .  ankh morpork  it   s all about the city .  vetinari   s head  because they   ll expect that  and a great big one  so they get the message .  oh  the coat of arms  we must have that .  and down here       the pencil scribbled fast       a space for the chairman   s signature  pardon me  i mean paw print .  on the back   well  we are talking fine detail  owlswick .  some god would give us a bit of gravitas .  one of the jollier ones .  what   s the name of that god with the three pronged fork .  one like him  anyway .  fine lines  owlswick  that   s what we want .  oh  and a boat .  i like boats .  tell    em it   s worth a dollar again  too .  um   oh yes  mystic stuff doesn   t hurt  people   ll believe in any damn thing if it sounds old and mysterious .  doth not a penny to the widow outshine the unconquered sun .         what does that mean .         i haven   t the foggiest idea     said moist     i just made it up .     he sketched away for a while and then pushed the paper across to the awestruck owlswick .      something like that     he said .     have a go .  think you can make something of it .         i   ll try     owlswick promised .      good .  i   ll see you tomo   later on .  igor here will look after you .      owlswick was already staring at nothing .  moist pulled igor aside .      just a shave and a haircut  okay .         as you with  thur .  am i right in thinking that the gentleman doeth not want any entanglementth with the watch .         correct .         no problem there  thur .  could i thuggetht a change of name .         good idea .  any suggestions .         i like the name clamp  thur .  and for a firtht name  exorbit thpringth to mind     igor sprayed .      really .  where did it spring from .  no  don   t answer that .  exorbit clamp       moist hesitated  but at this time of the night  why argue .  especially when it was this time of the morning .     exorbit clamp it is  then .  make certain he forgets even the name of jenkins     moist added  with what  he later realized  was in the circumstances a definite lack of foresight .   moist slipped back up to bed without ever having to duck out of sight .  no guard is at his best in the small hours .  the place was locked up tight  wasn   t it .  who would break in .   down in the well fornicated vault  the artist formerly known as owlswick stared at moist   s sketches and felt his brain begin to fizz .  it was true that he was not  in any proper sense  a madman .  he was  by certain standards  very sane .  faced with a world too busy  complex  and incomprehensible to deal with  he   d reduced it to a small bubble just big enough to hold him and his palette .  it was nice and quiet in there .  all the noises were far away  and they couldn   t spy on him .      mr .  igor .     he said .   igor looked up from a crate in which he had been rummaging .  he held what looked like a metal colander in his hands .      how may i be of thurvith  thur .         can you get me some old books with pictures of gods and boats and maybe some views of the city too .         indeed  thur .  there ith an antiquarian booktheller in lobbin clout .     igor put the metal device aside  pulled a battered leather bag from under the table  and  after a moment   s thought  put a hammer in it .   even in the world of the newly fledged mr .  clamp  it was still so late at night that it was too early in the morning .      er   i   m sure it can wait until daylight     he volunteered .      oh  i alwayth thhop at night  thur     said igor     when i   m after   bargainth .          moist woke fully dressed and far too early  with mr .  fusspot standing on his chest and squeaking his rubber bone very loudly .  as a result  moist was being dribbled on in no small way .   behind mr .  fusspot was gladys .  behind her were two men in black suits .      his lordship has agreed to see you  mr .  lipwig     said one of them quite cheerfully .   moist tried to wipe the slobber off his lapel  and only succeeded in shining the suit .      do i want to see him .      one of the men smiled .      ooooh yes .             a hanging always makes me hungry     said lord vetinari  working carefully on a hard boiled egg .     don   t you find this so .         um   i   ve only been hanged once     said moist .     i didn   t feel like eating much .         i think it is the chilly early morning air     said vetinari  apparently not hearing this .     it puts an edge on the appetite .      he looked directly at moist for the first time  and appeared concerned .      oh dear  you   re not eating  mr .  lipwig .  you must eat .  you look a little peaky .  i trust your job is not getting on top of you .      somewhere en route to the palace  moist thought  he must have stepped into another world .  it had to be something like that .  it was the only explanation .      er   who was hanged .     he said .      owlswick jenkins  the forger     said vetinari  devoting himself again to the surgical removal of the white from the yolk .     drumknott  perhaps mr .  lipwig would like some fruit .  or some of that bowel lacerating grain and nut concoction you favor so much .         indeed  sir     said the secretary .   vetinari leaned forward as if inviting moist to join a conspiracy and added     i believe the cook does kippers for the guards .  very fortifying .  you really do look quite pale .  don   t you think he looks pale  drumknott .         verging on the wan  sir .      it was like having acid dropped slowly into your ear .  moist thought frantically  but the best he could come up with was     was it a well attended hanging .         not very .  i don   t think it was properly advertised     said vetinari     and  of course  his crime was not associated with buckets of gore .  that always makes the crowd cheer as you know .  but owlswick jenkins was there  oh yes .  he never cut a throat but he bled the city  drop by drop .      vetinari had removed and eaten the whole of the white of the egg  leaving the yolk glowing and unsullied .   what would i have done if i was vetinari and found my prison was about to become a laughingstock .  there   s nothing like laughter for undermining authority  moist thought .  more important  what would he have done if he was him  which of course he is     you   d hang someone else  that   s what you   d do .  you   d find some wretch of the right general shape who was waiting in the slammer for the hemp fandango and cut him a deal .  oh  he   d hang right enough  but under the name of owlswick jenkins .  news would get out that the stand in had been pardoned but died accidentally or something  and his dear ol    mum or his wife and kids would get an anonymous bag of wonga and escape a little bit of shame .   and then the crowd would get their hanging .  now  with any luck  bellyster had a job washing spittoons  justice or something vaguely similar would be seen to be done  and the message would be sent out that crimes against the city should be contemplated exclusively by those with cast iron necks  and even then  only maybe .   moist realized he was touching his own neck .  sometimes he woke up in the night  even now  just a moment after the void opened under his feet     vetinari was looking at him .  it wasn   t exactly a smile on his face  but moist got the nape twitching feeling that  when he tried to think like vetinari  his lordship slid in on those thoughts like some big black spider on a bunch of bananas and scuttled around where he shouldn   t .   and the certainty hit him .  owlswick wouldn   t have died anyway .  not with a talent like that .  he would have dropped through the trapdoor to a new life  just as moist had .  he   d have woken up to be given the angel offer  which for owlswick would have been a nice light room somewhere  three meals a day  his potty emptied on demand  and all the ink he wanted .  from an owlswick point of view  he   d be getting heaven .  and vetinari   would get the world   s best forger  working for the city .   oh  damn .  i   m right in his way .  i   m in vetinari   s way .   the orange gold ball of the rejected yolk glowed on vetinari   s plate .      your wonderful plans for paper money are progressing .     said his lordship .     i   m hearing such a lot about them .         what .  oh   yes .  er   i   d like to put your head on a dollar bill  please .         but of course .  a good place to put a head  considering all the places a head might be put .      like a spike  yeah .  he needs me  moist thought  as the totally not a threat sank in .  but how much .      look  i           possibly your fertile mind can assist me with a little puzzle  mr .  lipwig .     vetinari dabbed at his lips and pushed back his chair .     do follow me .  drumknott  please bring the ring .  and the tongs  of course  just in case .      he led the way out onto the balcony  trailed by moist  and leaned on the balustrade with his back to the foggy city .      still a lot of cloud about  but i think the sun should break through at any time  don   t you think .     he said .   moist glanced up at the sky .  there was a patch of pale gold among the billows  like the yolk of an egg .  what was the man doing .      pretty soon  yes     he ventured .   the secretary handed vetinari a small box .      that   s the box for your signet ring     said moist .      well done  mr .  lipwig  observant as ever .  do take it .      guardedly  moist picked up the ring .  it was black and had an odd  organic feel to it .  the v seemed to stare at him .      do you notice anything unusual about it .     said vetinari  watching him carefully .      feels warm     said moist .      yes it does  doesn   t it     said vetinari .     that is because it is made of stygium .  it   s called a metal  but i strongly believe that it is an alloy  and a magically constructed one at that .  the dwarfs sometimes find it in the loko region  and it is extremely expensive .  one day i shall write a monograph on its fascinating history  but for now  all i will say is that it is usually only of interest to those who  by inclination or lifestyle  move in darkness   and also  of course  to those who find a life without danger hardly worth living .  it can kill  you see .  in direct sunshine it heats within a few seconds to a temperature that will melt iron .  no one knows why .      moist glanced up at the hazy sky .  the boiled egg glow of the sun drifted into another bank of fog .  the ring cooled .      occasionally there is a fad among young assassins for stygium rings .  classically  they wear an ornate black glove over the ring during the day .  it   s all about risk  mr .  lipwig .  it   s about living with death in your pocket .  i swear  there are people who will pull a tiger   s tail for mischief .  of course  people who are interested in coolth rather than danger just wear the glove .  be that as it may  less than two weeks ago the only man in the city who carries a stock of stygium and knows how to work it was murdered  late at night .  the murderer dropped a peppermint bomb afterward .  who do you think did it .      i   m not going to look up  thought moist .  this is just a game .  he wants me to sweat .      what was taken .     he said .      the watch does not know  because  you see  what was taken was  de facto  not there .         all right  what was left behind .     said moist  and thought  he   s not looking at the sky  either        some gems and a few ounces of stygium in the safe     said vetinari .     you didn   t ask how the man was killed .         how was           crossbow shot to the head  while he was seated .  is this exciting  mr .  lipwig .         hit man  then     said moist desperately .     it was planned  because he   d brought the bomb .  maybe the dead man didn   t pay a debt .  perhaps he was a fence and tried to pull a scam .  there   s not enough information .         there never is     said vetinari .     my cap comes back from the cleaners subtly changed  and a young man who works there dies in a brawl .  a former gardener here comes in at the dead of night to buy a rather worn pair of drumknott   s old boots .  why .  perhaps we shall never know .  why was a picture of myself stolen from the royal art gallery last month .  who benefits .         uh  why was this stygium left in the safe .         good question .  the key was in the man   s pocket .  so what is our motive .         not enough information .  revenge .  silence .  maybe he   s made something he shouldn   t .  can you make a dagger out of this stuff .         ah  i think you are getting warm  mr .  lipwig .  not about a weapon  because accretions of stygium much bigger than a ring tend to explode without warning .  but he was a rather greedy man  that is true .         an argument over something .     said moist .  yes  i am getting warm  thank you .  and what are the tongs for .  to pick it up after it   s dropped through my hand .   the light was growing  he could see faint shadows on the wall  he felt the sweat trickle down his spine        an interesting thought .  do give me that ring back     said vetinari  proffering the box .   hah .  so it was just a show to scare him  after all  moist thought  flicking the wretched ring into the box .  i   ve never even heard of stygium before today .  he must have made it up     he sensed the heat before it  and saw the ring blaze white hot as it fell into the box .  the lid snapped shut  leaving a purple hole in moist   s vision .      remarkable  isn   t it     said vetinari .     incidentally  i think you were needlessly silly to hold it all that time .  i   m not a monster  you know .      no  monsters don   t play tricks with your brain  thought moist .  at least  while it   s still inside your head        look  about owlswick  i didn   t mean       he began  but vetinari held up a hand .      i don   t know what you are talking about  mr .  lipwig .  in fact  i invited you here in your capacity as de facto deputy chairman of the royal bank .  i want you to loan me   that is to say  the city   half a million dollars at two percent .  you are  of course  at liberty to refuse .      so many thoughts scrambled for the emergency exit in moist   s brain that only one remained   we   re going to need some bigger notes         moist ran back to the bank  and straight to the little door under the stairs .  he liked it down in the undercroft .  it was cool and peaceful  apart from the gurgling of the glooper and the screams .   that last bit was wrong  wasn   t it .   the pink poisons of involuntary insomnia slopped around in his head as he broke into a run .   the former owlswick was sitting in a chair  apparently clean shaven except for a pointy little beard .  some kind of metal helmet had been attached to his head  and from it wires ran down into some glowing  clicking device that only an igor would want to understand .  the air smelled of thunderstorms .      what are you doing to this poor man .     moist yelled .      changing hith mind  thur     said igor  pulling a huge knife switch .   the helmet buzzed .  clamp blinked .      it tickles     he said .     and  for some reason  it tastes of strawberries .         you   re putting lightning right into his head .     said moist .     that   s barbaric .         no  thur .  barbarianth don   t have the capabilitieth     said igor smoothly .     all i   m doing  thur  ith taking out all the bad memo rieth and thtoring them       here he pulled a cloth aside to reveal a big jar full of green liquid  containing something rounded and studded with still more wires       into thith .         you   re putting his brain into a   parsnip .         it ith a turnip     said igor .      it   s amazing what they can do  isn   t it     said a voice by moist   s elbow .  he looked down .   mr .  clamp  now helmetless  beamed up at him .  he looked shiny and alert  like a better class of shoe salesman .  igor had even managed a suit transplant .      are you all right .     said moist .      fine .         what did   it feel like .         hard to explain     said clamp .     but it sounded like the smell of raspberries tastes .         really .  oh .  i suppose that   s all right  then .  and you really feel okay  in yourself .     said moist  probing for the dreadful drawback .  it had to be there .  but owls   exorbit looked happy and full of confidence and vim  a man ready to take what life threw at him and knock it out of the court .   igor was winding up his wiring with what  under all those scars  was a very smug look on what was probably his face .   moist felt a pang of guilt .  he was an   berwald boy  he   d come down the vilinus pass like everyone else  trying to seek his fortune   correction  everybody else   s fortune   and he had no right to pick up the fashionable lowland prejudice against the clan of igors .  after all  didn   t they simply put into practice what so many priests professed to believe  that the body was just a rather heavy cheap suit clothing the invisible  everlasting soul  and therefore  swapping around bits and pieces like spare parts was surely no worse than running a shonky shop for used clothing .  it was a constant source of hurt amazement to igors that people couldn   t see that this was both sensible and provident  at least up until the time when the axe slipped and you needed someone to lend a hand in a hurry .  at a time like that  even an igor looked good .   mostly they looked   serviceable .  igors  with their obliviousness to pain  wonderful healing powers  and marvelous ability to carry out surgery on themselves with the aid of a hand mirror  could presumably not look like a stumpy butler who   d been left in the rain for a month .  igorinas always looked stunning  but there was always something   a beautifully curved scar under one eye  a ring of decorative stitching around a wrist   that was for the look .  that was always disconcerting  but an igor always had his heart in the right place .  or a heart  at least .      well  er   well done  igor     moist managed .     ready to make a start on the ol    dollar bill  then  mr .   er  clamp .      mr .  clamp   s smile was full of sunbeams .     done it .     he announced .     did it this morning .         surely not .         indeed i have .  come and see .     the little man walked over to a table and lifted a sheet of paper .   the bank note gleamed  in purple and gold .  it gave off money in rays .  it seemed to float above the paper like a small magic carpet .  it said wealth and mystery and tradition        we   re going to make so much money .     said moist .  we   d better  he added to himself .  we   ll need to print at least six hundred thousand of these  unless i can come up with some bigger denominations .   but there it was  so beautiful you wanted to cry  and make lots more like it  and put them in your wallet .      how did you do it so quickly .         well  a lot of it is just geometry     said mr .  clamp .     mr .  igor here was kind enough to make me a little device which was a great help there .  it   s not finished  of course  and i haven   t even started on the other side yet .  i think i   ll make a start on that now  in fact  while i   m still fresh .         you think you can do better .     said moist  awed in the presence of genius .      i feel so   full of energy .     said clamp .      that would be the elecktrical fluid  i expect     said moist .      no  i mean i can see so clearly what needs to be done .  before  it was all like some horrible weight i had to lift  but now everything is clear and light .         well  i   m glad to hear it     said moist  not entirely certain that he was .     do excuse me  i have a bank to run .      he hurried through the arches and entered the main hall via the unassuming door in time to very nearly collide with bent .      ah  mr .  lipwig  i wondered where you were           is this going to be important  mr .  bent .      the chief cashier looked offended  as if he   d ever trouble moist about anything that was not important .      there are lots of men outside the mint     he said .     with trolls and carts .  they say you want them to install a       bent shuddered       a printing engine .         that   s right     said moist .     they   re from teemer and spools .  we must print the money here .  it   ll look more official and we can control what goes out of the doors .         mr .  lipwig .  you are turning the bank into a   a circus .         well  i   m the man with the top hat  mr .  bent  so i suppose i   m the ringmaster .      he said it with a laugh  to lighten the mood a little  but bent   s face was a sudden thundercloud .      really  mr .  lipwig .  and whoever told you the ringmaster runs the circus .  you are very much mistaken  sir .  why are you cutting off the other shareholders .         because they don   t know what a bank is about .  come with me to the mint  will you .      he strode through the main hall  having to dodge and weave between the queues .      and you know what a bank is about  do you  sir .     said bent  following behind in his jerky flamingo step .      i   m learning .  why do we have one queue in front of each clerk .     moist demanded .     it means that if one customer takes up a lot of time  the whole queue has to wait .  then they   ll start hopping sideways from one queue to another and the next thing you know someone has a nasty head wound .  have one big queue and tell people to go to the next clerk free .  people don   t mind a long queue if they can see that it   s moving   sorry  sir .      this was to a customer he   d collided with  who steadied him self  grinned at moist  and spoke in a voice from a past that should have stayed buried .     why  if it isn   t my old friend albert .  you   re doin    well for yourself  ain   t you .     the stranger went on  spluttering the words through ill fitting teeth .     you in your shuit o    lightsh .          moist   s past life flashed before his eyes .  he didn   t even need to go to the bother of dying  although he felt as though he was going to .   it was cribbins .  it could only be cribbins .   moist   s memory sandbagged him  one bag after another .  the teeth .  those damn false teeth .  they were that man   s pride and joy .  he   d prized them out of the mouth of an old man he   d robbed  while the poor devil lay dying of fear .  he   d joked that they had a mind of their own .  and they spluttered and popped and slurped and fitted so badly that they once turned around in his mouth and bit him in the throat .  he used to take them out and talk to them .  and  aargh  they were so old  and the stained teeth had been carved from walrus ivory and the spring was so strong that sometimes it   d force the top of his head back so that you could see right up his nose .  .   it all came back like a bad oyster .   he was just cribbins .  no one knew his first name .  they   d teamed up oh  ten years ago  and they   d run the old legacy con in   berwald one winter .  he was much older than moist and still had the serious personal problem that made him smell of bananas .   and he was a nasty piece of work .  professionals had their pride .  there had to be some people you wouldn   t rob  some things you didn   t steal .  and you had to have style .  if you didn   t have style  you   d never fly .   cribbins didn   t have style .  he wasn   t violent  unless there was absolutely no chance of retaliation  but there was some generalized  wretched  wheedling malice about the man that had got on moist   s soul .      is there a problem  mr .  lipwig .     said bent  glaring at cribbins .      what .  oh   no       said moist .   it   s a shakedown  he thought .  that bloody picture in the paper .  but he can   t prove a thing  not a thing .      you are mistaken  sir     said moist .  he looked around .  the queues were moving  and no one was paying them any attention .   cribbins put his head on one side and gave moist an amused look .     mishtaken  shir .  could be .  i could be mishtaken .  life on the road  making new chums every day  you know   well  you wouldn   t  would you  on account of not being albert shpangler .  funny  though     cos you have his smile  sir  hard to change a man   s smile  and your smile ish  like  in front of your face  like you is shlooking out from behind it slurp .  just like young albert   s smile .  bright lad he wash  very quick  very quick  i taught him everything he knew .         and that took about ten minutes  moist thought  and a year to forget some of it .  you   re the sort that gives criminals a bad name           course  sir  you   re wonderin     can the leopard change his shorts .  can that ol    rascal i knew all them years ago have forsook the wide and wobbly for the straight an    narrow .     he glanced at moist  and amended     whoopsh .  no     course you ain   t  on account of you never seein    me before .  but i was scrobbled in pseudopolis  you see  thrown into the clink for malicious lingering  and that   s where i found om .         why .  what had he done .     it was stupid  but moist couldn   t resist it .      do not jest  sir  do not jest     said cribbins solemnly .     i am a changed man  a changed man .  it is my task to pass on the good news  shir .     here  with the speed of a snake   s tongue  cribbins produced a battered tin from inside his greasy jacket .     my crimes weigh me down like chains of hot iron  shir  like chains  but i am a man anxious to unburden himshelf by means of good works and confession  the last bein    mosht important .  i have to get a lot off my chest before i can sleep easy  shir .     he rattled the box .     for the kiddies  shir .      this would probably work better if i hadn   t seen you do this before  moist thought .  the penitent thief must be one of the oldest cons in the book .   he said     well  i   m glad to hear it  mr .  cribbins .  i   m sorry i   m not the old friend you are looking for .  let me give you a couple of dollars   for the kiddies .      the coin clanked on the bottom of the tin .     thank you kindly  mishter shpangler     said cribbins .   moist flashed a little smile .     in fact i   m not mr .  spangler  mr .         i called him cribbins .  just then .  i called him cribbins .  did he tell me his name .  did he notice .  he must have noticed .         i beg your pardon  l mean reverend     he managed  and the average person would not have noticed the tiny pause and quite adroit save .  but cribbins wasn   t average .      thank you  mr .  lipwig     he said  and moist heard the drawn out mister and the explosively sardonic    lipwig .     they meant    gotcha .      cribbins winked at moist and strolled off through the banking hall  shaking his tin  his teeth accompanying him with a medley of horrible dental noises .      woe and thrice woe szss .  is the man who stealssh by words  for his tongue shall cleave to the roof of his mouth pock .  spare a few coppersh for the poor orphans sweessh .  brothers and shisters .  to those svhip .  that hath shall be giventh  generally spheaking           i shall call the guards     said mr .  bent firmly .     we don   t allow beggars in the bank .      moist grabbed his arm .     no     he said urgently     not with all these people in here .  manhandling a man of the cloth and all that .  it won   t look good .  i think he   ll be going soon .      now he   ll let me stew  thought moist  as cribbins headed nonchalantly toward the door .  that   s his way .  he   ll spin it out .  then he   ll hit me for money  again and again .   okay  but what could cribbins prove .  but did there need to be proof .  if he started talking about albert spangler  it could get bad .  would vetinari throw him to the wolves .  he might .  he probably would .  you could bet your hat that he wouldn   t play the resurrection game without lots of contingency plans .   well  he had some time  at least .  cribbins wouldn   t go for a quick kill .  he liked to watch people wriggle .      are you all right .     said bent .  moist came back to reality .      what .  oh  fine     he said .      you should not encourage that sort of person in here  you know .      moist shook himself .      you are right about that  mr .  bent .  let   s get to the mint  shall we .         yes  sir .  but i warn you  mr .  lipwig  these men will not be won over by fancy words .             inspectors       said mr .  shady  ten minutes later  turning the word over in his mouth like a candy .      i need people who value the high traditions of the mint     said moist  and did not add  like making coins very  very slowly and taking your work home with you .      inspectors     said mr .  shady again .  behind him  the men of the sheds held their caps in their hands and watched moist owlishly  except when mr .  shady was speaking  then they stared at the back of the man   s neck .   they were all in mr .  shady   s official shed  which was built high up on the wall  like a swallow   s nest .  it creaked whenever anyone moved .      and of course  some of you will still be needed to deal with the outworkers     moist went on     but in the main it will be your job to see that mr .  spools   s men arrive on time  comport themselves as they should  and observe proper security .         security     said mr .  shady  as if tasting the word .  moist saw a flicker of evil light in the eyes of the men .  it said  these buggers will be taking over our mint but they   ll have to go past us to get out of the door .  hoho .      and of course you can keep the sheds     said moist .     i also have plans for commemorative coins and other items  so your skills will not be wasted .  fair enough .      mr .  shady looked at his fellows and then back to moist .      we   d like to talk about this     he said .   moist nodded at him  and at bent  and led the way down the creaking  swaying staircase to the floor of the mint  where the parts of the new press were already being stacked up .  bent gave a little shudder when he saw it .      they won   t accept  you know     he said with unconcealed hope in his voice .     they   ve been doing things the same way here for hundreds of years .  and they are craftsmen .         so were the people who used to make knives out of flint     said moist .  in truth  he   d been amazed at himself .  it must have been the encounter with cribbins .  it had made his brain race .     look  i don   t like to see skills unused     he said     but i   ll give them better wages and a decent job and use of the sheds .  they wouldn   t get an offer like that in a hundred years        someone was coming down the swaying stairs .  moist recognized him as young alf  who  amazingly  had managed to be employed in the mint while still too young to shave though definitely old enough to have spots .      er  the men say  will there be badges .     said the boy .      actually  i was thinking of uniforms     said moist .     silver breastplate with the city   s coat of arms on it and lightweight silver chain mail  to look impressive when we have visitors .      the boy pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket and consulted it .      what about clipboards .     he said .      certainly     said moist .     and whistles  too .         and  er  it   s def    nite about the sheds  right .         i   m a man of my word     said moist .      you are a man of words  mr .  lipwig     said bent as the boy scuttled back up the rocking steps     but i fear they will lead us into ruin .  the bank needs solidarity  reliability   everything that gold represents .      moist spun around .  it had not been a good day .  it had not been a good night  either .      mr .  bent  if you do not like what i am doing  feel free to leave .  you   ll have a good reference and all the wages due to you .      bent looked as though he   d been slapped .      leave the bank .  leave the bank .  how could i do that .  how dare you .      a door slammed above them .  they looked up .  the men of the sheds were coming down the stairs in solemn procession .      now we shall see     hissed bent .     these are men of solid worth .  they   ll have nothing to do with your gaudy offer  mr    .  ringmaster .      the men reached the bottom of the steps .  without a word they all looked at mr .  shady  except for mr .  shady  who looked at moist .      the sheds stay  right .     he said .      you   re giving in .     said mr .  bent  aghast .     after hundreds of years .         well     said mr .  shady     me and the boys had a bit of a talk and  well  at a time like this  a man   s got to think of his shed .  and the outworkers will be all right  right .         mr .  shady  i   d go to the barricades for the elim     said moist .      and we talked to some of the lads from the post office last night and they said we could trust mr .  lipwig   s word    cos he   s as straight as a corkscrew .         a corkscrew .     said bent  shocked .      yeah  we asked about that  too     said shady .     and they said he acts curly but that   s okay    cos he damn well gets the corks out .      mr .  bent   s expression went blank .     oh     he said .     this is clearly some kind of judgment clouding joke  which i do not understand .  if you will excuse me  i have a great deal of work to attend to .      his feet rising and falling  as though he was walking on an invisible staircase  mr .  bent departed in jerky haste .      very well  gentlemen  thank you for your helpful attitude     said moist  watching the retreating figure     and for my part i will get those uniforms ordered this afternoon .         you   re a fast mover  master     said mr .  shady .      stand still and your mistakes catch up with you .     said moist .  they laughed  because he   d said it  but the face of cribbins rose up in his mind and  quite unconsciously  he put his hand in his pocket and touched the blackjack .  he   d have to learn how to use it now  because a weapon you held and didn   t know how to use belonged to your enemy .   he   d bought it   why .  because it was like the lock picks  a token to prove  if only to himself  that he hadn   t given in  not all the way  that a part of him was still free .  it was like the other ready made identities  the escape plans  the caches of money and clothes .  they told him that any day he could leave all this  melt into the crowd  say good bye to the paperwork and the timetable and the endless  endless wanting .   they told him that he could give it up anytime he liked .  any hour  any minute  any second .  and because he could  he didn   t   every hour  every minute  every second .  there had to be a reason why .      mr .  lipwig .  mr .  lipwig .      a young clerk dodged and weaved through the busyness of the mint  and stopped in front of moist  panting .      mr .  lipwig  there   s a lady in the hall to see you and we   ve thanked her for not smoking three times and she   s still doing it .      the image of the wretched cribbins vanished  and was replaced with a much better one .   ah  yes .  that reason .       miss adora belle dearheart  known to moist as spike  was standing in the middle of the banking hall .  moist just headed for the smoke .      hello  you     she said  and that was that .     can you take me away from all this .     she gestured with her nonsmoking hand .  staff had meaningfully surrounded her with tall brass ashtrays  full of white sand .   moist shifted a couple of them  and let her out .      how was       he began  but she interrupted .      we can talk on the way .         where are we going .     moist asked hopefully .      unseen university     said adora belle  heading for the door .  she had a large woven bag on her shoulder .  it was apparently stuffed with straw .      not lunch then .     said moist .      lunch can wait .  this is important .         oh .          it was lunchtime at unseen university  where every meal is important .  it was hard to find a time when some meal or other was not in progress there .  the library was unusually empty  and adora belle walked up to the nearest wizard who did not seem gainfully employed and demanded     i want to see the cabinet of curiosity right away .         i don   t think we have anything like that     said the wizard .     who   s it by .         please don   t lie .  my name is adora belle dearheart  so as you can imagine i   ve got a pretty short temper .  my father brought me with him when you people asked him to come and look at the cabinet  about twenty years ago .  you wanted to find out how the doors worked .  someone must remember .  it was in a big room .  a very big room .  and it had lots and lots of drawers .  and the funny thing about them was        the wizard raised his hands quickly  as if to ward off further words .     can you wait just one minute .     he suggested .   they waited for five .  occasionally  a pointy hatted head peered around a bookshelf to look at them  and ducked away if it thought it   d been spotted .   adora belle lit a fresh cigarette .  moist pointed to a sign which said if you are smoking  thank you for being beaten about the head .      that   s just for show     said adora belle  expelling a stream of blue smoke .     all wizards smoke like chimneys .         not in here  i notice     said moist     and possibly this is because of all the highly inflammable books .  it might be a good idea to        he felt the swish of the air and got a whiff of rain forest as something heavy swung overhead and disappeared upward into the gloom  now trailing a stream of blue smoke .      hey  someone took my       adora belle began  but moist pushed her out of the way as the thing swung back again and a banana knocked his hat off .      they are a bit more definite about things here     he said  picking up his hat .     if it   s any comfort  the librarian probably intended to hit me .  he can be quite gallant .         ah  you   re mr .  lipwig  i recognize the suit .     said an elderly wizard  who clearly hoped he was appearing as if by magic but  in fact  had appeared as if by stepping out from behind a bookcase .     i know i am the chair of indefinite studies here  for my sins .  and you  ahaha  by a process of elimination  will be miss dearheart  who remembers the cabinet of curiosity .     the chair of indefinite studies stepped closer and looked conspiratorial .  he lowered his voice .     i wonder if i can persuade you to forget about it .         not a chance     said adora belle .      we like to think of it as one of our better kept secrets  you see           good .  i   ll help you keep it     said adora belle .      nothing i could say could change your mind .         i don   t know     said adora belle .     abracadabra  maybe .  got your spell book .     moist was impressed at that .  she could be s   spiky .      oh   that type of lady     said the chair of indefinite studies wearily .     modern .  oh well  i suppose you   d better come with me  then .         what   s this all about please .     hissed moist  as they followed the wizard .      i need something translated     said adora belle     in a hurry .         aren   t you glad to see me .         oh yes .  lots .  but i need something translated in a hurry .         and this cabinet thing can help .         perhaps .         perhaps .     perhaps    could wait until after lunch  couldn   t it .  if it was    definitely     now  i could have seen the point           oh dear  i   m afraid i   m lost again  and through no fault of my own  i might add     grumbled the chair of indefinite studies .     i   m afraid  they keep changing the parameters and they do leak so  i don   t know  what with one thing and another you can   t call your door your own these days           what were your sins .     said moist  giving up on adora belle .      pardon .  oh dear  what is that stain on the ceiling .  probably best not to know           what were the sins you committed in order to become the chair of indefinite studies .     moist persisted .      oh  i just tend to say that for something to say     said the wizard  opening a door and slamming it again quickly .     but right now i   m inclined to think i must have committed a few  and they must have been whoppers .  it   s just unbearable at the moment  of course .  they   re saying that everything in the whole wretched universe is technically indefinable  but what am i supposed to do about it .  and of course this damn cabinet is playing havoc with the place again  i thought we   d seen the last of it fifteen years ago   oh  yes  mind the squid  we   re a bit puzzled about that  actually   ah  here   s the right door     the chair sniffed     and it   s twenty five feet away from where it ought to be .  what did i tell you        the door opened and then it was just a matter of knowing where to start .  moist opted for letting his jaw drop  which was clean and simple .   the room was bigger than it ought to be .  no room ought to be more than a mile across  especially when outside in the corridor  which looked quite ordinary if you ignored the giant squid  it appeared to have perfectly normal rooms on either side of it .  it shouldn   t have a ceiling so high that you couldn   t see it  either .  it simply should not fit .      it   s quite easy to do this  actually     said the chair of indefinite studies  as they stared .     at least  so they tell me     he added wistfully .     apparently  if you shrink time you can expand space .         how do they do that .     moist asked  staring at the   structure that was the cabinet of curiosity .      i   m proud to say i haven   t got the faintest idea     said the chair .     frankly  i   m afraid i got rather lost round about the time we stopped using dribbly candles .  i know it   s technically my department but i find it best just to let them get on with it .  they do insist on trying to explain things  which of course does not help        moist  if he   d had any mental picture at all  was expecting a cabinet .  after all  that   s what it was called  yes .   but what filled most of the impossible room was a tree  in the general shape of a venerable spreading oak .  it was a tree in winter  there were no leaves .  and then  when the mind had found a familiar  friendly simile  it had to come to terms with the fact that the tree was made of filing cabinets .  they appeared to be wooden ones  but this didn   t help much .   high up in what had to be called the branches  wizards on broomsticks were engaged in who knew what .  they looked like insects .      it is a bit of a shock when you see it for the first time  isn   t it     said a friendly voice .   moist looked around at a young wizard  at least by the standards of wizards  who had round spectacles  a clipboard  and the shiny sort of expression that says  i probably know more than you can possibly imagine  but i am still reasonably happy to talk even to people like you .      you   re ponder stibbons  right .     said moist .     the only one who does any work in the university .      other wizards turned their heads at this  and ponder went red .      that   s quite untrue .  i just pull my weight  like any other member of the faculty     he said  but a slight tone to his voice suggested that perhaps the other faculty members had far too much weight and not enough pull .     i am in charge of the cabinet project  for my sins .         why .  what did you do .     said moist  at sea in a world of sin .     something worse .         er   volunteered to take it over     said ponder .     and i have to say we have learned more in the last six months than in the past twenty five years .  the cabinet is a truly amazing artifact .         where did you find it .         in the attic  tucked behind a collection of stuffed frogs .  we think people gave up trying to make it work years ago .  of course  that was back in the dribbly candle era     said ponder  earning a snort from the chair of indefinite studies .     modern techno mancy is somewhat more useful .         all right  then     said moist     what does it do .         we don   t know .         how does it work .         we don   t know .         where did it come from .         we don   t know .         well  that seems to be all     said moist sarcastically .     oh no  one last one  what is it .  and let me tell you  i   m agog .         that may be the wrong sort of question to ask     said ponder  shaking his head .     technically it appears to be a classic bag of holding but with n mouths  where n is the number of items in an eleven dimensional universe  which are not currently alive  not pink  and can fit in a cubical drawer    .    inches on a side  divided by p .         what   s p .         that may be the wrong sort of question .         when i was a little girl  it was just a magic box     adora belle broke in  in a dreamy voice .     it was in a much smaller room and when it unfolded a few times there was a box with a golem   s foot in it .         ah  yes  in the third iteration     said ponder .     they couldn   t get much further than that in those days .  now  of course  we   ve got controlled recursion and aim driven folding that effectively reduces collateral boxing to   .    percent  a twelvefold improvement in the last year alone .         that   s great .     said moist  feeling that it was the least he could do .      does miss dearheart want to see the item again .     said ponder  lowering his voice .   adora belle still had a faraway look in her eyes .      i think so     said moist .     she   s very big on golems .         we were about to fold up for today in any case     said ponder .     it won   t hurt to pick up the foot on the way .      he took a large megaphone from a bench and held it to his lips .      the cabinet closes in three minutes  gentlemen .  all researchers inside the safety area now  please .  be there or be square .         be there or be square .     said moist  as ponder lowered the megaphone .      oh  a couple of years ago someone ignored the warning and  um  when the cabinet folded up  he temporarily became a curiosity .         you mean he ended up inside a fourteen inch cube .     said moist  horrified .      mostly .  look  we really would be very happy if you didn   t tell anyone about the cabinet  thank you .  we know how to use it  we think  but it might not be the way it was intended to be used .  we don   t know what it   s for  as you put it  or who built it or even if they are completely the wrong questions to ask .  nothing in it is bigger than about fourteen inches square  but we don   t know why this is  or who it is who decides they are curious  or why  and we certainly don   t know why it contains nothing pink .  it   s all very embarrassing .  i   m sure you can keep a secret  mr .  lipwig .         you   d be amazed .         oh .  why .         that   s the wrong kind of question .         you do know something quite important about the cabinet     said adora belle  apparently waking up .     you know it wasn   t built for or by a girl between the ages of four and  oh  eleven years old .         how do we know that .         no pink .  trust me .  no girl in that age group would leave out pink .         are you sure .  that   s wonderful .     said ponder  making a note on his clipboard .     that   s certainly worth knowing .  let   s get the foot  then  shall we .      the broomstick riding wizards had touched down now .  ponder cleared his throat and picked up the megaphone .     all down .  wonderful .  hex   be so good as to fold  please .      there was silence for a while  and then a distant clattering noise began to grow  up near the ceiling .  it sounded like gods shuffling wooden playing cards that happened to be a mile high .      hex is our thinking engine     said ponder .     we   d hardly be able to explore the box at all without him .      the clattering was becoming louder and faster .      you might find your ears aching     said ponder  raising his voice .     hex tries to control the speed  but it takes finite time for the ventilators to get air back into the room .  the volume of the cabinet changes very fast  you see .      this was shouted against the thunder of collapsing drawers .  they slammed in on themselves far too fast for the human eye to follow as the edifice shrunk and folded and slid and rattled down into house size  shed size  and  finally  in the middle of the huge space  unless it was some kind of time  stood a small polished cabinet  about a foot and a half on a side  standing on four beautifully carved legs .   the cabinet   s doors clicked shut .      slowly unfold to specimen           said ponder  in the ringing silence .   the doors opened .  a deep drawer slid out .   it went on sliding .      just follow me     said ponder  strolling toward the cabinet .     it   s fairly safe .         er  a drawer about a hundred yards long has just slid out of a box about fourteen inches square     said moist  in case he was the only one to notice .      yes .  that   s what happens     said ponder  as the drawer slid back about halfway .  its side  moist saw  was a line of drawers .  so drawers opened   out of drawers .  of course  moist thought  in eleven dimensional space that was the wrong thing to think .      it   s a sliding puzzle     said adora belle     but with lots more directions to slide .         that is a very graphic analogy which aids understanding wonderfully while being  strictly speaking  wrong in every possible way     said ponder .   adora belle   s eyes narrowed .  she had not had a cigarette in ten minutes .   the long drawer extruded another drawer at right angles .  all along the sides of it were  yes  yet more drawers .  one of these extended slowly .   moist took a risk and tapped on what appeared to be perfectly ordinary wood .  it made a perfectly ordinary noise .      should i worry that i just saw a drawer slide through another drawer .     he said .      no     said ponder .     the cabinet is trying to make four dimensional sense of something that is happening in eleven or  possibly  ten .         trying .  do you mean it   s alive .         aha .  the right type of question .         i bet you don   t know the answer  though .         you are correct .  but you must admit it   s an interesting question not to know the answer to .  and  yes  here we have the foot .  hold and collapse please  hex .      the drawers collapsed back into themselves in a series of crashes  much shorter and less dramatic than before  leaving the cabinet looking demure and antique and slightly bow legged .  it had little claws as feet  a cabinet maker   s affectation that always annoyed moist in a low grade way .  did they think the things moved around in the night .  or maybe the cabinet really did .   and the cabinet   s doors were open .  nestling inside  and only just fitting  was a golem   s foot  or at least most of one .   once  golems were delicate and beautiful .  once  the very best sculptors probably made them to rival the most beautiful of statues  but long since then the fumble fingered many who could barely make a snake out of clay found that bashing the stuff into the shape of a big  hulking gingerbread man worked just as well .   this foot was one of the early kind .  it was made of a clay like white china  with patterns of tiny raised markings in yellow  black  and red .  a little brass plate in front of it was engraved  in   berwaldean  foot of umnian golem  middle period .      well  whoever made the cabinet comes from           anyone looking at the labels sees it in their native tongue     said ponder wearily .     the markings apparently indicate that it did indeed come from the city of um  according to the late professor flead .         um .     said moist .     um what .  they weren   t sure what to call the place .         just um     said ponder .     very ancient .  about sixty thousand years  i believe .  back in the clay age .         the first golem makers     said adora belle .  she unslung the bag and started to rummage in the straw .   moist tapped the foot .  it seemed eggshell thin .      it   s some sort of ceramic     said ponder .     no one knows how they made it .  the umnians even baked boats out of the stuff .         did they work .         up to a point     said ponder .     anyway  the city was totally destroyed in the first war with the ice giants .  there   s nothing there now .  we think that the foot was put in the cabinet a long time ago .         or will be dug up some time in the future  perhaps .     said moist .      that could very well be the case     said ponder gravely .      in which case  won   t that be a bit of a problem .  i mean  can it be in the ground and in the cabinet at the same time .         that  mr .  lipwig  is           the wrong type of question .         yes .  the box exists in ten or possibly eleven dimensions .  practically anything may be possible .         why only eleven dimensions .         we don   t know     said ponder .     it might be simply that more would be silly .         can you take the foot out  please .     said adora belle  who was now brushing wisps of straw off a long package .   ponder nodded  lifted out the relic with great care  and placed it gently on the bench behind them .      what would have happened if you had drop       moist began .      wrong type of question  mr .  lipwig .      adora belle put the bundle down beside the foot and unwrapped it with care .   it contained a part of a golem   s arm  two feet long .      i knew it .  the markings are the same .     she said .     and there   s a lot more on my piece .  can you translate it .         me .  no     said ponder .     the arts are not my field     he added  in a way that suggested his was a pretty superior field with much better flowers in it .     you need professor flead .         you mean the one who   s dead .     said moist .      he   s dead at the moment  but i   m sure that in the interests of discretion my colleague dr .  hicks can arrange for the professor to talk to you after lunch .         when he   ll be less dead .     said moist .      when dr .  hicks has had lunch     said ponder patiently .     professor flead will be pleased to receive visitors  er  especially miss dearheart .  he is the world expert on umnian .  every word has hundreds of meanings  i understand .         can i take the foot .     said adora belle .      no     said ponder .     it   s ours .         that was the wrong type of answer     said adora belle  picking up the foot .     on behalf of the golem trust  i am acquiring this golem .  if you can prove ownership  we will pay you a fair price for it .         would that it were that simple     said ponder  politely taking it from her     but  you see  if a curiosity is taken away from the cabinet room for more than fourteen hours and fourteen seconds  the cabinet stops working .  last time it took us three months to restart it .  but you can drop in at any time to  er  check that we   re not mistreating it .      moist laid a hand on adora belle   s arm to forestall an incident .      she   s very passionate about golems     he said .     the trust digs them up all the time .         that   s very commendable     said stibbons .     i   ll talk to dr .  hicks .  he   s the head of the department of postmortem communications .         postmortem com       moist began .     isn   t that the same as necroman           i said the department of postmortem communications     said ponder very firmly .     i suggest you come back at three o   clock .             did anything about that conversation strike you as normal .     said moist  as they stepped out into the sunlight .      actually  i thought it went very well     said adora belle .      this wasn   t how i imagined your homecoming     said moist .      why the rush .  is there some problem .         look  we found four golems at the dig     said adora belle .      that   s   good  yes .     said moist .      yes .  and you know how deep they were .         i couldn   t guess .         guess .         i don   t know .     said moist  bewildered at suddenly having to play    what   s my depth .        two hundred feet down .  that   s more than           half a mile underground .         impossible .  that   s deeper than coal .         keep it down  will you .  look  is there somewhere we can go and talk .         how about   the royal bank of ankh morpork .  there   s a private dining room .         and they   ll let us eat there  will they .         oh yes .  the chairman is a great friend of mine     said moist .      he is  is he .         he certainly is     said moist .     why  only this morning he licked my face .      adora belle stopped and turned to stare at him .     really .     she said .     then it   s just as well i got back when i did .          chapter       the joy of collops mr .  bent goes out to lunch the dark fine arts amateur thespians  avoidance of embarrassment by the pen of doom .  professor flead gets cozy lust comes in many varieties a hero of banking .  cribbins   s cup runneth over      the sun shone through the window of the bank   s dining room onto a scene of perfect pleasure .      you should sell tickets     said adora belle dreamily  with her chin in her hands .     people who are depressed would come here and go away cured .         it   s certainly hard to watch it happening and be sad     said moist .      it   s the enthusiastic way he tries to turn his mouth inside out     said adora belle .   there was a gulp from mr .   fusspot as the last of the sticky toffee pudding went down .  he then turned the bowl over hopefully  in case there was any more .  there never had been  but mr .  fusspot was not a dog to bow down to the laws of causality .      so       said adora belle     a mad old lady   all right  a very astute mad old lady   died and gave you her dog  which sort of wears this bank on its collar  and you   ve told everyone that gold is worth less than potatoes  and you broke a dastardly criminal out of your actual death row  he   s in the cellar designing    bank notes    for you  you   ve upset the nastiest family in the city  people are queuing to join the bank because you make them laugh   what have i missed .         i think my secretary is  uh  getting sweet on me .  well  i say secretary  she   s sort of assumed that she is .      some fianc  es would have burst into tears or shouted .  adora belle burst out laughing .      and she   s a golem     said moist .   the laughter stopped .     that   s not possible .  they don   t work that way .  anyway  why should a golem think he   s female .  it   s never happened before .         i bet there haven   t been many emancipated golems before .  besides  why should he think he   s male .  and she bats her eyelashes at me   well  that   s what she thinks she   s doing  i think .  the counter girls are behind this .  look i   m serious .  trouble is  so is she .         i   ll have a word with him   or  as you say  her .         good .  the other thing is  there   s this man        aimsbury poked his head around the door .  he was in love .      would you like some more minced collops  miss .     he said  waggling his eyebrows as if to indicate that the joys of minced collops were a secret known only to a few .      you   ve still got more .     said adora belle  looking down at her plate .  not even mr .  fusspot could have cleaned it better  and she   d already cleaned it twice .      do you know what they are .     said moist  who   d settled again for an omelet made by peggy .      do you .         no .         nor do i .  but my granny used to make them and they are one of my happiest childhood memories  thank you very much .  don   t spoil it .     adora belle beamed at the delighted chef .     yes please  aimsbury  just a little more then .  and could i just say that the flavor could really be brought out by just a touch of gar               you are not eating  mr .  bent     said cosmo .     perhaps a little of this pheasant .      the chief cashier looked around nervously  uneasy in this grand house full of art and servants .     i   i want to make it clear that my loyalty to the bank is              beyond question  mr .  bent .  of course .     cosmo pushed a silver tray toward him .     do eat something .  now you have come all this way .         but you are hardly eating at all  mr .  cosmo .  just bread and water .         i find it helps me think .  now  what was it you wanted to           they all like him  mr .  cosmo .  he just talks to people and they like him .  and he is really set on dismissing gold .  think of it  sir .  where would we find true worth .  he says it   s all about the city but that puts us at the mercy of politicians .  it   s trickery again .         a little brandy would do you good  i think     said cosmo .     and what you say is solid gold truth  but where is our way forward .      bent hesitated .  he did not like the lavish family .  they crawled over the bank like ivy  but at least they didn   t try to change things and at least they believed in gold .  and they weren   t silly .   mavolio bent had a definition of    silly    that most people would have considered a touch on the broad side .  laughter was silly .  theatricals  poetry  and music were silly .  clothes that weren   t gray  black  or at least of undyed cloth were silly .  pictures of things that weren   t real were silly  pictures of things that were real were unnecessary  .  the ground state of being was silliness  which had to be overcome with every mortal fiber .   missionaries from the stricter religions would have found in mavolio bent an ideal convert  except that religion was extremely silly .   numbers were not silly .  numbers held everything together .  and gold was not silly .  the lavishes believed in counting and in gold .  mr .  lipwig treated numbers as if they were something to play with  and he said gold was just lead on holiday .  that was more than silly  it was inappropriate behavior  a scourge that he had torn from his breast after years of struggle .   the man had to go .  bent had worked his way up the echelons of the bank over many years  fighting every natural disadvantage  and it hadn   t been to see this   person make a mockery of it all .  no .      a man came to the bank again today     he said .     he was very odd .  and he seemed to know mr .  lipwig  but he called him albert spangler .  talked as if he knew him from long ago and i think mr .  lipwig was upset at that .  name of cribbins  or so mr .  lipwig called him .  very old clothes  very dusty .  he made out he was a holy man  but i don   t think so .         and that was what was odd  was it .         no  mr .  cosmo           just call me cosmo  malcolm .  we surely needn   t stand on ceremony .         er   yes     said mavolio bent .     well  no  it wasn   t that .  it was his teeth .  they were those dine chewers  and they moved and rattled when he spoke  causing him to slurp .         ah  the old type with the springs     said cosmo .     very good .  and lipwig was annoyed .         oh  yes .  and the strange thing was  he said he didn   t know the man but he called him by name .      cosmo smiled .     yes  that is strange .  and the man left .         well  yes  si   mr .    cosmo     said bent .     and then i came here .         you have done very well  matthew .  should the man come in again  could you please follow him and try to find out where he is staying .         if i can  si   mr .    cosmo .         good man .     cosmo helped bent out of his chair  shook his hand  waltzed him to the door  opened the door  and ushered him out all in one smooth  balletic movement .      hurry back  mr .  bent  the bank needs you .     he said  closing the door .     he   s a strange creature  don   t you think  drumknott .      i wish he   d stop doing that  heretofore thought .  does he think he   s vetinari .  what do they call those fishes that swim alongside sharks  making themselves useful so they don   t get eaten .  that   s me  that   s what i   m doing  just hanging on  because it   s much safer than letting go .      how would vetinari find a badly dressed man  new to the city  with ill fitting teeth  drumknott .     said cosmo .   fifty dollars a month and all found  thought heretofore  snapping out of a brief marine nightmare .  never forget it .  and in another few days you   re free .      he makes much use of the beggars    guild  sir     he said .      ah  of course .  see to it .         there will be expenses  sir .         yes  drumknott  i   m conscious of the fact .  there are always expenses .  and the other matter .         soon  sir  soon .  this is not a job for cranberry  sir .  i   m having to bribe at the highest level .     heretofore coughed .     silence is expensive  sir            moist escorted adora belle back to the university in silence .  but the important thing was that nothing had been broken and no one was killed .   then  as if reaching a conclusion after much careful thought  adora belle said     i worked in a bank for a while  you know  and hardly anyone got stabbed .         i   m sorry  i forgot to warn you .  and i did push you out of the way in time .         i must admit that the way you threw me to the floor quite turned my head .         look  i   m sorry  okay .  and so is aimsbury .  and now will you tell me what all this is about .  you found four golems  right .  have you brought them back .         no  the tunnel collapsed before we got down that far .  i told you  they were half a mile down  under millions of tons of sand and mud .  for what it   s worth  we think there was a natural ice dam up in the mountains  which burst and flooded half the continent .  the stories about um say it was destroyed in a flood  so that fits .  the golems were washed away with the rubble  which ended up against some chalk cliffs by the sea .         how did you find out they were down there .  it   s   well  it   s nowhere .         the usual way .  one of our golems heard one singing .  imagine that .  it   s been underground for sixty thousand years        in the night under the world  in the pressure of the depth  in the crushing of the dark   a golem sang .  there were no words .  the song was older than words  it was older than tongues .  it was the call of the common clay  and it carried for miles .  it traveled along fault lines  made crystals sing in harmony in dark  unmeasured caverns  followed rivers that never saw the sun        and out of the ground and up the legs of a golem from the golem trust  who was pulling a wagon loaded with coal along the region   s one road .  when he arrived in ankh morpork  he told the trust .  that was what the trust did  it found golems .   cities  kingdoms  countries came and went  but the golems that priests had baked from clay and filled with holy fire tended to go on forever .  when they had no more orders  no more water to fetch or wood to hew  perhaps because the land was now on the ocean floor or the city was inconveniently under fifty feet of volcanic ash  they did nothing but wait for the next order .  they were  after all  property .  they obeyed whatever instructions were written on the little scroll in their head .  sooner or later  rock erodes .  sooner or later a new city would arise .  one day there would be orders .   golems had no concept of freedom .  they knew they were artifacts  some even still bore  on their clay  the finger marks of the long dead priests .  golems were made to be owned .   there had always been a few in ankh morpork  running errands  doing chores  pumping water deep underground  unseen and silent and not getting in anyone   s way .  then  one day  someone freed a golem by inserting in its head the receipt for the money he   d paid for it .  and then he told it that it owned itself .   a golem could not be freed by orders  or a war  or a whim .  but it could be freed by freehold .  when you have been a possession  then you really understand what freedom means  in all its magnificent terror .   dorfl  the first freed golem  had a plan .  he worked hard  around the clock he had no time for  and bought another golem .  the two golems worked hard and bought a third golem   and now there was the golem trust  which bought golems  found golems entombed underground or in the depths of the sea  and helped golems buy themselves .   in the booming city golems were worth their weight in gold .  they would accept small wages but they earned them for twenty four hours a day .  it was still a bargain   stronger than trolls  more reliable than oxen  and more indefatigable and intelligent than a dozen of each  a golem could power every machine in a workshop .   this didn   t make them popular .  there was always a reason to dislike a golem .  they didn   t drink  eat  gamble  swear  or smile .  they worked .  if a fire broke out  they hurried to it en masse and put it out and then walked back to what they had been doing .  no one knew why a creature that had been baked into life had the urge to do this  but all it won them was a kind of awkward resentment .  you couldn   t be grateful to an unmoving face with glowing eyes .      how many are down there .     said moist .      i told you .  four .      moist felt relieved .     well  that   s good .  well done .  can we have a proper celebratory meal tonight .  of something the animal wasn   t so attached to .  and then  who knows           there may be a snag     said adora belle slowly .      no  really .         oh  please .     adora belle sighed .     look  the umnians were the first golem builders  do you understand .  golem legend says that the umnians invented golems .  it   s easy to believe  too .  some priest baking a votive offering says the right words  and the clay sits up .  it was their only invention .  they didn   t need any more .  golems built their city  golems tilled their fields .  they invented the wheel  but as a children   s toy .  they didn   t need wheels  you see .  you don   t need weapons  either  when you   ve got golems instead of city walls .  you don   t even need shovels           you   re not going to tell me they built fifty foot high killer golems  are you .         only a man would think of that .         it   s our job     said moist .     if you don   t think of fifty foot high killer golems first  someone else will .         well  there   s no evidence of them     said adora belle briskly .     the umnians never even worked iron .  they did work bronze  though   and gold .      there was something about the way gold was left hanging there that moist didn   t like .      gold     he said .      umnian is a very complex language     said adora belle quickly .     none of the trust golems know much about it  so we can   t be certain           gold     said moist  his voice leaden .      so  when the digging team found caves down there  we came up with a plan .  the tunnel was getting unstable anyway  so they closed it off  we said it had collapsed  and by now the team will have brought the golems out under the sea and be bringing them underwater all the way into the city     said adora belle .   moist pointed at the golem   s arm in its bag .     that one isn   t gold     he said hopefully .      we found a lot of golem remains about halfway down     said adora belle with a sigh .     the others are deeper   er  perhaps because they are heavier .         gold   s twice the weight of lead     said moist gloomily .      the buried golem is singing in umnian  which is the most complex language ever     said adora belle .     i can   t be certain of our translation  so i thought  let   s start by getting them into ankh morpork  where they will be safe .      moist took a deep breath .     do you know how much trouble you can get into by breaking a contract with a dwarf .         oh  come on .  i   m not starting a war .         no  you   re starting a legal action .  and with the dwarfs that   s even worse .  you told me the contract said you couldn   t take precious metals out of the land .         yes  but these are golems .  they   re alive .         look  you   ve taken              may have taken              all right  may have taken  good grief  tons of gold out of dwarf land           golem trust land              all right  but there was a covenant .  which you broke when you took              didn   t take .  it walked off by itself     said adora belle calmly .      for heavens    sake  only a woman could think like this .  you think because you believe there   s a perfectly good justification for your actions the legal issues don   t matter .  and here am i  this close to persuading people here that a dollar doesn   t have to be round and shiny and i   m finding that at any minute four big shiny beaming golems are going to stroll into town  waving and glittering at everybody .         there   s no need to get hysterical     said adora belle .      yes  there is .  what there isn   t a need for is staying calm .         yes  but that   s when you come alive  right .  that   s when your brain works best .  you always find a way  right .      and there was nothing you could do about a woman like that .  she just turned herself into a hammer and you ran right into her .   fortunately .   they   d reached the entrance to the university .  above them loomed the forbidding statue of alberto malich  the founder .  it had a chamber pot on its head .  this had inconvenienced the pigeon which  by family tradition  spent most of its time perched on alberto   s head and now wore on its own head a miniature version of the same pottery receptacle .   must be rag week again  thought moist .  students  eh .  love    em or hate    em  you   re not allowed to hit    em with a shovel .      look  golems or not  let   s have dinner tonight  just you and me  up in the suite .  aimsbury would love it .  he doesn   t often get a chance to cook for humans and it   d make him feel better .  he   ll do anything you want  i   m sure .      adora belle gave him a lopsided look .     i thought you   d suggest that  so i ordered sheep   s head .  he was overjoyed .         sheep   s head     said moist gloomily     you know i hate food that stares back .  i won   t even look a sardine in the face .         he promised to blindfold it .         oh  good .         my granny made a wonderful sheep   s head mold     said adora belle .     that   s where you use pig   s trotters to thicken the broth so that when it gets cold you           you know  sometimes there   s such a thing as too much information .     said moist .     this evening  then .  now let   s go and see your dead wizard .  you should enjoy it .  there   s bound to be skulls .          there were skulls .  there were black drapes .  there were complex symbols drawn on the floor .  there were spirals of incense from black thuribles .  and in the middle of all this the head of postmortem communications  in a fearsome mask  was fiddling with a candle .   he stopped when he heard them come in  and straightened up hurriedly .      oh  you   re early     he said  his voice somewhat muffled by the fangs .     sorry .  it   s the candles .  they should be cheap tallow for the proper black smoke  but wouldn   t you know it  they   ve given me beeswax .  i told them just dribbling is no good to me  acrid smoke is what we want .  or what they want  anyway .  sorry  john hicks  head of department .  ponder has told me all about you .      he took off the mask and extended a hand .  the man looked as though he   d tried  like any self respecting necromancer  to grow a proper goatee beard  but owing to some basic lack of malevolence it had turned out a bit sheepish .  after a few seconds hicks realized why they were staring  and pulled off the fake rubber hand with the black fingernails .      i thought necromancy was banned     said moist .      oh  we don   t do necromancy here     said hicks .     what made you think that .      moist looked around at the furnishings  shrugged  and said     well  i suppose it first crossed my mind when i saw the way the paint was flaking off the door and you can still just see a crude skull and the letters necr           ancient history  ancient history     said hicks  quickly .     we are the department of postmortem communications  a force for good  you understand .  necromancy  on the other hand  is a very bad form of magic done by evil wizards .         and since you are not evil wizards  what you are doing can   t be called necromancy .         exactly .         and  er  what defines an evil wizard .     said adora belle .      well  doing necromancy would definitely be there right on top of the list .         could you just remind us what you are going to do .         we   re going to talk to the late professor flead     said hicks .      who is dead  yes .         very much so .  extremely dead .         isn   t that just a tiny bit like necromancy .         ah  but  you see  for necromancy you require skulls and bones and a general necropolitan feel     said dr .  hicks .  he looked at their expressions .     ah  i see where you   re going here     he said  with a little laugh that cracked a bit around the edges .     don   t be deceived by appearances .  i don   t need all this .  professor flead does .  he   s a bit of a traditionalist  and wouldn   t get out of his urn for anything less than the full rite of souls complete with the dread mask of summoning .     he twanged a fang .      and that   s the dread mask of summoning  is it .     said moist .  the wizard hesitated for a moment before saying     of course .         only it looks just like the dread sorcerer mask they sell in boffo   s shop in tenth egg street     said moist .     excellent value at five dollars  i thought .         i  er  think you must be mistaken     said hicks .      i don   t think so     said moist     you left the label on .         where .  where .     the i   m not a necromancer at all snatched up the mask and turned it over in his hands  looking for     he saw moist   s grin and rolled his eyes .      all right  yes     he muttered .     we lost the real one .  everything gets lost around here  you just wouldn   t believe it .  they   re not clearing up the spells properly .  was there a huge squid in the corridor .         not this afternoon     said adora belle .      yes  what   s the reason for the squid .         oooh  let me tell you about the squid .     said hicks .      yes .         you don   t want to know about the squid .         we don   t .         believe me .  are you sure it wasn   t there .         it   s the sort of thing you notice     said adora belle .      with any luck that one   s worn off  then     said hicks  relaxing .     it really is getting impossible .  last week everything in my filing cabinet filed itself under w .  no one seems to know why .         and you were going to tell us about the skulls     said adora belle .      all fake     said hicks .      excuse me .     the voice was dry and crackly and came from the shadows in the far corner .      apart from charlie  of course     hicks added hurriedly .     he   s been here for ever .         i   m the backbone of the department     said the voice  a shade proudly .      look  shall we get started .     said hicks  rummaging in a black velvet sack .     there are some hooded black robes on the hook behind the door .  they   re just for show  of course  but nec   postmortem communications is all about theater  really .  most of the people we   communicate with are wizards  and frankly  they don   t like change .         we   re not going to do anything   ghoulish  are we .     said adora belle  looking at a robe doubtfully .      apart from talk to someone who   s been dead for three hundred years     said moist .  he was not naturally at ease in the presence of skulls .  humans have been genetically programmed not to be  ever since monkey times  because  a  whatever turned that skull into a skull might still be around and you should head for a tree now  and  b  skulls look like they   re having a laugh at one   s expense .      don   t worry about that     said hicks  taking a small ornamental jar out of the black bag and polishing it on his sleeve .     professor flead willed his soul to the university .  he   s a bit crabby  i have to say  but he can be cooperative if we put on a decent show .     he stood back .     let   s see   grisly candles  circle of namareth  glass of silent time  the mask  of course  the curtains of  er  curtains  and     here he put a small box down beside the bottle     the vital ingredients .         sorry .  you mean all those expensive sounding other things aren   t vital .     said moist .      they   re more like   scenery     said hicks  adjusting the hood .     i mean  we could all sit around reading the script out loud  but without the costumes and scenery who   d want to turn up .  are you interested in the theater at all .     he added  in a hopeful voice .      i go when i can     said moist guardedly  because he recognized the hope in the man   s voice .      you didn   t by any chance see    tis pity she   s an instructor in unarmed combat at the little theater recently .  it was put on by the dolly sisters players .         uh  no  i   m afraid not .         i played sir andrew fartswell     said dr .  hicks  in case moist was due a sudden attack of recollection .      oh  that was you was it .     said moist  who   d met actors before .     everyone at work was talking about it .      i   m okay so long as he doesn   t ask which night they talked about  he thought .  there   s always one night in every play when something hilariously dreadful happens .  but he was lucky  an experienced actor knows when not to push his luck .   instead  hicks said     do you know ancient languages .         i can do basic droning     said moist .      i can speak formal golem .  is this ancient enough for you .     said adora belle  and made moist   s spine tingle .  the private language of the golems was usually hell on the human tongue  but it sounded unbearably sexy when adora belle uttered it .  it was like silver in the air .      what was that .     said hicks .      the common language of golems for the last twenty thousand years     said adora belle .      really .  most  er  moving   er   we   ll begin            in the counting house no one dared to look up as the desk of the chief cashier rumbled around on its turntable like some ancient tumbrel .  papers flew under mavolio bent   s hands while his brain drowned in poisons and his feet treadled continually to release the dark energies choking his soul .   he didn   t calculate  not as other men saw it .  calculation was for people who couldn   t see the answer turning gently in their head .  to see was to know .  it always had been .   the mound of accumulated paperwork dwindled as the fury of his thinking wracked him .   there were new accounts being opened all the time .  and why .  was it because of trust .  probity .  an urge toward thrift .  was it because of anything that could be called worth .   no .  it was because of lipwig .  people whom mr .  bent had never seen before and hoped never to see again were pouring into the bank  their money in boxes  their money in piggy banks  and quite often their money in socks .  sometimes they were actually wearing the socks .   and they were doing this because of words .  the bank   s coffers were filling up because the wretched mr .  lipwig made people laugh and made people hope .  people liked him .  no one had ever liked mr .  bent  as far as he was aware .  oh  there had been a mother   s love and a father   s arms  the one chilly  the other too late  but where had they got him .  in the end he   d been left alone .  so he   d run away and found the gray caravan and entered a new life based on numbers and on worth and solid respect  and he had worked his way up and yes  he was a man of worth and yes  he had respect .  yes  respect .  even mr .  cosmo respected him .   and now here was lipwig  and who was he .  no one seemed to know  except for the suspicious man with the unstable teeth .  one day there was no lipwig  next day he was the postmaster general .  and now he was in the bank  a man whose worth was in his mouth and who showed no respect for anyone .  and he made people laugh   and the bank filled up with money .   and did the lavishes lavish anything on you .  said a familiar little voice in his head .  it was a hated little part of himself that he had beaten and starved and punched back into its wardrobe for years .  it wasn   t the voice of his conscience .  he was the voice of his conscience .  it was the voice of the   the mask .      no .     snapped bent .  some of the nearest clerks looked up at the unaccustomed noise and then hurriedly lowered their heads for fear of catching his eye .  bent stared fixedly at the sheet in front of him  watching the numbers roll past .  rely on the numbers .  they didn   t let you down     cosmo doesn   t respect you  you fool  you fool .  you have run their bank for them and cleaned up after them .  you made  they spent   and they laugh at you .  you know they do .  silly mr .  bent with his funny walk  silly  silly  silly        get away from me  get away     he whispered .   the people like him because he likes them .  no one likes mr .  bent .      but i have worth .  i have value .     mr .  bent pulled another worksheet toward himself and sought solace in its columns .  but he was pursued     where was your worth and value when you made the numbers dance  mr .  bent .  the innocent numbers .  you made them dance and somersault and cartwheel when you cracked your whip  and they danced into the wrong places  didn   t they  because sir joshua demanded his price .  where did the gold dance off to  mr .  bent .  smoke and mirrors .      no .      in the counting house all the pens ceased moving for a few seconds  before scribbling again with frantic activity .   eyes watering with shame and rage  mr .  bent tried to unscrew the top from his patent fountain pen .  in the muted silence of the banking hall  the sound of the green pen being deployed had the same effect as the sound of the axman sharpening his blade .  every clerk bent low to his desk .  mr .  bent had found a mistake .  all anyone could do was keep their eyes on the paper in front of them and hope against hope that it was not theirs .   someone  and please gods it would not be them  would have to go and stand in front of the high desk .  they knew that mr .  bent did not like mistakes  mr .  bent believed that mistakes were the result of a deformity of the soul .   at the sound of the pen of doom  one of the senior clerks hurried to mr .  bent   s side .  those workers who risked being turned to water by the ferocity of mr .  bent   s stare essayed a quick glance and saw her being shown the offending document .  there was a distant tut tut sound .  her tread as she came down the steps and crossed the floor echoed in deadly  praying silence .  she did not know  as she scurried  button boots flashing  to the desk of one of the youngest and newest clerks  that she was about to meet a young man who was destined to go down in history as one of the great heroes of banking .       the dark organ music filled the department of postmortem communications .  moist assumed it was all part of the ambience  although the mood would have been more precisely obtained if the tune it was playing did not appear to be    cantata and fugue for someone who has trouble with the pedals .      as the last note died  after a long illness  dr .  hicks spun around on the stool and raised the mask .      sorry about that  i have two left feet sometimes .  could you both just chant a bit while i do the mystic waving  please .  don   t worry about words .  anything seems to work if it sounds sepulchral enough .      as he walked around the circle  chanting variants on oo .  and raah .   moist wondered how many bankers raised the dead during the course of an afternoon .  probably not a high number .  he shouldn   t be doing this  surely .  he should be out there making money .  owls   clamp must have finished the design by now .  he could be holding his first note in his hands by tomorrow .  and then there was damn cribbins  who could be talking to anyone .  true  the man had a rap sheet as long as a roller towel  but the city worked by alliances and if he met up with the lavishes then moist   s life would unravel all the way back to the gallows        in my day we at least hired a decent mask     growled an elderly voice .     i say  is that a woman over there .      a figure had appeared in the circle  without any bother or fuss  apart from the grumbling .  it was in every respect the picture of a wizard   robed  pointy hatted  bearded  and elderly  with the addition of a silvery monochrome effect overall and some slight transparency .      ah  professor flead     said hicks     it   s kind of you to join us           you know you brought me here and it   s not as if i had anything else to do     said flead .  he turned back to adora belle and his voice became pure syrup .     what is your name  my dear .         adora belle dearheart .      the warning tone of voice was lost on flead .      how delightful     he said  giving her a gummy smile .  regrettably  this made little strings of saliva vibrate in his mouth like the web of a very old spider .     and would you believe me if i told you that you bear a striking resemblance to my beloved concubine fenti  who died more than three hundred years ago .  the likeness is astounding .         i   d say that was a pickup line     said adora belle .      oh dear  such cynicism     sighed the late flead  turning to the head of postmortem communications .      apart from this young lady   s wonderful chanting  it was frankly a mess  hicks     he said sharply .  he tried to pat adora belle   s hand  but his fingers passed right through .      i   m sorry  professor  we just don   t get the funding these days     said hicks .      i know  i know .  it was ever thus  doctor .  even in my day  if you needed a corpse you had to go out and find your own .  and if you couldn   t find one  you jolly well had to make one .  it   s all so nice now  so damn correct .  so a fresh egg technically does the trick  but whatever happened to style .  they tell me they   ve made an engine that can think now  but of course the fine arts are always last in the queue .  and so i   m brought to this  one barely competent postmortem communicator and two people from central groaning .         necromancy is a fine art .     said moist .      none finer  young man .  get things just a tiny bit wrong and the spirits of the vengeful dead may enter your head via your ears and blow your brains out down your nose .      the eyes of moist and adora belle focused on dr .  hicks like those of an archer on his target .  he waved his hands frantically and mouthed    not very often .         what is a pretty young woman like you doing here  hmm .     said flead  trying to grab adora belle   s hand again .      i   m trying to translate a phrase from umnian     she said  giving him a wooden smile and absentmindedly wiping her hand on her dress .      are women allowed to do that sort of thing these days .  what fun .  one of my greatest regrets  you know  is that when i was in possession of a body i didn   t let it spend enough time in the company of young ladies        moist looked around to see if there was any kind of emergency lever .  there had to be something  if only in the event of nasal brain explosion .   he sidled up to hicks .      it   s going to go really bad in a moment .     he hissed .      it   s all right  i can banish him to the undead zone in a moment     hicks whispered .      that won   t be far enough if she loses her temper .  i once saw her put a stiletto heel right through a man   s foot while she was smoking a cigarette .  she hasn   t had a cigarette for more than fifteen minutes  so there   s no telling what she   ll do .      but adora belle had pulled the golem   s arm out of her bag  and the late professor flead   s eyes twinkled with something more compelling than romance .  lust comes in many varieties .   he picked up the arm .  that was the second surprising thing .  and then moist realized that the arm was still there  by flead   s feet  and what he was lifting was a pearly  tenuous ghost .      ah  part of an umnian golem     he said .     bad condition .  immensely rare .  probably dug up on the site of um  yes .         possibly     said adora belle .      hmm .  possibly  eh .     said flead  turning the spectral arm around .     look at the wafer thinness .  light as a feather but strong as steel while the fires burned within .  there has been nothing like them since .         i might know where such fires still burn     said adora belle .      after sixty thousand years .  i think not  madam .         i think otherwise .      she could say things in that tone of voice and turn heads .  she projected absolute certainty .  moist had worked hard for years to get a voice like that .      are you saying an umnian golem has survived .         yes .  four of them  i think     said adora belle .      can they sing .         at least one can .         i   d give anything to see one before i die     said flead .      er       moist began .      figure of speech  figure of speech     said flead  waving a hand irritably .      i think that could be arranged     said adora belle .     in the meantime  we   ve transcribed their song into boddely   s phonetic runes .     she dipped into her bag and produced a small scroll .  flead reached out  and once again an iridescent ghost of the scroll was now in his hands .      it appears to be gibberish     he said  glancing at it     although i have to say that umnian always does at first glance .  i shall need some time to work it out .  umnian is entirely a contextual language .  have you seen these golems .         no  our tunnel collapsed .  we can   t even talk to the golems who were digging anymore .  song doesn   t travel well under salt water .  but we think they are   unusual golems .         golden  probably     said flead  the words leaving a thoughtful silence in their wake .   then adora belle said     oh .     moist shut his eyes  on the inside of the lids  the gold reserves of ankh morpork walked up and down  gleaming .      anyone who researches um finds the golden golem legend     said flead .     sixty thousand years ago some witch doctor sitting by a fire made a clay figure and worked out how to make it live and that was the only invention they ever needed  do you understand .  even had horse golems  did you know that .  no one has ever been able to create one since .  yet the umnians never worked iron .  they never invented the spade or the wheel .  golems herded their animals and spun their cloth .  the umnians did make their own jewelry  though  which largely consisted of scenes of human sacrifice  badly executed in every sense of the word .  they were incredibly inventive in that area .  a theocracy  of course     he added  with a shrug .     i don   t know what it is about stepped pyramids that brings out the worst in a god   anyway  yes  they did work gold .  they dressed their priests in it .  quite possibly they made a few golems out of it .  or  equally  the    golden golems    was a metaphor referring to the value of golems to the umnians .  when people wish to express the concept of worth  gold is always the word of choice           isn   t it just     murmured moist .         or it is simply a legend without foundation .  exploration of the site has never found anything except a few fragments of broken golems     said flead  sitting back and making himself comfortable on empty air .   he winked at adora belle .     perhaps you looked elsewhere .  one story tells us that upon the death of all the humans  the golems walked into the sea    .     the question mark hung in the air like the hook it was .      what an interesting story     said adora belle  poker faced .   flead smiled .     i will find the sense of this message .  of course you will come and see me again tomorrow .   moist didn   t like the sound of that  whatever it was .  it didn   t help that adora belle was smiling .   flead added      have you  sir .     said adora belle  laughing .      no  but i have an excellent memory .      moist frowned .  he liked it better when she was giving the old devil the cold shoulder .      can we go now .     he said .       probationary trainee junior clerk hammersmith coot watched miss drapes looming ever closer  with slightly less apprehension than his older colleagues did  and they knew this was because the poor kid had not been there long enough to know the meaning of what was about to happen .   the senior clerk put the paper on his desk with some force .  the total had been ringed around in green ink which was still wet .     mr .  bent     she said  with a tincture of satisfaction     says you must do this again .  properly .      and because hammersmith was a well brought up young man and because this was only his first week in the bank  he said     yes  miss drapes     took the paper neatly  and set to work .   there were many different stories told about what happened next .  in years to come  clerks measured their banking experience in how close they were when the thing happened .  there were disagreements on what was actually said .  certainly there was no violence  no matter what some of the stories implied .  but it was a day that brought the world  or at least that part of it that included the counting house  to its knees .   everyone agreed that hammersmith spent some time working on the percentages .  they say he produced a notebook   a personal notebook  which was an offense in itself   and did some work in it .  then  after  some say fifteen minutes  some say nearly half an hour  he walked back to the desk of miss drapes  and declared     i   m sorry  miss drapes  but i can   t find where the mistake is .  i have checked my workings and believe my total is correct .      his voice was not loud  but the room went silent .  in fact  it was more than silent .  the sheer straining of hundreds of ears meant spiders spinning cobwebs near the ceiling wobbled in the aural suction .  he was sent back to his desk to    do it again and don   t waste people   s time     and after a further ten minutes  some say fifteen  miss drapes went to his desk and looked over his shoulder .   most people agree that after half a minute or so she picked up the paper  pulled a pencil from the tight bun on the back of her head  ordered the young man out of his seat  sat down  and spent some time staring at the numbers .  she got up .  she went to the desk of another senior clerk .  together they pored over the piece of paper .  a third clerk was summoned .  he copied out the offending columns  worked on them for a while  and looked up  his face gray .  no one needed to say it aloud .  by now all work had stopped but mr .  bent  up on the high stool  was still engrossed in the numbers before him and  significantly  he was muttering under his breath .   people sensed it in the air .   mr .  bent had made a mistake .   the most senior clerks conferred hastily in a corner .  there was no higher authority that they could appeal to .  mr .  bent was the higher authority  second only to the inexorable lord of mathematics .  in the end it was left to the luckless miss drapes  who so recently had been the agent of mr .  bent   s displeasure  to write on the document     i am sorry  mr .  bent  i believe the young man is right .     she slipped this at the bottom of a number of working sheets that she was delivering to the in tray  dropped it in as the tray rumbled past  and then the sound of her little boots echoed as she rushed  weeping  the length of the hall to the ladies    restroom  where she had hysterics .   the remaining members of the staff looked around warily  like ancient monsters who can see a second sun getting bigger in the sky but have absolutely no idea what they should do about it .  mr .  bent was a fast man with an in tray and by the look of it there were about two minutes or less before he was confronted with the message .  suddenly and all at once  they fled for the exits .          and how was that for you .     said moist  stepping out into the sunlight .      do i detect a note of peevishness .     said adora belle .      well  my plans for today did not include dropping in to chat with a three hundred year old letch .         i think you mean lych  and anyway he was a ghost  not a corpse .         he was letching .         all in his mind     said adora belle .     your mind  too .         normally you go crazy if people try to patronize you .         true .  but most people aren   t able to translate a language so old that even golems can hardly understand a tenth of it .  get a talent like that and it could be you getting the girls when you are three centuries dead .         you were just flirting to get what you wanted .      adora belle stopped dead in the middle of the square to confront him .     and .  you flirt with people all the time .  you flirt with the whole world .  that   s what makes you interesting  because you   re more like a musician than a thief .  you want to play the world  especially the fiddly bits .  and now i   m going home for a bath .  i got off the coach this morning  remember .         this morning     said moist     i found that one of my staff had swapped the mind of another of my staff with that of a turnip .         was that good .     said adora belle .      i   m not sure .  in fact i   d better go and check .  look  we   ve both had a busy day .  i   ll send a cab at half past seven  all right .          cribbins was enjoying himself .  he   d never been much for reading  up until now .  oh  he could read  and write too  in a nice cursive script that people thought was quite distinguished .  and he   d always liked the times for its clear  readable font  and had  with the aid of some scissors and a pot of paste  often accepted its assistance in producing those missives that attract attention not by fine writing but by having the messages created in cut out words and letters and even whole phrases  if you were lucky .  reading for pleasure had passed him by  however .  but he was reading now  oh yes  and it was extremely pleasurable  goodness yes .  it was amazing what you could find if you knew what you were looking for .  and now  all his hogswatches were about to come at once        a cup of tea  reverend .     said a voice by his side .  it was the plump lady in charge of the times    back issues department  who had taken to him as soon as he doffed his hat to her .  she had the slightly wistful  slightly hungry look that so many women of a certain age wore when they   d decided to trust in gods because of the absolute impossibility of continuing to trust in men .      why  thank you  shister     he said  beaming .     and is it not written     the eleemosynary cup is more worthy than the thrown hen    .      then he noticed the discreet little silver ladle pinned to her bosom  and that her earrings were two tiny spatulas .  the holy symbols of anoia  yes .  he   d just been reading about anoia in the religious pages .  all the rage these days  thanks to the help of young spangler .  started out way down the ladder as the goddess of things that get stuck in drawers  but the talk in the religious pages was that she was being tipped for goddess of lost causes  a very profitable area  very profitable indeed for a man with a flexible approach but  and he sighed inwardly  it was not such a good idea to do business when the god in question was active  in case anoia got angry and found a new use for a spatula .  besides  he   d soon be able to put all that behind him .  what a clever lad young spangler had turned out to be .  smarmy little devil .  this wasn   t going to be over quick  oh no .  this was going to be a pension for life .  and it   d be a long  long life  or else        is there anything more i can get you  reverend .     said the woman anxiously .      my cup runneth over  shister     said cribbins .   the woman   s anxious expression intensified .     oh  i   m sorry  i hope it hasn   t gone on the        cribbins carefully put his hand over the cup .     i meant that i am more than shatisfied     he said  and he was .  it was a bloody miracle  that   s what it was .  if om was going to hand them out like this  he might even start believing in him .   and it got better the more you thought about it  cribbins told himself  as the woman hurried away .  how   d the kid done it .  there must have been cronies .  the hangman  for one  a couple of jailers     reflectively  he removed his false teeth with a twang  swilled them gently in the tea  patted them dry with his handkerchief and wrestled them back into his mouth a few seconds before footsteps told him the woman was returning .  she was positively vibrating with genteel courage .      excuse me  reverend  but can i ask a favor .     she said  going pink .      og orsk   ugger .  usht arg ogent       cribbins turned his back  and against a chorus of snaps and twoings dragged the wretched dentures around the right way .  damned things .  why he had ever bothered to lever them out of the old man   s mouth  he   d never know .      i do beg your pardon  shister  a little dental mishap there       he murmured  turning back and dabbing at his mouth .     pray continue .         it   s funny you should say that  reverend     said the woman  her eyes bright with nervousness     because i belong to a small group of ladies who run  well  a god of the month club .  er   that is  we pick a god and believe in him   or her  obviously  or it  although we draw the line at the ones with teeth and too many legs  er  and foreign ones  of course  and then we pray to them for a month and then we sit down and discuss it .  well  there   s so many  aren   t there .  thousands .  we   ve never really considered om  though  but if you would care to give us a little talk next tuesday i   m sure we   ll be happy to give him a jolly good try .      springs pinged as cribbins gave her a huge smile .      what is your name  shister .     he asked .      berenice     she said .     berenice  er  houser .      ah  no longer using the bastard   s name  very wise  thought cribbins .     what a wonderful idea  berenish     he said .     i would consider it a pleshure .      she beamed .      there wouldn   t be any biscuits  would there  berenish .     cribbins added .   ms .  houser blushed .     i believe i have some chocolate ones somewhere     she volunteered  as if letting him in on a big secret .      may anoia rattle your drawers  shister     said cribbins to her retreating back .   wonderful  he thought  as she bustled off  blushing and happy .  he tucked his notebook into his jacket and sat back and listened to the ticking of the clock on the wall and the gentle snores of the beggars  who were the normal habitu  s of this office on a hot afternoon .  all was peaceful  settled  organized  just like life ought to be .   it was going to be the gravy boat for him from this day forward .   if he was very  very careful .       moist ran down the lengths of the vaults toward the brilliant light at the far end .  there was a tableau of peacefulness .  hubert was standing in front of the glooper  occasionally tapping a pipe .  igor was blowing some curious glass creation over his little forge  and mr .  clamp  formerly known as owlswick jenkins  was sitting at his desk with a faraway look on his face .   moist sensed the doom ahead .  something was wrong .  it might not be even a particular thing  it was just a sheer platonic wrongness   and he did not like mr .  clamp   s expression at all .   nevertheless  the human brain  which survives by hoping from one second to another  will always endeavor to put off the moment of truth .  moist approached the desk  rubbing his hands together .     how   s it going then  owl   i mean mr .  clamp     he said .     finished it yet  have we .         oh  yes     said clamp  a strange  mirthless little smile on his face .     here it is .      on the desk in front of him was the other side of the first proper dollar bill ever to be designed .  moist had seen pictures quite like it  but they had been when he was four years old  in nursery school .  the face of what was presumably meant to be lord vetinari had two dots for eyes and a broad grin .  the panorama of the vibrant city of ankh morpork appeared to consist of a lot of square houses  with a window  all square  in each corner and a door in the middle .      i think it   s one of the best things i have ever done     said clamp .   moist patted him convivially on the shoulder and then marched toward igor  who was already looking defensive .      what have you done to that man .     said moist .      i have made him a well balanthed perthonality  no longer bethet with anxthietieth  fearth  and the demonth of paranoia     said igor .   moist glanced at igor   s workbench  a brave thing to do by any standards .  on it was a jar with something indistinct floating in it .  moist looked closer  another minor act of heroism when you were in an igor rich environment .   it was not a happy turnip .  it was blotchy .  it was bouncing gently from one side of the jar to another  occasionally turning over .     i see     said moist .     but it would appear  regrettably  that by giving our friend the relaxed and hopeful attitude toward life of  not to put too fine a point on it  a turnip  you have also given him the artistic abilities of  and i have no hesitation in using the term again  a turnip .         but he ith much happier in himthelf     said igor .      granted  but how much of himself is  and i really don   t wish to keep repeating myself here  of a root vegetable like nature .      igor considered this for some time .     ath a medical man  thir     he said     i mutht conthider what ith betht for the pathient .  at the moment he ith happy and content and hath no careth in the world .  why would he give up all thith for a mere fathility with a penthil .      moist was aware of an insistent bonk bonk .  it was the turnip banging itself against the side of the jar .     that is an interesting and philosophical point     he said  once again looking at clamp   s happy yet somewhat unfocused expression .     but it seems to me that all those nasty little details were what made him  well  him .     the frantic banging of the vegetable grew louder .  igor and moist stared from the jar to the eerily smiling man .      igor  i   m not sure you know what makes people tick .      igor gave an avuncular little chuckle .     oh  believe me  thur           igor .     said moist .      yeth  marthter     said igor gloomily .      go and fetch the damn wires again  will you .         yeth  marthter .          moist got back upstairs again to find himself in the middle of a panic .  a tearful miss drapes spotted him and click clicked over  at speed .      it   s mr .  bent  sir .  he just rushed out  yelling .  we can   t find him anywhere .         why are you looking .     said moist  and then realized he   d said it aloud .     i meant  what is the reason for you looking .      the story unfolded .  as miss drapes talked  moist got the impression that all the other listeners were getting the point and he wasn   t .      so  okay  he made a mistake     he said .     no harm done  is there .  it   s all been sorted out  right .  a bit embarrassing  i dare say       but  he reminded himself  an error is worse than a sin  isn   t it .   but that   s plain daft  his sensible self pointed out .  he could have said something like     you see .  even i can make a mistake through a moment   s inattention .  we must be forever vigilant .     or he could have said     i did this on purpose to test you .     even schoolteachers know that one .  i can think of half a dozen ways to wriggle out of something like that .  but then i   m a wriggler .  i don   t think he   s ever wriggled in his life .      i hope he hasn   t done something   silly     said miss drapes  fishing a crumpled handkerchief out of a sleeve .   something   silly  thought moist .  that   s the phrase people used when they were thinking about someone jumping into the river or taking the entire contents of the medicine box in one go .  silly things like that .      i   ve never met a less silly man     he said .      well  er   we   ve always wondered about him  to be honest     said a clerk .     i mean  he   s in at dawn and one of the cleaners told me he   s often in here late at night   what .  what .  that hurt .      miss drapes  who had nudged him hard  now whispered urgently in his ear .  the man deflated and looked awkwardly at moist .      sorry  sir  i spoke out of turn     he mumbled .      mr .  bent is a good man  mr .  lipwig     said miss drapes .     he drives himself hard .         drives all of you hard  it seems to me     said moist .   this attempt at solidarity with the laboring masses didn   t seem to hit the mark .      if you can   t stand the heat  get off the pot  that   s what i say     said a senior clerk  and there was a general murmur of agreement .      er  i think you get out of the kitchen     said moist .        get off the pot    is the alternative when           half the chief cashiers in the plains have worked in this room     said miss drapes .     and quite a few managers  now .  and miss lee  who   s deputy manager of apsly   s commercial bank in sto lat  she got the job because of the letter mr .  bent wrote .  bent trained  you see .  that counts for a lot .  if you   ve got a reference from mr .  bent  you can walk into any bank and get a job with a snap of your fingers .         and if you stay  the pay here is better than anywhere     a clerk put in .     he told the board  if they want the best  they   d have to pay for it .         oh  he   s demanding     said another clerk     but i hear they   re all working for a human resources manager at pipeworth   s bank now  and if it comes to that i   ll take mr .  bent any day of the week .  at least he thinks i   m a person .  i was hearing where she was timing how long people spent in the privy .         they call it time and motion study     said moist .     look  i expect mr .  bent just wants to be alone for a while .  who was he yelling at  the lad who   d made a mistake .    or didn   t make it  i mean .         that was young hammersmith     said miss drapes .     we sent him home because he was in a bit of a state .  and no  he wasn   t really shouting at him .  he wasn   t really shouting at anybody .  he was       she paused  searching for a word .      gibbering     said the clerk who had spoken out of turn  giving the turn another twist     and you don   t all have to look at me like that .  you all heard him .  and he looked as though he   d seen a ghost .      clerks were wandering back into the counting house in ones and twos .  they   d searched everywhere  was the general agreement  and there was strong support for the theory that he   d gone out through the mint  it being rather busy in there with all the work still going on .  moist doubted it .  the bank was old  and old buildings have all sorts of crannies  and mr .  bent had been here for        how long has he been here .     he wondered aloud .   the general consensus was    since the mind of man can remember    but miss drapes  who seemed for some reason to have made herself well informed on the subject of mavolio bent  volunteered that it was thirty nine years and he got a job when he was thirteen by sitting on the steps all night until the chairman came to work and impressing him with his command of numbers .  he went from messenger boy to chief cashier in twenty years .      speedy .     said moist .      never had a day off for illness  either     miss drapes concluded .      well .  perhaps he   s entitled to some now     said moist .     do you know where he lives  miss drapes .         mrs .  cake   s boardinghouse .         really .  that   s a bit       moist stopped and chose from a number of options       low rent  isn   t it .         he says that as a bachelor it meets his needs     said miss drapes  and avoided moist   s gaze .   moist could feel the day slipping away from him .  but they were all staring at him .  there was only one thing he could say if he was to maintain his image .      then i think i ought to see if he   s gone there     said moist .  their faces broke into smiles of relief .  he added     but i think that one of you should come with me .  after all  you know him .     it looks as though i don   t  he thought .      i   ll fetch my coat     said miss drapes .  the only reason that her words came out at the speed of sound was that she couldn   t make them go any faster .       chapter       as below  so above no pain without gain a mind for puzzles mr .  bent   s sad past something in the wardrobe wonderful money thoughts on madness  by igor a pot thickens      hubert tapped thoughtfully on one of the glooper   s tubes .      igor .     he said .      yeth  marthter .     said igor  behind him .   hubert jumped .      i thought you were over by your lightning cells .     he managed .      i wath  thur  but i am here now .   what wath it you wanted .         you   ve wired up all the valves  igor .  i can   t make any changes .         yeth  thur     said igor calmly .     there would be amathingly dire conthequentheth  thur .         but i want to change some parameters  igor     said hubert  absentmindedly taking a rain hat off the peg .      i am afraid there ith a problem  thur .  you athked me to make the glooper ath accurate ath poththible .         well  of course .  accuracy is vital .         it ith   extremely accurate  thur     said igor  looking uncomfortable .     poththibly too accurate  thur .      this    poththibly    caused hubert to grope for an umbrella .      how can anything be too accurate .      igor looked around .  suddenly  he was on edge .     would you mind if i wind down on the lisp a little  sir .         can you do that .         oh yeth   or  indeed  yes  sir .  but it   s a clan thing  you see .  it   s expected  like the stitcheth .  but i think you will find the explanation hard enough to understand as it is .         well  er  thank you .  go ahead  please .      it was quite a long explanation .  hubert listened with care  his mouth open .  the term    cargo cult    whirled past  and was followed by a short dissertation on the hypothesis that all water  everywhere  knows where all the other water is  some interesting facts about hyphenated silicon and what happens to it in the presence of cheese  the benefits and hazards of morphic resonation in areas of high background magic  the truth about identical twins  and the fact that if the fundamental occult maxim    as above  so below    was true  then so was    as below  so above        the silence that followed was broken only by the tinkle of water in the glooper  and the sound of the former owlswick   s pencil as he worked away with demon haunted skill .      do you mind going back to lisping  please .     said hubert .     i don   t know why  it just sounds better that way .         very good  thur .         all right .  now  are you really saying that i can now change the economic life of the city by adjusting the glooper .  it   s like a witch   s wax doll and i   ve got all the pins .         that ith correct  thur .  a very nice analogy .      hubert stared at the crystal masterpiece .  the light in the undercroft was changing all the time as the economic life of the city pumped itself around the tubes  some of them no thicker than a hair .      it   s an economic model  in fact  which is the real thing .         they are identical  thur .         so with one hammer blow i could throw the city into an irrevocable economic crash .         yeth  thur .  do you want me to fetch a hammer .      hubert stared up at the rushing  trickling  foaming thing that was the glooper and his eyes bulged .  he started to giggle but it grew very quickly into a laugh .      hahah .  ahahahah .  .  .  ahahahaha .  .  .  .    can you get me a glass of water  please .    hahahaha .  .  .  hahahahahah .  .    haha haha .  .  .         the laughter stopped abruptly .      that can   t be right  igor .         really  thur .         yes indeed .  look at our old friend flask    a .  can you see it .  it   s empty .         indeed  thur .         indeed indeed     said hubert .     flask    a represents the gold in our very own vaults  igor .  and ten tons of gold just don   t get up and walk away .  eh .  hahahaha .  .  .  could you get me that glass of water i asked for .  hahahah ahah .  .    haha haha .  .  .             a smile played around cosmo   s lips  which was a dangerous playground for anything as innocent as a smile .      all of them .     he said .      well  all the counting house clerks     said heretofore .     they just ran out into the street .  some of them were in tears .         a panic  in fact     murmured cosmo .  he looked at the picture of vetinari opposite his desk and was sure it winked at him .      apparently it was some problem with the chief cashier  sir .         mr .  bent .         apparently he made a mistake  sir .  they said he was muttering to himself and then just ran out of the room .  they said that some of the staff had gone back in to search for him .         mavolio bent made a mistake .  i think not     said cosmo .      they say he ran off  sir .      cosmo very nearly raised an eyebrow without mechanical aid .  it was that close .      ran off .  was he carrying any large and heavy bags .  they usually do .         i believe he wasn   t  sir     said heretofore .      that would have been   helpful .      cosmo leaned back in his chair  pulled off the black glove for the third time today  and held out his hand at arm   s length .  the ring did look impressive  especially against the pale blue of his finger .      have you ever seen a run on a bank  drumknott .     he said .     have you ever seen the crowds fighting for their money .         no  sir     said heretofore  who was beginning to worry again .  the tight boots had been  well  funny  but surely a finger shouldn   t look that color .      it   s a dreadful sight .  it   s like watching a beached whale being eaten alive by crabs     said cosmo  turning his hand so that the light showed up the shadowy v .     it may squirm in its agony  but there can be only one outcome .  it is a terrible thing  if done properly .      this is how vetinari thinks  his soul exulted .  plans can break down .  you cannot plan the future .  only presumptuous fools plan .  the wise man steers .      as a director of the bank and  of course  a concerned citizen     he said dreamily     i shall now write a letter to the times .         yes  sir  of course     said heretofore     and shall i send for a jeweler  sir .  i understand they have some fine little snips that           no pain without gain  drumknott .  it sharpens my thinking .     the glove went back on .      er       and then heretofore gave up .  he   d tried his best  but cosmo was bent on his own destruction  and all a sensible man could do was to make as much money as possible and then stay alive to spend it .      i   ve had another stroke of luck  sir     he ventured .  he   d have liked more time  but it was clear that time was getting short .      indeed .  what is this .         that project i have been working on           very expensively .  yes .         i believe i can get you vetinari   s stick  sir .         you mean his sword stick .         yes  sir .  as far as i know  the blade has never been drawn in anger .         i understood it was always close to him .         i didn   t say it would be easy  sir .  or cheap .  but after much  much work i now see a clear way     said heretofore .      they say the steel of the blade was taken from the iron in the blood of a thousand men           so i have heard  sir .         have you seen it .         very briefly  sir .      for the first time in his career  heretofore found himself feeling sorry for cosmo .  there was a kind of yearning in the man   s voice .  he didn   t want to usurp vetinari .  there were plenty of people in the city who wanted to usurp vetinari .  but cosmo wanted to be vetinari .      what was it like .     the voice was pleading .  poison from the sickening finger must have got to his brain  thought heretofore .  but his mind is pretty poisonous to begin with .  perhaps they will be friends .      er   well  the handle and scabbard are just like yours  sir  but a little worn .  the blade  though  is gray and looks           gray .         yes  sir .  it looks aged and slightly pitted .  but here and there  when the light catches it  there are little red and gold flecks .  i have to say that it looks ominous .         the flecks of light would be the blood  of course     said cosmo thoughtfully     or  possibly  yes  very possibly the trapped souls of those who died to make the dreadful blade .         i had not thought of that  sir     said heretofore  who had spent two nights with a new blade  some hematite  a brass brush  and some chemicals to produce a weapon that looked as though it   d spring for your throat of its own accord .      you could get it tonight .         i think so  sir .  it will be dangerous  of course .         and require yet more expense  i imagine     said cosmo  with rather more insight than heretofore would have expected in his current state .      there are so many bribes  sir .  he will not be happy when he finds out  and i daren   t risk the time it would take to make an exact replacement .         yes .  i see .      cosmo pulled off the black glove again and looked at his hand .  there seemed to be some greenish tint to his finger now  and he wondered if there was some copper in the ring   s alloy .  but the pink  almost red streaks moving up his arm looked very healthy .      yes .  get the stick     he murmured  turning his hand to catch the light from the lamps .  odd  though  he couldn   t feel any heat on the finger  but that didn   t matter .   he could see the future so clearly .  the shoes  the cap  the ring  the stick   surely  as he filled the occult space occupied by vetinari  the wretched man would feel himself getting weaker and more confused  and he   d get things wrong and make mistakes      see to it  drumknott     he said .       lord havelock vetinari pinched the bridge of his nose .  it had been a long day and was clearly going to be a long evening .      i think i need a moment to relax .  let   s get it over with     he said .   drumknott walked over to the long table  which at this time of day held copies of several editions of the times  his lordship being keen on keeping track of what people thought was going on .   vetinari sighed .  people told him things all the time .  lots of people had been telling him things in the last hour .  they told him things for all sorts of reasons  to gain some credit  to gain some money  for a favor quid pro quo  out of malice  mischief  or  suspiciously  out of a professed regard for the public good .  what it amounted to was no information but a huge  argus eyed ball of little  wiggling factoids  out of which some information could  with care  be teased .   his secretary laid before him the paper  carefully folded to the correct page and place  which was occupied by a square filled with a lot of smaller squares  some of them containing numbers .      today   s    jikan no muda    sir     he said .  vetinari glanced at it for a few seconds  and then handed it back to him .   the patrician shut his eyes  drummed his fingers on the desktop for a moment .     hmm   nine six three one seven four       drumknott scribbled hastily as the numbers streamed  and vetinari eventually concluded        eight four seven three .  and i   m sure they used that one last month .  on a monday  i believe .         seventeen seconds  sir     said drumknott  his pencil still catching up .      well  it has been a tiring day     said vetinari .     and what is the point .  numbers are easy to outwit .  they can   t think back .  the people who devise the crosswords  now they are indeed devious .  who would know that    pysdxes    are ancient ephebian carved bone needle holders .         well  you  sir  of course     said drumknott  carefully stacking the files     and the curator of ephebian antiquities at the royal art museum     puzzler    of the times  and miss grace speaker  who runs the pet shop in pellicool steps .         we should keep an eye on that pet shop  drumknott .  a woman with a mind like that content to dispense dog food .  i think not .         indeed  sir .  i shall make a note .         i   m pleased to hear that your new boots have ceased squeaking  by the way .         thank you  sir .  they have broken in nicely .      vetinari stared pensively at the day   s files .      mr .  bent  mr .  bent  mr .  bent     he said .     the mysterious mr .  bent .  without him  the royal bank would be in far more trouble than it has been .  and now that it is without him  it will fall over .  it revolves around him .  it beats to his pulse .  old lavish was frightened of him  i   m sure .  he said he thought that bent was a       he paused .      sir .     said drumknott .      let us just accept the fact that he has  in every way  proved to be a model citizen     said vetinari .     the past is a dangerous country  is it not .         there is no file on him  sir .         he has never drawn attention to himself .  all i know for sure is that he arrived here as a child  on a cart owned by some traveling accountants               what  like tinkers and fortune tellers .     said moist  as the cab rocked its way through streets that grew narrower and darker .      i suppose you could say so     said miss drapes with a hint of disapproval .     they do big  you know  circuits all the way up to the mountains  doing the books for little businesses  helping people with their taxes  that sort of thing .     she cleared her throat .     whole families of them .  it must be a wonderful life .         every day a new ledger     said moist  nodding gravely     and by night they drink beer  and happy  laughing accountants dance the double entry polka to the sound of accordions           do they .     said miss drapes nervously .      i don   t know .  it would be nice to think so     said moist .     well  that explains something  at least .  he was obviously ambitious .  all he could hope for on the road was being allowed to steer the horse  i suppose .         he was thirteen     said miss drapes  and she blew her nose loudly .     it   s so sad .     she turned a tearful face toward moist .      there   s something dreadful in his past  mr .  lipstick .  they say one day some men came to the bank and asked           this is it  mrs .  cake   s     said the cabman  pulling up sharply     an    that   ll be eleven pence and don   t ask me to hang about    cos they   ll have the    orse up on bricks and its shoes off in a wink .      the door of the boardinghouse was opened by the hairiest woman moist had ever seen  but in the area of elm street you learned to discount this sort of thing .  mrs .  cake was famously accommodating to the city   s newly arrived undead  giving them a safe and understanding haven until they could get on their feet  however many they had .      mrs .  cake .     he said .      mother   s at church     said the woman .     she said to expect you  mr .  lipwig .         you have a mr .  bent staying here  i believe .         the banker .  room seven on the second floor .  but i don   t think he   s in .  he   s not in trouble  is he .      moist explained the situation  aware all the while of doors opening a fraction in the shadows beyond the woman .  the air was sharp with the smell of disinfectant  mrs .  cake believed that cleanliness was more to be trusted than godliness and  besides  without that sharp note of pine half the clientele would be driven mad by the smell of the other half .   and in the middle of all this was the silent  featureless room of mr .  bent  chief cashier .  the woman  who volunteered that her name was ludmilla  let them in  very reluctantly  with a master key .      he   s always been a good guest     she said .     never a moment   s trouble .      one glance took in everything  the narrow room  the narrow bed  the clothes hanging neatly around the walls  the tiny jug and basin set  the incongruously large wardrobe .  lives collect clutter  but mr .  bent   s did not .  unless  of course  it was all in the wardrobe .      most of your long term guests are unde              differently alive     said ludmilla sharply .      yes  of course  so i   m wondering why   mr .  bent would stay here .         mr .  lipwick  what are you suggesting .     said miss drapes .      you must admit it   s rather unexpected     said moist .  and  because she was already distraught enough  he didn   t add  i don   t have to suggest anything .  it suggests itself .  tall .  dark .  gets in before dawn  leaves after dark .  mr .  fusspot growls at him .  compulsive counter .  obsessive over detail .  gives you a gentle attack of the creeps which makes you feel mildly ashamed .  sleeps on a long  thin bed .  stays at mrs .  cake   s  where the vampires hang up .  it   s not very hard to connect the dots .      this isn   t about the man who was here the other night  is it .     said ludmilla .      what man would that be .         didn   t give a name .  just said he was a friend .  all in black  had a black cane with a silver skull on it .  nasty piece of work  mum said .  mind you     ludmilla added     she says that about nearly everyone .  he had a black coach .         not lord vetinari  surely .         oh  no  mum   s all for him  except she thinks he ought to hang more people .  no  this one was pretty stout  mum said .         oh  really .     said moist .     well  thank you  ma   am .  well perhaps we should be going .  by the way  do you by any chance have a key to that wardrobe .         no key .  he put a new lock on it years ago  but mum didn   t complain because he   s never any trouble .  it   s one of those magic ones they sell at the university     ludmilla went on  as moist examined the lock .  the trouble with the wretched magical ones was that just about anything could be a key  from a word to a touch .      it   s rather strange that he hangs all his clothes on the walls  isn   t it .     he said  straightening up .   ludmilla looked disapproving .     we don   t use the word strange in this household .         differently normal .     moist suggested .      that   ll do .     there was a warning glint in ludmilla   s eye .     who can say who is truly normal in this world .      well  being someone whose fingernails don   t visibly extend when they   re annoyed would be a definite candidate  thought moist .     well  we should get back to the bank     he said .     if mr .  bent turns up  do tell him that people are looking for him .         and care about him     said miss drapes quickly  and then put a hand over her mouth and blushed .   i just want to make money  thought moist  as he led the trembling miss drapes back to the area where cabs dared to go .  i thought life in banking was profitable boredom punctuated by big cigars .  instead  it has turned out differently normal .  the only really sane person in there is igor  and possibly the turnip .  and i   m not sure about the turnip .   he dropped the snuffling miss drapes off at her lodgings in welcome soap  with a promise to let her know when the errant mr .  bent broke cover  and took the cab onward to the bank .  the night guards had already arrived  but quite a few clerks were still hanging around  apparently unable to come to terms with the new reality .  mr .  bent had been a fixture  like the pillars .   cosmo had been round to see him .  it wouldn   t have been a social call .   what had it been .  a threat .  well  no one liked being beaten up .  but perhaps it was more sophisticated .  perhaps it was we   ll tell people you are a vampire .  to which a sensible person would reply  stick it where the sun shineth not .  that would have been a threat twenty years ago  but today .  there were plenty of vampires in the city  neurotic as hell  wearing the black ribbon to show they   d signed the pledge  and in general getting on with  for want of a better word  their lives .  mostly  people just accepted it .  day after day went past with no trouble  and so the situation became regarded as normal .  differently normal  but still normal .   okay  mr .  bent had kept quiet about his past  but that was hardly a pitchforking matter .  he   d been sitting in a bank for forty years doing sums  for heavens    sake .   but perhaps he didn   t see it that way .  you measured common sense with a ruler  other people measured it with a potato .   he didn   t hear gladys approach .  he just became aware that she was standing behind him .      i have been very worried about you  mr .  lipwig     she rumbled .      thank you  gladys     he said cautiously .      i will make you a sandwich .  you like my sandwiches .         that would be kind of you  gladys  but miss dearheart will be joining me shortly for dinner upstairs .      the glow in the golem   s eyes faded for a moment and then grew brighter .      miss dearheart .         yes  she was here this morning .         a lady .         she   s my fianc  e  gladys .  she will be here quite a lot  i expect .         fianc  e     said gladys .     ah  yes .  i am reading twenty tips to make your wedding go with a swing .      gladys   s eyes dimmed .  she turned around and plodded toward the stairs .   moist felt like a heel .  of course  he was a heel .  but that didn   t make feeling like one feel any better .  on the other hand  shedamn  he   it   gladys was the fault of misplaced female solidarity .  what could he hope to achieve against that .  adora belle would have to do something about it .   he was aware that one of the senior clerks was hovering politely .      yes .     he said .     can i help you .         what do you want us to do  sir .         what   s your name .         spittle  sir .  robert spittle .         why are you asking me  bob .         because the chairman goes woof  sir .  safes need locking up .  so does the ledger room .  mr .  bent had all the keys .  it   s robert  sir  if you don   t mind .         are there any spare keys .         there might be in the chairman   s office  sir     said spittle .      look   robert  i want you to go home and get a good night   s sleep  okay .  and i   ll find the keys and turn every lock i can find .  i   m sure mr .  bent will be with us tomorrow  but if he   s not  i   ll call a meeting of the senior clerks .  i mean  hah  you must know how it all works .         well  yes .  of course .  only   well   but       the clerk   s voice faded into silence .   but there   s no mr .  bent  thought moist .  and he delegated with the same ease that oysters tango .  what the hell are we going to do .      there   s people here .  so much for banker   s hours     said a voice from the doorway .     in trouble again i hear .      it was adora belle  and of course she meant    hello .  it   s good to see you .         you look stunning     said moist .      yes  i know     said adora belle .     what   s happening .  the cabbie told me all the staff had walked out of your bank .      later moist thought  that was when it all went wrong .  you have to leap on the stallion of rumor before he   s out of the yard  so that you might be able to pull on the reins .  you should have thought  what did it look like  with staff running out of the bank .  you should have run to the times office .  you should have got in the saddle and turned it right around  there and then .   but adora belle did look stunning .  besides  all that had happened was that a member of staff had a funny turn and left the building .  what could anyone make of that .   and the answer  of course  was  anything they wanted to .   he was aware of someone else behind him .      mr .  lipwig  thur .      moist turned .  it was even less fun looking at igor when you   d just been looking at adora belle .      igor  this is really not the time       moist began .      i know i   m not thupothed to come upthairth  thur  but mr .  clamp thayth he hath finithed hith drawing .  it ith very good .         what was all that about .     said adora belle .     i think i nearly got two of the words .         oh  there   s a man down in the forni   the cellar  who is designing a dollar note for me .  paper money  in fact .         really .  i   d love to see that .         you would .          it was truly wonderful .  moist looked at the back and the front of the dollar note designs .  under igor   s brilliant white lights they looked rich as plum pudding and more complicated than a dwarf contract .      we   re going to make so much money     he said aloud .     wonderful job  owls   mr .  clamp .         i   m going to hold on to the owlswick     said the artist nervously .     it   s the jenkins that matters  after all .         well  yes     said moist     there must be dozens of owlswicks around .     he looked at hubert  who was on a stepladder and peering hopelessly at the tubing .      how   s it going  hubert .     he said .     the money   s still rushing around okay  is it .         what .  oh  fine .  fine .  fine     said hubert  almost knocking over the ladder in his haste to get down .  he looked at adora belle with an expression of uncertain dread .      this is adora belle dearheart  hubert     said moist  in case the man was about to flee .     she is my fianc  e .  she   s a woman     he added  in view of the worried look .   adora belle held out her hand and said     hello  hubert .      hubert stared .      it   s okay to shake hands  hubert     said moist carefully .     hubert   s an economist .  that   s like an alchemist  but less messy .         so you know how the money moves around  do you  hubert .     said adora belle  shaking an unresisting hand .   at last the notion of speech dawned on hubert .      i welded one thousand and ninety seven joints     he said     and blew the law of diminishing returns .         i shouldn   t think anyone   s ever done that before     said adora belle .   hubert brightened up .  this was easy .      we are not doing anything wrong  you know .     he said .      i   m sure you aren   t     said adora belle  trying to pull her hand away .      it can keep track of every dollar in the city  you know .  the possibilities are endless .  but  but  but  um  of course we   re not upsetting things in any way .         i   m very glad to hear it  hubert     said adora belle  tugging harder .      of course we are having teething troubles .  but everything is being done with immense care .  nothing has been lost because we   ve left a valve open or anything like that .         how intriguing .     said adora belle  bracing her left hand on hubert   s shoulder and wrenching the other one free .      we have to go  hubert     said moist .     keep up the good work  though .  i   m very proud of you .         you are .     said hubert .     cosmo said i was insane  and wanted auntie to sell the glooper for scrap .         typical hidebound  old fashioned thinking     said moist .     this is the century of the anchovy .  the future belongs to men like you  who can tell us how everything works .         it does .     said hubert .      you mark my words     said moist  ushering adora belle firmly toward the distant exit .   when they were gone  hubert sniffed the palm of his hand and shivered .      they were nice people  weren   t they     he said .      yeth  marthter .      hubert looked up at the glittering  trickling pipes of the glooper  faithfully mirroring in its ebbing and flowing the tides of money around the city .   just one blow could rattle the world .  it was a terrible responsibility .   igor joined him .  they stood in a silence broken only by the sloshing of commerce .      what shall i do  igor .     said hubert .      in the old country we have a thaying     igor volunteered .      a what .         a thaying .  we thay     if you don   t want the monthter you don   t pull the lever .            you don   t think i   ve gone mad  do you  igor .         many great men have been conthidered mad  mr .  hubert .  even dr .  hanth forvord wath called mad .  but i put it to you  could a madman have created a revolutionary living brain extractor .             is hubert quite    normal .     said adora belle  as they climbed the marble staircase toward dinner .      by the standards of obsessive men who don   t get out into the sunlight .     said moist .     pretty normal  i   d say .         but he acted as if he   d never seen a woman before .         he   s just not used to things that don   t come with a manual     said moist .      hah     said adora belle     why is it only men that get like that .      earns a tiny wage working for golems  thought moist .  puts up with graffiti and smashed windows because of golems .  camps out in wilderness  argues with powerful men .  all for golems .  but he didn   t say anything  because he   d read the manual .   they had reached the managerial floor .  adora belle sniffed .     smell that .  isn   t that just wonderful .     she said .     wouldn   t it turn a rabbit into a carnivore .         sheep   s head     said moist gloomily .     only to make the broth     said adora belle .     all the soft wobbly bits get taken out first .  don   t worry .  you   ve just been put off by the old joke  that   s all .         what old joke .         oh  come on .  a boy goes into a butcher   s shop and says     mum says can we please have a sheep   s head and you   re to leave the eyes in    cos it   s got to see us through the week .     you don   t get it .  it   s using see in the sense of to last and also in the sense of  well  to see           i just think it   s a bit unfair to the sheep  that   s all .         interesting     said adora belle .     you eat nice  anonymous lumps of animals but think it   s unfair to eat the other bits .  you think the head goes off thinking     at least he didn   t eat me .     strictly speaking  the more we eat of an animal the happier its species should be  since we wouldn   t need to kill so many of them .      moist pushed open the double doors  and the air was full of wrongness again .   there was no mr .  fusspot .  normally he   d be waiting in his in tray  ready to greet moist with a big  slobbery welcome .  but the tray was empty .   the room seemed larger  too  and this was because it also contained no gladys .   there was a little blue collar on the floor .  the smell of cooking filled the air .   moist ran down the passage to the kitchen  where the golem was standing solemnly by the stove  watching the rattling lid of a very large pot .  grubby foam slid down and dripped onto the stove .   gladys turned when she saw moist .      i am cooking your dinner  mr .  lipwig .      the dark moppets of dread played their paranoid hopscotch across moist   s inner eyeballs .      could you just put the ladle down and step away from the pot  please .     said adora belle  suddenly beside him .      i am cooking mr .  lipwig   s dinner     said gladys  with a touch of defiance .  the scummy bubbles  it seemed to moist  were getting bigger .      yes  and it looks as if it   s nearly done     said adora belle .     so i would like to see it  gladys .      there was silence .      gladys .      in one movement the golem handed her the ladle and stood back  half a ton of living clay moving as lightly and silently as smoke .   cautiously  adora belle lifted the pot   s lid and plunged the ladle into the seething mass .   something scratched at moist   s boot .  he looked down into the worried goldfish eyes of mr .  fusspot .   then he looked back at what was rising out of the pot  and realized that it was at least thirty seconds since he   d last drawn a breath .   peggy came bustling in .     oh  there you are  you naughty boy .     she said  picking up the little dog .     would you believe it  he got all the way down to the cold room .     she looked around  brushing hair out of her eyes .     oh  gladys  i did tell you to move it onto the cool plate when it started to thicken .      moist looked at the rising ladle  and in the flood of relief various awkward observations scrambled to be heard .   i   ve been in this job less than a week .  the man i really depend on has run away screaming .  i   m going to be exposed as a criminal .  that   s a sheep   s head     and   thank you for the thought  aimsbury   it   s wearing sunglasses .       chapter       cribbins fights his teeth theological advice    that   s what i call entertainment    mr .  fusspot   s magic toy sir joshua   s books

added hopefully .   cribbins opened his eyes .  the warmth and the steady ticking of the clock had lulled him into a wonderful doze .   ms .  houser was standing there  not gloriously naked and pink as so recently featured in the reverie  but in a plain brown coat and an unsuitable hat with feathers in it .  suddenly awake  he fumbled urgently in his pocket for his dentures  not trusting them with the custody of his mouth while he slept .  he turned his head away in a flurry of unaccustomed embarrassment  as he fought to get them in  and then fought again to get them in and the right way up .  they always fought back .  in desperation he wrenched them out and banged them sharply on the arm of the chair once or twice to break their spirit before ramming them into his mouth once more .      wshg .     said cribbins  and slapped the side of his face .     why  thank you  ma   am     he said  dabbing at his mouth with his handkerchief .     i am sorry about that  but i   m a martyr to them  i shwear .         i didn   t like to disturb you     ms .  houser went on  her horrified expression fading .     i   m sure you needed your sleep .         not sleeping  ma   am but contemplating     said cribbins  standing up .     contemplating the fall of the unrighteous and the elevation of the godly .  is it not said that the last shall be first and the first shall be last .         you know  i   ve always been a bit worried about that     said ms .  houser .     i mean  what happens to the people who aren   t first but aren   t really last  either .  you know   jogging along  doing their best .     she strolled toward the door in a manner which  quite as subtly as she thought  invited him to accompany her .      a conundrum indeed  berenice     said cribbins  following her .     the holy texts don   t mention it  but i have no doubt that       his forehead creased .  cribbins was seldom troubled by religious questions  and this one was pretty difficult .  he rose to it like a born theologian .     i have no doubt that they will be found shtill jogging along  but possibly in the opposite direction .         back toward the last .     she said  looking worried .      ah  dear lady  remember that they will by then be the first .         oh yes  i hadn   t thought of it like that .  that   s the only way it could work  unless of course the original first would wait for the last to catch up .         that would be a miracle indeed     said cribbins  watching her lock the door behind them .  the evening air was sharp and unwelcoming after the warmth of the newspaper room  and made the prospect of another night in the flophouse in monkey street seem doubly unwelcome .  he needed his own miracle right now  and he had a feeling that one was shaping up right here .      i expect it   s very hard for you  reverend  finding a place to stay     ms .  houser said .  he couldn   t make out her expression in the gloom .      oh  i have faith  shister     he said .     if om does not come  he shendsh   arrg .      and at a time like this .  a spring had slipped .  it was a judgment .   but agonizing as it was  it might yet have its blessing .  ms .  houser was bearing down on him with the look of a woman determined to do good at any price .   oh  it hurt  though  it had snapped right across his tongue .   a voice behind him said     excuse me  i couldn   t help noticing   are you mr .  cribbins  by any chance .      enraged by the pain in his mouth  cribbins turned with murder in his heart  but    that   s reverend cribbins  thank you     said ms .  houser  and his fists unclenched .         shme     he muttered .   a pale young man in an old fashioned clerk   s robe was staring at him .      my name is heretofore     he said     and if you are cribbins  i know a rich man who wants to meet you .  it could be your lucky day .         ish zat sho .     muttered cribbins .     and if zat man ish called coshmo  i want to meet him .  it could be hish lucky day  too .  ain   t we the lucky ones .             you must have had a moment of dread     said moist  as they relaxed in the marble floored sitting room .  at least  adora belle relaxed .  moist was searching .      i don   t know what you   re talking about     she said  as he opened a cupboard .      golems weren   t built to be free .  they don   t know how to handle   stuff .         they   ll learn .  and she wouldn   t have hurt the dog     said adora belle  watching him pace the room .      you weren   t sure .  i heard the way you were talking to her .     put down the ladle and turn around slowly    sort of thing .     moist pulled open a drawer .      are you looking for something .         some bank keys .  there should be a set of them somewhere around .      adora belle joined in .  it was that or argue about gladys .  besides  the suite had a great many drawers and cupboards  and it was something to do while dinner was prepared .      what is this key for .     she asked after a mere few seconds .  moist turned .  adora belle held up a silvery key on a ring .     no  there   ll be a lot more than that     said moist .     where did you find that  anyway .      she pointed to the big desk .     i just touched the side here and   oh  it didn   t do it this time        it took moist more than a minute to find the trigger that slid the little drawer out .  shut  it disappeared seamlessly into the grain of the wood .      it must be for something important     he said  heading for another desk .     maybe he kept the rest of the keys somewhere else .  just try it on anything .  i   ve just been camping here  really .  i don   t know what   s in half of these drawers .      he returned to a bureau and was sifting through its contents when he heard a click and a creak behind him and adora belle said  in a rather flat voice     you did say he entertained young ladies up here  right .         apparently  yes .  why .         well  that   s what i call entertainment .      moist turned .  the door of a heavy cupboard stood wide open .      oh  no     he said .     what   s all that for .         you are joking .         well  yes  all right .  but it   s all so   so black .         and leathery     said adora belle .     possibly rubbery  too .      they advanced on the museum of inventive erotica just revealed .  some of it  freed at last from confinement  unfolded  slid  or  in a few cases  bounced onto the floor .      this       moist prodded something  which went spoing .        is  yes  rubbery .  definitely rubbery .         but all this here is pretty much frilly     said adora belle .     he must have run out of ideas .         either that or there were no more ideas to be had .  i think he was eighty when he died     said moist  as a seismic shift caused some more piles to slide and slither downward .      well done him     said adora belle .     oh  and there   s a couple of shelves of books  too     adora belle went on  investigating the gloom at the back of the cupboard .     just here  behind the rather curious saddle and the whips .  bedtime reading  i assume .         i don   t think so     said moist  pulling out a leather bound volume and flicking it open at a random page .     look  it   s the old boy   s journal .  years and years of it .  good grief  there   s decades .         let   s publish it and make a fortune     said adora belle  kicking the heap .     plain covers  of course .         no  you don   t understand .  there may be something in here about mr .  bent .  there   s some secret        moist ran a finger along the spines .     let   s see  he   s fifty two  he came here when he was about thirteen  and a few months later some people came looking for him .  old lavish didn   t like the look of them   ah .     he pulled out a couple of volumes .     these should tell us something  they   re around the right time           what are these  and why do they jingle .     adora belle said  holding up a couple of strange devices .      how should i know .         you   re a man .         well  yes .  and .  i mean  i don   t go in for this stuff .         you know  i think it   s like horseradish     said adora belle thoughtfully .      pardon .         like   well  horseradish is good in a beef sandwich  so you have some .  but one day a spoonful just doesn   t cut the mustard           as it were     said moist  fascinated .         and so you have two  and soon it   s three  and eventually there   s more horseradish than beef  and then one day you realize the beef fell out and you didn   t notice .         i don   t think that is the metaphor you   re looking for     said moist     because i have known you to make yourself a horseradish sandwich .         all right  but it   s still a good one     said adora belle .  she reached down and picked up something from the floor .      your keys  i think .  what they were doing in there we shall never know  with any luck .      moist took them .  the ring was heavy with keys of all sizes .      and what shall we do with all this stuff .     adora belle kicked the heap again .  it quivered  and somewhere inside something squeaked .      put it back in the cupboard .     moist suggested uncertainly .  the pile of passionless frippery had a brooding  alien look  like some sea monster of the abyss that had been dragged unceremoniously from its native darkness into the light of the sun .      i don   t think i could face it     said adora belle .     let   s just leave the door open and let it crawl back by itself .  hey .     this was to mr .  fusspot  who   d trotted smartly out of the room with something in his mouth .      tell me that was just an old rubber bone     she said .     please .         no oh     said moist  shaking his head .     i think that would definitely be the wrong description .  i think it was   was   it was not an old rubber bone  is what it was .             now look     said hubert     don   t you think we   d know if the gold had been stolen .  people talk about that sort of thing .  i   m pretty certain it   s a fault in the crossover multivalve  right here .     he tapped a thin glass tube .      i don   t think the glooper ith wrong  thur     said igor gloomily .      igor  you realize that if the glooper is right then i   ll have to believe there is practically no gold in our vaults .         i believe the glooper ith not in error  thur .     igor took a dollar out of his pocket and walked over to the well .      if you would be tho good ath to watch the    lotht money    column  thur .     he said  and dropped the coin into the dark waters .  it gleamed for a moment as it sank beyond the pockets of mankind .   in one corner of the glooper   s convoluted glass tubing a small blue bubble drifted up  dawdling from side to side as it rose  and burst on the surface with a faint gloop .      oh dear     said hubert .       the comic convention  when two people are dining at a table designed to accommodate twenty  is that they sit at either end .  moist and adora belle didn   t try it  but instead huddled together .  gladys stood at the other end  a napkin over one arm  her eyes two sullen glows .   the sheep skull didn   t help moist   s frame of mind at all .  peggy had arranged it as a centerpiece  with flowers around it  but the cool sunglasses were getting on his nerves .      how good is a golem   s hearing .     he said .      extremely     said adora belle .     look  don   t worry  i have a plan .         oh  good .         no  seriously .  i   ll take her out tomorrow .         can   t you just       moist hesitated  and then mouthed     change the words in her head .         she   s a free golem .     said adora belle sharply .     how would you like it .      moist remembered owlswick and the turnip .     not much     he admitted .      with free golems you should change minds by persuasion .  i think i can do that .         aren   t your golden golems due to arrive tomorrow .         i hope so .         it   s going to be a busy day .  i   m going to launch paper money and you   re going to march gold through the streets .         we couldn   t leave them underground .  anyway  they might not be golden .  i   ll go and see flead in the morning .         we will go and see him .  together .      she patted moist   s arm .     never mind .  there could be worse things than golden golems .         i can   t think what they are     said moist  a phrase that he later regretted .     i   d like to take people   s minds off gold        he stopped and stared at the sheep  which stared back in a calm enigmatic way .  for some reason moist felt it should have a saxophone and a little black beret .      surely they looked in the vault     he said aloud .      who looked .     said adora belle .      that   s where he   d go .  the one thing you can depend on  right .  the foundation of all that   s worthy .         who   d go .         mr .  bent is in the gold vault .     said moist  standing up so quickly that his chair fell over .     he   s got all the keys .         sorry .  is this the man who went haywire after making a simple mistake .         that   s him .  he   s got a past .         one of those with a capital p .         exactly .  come on  let   s get down there .         i thought we were going to have a romantic evening .         we will .  right after we get him out .          the only sound in the vaults was the tap tap tapping of adora belle   s foot .   it was really annoying moist as he paced up and down in front of the gold room  by the light of silver candlesticks that had been gracing the dining room table .      i just hope aimsbury is keeping the broth warm     said adora belle .  tap tap tap tap .      look     said moist .     firstly  to open a safe like this you need to have a name like fingers mcgee  and secondly  these little lock picks aren   t up to the job .         well  let   s go and find mr .  mcgee .  he   s probably got the right sort .     tap tap .  tap tap .      that won   t be any good because  thirdly  there   s probably no such person  and  fourthly  the vault is locked from the inside and i think he   s left the key in the lock  which is why none of these work .     he waved the key ring .     fifthly  i   m trying to turn the key from this side with tweezers  an old trick which  it turns out  does not work .         good .  so we can go back to the suite .     tap tap tap tap .   moist peered again through the little spyhole in the door .  a heavy plate had been slid across it on the inside  and he could just make out a glimmer of light around the edges .  there was a lamp in there .  what there was not  as far as he knew  was any kind of ventilation .  it looked as though the vault had been built before the idea of breathing caught on .  it was a man made cave  built to contain something you never intended to take out .  gold didn   t choke .      i don   t think we have the option     he said     because sixthly  he   s running out of air .  he may even be dead .         if he   s dead  can we leave him until tomorrow .  it   s freezing down here .      tap tap tap tap .   moist looked up at the ceiling .  it was made of ancient oak beams  strapped together with iron bands .  he knew what old oak could be like .  it could be like steel  only nastier .  it blunted axes and bounced hammers back in their owners    faces .      can   t the guards help .     adora belle ventured .      i doubt it     said moist .     anyway  i don   t particularly want to encourage the idea that they can spend the night breaking into the vault .         but they   re mostly city watch  aren   t they .         so .  when a man is legging it for the horizon with as much gold as he can carry he doesn   t worry much about what his old job was .  i   m a criminal .  trust me .      he walked toward the stairs  counting under his breath .      and now what are you doing .         working out which part of the bank is directly over the gold     said moist .     but you know what .  i think i already know .  the gold room is right under his desk .          the lamp had burned low  and oily smoke swirled and settled on the sacks where mr .  bent lay curled up in a tight ball .   there was sound above  and voices muffled by the ancient ceiling .  one of them said     i can   t budge it .  all right  gladys  over to you .         is this ladylike behavior .     a second voice rumbled .      oh yes  it counts as moving furniture     said a voice that was clearly female .      very well .  i shall lift it up and dust underneath it .      there was the thunder of wood being scraped on wood  and a little dust fell onto the piled bullion .      very dusty indeed .  i shall fetch a broom .         actually  gladys  i   d like you to lift up the floor now     said the first voice .      there may be dust underneath that too .         i   m certain of it .         very well .      there were several thumps that made the beams creak  and then a rumble of     it does not say anything about dusting under the floor in lady waggon   s book of household management .         gladys  a man may be dying under there .         i see .  that would be untidy .     the beams rattled under a blow .     lady waggon says that any bodies found during a weekend party should be disposed of discreetly  in case of scandal .      three more blows  and a beam shattered .      lady waggon says watchmen are disrespectful and do not wipe their dirty boots .      another beam cracked .  light lanced down .  a hand the size of a shovel appeared  grabbed one of the iron straps  and snapped it     moist peered into the gloom  while smoke poured up past him .      he   s down there .  ye gods  this reeks .      adora belle looked over his shoulder .      is he alive .         i certainly hope so .     moist eased himself between the beams and dropped onto the bullion boxes .   after a moment he called up     there   s a pulse .  and there   s a key in the lock  too .  can you come down the stairs and give me a hand .         er   we have visitors     adora belle called down .   a couple of helmeted heads were now outlined against the light .  damn it .  using off duty watchmen was all very well  but they tended to take their badges everywhere with them  and were just the sort of people who   d jump to conclusions merely because they   d found a man standing in the wreckage of a bank vault after hours .  the words    look  i can explain    presented themselves for utterance  but moist strangled them just in time .  it was his bank  after all .      well  what do you want .     he demanded .   this was sufficiently unexpected to throw the men  but one of them rallied .      is this your bank vault  sir .     he said .      i   m the deputy chairman  you idiot .  and there   s a sick man down here .         did he fall when you were breaking into the vault  sir .      oh gods  you just couldn   t budge a born copper .  they just kept going  in that patient  grinding tone .  when you were a policeman  everything was a crime .      officer   you are a copper  right .         constable haddock  sir .         well  constable  can we get my colleague into the fresh air .  he   s wheezing .  i   ll unlock the door down here .      haddock nodded to the other guard  who hurried away toward the stairs .      if you had a key  sir  why did you break in .         to get him out  of course .         so how           it   s all perfectly sensible     said moist .     once i   ve got out of here we will all have a laugh .         i shall look forward to that  sir     said haddock     because i like a laugh .          talking to the watch was like tap dancing on a landslide .  if you were nimble  you could stay upright  but you couldn   t steer and there were no brakes and you just knew that it was going to end in a certain amount of fuss .   it wasn   t constable haddock anymore .  it had stopped being constable haddock just as soon as constable haddock had found that the pockets of the master of the royal mint contained a velvet roll of lock picks and a blackjack  and it then became sergeant detritus .   lock picks  as moist knew  were technically not illegal .  owning them was fine .  owning them while standing in someone else   s house was not fine .  owning them while being found in a stricken bank vault was so far from fine it could see the curvature of the universe .   so far  to sergeant detritus  so good .  however  the sergeant   s grasp began to slip when confronted with the evidence that moist quite legitimately had the keys for the vault he had broken into .  this seemed to the troll to be a criminal act in itself  and he   d toyed for a while with the charge    wasting watch time by breaking in when you didn   t have to .     he didn   t understand about the visceral need for the lock picks  trolls didn   t have a word for machismo in the same way that puddles don   t have a word for water .  he also had a problem with the mind set and actions of the nearly late mr .  bent .  trolls don   t go mad  they get mad .  so he gave up  and it became captain carrot .   moist knew him of old .  he was big and smelled of soap  and his normal expression was one of blue eyed innocence .  moist couldn   t see behind that amiable face  just couldn   t see a thing .  he could read most people but the captain was a closed book in a locked bookcase .  and the man was always courteous  in that really annoying way police have .   he said     good evening     politely  as he sat down opposite moist in the little office that had suddenly become an interview room .     can i start  sir  by asking you about the three men down in the cellar .  and the big glass   thing .         mr .  hubert turvy and his assistants     said moist .     they are studying the economic system of the city .  they   re not involved in this .  come to think of it  i   m not involved in this either .  there is  in fact  no this .  i have explained all this to the sergeant .         sergeant detritus thinks you are too smart  mr .  lipwig     said captain carrot  opening his notebook .      well  yes  i expect he thinks that about most people  doesn   t he .      carrot   s expression changed not one iota .      can you tell me why there is a golem downstairs who is wearing a dress and keeps ordering my men to wipe their dirty boots .     he said .      not without sounding mad  no .  what has this got to do with anything .         i don   t know  sir .  i hope to find out .  who is lady deirdre waggon .         she writes rather out of date books on etiquette and household management  for young ladies who would like to be the type of women who have time to arrange flowers .  look  is this relevant .         i don   t know that  sir .  i am endeavoring to assess the situation .  can you tell me why a small dog is running around the building  in possession of what i shall call a wind up clockwork item of an intimate nature .         i think it is because my sanity is slipping away     said moist .     look  the only thing that is important here is that mr .  bent had   a nasty turn and locked himself in the gold vault .  i had to get him out quickly .         ah  yes  the gold vault     said the captain .     can we talk about the gold for a moment .         what   s wrong with the gold .         i was hoping you could tell us  sir .  i believe you wanted to sell it to the dwarfs .         what .  well  yes  i said that  but it was only to make a point           a point     said captain carrot solemnly  writing this down .      look  i know how this sort of thing goes     said moist .     you just keep me talking in the hope that i   ll suddenly forget where i am and say something stupid and incriminating  right .         thank you for that  sir     said captain carrot  turning over another page in his notebook .      thank me for what .         for telling me you know how this sort of thing goes  sir .      see .  moist told himself  this is what happens when you get too comfortable .  you lose the edge .  even a copper can outsmart you .   the captain looked up .     i will tell you  mr .  lipwig  that some of what you say has been corroborated by an unbiased witness who could not possibly be an accomplice .         you talked to gladys .     said moist .      gladys being .         she   s the one going on about dirty boots .         how can a golem be a    she     sir .         ah  i know this one .  the correct answer is  how can a golem be a    he    .         an interesting point  sir .  that explains the dress  then .  out of interest  how much weight would you say a golem can carry .         i don   t know .  a couple of tons  maybe .  what are you getting at .         i don   t know  sir     said carrot cheerfully .     commander vimes says that when life hands you a mess of spaghetti  just keep pulling until you find the meatball .  in fact  your story agrees  insofar as he understood events  with what we have been told by a mr .  fusspot .         you talked to the dog .         well  he is the chairman of the bank  sir     said the captain .      how did you understand what   ah  you have a werewolf  right .     said moist  grinning .      we don   t confirm that  sir .         everyone knows it   s nobby nobbs  you know .         do they  sir .  gosh .  anyway  your movements this evening are accounted for .         good .  thank you .     moist started to rise .      however  your movements earlier this week  sir  are not .     moist sat down again .      well .  i don   t have to account for them  do i .         it might help us  sir .         how would it help you .         it might help us understand why there is no gold in the vault  sir .  it   s a small detail in the great scheme of things  but it is something of a puzzler .      at which point  somewhere close at hand  mr .  fusspot began to bark         cosmo lavish sat at his desk with his fingers steepled in front of his mouth  watching cribbins eat .  not many people in a state to make a choice had ever done this for more than thirty seconds .      the soup is good .     he said .   cribbins lowered the bowl after one lengthy final gurgle .      champion  your lordship .     cribbins removed a gray rag from his pocket and     he   s going to take his teeth out  right now  here at the table  thought cosmo .  amazing .  ah  yes  and there   s still bits of carrot in them        don   t hesitate to repair your teeth     he said  as cribbins removed a bent fork from a pocket .      i   m a martyr to them  shir     said cribbins .     i   ll shwear they   re out to get me .     springs twanged as he fought them with the fork and then  apparently satisfied  he wrestled them back onto his gray gums and champed them into place .      that   s better     he announced .      good     said cosmo .     and now  in view of the nature of your allegations  which drumknott here has carefully transcribed and you have signed  let me ask you  why have you not gone to lord vetinari .         i   ve knowed men escape the noose  sir     said cribbins .     it ain   t too hard if you   ve got the readies .  but i never heard of one get a big plum job the very next day .  gov   ment job  too .  then suddenly he   s a banker  no leshsh .  shomeone   s watching over him  and i don   t think it   s a bleeding fairy .  if i wash to go to vetinari  then i   d be a bit silly  right .  but he   s got your bank  and you ain   t  which is a shame .  sho i   m your man  shir .         at a price  i have no doubt .         well  yes  something in the way of expenses would help  yesh .         and you are sure that lipwig and spangler are one and the same .         it   s the smile  shir .  you never forget it .  and he has this gift of chatting to people  he makes people want to do things his way .  it   s like magic  the little ingrate .      cosmo stared at him and then said     give the reverend fifty dollars  drum   heretofore  and direct him to a good hotel .  one where they might have a hot tub available .         fifty dollarsh .     growled cribbins .      and then please go ahead with that little acquisition  will you .         yes  sir .  of course .      cosmo pulled a piece of paper toward him  dipped a pen in the inkwell  and began to write furiously .      fifty dollarsh .     said cribbins again  appalled at the minimum wage of sin .   cosmo looked up and stared at the man as if seeing him for the first time and not enjoying the novelty .      hh  yes .  fifty dollars indeed for now  reverend     said cosmo soothingly .     and in the morning  if your memory is still as good  we will all look forward to a richer and righteous future .  do not let me detain you .      he returned to his paperwork .   heretofore grabbed cribbins   s arm and towed him forcibly out of the room .  he   d seen what cosmo was writing .     vetinarivetinarivetinari vetinarivetinarivetinari    vetinarivetinarivetinari vetinarivetinarivetinari    vetinarivetinarivetinari vetinarivetinarivetinari    vetinarivetinarivetinari vetinarivetinarivetinari    vetinarivetinarivetinari vetinarivetinarivetinari    vetinarivetinarivetinari vetinarivetinarivetinar         it was time for the sword stick  he thought .  get it  hand it over  take the money  and run .       things were quiet in the department of postmortem communications .  they were never very loud at the best of times  although you always got  when the sounds of the university slid into silence  the reedy little gnat sized voices leaking through from the other side .   the trouble was  thought hicks  that too many of his predecessors had never had any kind of a life outside the department  where social skills were not a priority  and even when dead had completely failed to get a life  either .  so they hung around the department  reluctant to leave the place .  sometimes  when they were feeling strong and the dolly sisters players were doing a new production  he let them out to paint the scenery .   hicks sighed .  that was the trouble with working in the dpc  you could never exactly be the boss .  in an ordinary job people retired  wandered back to the ol    workplace a few times while there were those who remembered them  and then faded into the ever swelling past .  but the former staff here never seemed to go     there was a saying     old necromancers never die .     when he told them this  people would say       and .     and hicks would have to reply     that   s all of it  i   m afraid .  just    old necromancers never die .         he was just tidying up for the night when  from his shadowy corner  charlie said     somebody coming through  well  i say some body        hicks spun around .  the magic circle was glowing and a pearly pointy hat was already rising through the solid floor .      professor flead .     he said .      yes  and we must hurry  young man     said the shade of flead  still rising .      but i banished you .  i used the ninefold erasure .  it banishes everything .         i wrote it     said flead  looking smug .     oh  don   t worry  i   m the only one it doesn   t work on .  ha  i   d be a damn fool to design a spell to work on myself  eh .      hicks pointed a shaking finger .     you put in a hidden portal  didn   t you .         of course .  a bloody good one .  don   t worry  i   m the only one who knows where it is  too .     the whole of flead was floating above the circle now .     and don   t try to look for it  a man of your limited talent will never find the hidden runes .      flead looked around the room .     isn   t that wonderful young lady here .     he said hopefully .     well  never mind .  you must get me out of this place  hicks .  i want to see the fun .         fun .  what fun .     said hicks  a man planning to look through the ninefold erasure spell very  very carefully .      i know what kind of golems are coming .          when he was a child  moist had prayed every night before going to bed .  his family were very active in the plain potato church  which shunned the excesses of the ancient and orthodox potato church .  its followers were retiring  industrious  and inventive  and their strict adherence to oil lamps and homemade furniture made them stand out in the region where most people used candles and sat on sheep .   he   d hated praying .  it felt as though he was opening a big black hole into space  and at any moment something might reach through and grab him .  this may have been because the standard bedtime prayer included the line    if i die before i wake     which on bad nights caused him to try and sit up until morning .   he   d also been instructed to use the hours before sleep to count his blessings .   lying here now  in the darkness of the bank  rather cold and significantly alone  he sought for some .   his teeth were good and he wasn   t suffering from premature hair loss .  there .  that wasn   t so hard  was it .   and the watch hadn   t actually arrested him  as such .  but there was a troll guarding the vault  which had ominous black and yellow ropes strung around it .   no gold in the vault .  well  even that wasn   t entirely true .  there was five pounds of it  at least  coating the lead ingots .  someone had done a pretty good job there .  that was a silver lining  right .  at least it was some gold .  it wasn   t as if there was no gold at all  right .   he was alone because adora belle was spending a night in the cells for assaulting an officer of the watch .  moist considered that this was unfair .  of course  depending on what kind of day a copper has had there is no action  short of being physically somewhere else  that may not be construed as assault  but adora belle hadn   t actually assaulted sergeant detritus  she   d merely attempted to stab his huge foot with her shoe  which resulted in a broken heel and a twisted ankle .  captain carrot said this had been taken into consideration .   the clocks of the city chimed four  and moist considered his future  specifically in terms of length .   look on the bright side .  he might just be hanged .   he should have gone down to the vaults on day one  with an alchemist and a lawyer in tow .  didn   t they ever audit the vaults .  was it done by a bunch of jolly decent chaps who   d poke their head into some other chap   s vault and sign off on it quickly  so   s not to miss lunch .  can   t go doubting a chap   s word  eh .  especially when you didn   t want him to doubt yours .   maybe the late sir joshua had blown it all on exotic leather goods and young ladies .  how many nights in the arms of beautiful women were worth a sack of gold .  the price of a good woman was proverbially above rubies  so a skillfully bad one was worth presumably a lot more .   he sat up and lit the candle  and his eye fell on mr .  lavish   s journal on the bedside table .   thirty nine years ago   well  it was the right year  and since at the moment he had nothing else to do     the luck that had been draining from his boots all day came back to him .  even though he wasn   t certain what he was looking for  he found it on the sixth random page      a pair of funny looking people came to the bank today  asking for the boy bent .  i bade the sta .  send them away .  he is doing exceedingly well .  one wonders what he must have su .  ered .      quite a lot of the journal seemed to be in some sort of code  but the nature of the secret symbols suggested that mr .  lavish painstakingly recorded every amorous affair .  you had to admire his directness  at least .  he   d worked out what he wanted to get from life  and had set out to get as much of it as he could .  moist had to take his hat off to the man .   and what had he wanted .  he   d never sat down to think about it .  but mostly  he wanted tomorrow to be different from today .   he looked at his watch .  four fifteen  and no one about but the guards .  there were watchmen on the main doors .  he was indeed not under arrest  but this was one of those civilized little arrangements  he was not under arrest  provided that he didn   t try to act like a man who was not under arrest .   ah  he thought  as he pulled on his trousers  there was another small blessing  he had been there when mr .  fusspot proposed to the werewolf        which was  by then  balancing on one of the huge ornamental urns that grew like toadstools in the bank   s corridors .  it was rocking .  so was corporal nobbs  who was laughing himself sick at        mr .  fusspot  who was bouncing up and down with wonderfully optimistic enthusiasm .  but he was holding in his mouth his new toy  which appeared to have been mysteriously wound up  and beneficent fate had decreed that at the top of each jump  its unbalancing action would cause the little dog to do one slow cartwheel in the air .   and moist thought  so  the werewolf is female and has a watch badge on her collar  and i   ve seen that hair color before .  hah .   but his gaze had gone straight back to mr .  fusspot  who was jumping and spinning with a look of total bliss on his little face        and then captain carrot had plucked him out of the air  the werewolf fled  and the show was over .  but moist would always have the memory .  next time he walked past sergeant angua he   d growl under his breath  although that would probably constitute assault .   now  fully dressed  he went for a walk along endless corridors .   the watch had put a lot of new guards in the bank for the night .  captain carrot was clever  you had to give him that .  they were trolls .  trolls were very hard to talk around to your point of view .   he could sense them watching him everywhere he went .  there wasn   t one at the door into the undercroft  but moist   s heart sank when he neared the pool of brilliant light around the glooper and saw one standing by the door to freedom .   owlswick was lying on a mattress and snoring  his paintbrush in his hand .  moist envied him .   hubert and igor were working on the tangle of glassware which  moist could swear  looked bigger every time he came down here .      what   s wrong .         wrong .  nothing .  nothing   s wrong .     said hubert .     it   s all fine .  is something wrong .  why do you think something is wrong .  what would make you think there   s something wrong .      moist yawned .      any coffee .  tea .     he suggested .      for you  mr .  lipwig     said igor     i will make thplot .         splot .  real splot .         indeed  thur     said igor smugly .      you can   t buy it here  you know .         i am aware of that  thur .  it hath now been outlawed in motht of the old country  too     said igor  rummaging in a sack .      outlawed .  it   s been outlawed .  but it   s just an herbal drink .  my granny used to make it .         indeed  it wath very traditional     igor agreed .     it put hairth on your chetht .         yes  she used to complain about that .         this an alcoholic beverage .     said hubert nervously .      absolutely not     said moist .     my granny never touched alcohol .     he thought for a moment and then added     except maybe aftershave .  splot   s made from tree bark .         oh .  well  that sounds nice     said hubert .   igor retired to his jungle of equipment  and there was the clinking of glassware .  moist sat down at the cluttered bench .      how   s it going in your world  hubert .     he said .     the water gurgling around okay  is it .         it   s fine .  fine .  it   s all fine .  nothing is wrong at all .     hubert went blank  fished out his notebook  glanced at a page  and put it back .     how are you .         me .  oh  great .  except that there should be ten tons of gold in the gold vaults and there isn   t .      it sounded as though a glass had broken in the direction of igor  and hubert stared in horror at moist .      ha .  hahahaha .     he said .     ha ha ha ha a hahaha .  .  ha ha ha .  .  .  ha ha        there was a blur as igor leaped the table and grabbed hubert .     thorry  mr .  lipwig     he said over his shoulder     thith can go on for hourth        he slapped hubert twice across the face and pulled a jar out of his pocket .      mr .  hubert .  how many fingerth am i holding up .      hubert slowly focused .      thirteen .     he quavered .   igor relaxed  and dropped the jar back into his pocket .     jutht in time .  well done  thur .         i am so sorry       hubert began .      don   t worry about it .  i   m feeling a bit that way myself     said moist .      so   this gold   have you any idea who took it .         no  but it must have been an inside job     said moist .     and now the watch are going to pin it on me  i suspect .         will that mean you won   t be in charge .     said hubert .      i doubt i   ll be allowed to run the bank from inside the tanty .         oh dear     said hubert  looking at igor .     um   what would happen if it was put back .      igor coughed loudly .      i think that   s unlikely  don   t you .     said moist .      yes  but igor told me that when the post office burned down last year the gods themselves gave you the money to rebuild it .         harrumph     said igor .      i doubt if that   s likely twice     said moist .     and i don   t think there   s a god of banking .         one might take it on for the publicity     said hubert desperately .     it could be worth a prayer .         harrumph .     said igor  louder this time .   moist looked from one to the other .  okay  he thought  something   s going on  and i   m not going to be told what it is .   pray to the gods to get a big heap of gold .  when had that ever worked .   well  last year it worked  true  but that was because i already knew where a big heap of gold was buried .  the gods help those who help themselves  and my word  didn   t i help myself .      you think it   s really worth it .     said moist .   a small  steaming mug was placed in front of him .      your thplot     said igor .  the words    now please drink it up and go    accompanied it in every respect but the vocal .      do you think i should pray  igor .     said moist  watching his face .      i couldn   t thay .  the igor position on prayer is that it is nothing more than hope with a beat to it .      moist leaned closer and whispered     igor  as one   berwald lad to another  your lisp just departed .      igor   s frown grew .     thorry  thur  i have a lot on my mind     he said  rolling his eyes to indicate the nervous hubert .      my fault  i   m disturbing you good people     said moist  emptying the cup in one go .     any minute now the dhdldlkp  kvyv vbdf   jvjvf  llljvmmk  vvbvlm bnxgcgbnme        ah yes  splot  thought moist .  it contained herbs and all natural ingredients .  but belladonna was an herb  and arsenic was natural .  there was no alcohol in it  people said  because alcohol couldn   t survive .  but a cup of hot splot got men out of bed and off to work when there was six feet of snow outside and the well was frozen .  it left you clear headed and quick thinking .  it was only a shame that the human tongue couldn   t keep up .   moist blinked once or twice and said     ughx        he said his good byes  even if they were his    gnyrxs     and headed back up the length of the undercroft  the light from the glooper pushing his shadow in front of him .  trolls watched him suspiciously as he climbed the steps  trying to keep his feet from flying away from him .  his brain buzzed  but it had nothing to do .  there was nothing to grab hold of  to worry a solution from .  and in an hour or so  the country edition of the times would be out and  very shortly after  so would he .  there would be a run on the bank  which is a horrifying thing at best  and the other banks wouldn   t help him out  would they  because he wasn   t a chap .  disgrace and ignominy and mr .  fusspot were staring him in the face  but only one of them was licking it .   he   d made it to his office  then .  splot certainly took your mind off all your little problems by rolling them into the big one of keeping all of yourself on one planet .  he accepted the little dog   s ritual slobbering kiss  got off his knees  and made it as far as the chair .   okay   sitting down  he could do that .  but his mind raced .   people would be here soon .  there were too many unanswered questions .  what to do  what to do .  pray .  moist wasn   t too keen on prayer  not because he thought the gods didn   t exist but because he was afraid they might .  all right  anoia had got a good deal out of him and he   d noticed her shiny new temple the other day  its frontage already hung with votive egg slicers  fondant whisks  ladles  parsnip butterers  and many other useless appliances donated by grateful worshipers who had faced the prospect of a life with their drawers stuck .  anoia delivered  because she specialized .  she didn   t even pretend to offer a paradise  eternal verities  or any kind of salvation .  she just left you with a smooth pulling action and access to the forks .  and practically no one had believed in her before he   d picked her  at random  as one of the gods to thank for the miraculous windfall .  would she remember .   if he had some gold stuck in a drawer  then maybe .  turning dross into gold  probably not .  still  you turned to the gods when all you had left was a prayer .   he wandered into the little kitchen and took a ladle off the hook .  then he went back to the office and rammed it into a desk drawer  where it stuck  this being the chief function of ladles in the world .  rattle your drawers  that was it .  she was attracted to the noise  apparently .      oh anoia     he said  tugging at the drawer handle .     this is me  moist von lipwig  penitent sinner .  i don   t know if you remember .  we are  all of us  mere utensils  stuck in drawers of our own making  and none more than i .  if you could find time in your busy schedule to unstick me in my hour of need you will not find me wanting in gratitude  yea indeed  when we put statues of the gods on the roof of the new post office .  i never liked the urns on the old one .  covered in gold leaf  too  by the way .  thanking you in anticipation  amen .      he gave the drawer one last tug .  the ladle sprang out  twanging through the air like a leaping salmon  and smashed a vase in the corner .   moist decided to take that as a hopeful sign .  you were supposed to smell cigarette smoke if anoia was present  but since adora belle had spent more than ten minutes in this room  there was no point in sniffing .   what next .  well  the gods helped those who helped themselves  and there was always one last lipwig friendly option .  it floated up in his mind  wing it .       chapter        doing it in style    the chairman goes woof    harry king puts something by the screaming starts one kiss  no tongue council of wars moist takes charge a little magic  with stamps arousing the professor   s interest a vision of paradise      wing it .  there   s nothing left .  remember the nearly gold chain .  this is the other end of the rainbow .  talk yourself out of a situation you can   t talk your way out of .  make your own luck .  put on a show .  if you fall  let them remember how you turned it into a dive .  sometimes the finest hour is the last one .   he went to the wardrobe and took out the best golden suit  the one he wore on special occasions .  then he went and found gladys  who was staring out of the window .   he had to speak her name quite loudly before she turned to face him  very slowly .      they are coming     she said .      yes  they are     said moist     and i   d better look my best .  could you press these trousers  please .      wordlessly  gladys took the pants from him  held them against the wall  and ran a huge palm down them before handing them back .  moist could have shaved with the crease .  then she turned back to the window .   moist joined her .  there was already a crowd in front of the bank  and coaches were pulling up as he watched .  there were a fair number of guards around  too .  a brief flash indicated that otto chriek of the times was already taking pictures .  ah  yes  a deputation was now forming .  people wanted to be in at the death .  sooner or later  someone would hammer at the door .  blow that for a game of soldiers .  he couldn   t let that happen .   wash  shave  trim errant nose hairs  brush teeth .  comb hair  shine boots .  don hat  walk down stairs  unlock door very slowly so that the click was unlikely to be heard outside  wait until he heard a tread getting louder .   moist opened the door  sharply .      well  gentlemen .      cosmo lavish wobbled as the knock failed to connect  but recovered and thrust a sheet of paper at him .      emergency audit     he said .     these gentlemen       and here he indicated a number of worthy looking men behind him       are representatives of the major guilds and some of the other banks .  this is standard procedure and you can   t stand in their way .  you will note that we have brought commander vimes of the watch .  when we have established that there is indeed no gold in the vault  i shall instruct him to arrest you on suspicion of theft .      moist glanced at the commander .  he did not like the man much  and was certain that vimes did not like him at all .  he was even more certain  though  that vimes did not readily take orders from the likes of cosmo lavish .      i   m sure that the commander will do as he sees fit     said moist meekly .     you know the way to the vault .  i am sorry it   s a bit of a mess at the moment .      cosmo half turned  to make certain the crowd heard everything he said .     you are a thief  mr .  lipwig .  a cheat and a liar  an embezzler and have no dress sense whatsoever .         i say  that   s a bit on the harsh side     said moist as the men swept through .     i happen to think i dress rather snappily .      now he was alone on the steps  facing the crowd .  they weren   t a mob yet  but it could only be a matter of time .      can i help anyone else .     he said .      what about our money .     said someone .      what about it .     said moist .      says in the paper you   ve got no gold     said the inquirer .   he pushed a damp copy of the times toward moist .  the newspaper had  on the whole  been quite restrained .  he had expected bad headlines  but the story was a single column on the front page and it was full of    we understand that    s and    we believe that    s and    the times had been informed that    s and all the phrases that journalists use when they are dealing with facts about large sums of money they don   t fully understand and are not quite certain that what they have been told is true .   he looked up into the face of sacharissa cripslock .      sorry     she said     but there were watchmen and guards all around the place last night and we didn   t have much time .  and frankly  mr .  bent   s   attack was enough of a story in its own right .  everyone knows he runs the bank .         the chairman runs the bank     said moist stiffly .      no  moist  the chairman goes woof     said sacharissa .     look  didn   t you sign anything when you took over the job .  a receipt or something .         well  maybe .  there was a mass of paperwork .  i just signed where i was told .  so did mr .  fusspot .         ye gods  the lawyers would have fun with that     said sacharissa  her notebook magically appearing in her hand .     and it   s no joke  either .  he could end up in debtors    prison .         kennel     said moist .     he goes woof  remember .  and that   s not going to happen .      sacharissa bent down to pat mr .  fusspot on his little head  and froze in mid bend .      what has he got in his    .     she began .      sacharissa  can we go into this later .  i really have not got time for it right now .  i swear by any three gods you believe in  even though you are a journalist  that when this is over i will give you a story that will tax even the times    ability to avoid inelegant and suggestive subjects .  trust me .         yes  but it looks like a       she began .      ah  so you do know what it is and i don   t need to explain     said moist briskly .   he handed the paper back to its worried owner .     you are mr .  cusper  aren   t you .     he said .     you have a balance of seven ankh morpork dollars with us  i believe .     for a moment the man looked impressed .  moist was really good at faces .     i told you we aren   t bothered about gold here     said moist .      yeah  but       the man began .     well  it   s not much of a bank if people can take the gold out of it  is it .     he said .      but it doesn   t make any difference     said moist .     i did tell you all .      they looked uncertain .  in theory  they should be stampeding up the steps .  moist knew what was holding them back .  it was hope .  it was the little voice inside that said  this isn   t really happening .  it was the voice that drove people to turn out the same pocket three times in a fruitless search for lost keys .  it was mad belief that the world is bound to start working properly again if i truly believe  and there will be keys .  it was the voice that said    this can   t be happening    very loudly  in order to drown out the creeping dread that it was .   he had about thirty seconds  while hope lasted .   and then the crowd parted .  pucci lavish did not know how to make an entrance .  harry king  on the other hand  did .  the milling  uncertain throng opened up like the sea in front of a hydrophobic prophet  leaving a channel that was suddenly lined on either side by large  weathered looking men with broken noses and a useful cross section of scars .  along this recent avenue strode harry king  trailing cigar smoke .  moist managed to stand his ground until mr .  king was a foot away  and made sure to look him in the eye .      how much money did i put in your bank  mr .  lipwig .     asked harry .      er  i believe it was fifty thousand dollars  mr .  king     said moist .      yes  i believe it was something like that     said mr .  king .     can yer guess what i am going to do now  mr .  lipwig .      moist did not guess .  the splot was still circulating in his system  and  in his brain  the answer clanged like a funeral bell .     you   re going to put some more in  aren   t you  mr .  king .      harry king beamed  as if moist was a dog that had just done a new trick .     that   s right  mr .  lipwig .  i thought to myself  harry  i thought  fifty thousand dollars seems a bit on the lonely side  so i   ve come along to round it up to sixty thousand dollars .      on signal  some more of harry king   s men came up behind him  carrying large chests between them .     most of it   s gold and silver  mr .  lipwig     said harry .     but i know you got lots of bright young men who can count it all up for you .         this is very kind of you  mr .  king     said moist     but at any minute the auditors are going to come back and the bank is going to be in big  big trouble .  please .  i can   t accept your money .      harry leaned closer to moist  enveloping him in cigar smoke and a hint of decayed cabbage .     i know you   re up to something     he whispered  tapping the side of his nose .     the bastards are out to get you  i can see that .  i know a winner when i sees one  and i know you   ve got something up your sleeves  eh .         just my arms  mr .  king  just my arms     said moist .      and long may you keep them     said harry  slapping him on the back .   the men filed past moist and deposited their cases on the floor .      i don   t need a receipt     said harry .     you know me  mr .  lipwig .  you know you can trust me  just like i know i can trust you .      moist shut his eyes  just for a moment .  to think that he had worried about ending the day hanging .      your money is safe with me  mr .  king     he said .      i know     said harry king .     and when you   ve won the day  i   ll send young wallace along and he   ll have a little chat with your monkey about how much interest i   m gonna get paid on this little lot  all right .  fair   s fair .         it certainly is  mr .  king .         right     said harry .     now i   m off to buy some land .      there was some uncertain murmuring from the crowd  as he departed .  the new deposit had thrown them .  it had thrown moist  too .  people were wondering what harry king knew .  so did moist .  it was a terrible thing  to have someone like harry believing in you .   now the crowd had evolved a spokesman  who said     look  what   s going on .  has the gold gone or not .         i don   t know     said moist .     i haven   t had a look today .         you say that as if it doesn   t matter     said sacharissa .      well  as i have explained     moist said     the city is still here .  the bank is still here .  i am still here .     he cast a glance toward harry king   s broad  retreating back .     for the moment .  so we don   t need the gold cluttering up the place  do we .      cosmo lavish appeared in the door behind moist .     so  mr .  lipwig  it would appear that you are a trickster to the end .         i beg your pardon .     said moist .   other members of the ad hoc audit committee were pushing their way out  looking satisfied .  they had  after all  been woken up very early in the morning  and those who are awakened very early in the morning expect to kill before breakfast .      have you finished already .     said moist .      surely you must know why we were brought here     said one of the bankers .     you know very well that last night the city watch found no gold in your vaults .  we can confirm this unhappy state of affairs .         oh well  you know how it is with money     said moist .     you think you are flat broke and there it was all the time in your other trousers .         no  mr .  lipwig  the joke is on you     said cosmo .     the bank is a sham .      he raised his voice .     i would advise all the investors you have misled to take their money back while they can .         no .  squad  to me .      commander vimes pushed his way through the bewildered bankers at the same time as half a dozen troll officers pounded up the steps and ended up shoulder to shoulder in front of the double doors .      are you a bloody fool  sir .     said vimes  nose to nose with cosmo .     that sounded to me like incitement to riot .  this bank is closed until further notice .         i am a director of the bank  commander     said cosmo .     you cannot keep me out .         watch me     said vimes .     i suggest you direct your complaint to his lordship .  sergeant detritus .         yessir .         nobody goes in there without a chitty signed by me .  and mr .  lipwig  you will not leave the city  understood .         yes  commander .     moist turned to cosmo .     you know  you   re not looking well     he said .     that   s not a good complexion you have there .         no more words  lipwig .     cosmo leaned down .  up close  his face looked even worse  like the face of a wax doll  if a wax doll could sweat .     we   ll meet in court .  it   s the end of the road  mr .  lipwig .  or should i say   mr .  spangler .      oh  gods  i should have done something about cribbins  thought moist .  i was too busy trying to make money     and there was adora belle  being ushered through the crowd by a couple of watchmen who were also acting as crutches .  vimes hurried down the steps as if he   d been expecting her .   moist became aware that the background noise of the city was getting louder .  the crowd had noticed it too .  somewhere  something big was happening  and this little confrontation was just a sideshow .      you think you are clever  mr .  lipwig .     said cosmo .      no  i know i am clever .  i think i   m unlucky     said moist .  but he thought  i didn   t have that many customers  surely .  i can hear screams .   with triumphant shouting behind him  he pushed his way down to adora belle and the cluster of coppers .      your golems  right .     he said .      every golem in the city just stopped moving     said adora belle .  their gazes met .      they   re coming .     said moist .      yes  i think they are .         who are .     said vimes suspiciously .      er  them .     said moist  pointing .   a few people came running around the corner from the maul and sprinted  gray faced  past the crowd outside the bank .  but they were only the flecks of foam driven before the tidal wave of people fleeing from the river area  and the wave of people broke on the bank as if it was a rock in the way of the flood .   floating on the sea of heads  as it were  was a circular canvas about ten feet across  of the sort that gets used to catch people who very wisely jump from burning buildings .  the four people carrying it were dr .  hicks and four other wizards  and it was at this point you would notice the chalked circle and the magic symbols .  in the middle of the portable magic circle sat professor flead  belaboring the wizards unsuccessfully with his ethereal staff .  they fetched up alongside the steps as the crowd ran onward .      i am sorry about this     panted hicks     it   s the only way we could get him here and he insisted  oh how he insisted           where   s the young lady .     flead shouted .  his voice was barely audible in the living daylight .  adora belle pushed her way through the policemen .      yes  professor flead .     she said .      i have found your answer .  i have spoken with several umnians .         i thought they all died thousands of years ago .         well  it is a department of necromancy     flead said .     but i must admit they were a wee bit indistinct  even for me .  can i have a kiss .  one kiss  one answer .      adora belle looked at moist .  he shrugged .  the day was totally beyond him .  he wasn   t flying anymore  he was simply being blown along by the gale .      all right     she said .     but no tongues .         tongues .     said flead sadly .     i wish .      there was the briefest of pecks  but the ghostly necromancer beamed .     wonderful     he said .     i feel at least a hundred years younger .         you have done the translations .     said adora belle .  and at that moment moist felt a vibration under foot .      what .  oh that     said flead .     it was those gold golems you were talking about           and another vibration  enough to cause a sense of unease in the bowels           although it turns out that the word in context doesn   t mean    gold    at all .  there are more than one hundred and twenty things it can mean  but in this case  taken in conjunction with the rest of the paragraph  it means    a thousand .         the street shook again .      four thousand golems  i think you   ll find     said flead cheerfully .     oh  and here they are now .          they came along the streets six abreast  wall to wall and ten feet high  water and mud cascading off of them .  the city echoed to their tread .   they did not trample people  but mere market stalls and coaches splintered under their massive feet .  they spread out as they moved  fanning out across the city  thundering down side streets  heading for the gates of ankh morpork  which were always open  because there was no point in discouraging customers .   and there were the horses  perhaps no more than a score in all the hurrying throng  saddles built into the clay of their backs  overtaking the two legged golems  and not a man watched but thought  where can i get one of those .  the rest of the golems marched on with the sound of thunder  heading out of the city .   one man shaped golem stopped in the middle of sator square  dropped on one knee  raised a fist as if in salute  and went still .  the horses halted beside it  as if awaiting riders .   and when the many walled city of ankh morpork had one more wall  out beyond the gates  they stopped .  as one  they raised their right hands in a fist .  shoulder to shoulder  ringing the city  the golems   guarded .  silence fell .   in sator square  commander vimes looked up at the poised fist and then at moist .      am i under arrest .     said moist meekly .   vimes sighed .     mr .  lipwig     he said     there   s no word for what you are .          the palace   s big ground floor council room was packed .  most people had to stand .  every guild  every interest group  and everyone who just wanted to say they had been there   was there .  the crowd overflowed into the palace grounds and out onto the streets .  children were climbing on the golem in the square  despite the efforts of the watchmen who were guarding it .   there was a large ax buried in the big table  moist noticed  the force of it had split the wood .  it had clearly been there for some time .  perhaps it was some kind of warning  or some kind of symbol .  this was a council of war  after all  but without the war .         however  we are already getting some very threatening notes from the other cities     said lord vetinari     so it is only a matter of time .         why .     said archchancellor ridcully of unseen university  who had managed to get a seat by dint of elevating its protesting occupant out of it .     all the things are doin    is standin    around outside the walls  yes .         quite so     said vetinari     and it   s called aggressive defense .  that is practically a declaration of war .     he gave a sad little sigh  the sign of a brain shifting down a gear .     may i remind you of the famous dictum of general tacticus     those who desire war  prepare for war    .  our city is surrounded by a wall of creatures each one of which  i gather  could only be stopped by a siege weapon .  miss dearheart     he paused to give adora belle a sharp little smile     has been kind enough to bring ankh morpork an army capable of conquering the world  although i   m happy to accept her assurance that she didn   t actually mean to .         then why don   t we .     said lord downey  head of the assassins    guild .      ah  lord downey .  yes  i thought someone would say that     said vetinari .     miss dearheart .  you have studied these golems .         i   ve had half an hour .     adora belle protested .     hopping on one foot  i might add .         nevertheless  you are our expert .  and you have had the assistance of the famously deceased professor flead .         he kept trying to see up my dress .         please  madam .         they have no chem that i can get at     said adora belle .     there   s no way of opening their heads .  as far as we can tell they have one overriding imperative  which is to defend the city .  and that   s all .  it   s actually carved into their clay .         nevertheless  there is such a thing as preemptive defense .  that might be construed as    guarding .     in your opinion  would they attack another city .         i don   t think so .  which city would you like me to test them on  my lord .     moist shuddered .  sometimes adora belle just didn   t care .      none     said vetinari .     we are not going to have another wretched empire while i am patrician .  we   ve only just got over the last one .  professor flead  have you been able to give them any instructions at all .      all heads turned to flead and his portable circle  which had remained near the door out of the sheer impossibility of struggling further into the room .      what .  no .  i am certain i have the gist of umnian  but i cannot make it move a step .  i have tried every likely command  to no avail .  it is most vexing .     he waved his staff at dr .  hicks .     come on  make yourself useful  you fellows .  one more try .         i think i might be able to communicate with them     said moist  staring at the ax  but his voice was lost in the disturbance as the grumbling students tried to manhandle the portable magic circle back through the crowded doorway .   let me just work out why  he thought .  yep   yep .  it   s actually   simple .  far too simple for a committee .      as    chairman of the  merchant   s    guild gentlemen may  i point out that these thing   s represent a valuable labor force in this    city       said mr .  robert parker .      no slaves in ankh morpork .     said adora belle  pointing a finger at vetinari .     you   ve always said that .      vetinari lifted an eyebrow at her .  then he held the eyebrow and raised her a further eyebrow .  but adora belle was unabashable .      miss dearheart  you have yourself explained that they have no chem .  you cannot free them .  i am ruling that they are tools  and since they regard themselves as servants of the city  i will treat them as such .     he raised both hands at the general uproar  and went on     they will not be sold and will be treated with care  as tools should be .  they will work for the good of the city and           no  that would be a terribly bad idea .     a white coat was struggling to get to the front of the crowd .  it was topped by a yellow rain hat .      and you are    .     said vetinari .   the figure removed its yellow hat  looked around  and went rigid .  a groan managed to escape from its mouth .      aren   t you hubert turvy .     said vetinari .  hubert   s face remained locked in a mask of terror  so vetinari  in a kinder tone  added     do you want some time to think about that last question .         i   only   just heard   about       hubert began .   hubert looked around at the hundreds of faces  and blinked .      mr .  turvy  the alchemist of money .     vetinari prompted .     it may be written down on your clothes somewhere .         i think i can assist here     said moist  and elbowed his way to the tongue tied economist .      hubert     he said  putting a hand on the man   s shoulder     all the people are here because they want to hear your amazing theory that demonstrates the inadvisability of putting these new golems to work .  you don   t want to disappoint them  do you .  i know you don   t meet many people  but everyone   s heard of your wonderful work .  can you help them understand what you just shouted .         we are agog     said lord vetinari .   in hubert   s head  the rising terror of crowds was overturned by the urge to impart knowledge to the ignorant  which meant everyone except him .  his hands grasped the lapels of his jacket .  he cleared his throat .      well  the problem is that  considered as a labor force  the golems are capable of doing the work per day of one hundred and twenty thousand men .         think of what they could do for the city .     said mr .  cowslick of the artificers    guild .      well  yes .  to begin with  they would put one hundred and twenty thousand men out of work     said hubert     but that would only be the start .  they do not require food  clothing or shelter .  most people spend their money on food  shelter  clothing  entertainment  and  not least  taxes .  what would these golems spend it on .  the demand for many things would drop and further unemployment would result .  you see  circulation is everything .  the money goes around  creating wealth as it goes .         you seem to be saying that these things could beggar us .     said vetinari .      there would be   difficult times     said hubert .      then what course of action do you propose  mr .  turvy .      hubert looked puzzled .     i don   t know  sir .  i didn   t know i had to find solutions as well .         any of the other cities would attack us if they had these golems     said lord downey     and surely we don   t have to think of their jobs  do we .  surely a little bit of conquest would be in order .         an empirette  perhaps .     said vetinari sourly .     we use our slaves to create more slaves .  but do we want to face the whole world in arms .  for that is what we would do  at the finish .  the best that we could hope for is that some of us would survive .  the worst is that we would triumph .  triumph and rot .  that is the lesson of history  lord downey .  are we not rich enough .      that started another clamor .   moist  unnoticed  pushed his way through the heaving crowd until he reached dr .  hicks and his crew  who were fighting their way back to the big golem .      can i come with you  please .     he said .     i want to try something .      hicks nodded  but while the portable circle was being dragged out in the street  he said     i think miss dearheart tried everything .  the professor was very impressed .         there   s something she didn   t try .  trust me .  talking of trust  who are these lads holding the blanket .         my students     said hicks  trying to keep the circle steady .      they want to study necro   er  postmortem communications .  why .         apparently it   s good for getting girls     sighed hicks .  there were sniggers .      in a necromancy department .  what kind of girls do they get .         no  it   s because when they graduate they get to wear the hooded black robe and the skull ring .  i think the term one of them used was    babe magnet .            but i thought wizards aren   t allowed to marry .         marriage .     said hicks .     oh  i don   t think they are concerned about that .         we never were in my day .     shouted flead  who was being shaken back and forth as the circle was dragged through the crowds .     can   t you blast some of these people with black fire  hicks .  you   re a necromancer  for the sake of the seven hells .  you are not supposed to be nice .  now that i can see what   s going on i think i shall have to spend a lot more time in the department .         could i have a quiet word .     whispered moist to hicks .     the lads can manage by themselves  can   t they .  tell them to catch up with us at the big golem .      he hurried on  and was not at all surprised to find hicks hurrying to catch up with him .  he pulled the not really a necromancer into the shelter of a doorway and said     do you trust your students .         are you mad .         it   s just that i have a little plan to save the day  the downside of which is that professor flead will no longer  alas  be available to you in your department .         by    unavailable    you mean    .         alas  you would never see him again     said moist .     i can tell that would be a blow .      hicks coughed .     oh dear .  he wouldn   t be able to come back at all .         i think not .         are you sure .     said hicks carefully .     no possibility .         i   m pretty sure .         hm .  well  of course  it would indeed be a blow .         a big blow .  a big blow     moist agreed .      i wouldn   t want him   hurt  of course .         anything but .  anything but     said moist  trying not to laugh .  we humans are good at this curly thinking  aren   t we  he thought .      and he has had a good innings  when all   s said and done .         two of them     said moist     when you come to think about it .         what do you want us to do .     said hicks  against the distant shouts of the ghostly professor berating the students .      there   s such a thing  i believe  as   an insorcism .         those .  we   re not allowed to do those .  they   re totally against university rules .         well  wearing the black robe and the skull ring has got to count for something  hasn   t it .  i mean  your predecessors would turn in their dark coffins if they thought you wouldn   t agree to the minor naughtiness i have in mind       and moist explained  in one simple sentence .   louder shouts and curses indicated that the portable circle was almost upon them .      well  doctor .     said moist .   a complex spectra of expressions chased one another across dr .  hicks   s face .      well  i suppose           yes  doctor .         well  it   d be like sending him to heaven  right .         exactly .  i couldn   t have put it better myself .         anyone could put it better than this bunch .     snapped flead  right behind him .     the department has really been allowed to go uphill since my day .  well  we shall see what we can do about that .         before you do  professor  i must speak to the golem     said moist .     can you translate for me .         can but won   t     snapped flead .      you tried to help miss dearheart just earlier on .         she is attractive .  why should i bequeath to you knowledge it took me a century to acquire .         because there   s fools back there who want to use these golems to start a war .         then that will reduce the number of fools .      in front of them now was the lone golem .  even kneeling  this one   s face was level with moist   s eyes .  the head turned to look blankly at him .  the guards around the golem  on the other hand  looked at moist with deep suspicion .      we are going to perform a little magic  officers     moist told them .   the corporal in charge looked as if this did not meet with his approval .      we   ve got to guard it     he pointed out  eyeing the black robes and the shimmering professor flead .      that   s fine  we can work around you     said moist .     do please stay .  i   m sure there   s not much risk .         risk .     said the corporal .      although perhaps it might be better it you fanned out to keep the public away     moist went on .     we would not want anything to happen to members of the public .  if  perhaps  you could push them back a hundred yards or so .         told to stay here     said the corporal  looking moist up and down .  he lowered his voice .     er  aren   t you the postmaster general .      moist recognized the look and the tone .  here we go        yes  indeed     he said .   the watchman lowered his voice still further .     so  er  do you by any chance have any of the blue           can   t help you there     said moist quickly  reaching into his pocket     but i do just happen to have here a couple of very rare   p green stamps with the highly amusing    misprint    that caused a bit of a stir last year  you may remember .  these are the only two left .  very collectible .      a small envelope appeared in his hand .  just as quickly  it vanished into the corporal   s pocket .      we can   t let anything happen to members of the public     he said     so i suggest we   d better keep them back a hundred yards or so .         good thinking     said moist .   a few minutes later  moist had the square to himself  the watchmen having worked out quite quickly that the further back from danger they pushed the public the further from said danger they  too  would be .   and now  moist thought  for the moment of truth .  if possible  though  it would become the moment of plausible lies  since most people were happier with them .   the umnian golems were bigger and heavier than the ones commonly seen around the town  but they were beautiful .  of course they were   they had probably been made by golems .  and their builders had given them what looked like muscles  and calm  sad faces .  in the last hour or so  in defiance of the watchmen  the lovable kids of the city had managed to scrawl a black mustache on this one .   o   kay .  now for the professor        tell me  professor  do you enjoy being dead .     he said .      enjoy .  how can anyone enjoy it  you fool .     said flead .      not much fun .         young man  the word fun is not applicable to existence beyond the grave     said flead .      and is that why you hang around the department .         yes .  it may be run by amateurs these days  but there   s always something going on .         certainly     said moist .     however  i   m wondering if someone of your   interests would not find them better served somewhere where there is always something coming off .         i do not understand your meaning .         tell me  professor  have you heard of the pink pussycat club .         no  i have not .  cats are not normally pink in these times  are they .         really .  well  let me tell you about the pink pussycat club     said moist .     excuse us  dr .  hicks .     he waved away hicks  who winked and led his students back to the crowd .  moist put his arm around the ghostly shoulders .  it was uncomfortable to hold it there with no actual shoulder to take the weight  but style was everything in these matters .   the watchers heard some urgent whispering pass to and fro  and then flead said     you mean it   s   smutty .      smut  thought moist .  he really is old .      oh  yes .  even  i might go so far as to say  suggestive .         do they show their   ankles .     said flead  his eyes gleaming .      ankles     said moist .     ye   yes  i rather think they do .     ye gods  he wondered  is he that old .      all the time .         twenty four hours a day .  they never clothe     said moist .     and sometimes they spin around a pole upside down .  take it from me  professor  for you  eternity might not be long enough .         and you just want a few words translated .         a small glossary of instructions .         and then i can go .         yes .         i have your word .         trust me .  i   ll just explain this to dr .  hicks .  he may take some persuading .      moist strolled over to the huddles of people who weren   t necromancers at all .  the postmortem communicator   s response was other than he expected .  second thoughts were arising .      i wonder if we   d be doing the right thing  setting him loose in a pole dancing establishment .     said hicks doubtfully .      no one will see him .  and he can   t touch .  they are very big on not touching in that place .  i   m told .         yes  i suppose all he can do is ogle the young ladies .     there was some sniggering from the students .      so .  they   re paid to be ogled at     said moist .     they are professional oglees .  it   s an ogling establishment .  for oglers .  and you heard what   s going on in the palace .  we could be at war in a day .  do you trust that lot .  trust me .         you use that phrase an awful lot  mr .  lipwig     said hicks .      well  i   m very trustworthy .  ready  then .  hold back until i summon you  and then you can take him to his last resting place .          there were people in the crowd  with sledgehammers .  you   d have a job to crack a golem if it didn   t want you to  but he ought to get them out of here as soon as possible .   this probably wouldn   t work .  it was too simple .  but adora belle had missed it  and so had flead .  the corporal now so bravely holding back the crowds wouldn   t have  because it was all about orders  but nobody had asked him .  you just had to think a little .      come on  young man     said flead  still where his bearers had left him and backed away .     let   s get on with it  shall we .      moist took a deep breath .      tell me how to say     trust me  and only me .  form ranks of four and march ten miles hubward of the city .  walk slowly        he said .      hee  hee .  you are a sharp one  mr .  lipstick .     said flead  his mind full of ankles .     but it won   t work  you know .  we tried things like that .         i can be very persuasive .         it won   t work  i tell you .  i have found not one single word that they will react to .         well  professor  it   s not what you say  it   s the way that you say it  isn   t it .  sooner or later it   s all about style .         hah .  you are a fool  man .         i thought we had a deal  professor .  and i shall want a number of other phrases .     he looked around at the golem horses  as still as statues .     and the one phrase i shall need is the equivalent of    giddyup    and while i think of it i shall need    whoa     too .  or do you want to go back to the place where they   ve never heard of pole dancing .          chapter        the golems go true worth at work  servants of a higher truth back in trouble again the beautiful butterfly the insanity of vetinari mr .  bent wakes up mysterious requirements      things were getting heated in the conference room .  this  to lord vetinari  was not a problem .  he was a great believer in letting a thousand voices be heard  because this meant that all he actually needed to do was listen only to the ones that had anything useful to say     useful    in this case being defined in the classic civil service way as    inclining to my point of view .     in his experience  it was a number generally smaller than ten .  the people who wanted a thousand  etc .   really meant that they wanted their own voice to be heard while the other nine hundred ninety nine were ignored  and for this purpose the gods had invented the committee .  vetinari was very good at committees  especially when drumknott took the minutes .  what the iron maiden was to stupid tyrants  the committee was to lord vetinari  it was only slightly more expensive  far less messy  considerably more efficient  and  best of all  you had to force people to climb inside the iron maiden .   he was just about to appoint the ten noisiest people onto a golem committee that could be locked in a distant office  when a dark clerk appeared  apparently out of a shadow  and whispered something in drumknott   s ear .  the secretary leaned down toward his master .      ah  it would seem that the golems are gone     said vetinari cheerfully  as the dutiful drumknott stepped back .      gone .     said adora belle  trying to see across to the window .     what do you mean  gone .         not here anymore     said vetinari .     mr .  lipwig  it seems  has taken them away .  they are leaving the vicinity of the city in an orderly fashion .         but he can   t do that .     lord downey was enraged .     we haven   t decided what to do with them yet .         he  however  has     said lord vetinari  beaming .      he shouldn   t be allowed to leave the city .  he is a bank robber .  commander vimes  do your duty and arrest him .     this was from cosmo .   vimes   s look would have frozen a saner man .      i doubt if he   s going far  sir     he said .     what do you wish me to do  your lordship .         well  the ingenious mr .  lipwig appears to have a purpose     said vetinari     so perhaps we should go and find out what it is .      the crowd made for the door  where it got stuck and fought itself .   as it piled out into the street  vetinari put his hands behind his head and leaned back with his eyes shut .     i love democracy .  i could listen to it all day .  get the coach out  will you  drumknott .         that is being done at this moment  sir .         did you put him up to this .      vetinari opened his eyes .     miss dearheart  always a pleasure     he murmured  waving away the smoke .     i thought you were gone .  imagine my delight at finding you are not .         well  did you .     said adora belle  her cigarette noticeably shortening as she took another drag .  she smoked as if it were a kind of warfare .      miss dearheart  i believe it would be impossible for me to put moist von lipwig up to anything that could be more dangerous than the things he finds to do of his own free will .  while you were away  he took to climbing high buildings for fun  picked every lock in the post office  and took up with the extreme sneezing fraternity  who are frankly insane .  he needs the heady whiff of danger to make his life worth living .         he never does that sort of thing when i   m here .         indeed .  can i invite you to ride with me .         what did you mean by saying    indeed    like that .     said adora belle suspiciously .   vetinari raised an eyebrow .     by now  if i have been adept at judging the way your fianc   thinks  we should be going to see an enormous hole            we   re going to need stone  thought moist as the golems dug .  lots of stone .  can they make mortar .  of course they can .  they   re the lancre army knife of tools .   it was fearful  the way they could dig  even in this worn out  hopeless soil .  dirt was fountaining into the air .  half a mile away  the old wizarding tower  a landmark on the road to sto lat  brooded over an area of scrub and desolation that was unusual on the heavily farmed plains .  a lot of magic had been used here once .  plants grew twisty or not at all .  the owls that haunted the ruins made sure their meals came from a distance away .  it was the perfect site .  no one wanted it .  it was a wasteland  and a wasteland shouldn   t be allowed to go to waste .   what a weapon  he thought  as his golem horse circled the diggers .  they could collapse a city in a day .  what a terrible force they would be in the wrong hands .   thank goodness they are in mine     the crowd was keeping its distance  but was also getting bigger and bigger .  the city had turned out to watch .  to be a true citizen of ankh morpork was to never miss a show .  as for mr .  fusspot  he was apparently having the time of his life standing on the horse   s head .  there   s nothing a small dog likes more than a high place from which to yap madly at people   no  actually  there was  and the chairman had managed to wedge his toy between a clay ear and his paw  and stopped barking to growl every time moist made a tentative grab at it .      mr .  lipwig .      he looked around to see sacharissa hurrying toward him  waving her notebook .  how does she do it .  he wondered  watching her as  dirt raining around her  she scurried past lines of digging golems .  she   s even here before the watch .      you have a golem horse  i see     she shouted as she reached him .     it looks beautiful .         it   s rather like riding a flowerpot that you can   t steer     moist yelled to make himself heard over the noise .     the saddle could use some padding  too .  good  though  aren   t they .  notice how they keep shifting all the time  just like the real thing .         and why are the golems burying themselves .         i ordered them to .         but they are immensely valuable .         yes .  so we should keep them safe  right .         but they belong to the city .         they were taking up a lot of room  don   t you think .  i   m not claiming them  in any case .         they could do wonderful things for the city  couldn   t they .     more people were arriving now and gravitating toward the man in the golden suit  because he was always good value for money .      like embroil it in a war or create an army of beggars .  my way   s better .         i   m sure you are going to tell us what it is .     shouted sacharissa .      i want to base the currency on them .  i want to make them into money .  gold that guards itself .  you can   t fake it .         you want to put us on the golem standard .         certainly .  look at them .  how much are they worth .     shouted moist  as his horse reared very convincingly .     they could build canals and dam floods  level mountains and make roads .  if we need them to  they will .  and if we don   t  then they   ll help to make us rich by doing nothing .  the dollar will be so sound you could bounce trolls off of it .      the horse  with an astonishing grasp of public relations  reared again as moist pointed at the laboring masses .      that is value .  that is worth .  what is the worth of a gold coin compared to the dexterity of the hand that holds it .     he replayed that line in his head and added     that would make a good headline on page one  don   t you think .  and it   s lipwig with a g .      sacharissa laughed .     page one is already crowded .  what   s going to happen to these things .         they   ll stay here until cool heads decide what to do next .         and what are they guarding the city from right now  exactly .         stupidity .         one last thing  moist .  you are the only one who knows the secret of the golems  yes .         inexplicably  this seems to be the case .         why is this .         i suppose i   m just a very persuasive person .     this got another laugh .      who just happens to command a huge  unstoppable army .  what demands are you going to make .         none .  no  on second thought  a coffee would be nice .  i didn   t have any breakfast .     that got a much bigger laugh from the crowd .      and do you think the citizens should be glad it   s you in the saddle  as it were .         hell  yes .  trust me .     said moist  dismounting and lifting a reluctant mr .  fusspot down from his perch .      well  you should know about that  mr .  lipwig .     this got a round of applause .     you wouldn   t care to tell us what happened to the gold from the bank  would you .            es wearin    it .     shouted a wag in the crowd  to cheering .      miss cripslock  your cynicism is  as ever  a dagger to my heart .     said moist .     i intended to get to the bottom of that today  but    best laid plans    and all that .  i just don   t seem to be able to clear my desk .      even this got a laugh  and it wasn   t really very funny .      mr .  lipwig .  i want you to come with me        commander vimes shoved his way through the crowd  with other watchmen materializing behind him .      am i under arrest .     said moist .      hell  yes .  you did leave the city .         i think he could successfully argue  commander  that the city has come with him .      all heads turned .  a path cleared itself for lord vetinari  as paths do for men known to have dungeons in their basement .  and adora belle hobbled past him  threw herself at moist  and started beating on his chest  shouting     how did you get through to them .  how did you make them understand .  tell me or i   ll never promise to marry you again .         what are your intentions  mr .  lipwig .     said vetinari .      i was planning to hand them over to the golem trust  sir     said moist  fending off adora belle as gently as possible .      you were .         but not the golem horses  sir .  i   ll bet they are faster than any flesh and blood creatures .  there are nineteen of them  and if you   ll take my advice  sir  you   ll give one to the king of the dwarfs  because i imagine he   s a bit angry right now .  it   s up to you what you do with the others .  but i   d like to ask for half a dozen of them for the post offce .  in the meantime  the rest of them will be safe under ground .  i want them to be the basis of the currency  because           yes  i couldn   t help overhearing     said vetinari .     well done  mr .  lipwig  i can see you   ve been thinking about this .  you have presented us with a sensible way forward  indeed .  i have also been giving the situation much thought  and all that remains is for me           oh  no thanks are necessary              to say     arrest this man  commander .     be so good as to handcuff him to a sturdy officer and put him in my coach .         what .     said moist .      what .     screamed adora belle .      the directors of the royal bank are pressing charges of embezzlement against you and the chairman  mr .  lipwig .     vetinari reached down and picked up mr .  fusspot by the scruff of his neck .  the little dog swung gently back and forth in the patrician   s grasp  wide eyes open wider in terror  his toy vibrating apologetically in his mouth .      you can   t seriously blame him for anything     moist protested .      alas  he is the chairman  mr .  lipwig .  his pawprints are on the documents .         how can you do this to moist after what   s just happened .     said adora belle .     hasn   t he just saved the day .         possibly  although i   m not sure whom he has saved it for .  the law must be obeyed  miss dearheart .  even tyrants have to obey the law .     he paused  looking thoughtful  and continued     no  i tell a lie  tyrants do not have to obey the law  obviously  but they do have to observe the niceties .  at least  i do .         but he didn   t take       adora belle began .      nine o   clock tomorrow  in the great hall     said vetinari .     i invite all interested parties to attend .  we shall get to the bottom of this .     he raised his voice .     are there any directors of the royal bank here .  ah  mr .  lavish .  are you well .      cosmo lavish  walking unsteadily  pushed his way through the crowd  supported on one side by a young man in a brown robe .      you have had him arrested .     said cosmo .      one uncontested fact is that mr .  lipwig  on behalf of mr .  fusspot  did formally take responsibility for the gold .         indeed he did     said cosmo  glaring at moist .      but in the circumstances i feel i should look into all aspects of the situation .         we are in agreement there     said cosmo .      and to that end i am arranging for my clerks to enter the bank tonight and examine its records     vetinari went on .      i cannot agree to your request     said cosmo .      fortuitously  it was not a request .     lord vetinari tucked mr .  fusspot under his arm  and continued     i have the chairman with me  you see .  commander vimes  mr .  lipwig into my coach  please .  see that miss dearheart is escorted safely home  will you .  we shall sort this out tomorrow .      vetinari looked at the tower of dust that now enveloped the industrious golems  and added     we   ve all had a very busy day .          out in the back alley behind the pink pussycat club the insistent  pumping music was muffled but still pervasive .   dark figures lurked        mr .  hicks  sir .      the head of the department of postmortem communications paused in the act of drawing a complicated rune among the rather less complex everyday graffiti and looked up at the concerned face of his student .      yes .  barnsforth .         is this exactly legal under college rules  sir .         of course not .  think of what might happen if this sort of thing fell into the wrong hands .  hold the lantern higher  goatly  we   re losing the light .         and whose hands would that be  sir .         well  technically ours  as a matter of fact .  but it   s perfectly all right if the council don   t find out .  and they won   t  of course .  they know better than to go around finding things out .         so it is illegal  technically .         well now     said hicks  drawing a glyph which flamed blue for a moment     who among us  when you get right down to it  can say what is right and what is wrong .         the college council  sir .     said barnsforth .   hicks threw down the chalk and straightened up .      now listen to me  you four .  we are going to insorcise flead  understand .  to his eternal satisfaction and the not inconsiderable good of the department  believe me .  this is a difficult ritual but if you assist me you   ll be doctors of postmortem communication by the end of the term  understand .  straight a   s for the lot of you and  of course  the skull ring .  since you have so far managed to turn in one third of an essay between you  i would say that is a bargain  wouldn   t you  barnsforth .      the student blinked in the force of the question  but natural talent came to his aid .  he coughed in a curiously academic way  and said     i think i understand you  sir .  what we are doing here goes beyond mundane definitions of right and wrong  does it not .  we serve a higher truth .         well done  barnsforth  you will go a long way .  everyone got that .  higher truth .  good .  now let   s decant the old bugger and get out of here before anyone catches us .          a troll officer in a coach is hard to ignore .  he just looms .  that was vimes   s little joke  perhaps .  sergeant detritus sat beside moist  effectively clamping him into his seat .  lord vetinari and drumknott sat opposite  his lordship with his hands crossed on the silver tipped cane and his chin resting on his hands .  he watched moist intently .  under vetinari   s seat  mr .  fusspot buzzed .   there was a rumor that the sword in the stick was made with the iron taken from the blood of a thousand men .  it seemed a waste  thought moist  when for a bit of extra work you could get enough to make a ploughshare .  who made up these things  anyway .   but with vetinari  it seemed possible  if a bit messy .      look  if you let cosmo       he began .      pas devant le gendarme     said lord vetinari .      dat mean no talkin    in front o    me     sergeant detritus supplied helpfully .      then can we talk about angels .     said moist  after a period of silence .      no we can   t .  mr .  lipwig  you appear to be the only person able to command the biggest army since the days of the empire .  do you think that is a good idea .         i didn   t want to .  i just worked out how to do it .         you know  mr .  lipwig  killing you right now would solve an incredibly large number of problems .         i didn   t intend this .  well   not exactly like this .         we didn   t intend the empire .  it just became a bad habit .  so  mr .  lipwig  now that you have your golems  what else do you intend to do with them .         put one in to power every clacks tower .  the donkey treadmills have never worked properly .  the other cities can   t object to that .  it will be a boon to ma   to peoplekind and the donkeys won   t object  i expect .         that will account for a few hundred  perhaps .  and the rest .         i intend to turn them into gold  sir .  and i think it will solve all our problems .      lord vetinari raised a quizzical eyebrow .     all our problems .          the pain was breaking through again  but somehow reassuring .  he was becoming vetinari  certainly .  the pain was good .  it was a good pain  concentrated  it helped him think .   right now  cosmo was thinking that pucci really should have been strangled at birth  which family folklore said he had been trying to do .  everything about her was annoying .  she was selfish  arrogant  greedy  vain  headstrong  and totally lacking in tact and the slightest amount of introspection .   those were not  within the clan  considered to be drawbacks in a person  one could hardly stay rich if one bothered all the time about whether what one was doing was wrong or right .  but pucci thought she was beautiful  and that grated on his nerves .  she did have good hair  that was true  but those high heels .  she looked like a tethered balloon .  the only reason she had any figure at all was because of the wonders of corsetry .  and  while he   d heard that fat girls had lovely personalities  she just had a lot  and all of it was lavish .   on the other hand  she was his age and at least had ambition and a wonderful gift for hatred .  she wasn   t lazy like the rest of them .  they spent their lives huddled around the money .  they had no vision .  pucci was someone he could talk to .  she saw things from a softer  female perspective .      you should have bent killed     she said .     i   m sure he knows something .  let   s hang him from one of the bridges by his ankles .  that   s what granddaddy used to do .  why are you still wearing that glove .         he   s been a loyal servant of the bank     said cosmo  ignoring the last remark .      well .  what   s that got to do with it .  is there still something wrong with your hand .         my hand is fine     said cosmo  as another red rose of pain bloomed all the way to his shoulder .  i   m so close  he thought .  so close .  vetinari thinks he has me  but i have him .  oh  yes .  nevertheless   perhaps it was time to start tidying up .      i will send cranberry to see mr .  bent tonight     he said .     the man is no further use now that i have cribbins .         good .  and then lipsbig will go to prison and we   ll get our bank back .  you don   t look well  you know .  you are very pale .         as pale as vetinari .     said cosmo  pointing at the painting .      what .  what are you talking about .  don   t be silly     said pucci .     and there   s a funny smell in here  too .  has something died .         my thoughts are unclouded .  tomorrow will be vetinari   s last day as patrician  i assure you .         you   re being silly again .  and ever so sweaty  i might add     said pucci .     honestly  it   s dripping off your chin .  pull yourself together .         i imagine the caterpillar feels it is dying when it begins to turn into a beautiful butterfly     said cosmo dreamily .      what .  what .  who knows .  what   s that got to do with anything .     pucci demanded .     that   s not how it works in any case  because  listen  this is very interesting  the caterpillar dies  right  and goes all mushy  and then a tiny bit of it  like a kidney or something  suddenly wakes up and eats the caterpillar soup  and that   s what comes out as the butterfly .  it   s a wonder of nature .  you   ve just got a touch of flu .  don   t be a big baby .  i have a date .  see you in the morning .      she flounced out  leaving cosmo alone except for cranberry  who was reading in the corner .   it occurred to cosmo that he really knew very little about the man .  as vetinari  of course  he would soon know everything about everybody .      you were at the assassins    school  weren   t you  cranberry .     he said .   cranberry took the little silver bookmark from his top pocket  placed it carefully on the page  and closed the book .      yes  sir .  scholarship boy .         oh  yes .  i remember them  scuttling about all the time .  they tended to get bullied .         yes  sir .  some of us survived .         never bullied you  did i .         no  sir .  i would have remembered .         that   s good .  that   s good .  what is your first name  cranberry .         don   t know  sir .  foundling .         how sad .  your life must have been very hard .         yes  sir .         the world can be so very harsh at times .         yes  sir .         will you be so good as to kill mr .  bent tonight .         i have made a mental note  sir .  i will take an associate and undertake the task an hour before dawn .  most of mrs .  cake   s lodgers will be out at that time and the fog will be thickest .  fortuitously  mrs .  cake is staying with her old friend mrs .  harms beetle in welcome soap tonight .  i checked earlier  having anticipated this eventuality .         you are a craftsman  cranberry .  i salute you .         thank you  sir .         have you seen heretofore anywhere .         no  sir .         i wonder where he   s got to .  now go off and have your supper  anyway .  i will not be dining tonight .      tomorrow i will change     he said aloud  when the door had shut behind cranberry .   he reached down and drew the sword .  it was a thing of beauty .   in the picture opposite  lord vetinari raised an eyebrow and said     tomorrow you will be a beautiful butterfly .      cosmo smiled .  he was nearly there .  vetinari had gone completely mad .       mr .  bent opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling .   after a few seconds  this uninspiring view was replaced by an enormous nose  with the rest of a worried face some distance beyond it .      you   re awake .      mr .  bent blinked and refocused and looked up at miss drapes  a shadow against the lamplight .      you had a bit of a funny turn  mr .  bent     she said in the slow  careful voice people use for talking to mental patients  the elderly  and the dangerously armed .      a funny turn .  i did something funny .     he raised his head from the pillow  and sniffed .      you are wearing a necklace of garlic  miss drapes .     he said .      it   s   a precaution     said miss drapes  looking guilty     against   colds   yes  colds .  you can   t be too careful .  how do you feel  in yourself .      mr .  bent hesitated .  he wasn   t certain how he felt .  he wasn   t certain who he was .  there seemed to be a hole inside .  there was no himself in himself .      what has been happening  miss drapes .         oh  you don   t want to worry about all that     said miss drapes  with fragile cheerfulness .      i believe i do  miss drapes .         the doctor said you weren   t to get excited  mr .  bent .         i  to the best of my knowledge  have never been excited in my life  miss drapes .      the woman nodded .  alas  the statement was so easy to believe .      well  you know mr .  lipwig .  they say he stole all the gold out of the vault .  the           story unfolded .  it was  in many places  speculations  both new and secondhand  and because miss drapes was a regular reader of the tanty bugle  it was recounted in the style and language in which tales of    orrible murder are discussed .   what shocked her was the way the man just lay there .  once or twice he asked her to go back over a detail  but his expression never changed .  she tried to add excitement  she painted the walls with exclamation marks  and he did not budge .         and now he   s banging up in the tanty     miss drapes said .     they say he will be hang  d by the neck until dead .  i think hang  d is worse than just being hanged .         but they cannot find the gold       whispered mavolio bent  leaning back against the pillow .      that   s right .  some say it has been spirited away by dire accomplices .     said miss drapes .     they say informations have been laid against him by mr .  lavish .         i am a damned man  miss drapes  judged and damned     said mr .  bent  staring at the wall .      you  mr .  bent .  that   s no way to talk .  you  who   ve never made a mistake .         but i have sinned .  oh  indeed i have .  i have worshiped false idols .         well  sometimes you can   t get real ones     said miss drapes  patting his hand and wondering if she should call someone .     look  if you want absolution  i understand the ionians are doing two sins for one this week           it   s caught me     he whispered .     oh dear  miss drapes .  there is something rising inside that wants to get out .         don   t you worry  we   ve got a bucket     said miss drapes .      no .  you should go  now .  this will be horrible .         i   m not going anywhere  mr .  bent     said miss drapes  a study in determination .     you   re just having a funny turn  that   s all .         ha     said mr .  bent .     ha   ha   haha       the laugh climbed up his throat like something from the crypt .   his skinny body went rigid and arced as if it was rising from the mattress .  miss drapes flung herself across the bed  but she was too late .  the man   s hand rose  trembling  and extended a finger toward the wardrobe .      here we are again .     bent screamed .   the lock clicked .  the doors swung open .   in the cupboard was a pile of ledgers and something   shrouded .  mr .  bent opened his eyes and looked up into those of miss drapes .      i brought it with me     he said  as if talking to himself .     i hated it so much but i brought it with me .  why .  who runs the circus .      miss drapes was silent .  all she knew was that she was going to follow this to the end .  after all  she   d spent the night in a man   s bedroom  and lady deirdre waggon had a lot to say about that .  she was technically a ruined woman  which seemed unfair given that  even more technically  she wasn   t .   she watched as mr .  bent   changed .  he had the decency to do so with his back turned  but she closed her eyes anyway .  then she remembered that she was ruined  and so there wasn   t much point  was there .   she opened them again .      miss drapes .     said mr .  bent dreamily .      yes  mr .  bent .     she said through chattering teeth .      we need to find   a bakery .      cranberry and his associate stepped into the room  and stopped dead .  this was not according to the plan .      and possibly a ladder     said mr .  bent .  he pulled a strip of pink rubber from his pocket  and bowed .       chapter        no help from on high drumknott reports a possible jape mr .  fusspot takes the stage strange things in the air the return of mr .  bent    look out  he   s got a daisy .     pucci   s big moment cosmo needs a hand      there was clean straw in moist   s cell and he was pretty certain no one had gobbed in the stirabout  which contained what  if you were forced to name it  you would have to concede was meat .  news had somehow got around that moist was the reason that bellyster was no longer on the staff .  even his fellow screws had hated the bullying bastard  so moist also got a second helping without asking  his shoes cleaned  and a complimentary copy of the times in the morning .   the marching golems had forced the bank   s troubles onto page five .  the golems were all over the front page  and a lot of the inner pages were full of vox pops  which meant people in the street who didn   t know anything told other people what they knew  and lengthy articles by people who also didn   t know anything but could say it very elegantly in       words .   he was just staring at the crossword puzzle when someone knocked very politely on the cell door .  it was the warden  who hoped mr .  lipwig had enjoyed his brief stay with them  would like to show him to his carriage  and looked forward to the pleasure of his custom again should there be any further temporary doubts about his honesty .  in the meantime  he would be grateful if mr .  lipwig would be kind enough to wear these lightweight manacles  for the look of the thing  and when they were taken off him  as they surely would be when his character was proved to be spotless  would he please remind the officer in charge that they were prison property  thank you very much .   there was a crowd outside the prison  but they were standing back from the large golem which  down on one knee and with fist thrust into the air  was waiting outside the gate .  it had turned up last night and if mr .  lipwig could see his way clear to getting it to move  said the warden  everyone would be most appreciative .   moist tried to look as though he   d expected it .  he had told black mustache to await further orders .  he hadn   t expected this .   in fact  it stomped after the coach all the way to the palace .  there were a lot of watchmen lining the route and there seemed to be a black clad figure on every rooftop .  it looked as though vetinari was not taking any chances on him escaping .  there were more guards waiting in the back courtyard   more than was efficient  moist could tell  since it can be easier for a swift thinking man to get away from twenty men than from five .  but somebody was making a statement .  it didn   t matter what it was  so long as it looked impressive .   he was led by dark passages into the sudden light of the great hall  which was packed .  there was a smattering of applause  one or two cheers  and a ringing series of    boo    s from pucci  who was sitting next to her brother in the front row of the big block of seats .  moist was led to a small podium  which was going to serve as a dock  where he could look around at the guild leaders  senior wizards  important priests  and members of the great and the good  or at least the big and the noisy .  there was harry king  grinning at him  and the cloud of smoke that indicated the presence of adora belle  and   oh yes  the new high priestess of anoia  her crown of bent spoons all shiny  her ceremonial ladle held stiffly  her face rigid with nerves and importance .  you owe me  girl  moist thought     cos a year ago you had to work in a bar in the evenings to make a living and anoia was just one of half a dozen demigoddesses who shared an altar  which  let   s face it  was your kitchen table with a cloth on it .  what   s one little miracle compared to that .   there was a whisking of cloth and suddenly lord vetinari was in his seat  with drumknott by his side .  the buzz of conversation ceased  as the patrician looked around the hall .      thank you for coming  ladies and gentlemen     he said .     let us get on  shall we .  this is not a court of law  as such .  it is a court of inquiry  which i have convened to look into the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of ten tons of gold bullion from the royal bank of ankh morpork .  the good name of the bank has been called into question  and so we will consider all matters apparently pertaining to it           no matter where they lead .         indeed  mr .  cosmo lavish  no matter where they lead .         we have your assurance on this .     cosmo insisted .      i believe i have already given it  mr .  lavish .  can we proceed .  i have appointed the learned mr .  slant  of morecombe  slant and honeyplace  as counsel to the inquiry .  he will examine and cross examine as he sees fit .  i think it is known to all that mr .  slant commands the total respect of ankh morpork   s legal profession .      mr .  slant bowed to vetinari and let his steady gaze take in the rest of the room .  it lingered a long time on the ranks of the lavishes .      first  the matter of the gold     said vetinari .     i present drumknott  my secretary and chief clerk  who overnight took a team of my senior clerks into the bank           am i in the dock here .     said moist .   vetinari glanced at him and looked down at his paperwork .     i have here your signature on a receipt for some ten tons of gold     he said .     do you dispute its authenticity .         no but i thought that was just a formality .     said moist .      ten tons of gold is a formality  is it .  and did you later break into the vault .         well  yes  technically .  i couldn   t unlock it because mr .  bent had fainted inside and left the key in the lock .         ah  yes  mr .  bent  the chief cashier .  is he with us today .      a quick survey found the room bentless .      i understood that he was in a somewhat distressed state but not seriously harmed     said lord vetinari .     commander vimes  please be so good as to send some men along to his lodgings  will you .  i would like him to join us .      he turned back to moist .     no  mr .  lipwig  you are not on trial  as yet .  generally speaking  before someone is put on trial it helps to have some clear reason for doing so .  it is considered neater .  i must point out  though  that you took formal responsibility for the gold which  we must assume  was clearly gold and clearly in the vault at that time .  in order to have a thorough understanding of the bank   s disposition at this time i asked my secretary to audit the bank   s affairs  which he and his team did last nigh           if i   m not actually on trial at this moment can i get rid of these shackles .  they do rather bias the case against me     said moist .      yes  very well .  guards  see to it .  now mr .  drumknott  if you please .      i   m going to be hung out to dry  thought moist  as drumknott started speaking .  what is vetinari playing at .   he stared at the crowds as drumknott went through the tedious litany of accountancy .  right in front  in a great black mass  was the lavish family .  from here  they looked like vultures .  this was going to take a long time  by the sound of drumknott   s earnest drone .  they were going to set him up  and vetinari was   ah  yes  and then it would be  in some quiet room     mr .  lipwig  if you could see your way clear to telling me how you controlled those golems        a commotion near the door came as a welcome respite and now sergeant fred colon  trailed by his inseparable associate nobby nobbs  was practically swimming through the crowd .  vimes pushed his way toward them  with sacharissa drifting in his wake .  there was a hurried conversation  and a ripple of horrified excitement rolled through the crowd .   moist caught the word murdered .   vetinari stood up and brought his stick down flat on the table  ending the noise like the punctuation of the gods .      what has happened  commander .     he said .      bodies  sir .  in mr .  bent   s lodgings .         he   s been murdered .         nossir .     vimes conferred briefly and urgently with his sergeant .     body provisionally identified as professor cranberry  sir  not a real professor  he   s a nasty hired killer who likes reading .  we thought he   d left the city .  sounds like the other one is ribcage jack  who was kicked to death       there was another whispered briefing  but commander vimes tended to raise his voice when he was angry       by a what .  on the second floor .  don   t be daft .  so what got cranberry .  eh .  did you just say what i thought you said .      he straightened up .     sorry  sir  i   m going to have to go and see this for myself .  i think someone is having a jape .         and poor bent .     said vetinari .      no sign of him  sir .         thank you  commander .     vetinari waved a hand .     do hurry back when you know more .  we cannot have japes .  thank you  drumknott .  i gather you found nothing untoward apart from the lack of gold .  i   m sure that comes as a relief to us all .  the floor is yours  mr .  slant .      the lawyer arose with an air of dignity and mothballs .      tell me  mr .  lipwig  what was your job before you came to ankh morpork .     he said .   o   kay  thought moist  looking at vetinari  i   ve worked it out .  if i   m good and say the right things  i might live .  at a price .  well  no thanks .  all i wanted to do was make some money .      your job  mr .  lipwig .     slant repeated .   moist looked along the rows of watchers  and saw the face of cribbins .  the man winked .      hmm .     he said .      i asked you what your job was before you arrived in this city .      it was at this point that moist became aware of a regrettably familiar whirring sound  and from his raised position he was the first to see the chairman of the royal bank appear from behind the curtains at the far end of the hall with his wonderful new toy clamped firmly in his mouth .  some trick of the vibrations was propelling mr .  fusspot backward across the shiny marble .   people in the audience craned their necks as  with tail wagging  the little dog passed behind vetinari   s chair and disappeared behind the curtains on the opposite side .   i   m in a world where that just happened  moist thought .  nothing matters .  it was an insight of incredibly wonderful liberation .      mr .  lipwig  i asked you a question     slant growled .      oh  sorry .  i was a crook .       and he flew .  this was it .  this was better than hanging off some old building .  look at the expression on cosmo   s face .  look at cribbins .  they had it all planned out  and now it had got away from them .  he had them all in his hand  and he was flying .   slant hesitated .      by    crook    you mean           confidence trickster .  occasional forgery .  i   d like to think i was more of a scallywag  to be frank .      moist saw the looks that passed between cosmo and cribbins  and exulted within .  no  this wasn   t supposed to happen  was it .  and now you   re going to have to run to keep up     mr .  slant was certainly having trouble in that area .      can i be clear here .  you broke the law for a living .         mostly i took advantage of other people   s greed  mr .  slant .  i think there was an element of education  too .      mr .  slant shook his head in amazement  causing an earwig to fall  with a keen sense of the appropriate  out of his ear .      education .     he said .      yes .  a lot of people learned that no one sells a real diamond ring for one tenth of its value .         and then you stepped into one of the highest public offices in the city .     said mr .  slant  above the laughter .  it was a release .  people had been holding their breath for too long .      i had to .  it was that or be hanged     said moist  and added     again .      mr .  slant looked flustered  and turned his eyes to vetinari .      are you sure you wish me to continue  my lord .         oh yes     said vetinari .     to the death  mr .  slant .         er   you have been hanged before .     slant said to moist .      oh  yes .  i did not wish it to become a habit .      that got another laugh .   mr .  slant turned again to vetinari  who was smiling faintly .      is this true  my lord .         indeed     said vetinari calmly .     mr .  lipwig was hanged last year under the name of albert spangler  but it turned out that he had a very tough neck  as was found when he was being placed in his coffin .  you may be aware  mr .  slant  of the ancient principle quia ego sic dico .  a man who survives being hanged may have been selected by the gods for a different destiny  as yet unfulfilled .  and since fortune had favored him  i resolved to put him on parole and charge him with resurrecting the post office  a task which had already taken the lives of four of my clerks .  if he succeeded  well and good .  if he failed  the city would have been spared the cost of another hanging .  it was a cruel joke which  i am happy to say  rebounded to the general good .  i don   t think that anyone here would argue that the post office is now a veritable jewel of the city .  indeed  the leopard can change his shorts .      mr .  slant nodded automatically  remembered himself  and fumbled with his notes .  he had lost his place .      and now we come to  er  the matter of the bank           mrs .  lavish  a lady many of us were privileged to know  recently confided in me that she was dying     said vetinari .     she asked me for advice on the future of the bank  given that her obvious heirs were  in her words     as nasty a bunch of weasels as you could ever hope not to meet           all thirty one of the lavish lawyers stood up and spoke at once  incurring a total cost to their clients of  am    .   p .   mr .  slant glared at them .   mr .  slant did not  despite what had been said  have the respect of ankh morpork   s legal profession .  he commanded its fear .  death had not diminished his encyclopedic memory  his guile  his talent for corkscrew reasoning  and the vitriol of his stare .  do not cross me this day  it advised the lawyers .  do not cross me  for if you do i will have the flesh from your very bones and the marrow therein .  you know those leather bound tomes you have on the wall behind your desk to impress your clients .  i have read them all  and i wrote half of them .  do not try me .  i am not in a good mood .   one by one  they sat down .      if i may continue .     said vetinari .     i understand that mrs .  lavish subsequently interviewed mr .  lipwig and considered that he would be a superb chairman in the very best traditions of the lavish family and the ideal guardian for the dog mr .  fusspot  who is  by the custom of the bank  its chairman .      cosmo rose slowly to his feet and stepped out into the center of the floor .     l object most strongly to the suggestion that this scoundrel is in the best traditions of my       he began .  mr .  slant was on his feet as though propelled by a spring .  quick as he was  moist was faster .      i object .     he said .      how do you dare object     cosmo spat     when you have admitted to being an arrogant scofflaw .         i object to lord vetinari   s allegation that i have had anything to do with the fine traditions of the lavish family     said moist  staring into eyes that now seemed to be weeping green tears .     for example  i have never been a pirate or traded in slaves        there was a great rising of lawyers .   mr .  slant glared .  there was a great seating .      they admit it     said moist .     it   s in the bank   s own official history .         that is correct  mr .  slant     said vetinari .     i have read it .  volenti non fit injuria clearly applies .      the whirring started again .  mr .  fusspot was coming back the other way .  moist forced himself not to look .      oh  this is low indeed .     snarled cosmo .     whose history could withstand this type of malice .      moist raised a hand .     oooh  oooh  i know this one .     he said .     mine can .  the worst i ever did was rob people who thought they were robbing me  but i never used violence and i gave it all back .  okay  i robbed a couple of banks  well  defrauded  really  but only because they made it so easy           gave it back .     said slant  looking for some kind of response from vetinari .  but the patrician was staring over the heads of the crowd  who were almost all engrossed in the transit of mr .  fusspot  and merely raised a finger in either acknowledgment or dismissal .      yes  you may recall that i saw the error of my ways last year when the gods       moist began .         robbed a couple of banks    .     said cosmo .     vetinari  are we to believe that you knowingly put the most important bank in the city into the charge of a known bank robber .      the mass ranks of the lavishes arose  united in the defense of the money .  vetinari still stared at the ceiling .   moist looked up .  a disc  something white  skimmed through the air near the ceiling  descended as it circled  and hit cosmo between the eyes .  a second one swooped on over the head of moist and landed in the bosoms of the lavishes .      should he have left it in the hands of unknown bank robbers .     a voice shouted  as collateral custard landed on every smart black suit .     here we are again .      a second wave of pies was already in the air  circling the room in trajectories that dropped them into the struggling lavishes .  and then a figure fought its way out of the crowd  to the groans and screams of those who   d temporarily been in its way  this was because those who managed to escape having their feet trodden on by the big shoes jumped back in time to be scythed down by the ladder the newcomer was carrying .  then it   d innocently turned to see what mayhem it had caused  and the swinging ladder felled anyone too slow to get away .  there was a method to it  though  as moist watched  the clown stepped away from the ladder  leaving four people trapped among the rungs in such a way that any attempt to get out would cause huge pain to the other three and  in the case of one of the watchmen  a serious impairment of marriage prospects .   red nosed and raggedy hatted  it bounced into the arena in great  leaping strides  his enormous boots flapping on the floor with every familiar step .      mr .  bent .     said moist .     is that you .         my jolly good pal mr .  lipwig .     shouted the clown .     you think the ringmaster runs the circus  do you .  only by the consent of the clowns  mr .  lipwig .  only by the consent of the clowns .      bent drew back his arm and hurled a pie at lord vetinari  but moist was already in full leap before the pie started its journey .  his brain came a poor third  and delivered its thoughts all in one go  telling him what his legs had apparently worked out for themselves  that the dignity of the great could rarely survive a faceful of custard  that a picture of an encustarded patrician on the front page of the times would rock the power politics of the city  and most of all  that in a post vetinari world he  moist  would not see tomorrow  which was one of his lifelong ambitions .   as in a silent dream  he sailed toward the oncoming nemesis  reaching out with snail pace fingers while the pie spun on to its date with history .   it hit him in the face .   the patrician had not moved .  custard flew up and four hundred fascinated eyes watched as a glob of the stuff was thrown up by the collision and headed on toward vetinari  who caught it in an upraised hand .   the little smack as it landed in his palm was the only sound in the room .   vetinari inspected the captured custard .   he dipped a finger into it  and tasted the blob thereon .  he cast his eyes upward thoughtfully  while the room held its collective breath  and then said     i do believe it is pineapple .      there was a thunder of applause .  there had to be  even if you hated vetinari  you had to admire the timing .   and now he was coming down the steps  advancing on a frozen and fearful clown .      the clowns do not run my circus  sir     he said  grabbing the man by his big red nose and pulling it to the full extent of the elastic .     is that understood .      the clown produced a bulbous horn and gave a mournful honk .      good .  i   m glad you agree .  and now i want to talk to mr .  bent  please .      there were two honks this time .      oh yes he is     said vetinari .     shall we get him out for the boys and girls .  what is    .   percent of    .    .         you leave him alone .  just you leave him alone .      the battered crowd parted yet again  this time for a disheveled miss drapes  as outraged and indignant as a mother hen .  she was clasping something heavy to her sparse bosom  and moist realized that it was a stack of ledgers .      this is what it   s all about .     she announced triumphantly  flinging her arms wide .     it   s not his fault .  they took advantage of him .      she pointed an accusatory finger at the dripping ranks of the lavishes .  if a battle goddess was allowed to have a respectable blouse and hair escaping rapidly from a tight bun  then miss drapes could have been deified .     it was them .  they sold the gold years ago .     this caused a general and enthusiastic uproar on all sides not containing a lavish .      there will be silence .     shouted vetinari .   the lawyers rose .  mr .  slant glared .  the lawyers sank .   and moist wiped pineapple custard from his eyes just in time .      look out .  he   s got a daisy .     he shouted  and then thought  i just shouted    look out .  he   s got a daisy     and i think i   m going to remember forever just how embarrassing this was .   lord vetinari looked down at the improbably large flower in the clown   s buttonhole .  a tiny drop of water glistened in the almost well concealed nozzle .      yes     he said     i know .  now  sir  i do indeed believe you are mr .  bent .  i recognize the walk  you see .  if you are not  then all you have to do is squeeze  and all i have to do is let go .  i repeat  i   d like to hear from mr .  bent .      sometimes the gods don   t have the right sense of occasion  moist thought .  there should be thunder  a plangent tone  a chord of tension  some kind of celestial acknowledgment that here was the moment of tru          .           said the clown .   vetinari smiled and patted him on the shoulder .      welcome back     he said  and looked around the room until his gaze found dr .  whiteface of the fools    guild .      doctor  would you take care of mr .  bent  please .  i think he needs to be among his own .         it would be an honor  my lord .  seven pies in the air at once and a four man ladder tie .  exemplary .  whoever you are brother  i offer you the joke handshake of welcome           he   s not going anywhere without me     said miss drapes grimly  as the white faced clown stepped forward .      indeed  who could imagine how he would     said vetinari .     and please extend the courtesy of your guild to mr .  bent   s young lady  doctor     he added  to the surprise and delight of miss drapes  who clung on daily to the    lady    but had reluctantly said good bye to the    young    years ago .      and will somebody please release those people from that ladder .  i think a saw will be required     vetinari went on .     drumknott  collect up these intriguing new ledgers that mr .  bent   s young lady has so kindly supplied .  and i think mr .  lavish needs medical attention           i   do   not .     cosmo  dripping custard  was trying to remain upright .  it was painful to watch .  he managed to point a furious but wavering finger at the tumbled books .     those     he declared     are the property of the bank .         mr .  lavish  it is clear to us all that you are ill       vetinari began .      yes  you   d like everyone to believe that  wouldn   t you   impostor .     cosmo said  visibly swaying .  in his head the crowd cheered .      the royal bank of ankh morpork     said vetinari  without taking his eyes off cosmo     prides itself on its red leather ledgers  which without fail are embossed with the seal of the city in gold leaf .  drumknott .         these are cheap cardboard bound ones  sir .  you can buy them anywhere .  the writing within  however  is the unmistakable fine copperplate hand of mr .  bent .         you are sure .         oh  yes .  he does a wonderful cursive script .         fake     said cosmo  as if his tongue was an inch thick     all fake .  stolen .      moist looked at the watching people and saw the shared expression .  whatever you thought of him  it was not good to see a man fall to bits where he stood .  a couple of watchmen were sidling carefully toward him .      i never stole a thing in my life .     said miss drapes  bridling enough for gymkhana .     they were in his wardrobe       she hesitated and decided she   d rather be scarlet than gray      and i don   t care what lady deirdre waggon thinks .  and i   ve taken a look inside them  too .  your father took the gold and sold it and forced him to hide it in the numbers .  and that   s not the half of it .            beautiful but   fly     cosmo slurred  blinking at vetinari .     you not me any mo    .  walked mile in y   shoes .      moist also edged in his direction .  cosmo had the look of someone who might explode at any moment  or collapse  or just possibly fall on moist   s neck  mumbling things like    you   re m   bestest pal  you are  it   s you   n me    gainst the worl    pal .      greenish sweat was pouring down the man   s face .      i think you need a lie down  mr .  lavish     said moist cheerfully .  cosmo tried to focus on him .         s a good pain     the dripping man confided .     got    li   l hat  got got sword o    t   ouands mens       and with a whisper of steel  a gray blade  with an evil red glitter to it  was pointing between moist   s eyes .  it didn   t waver .  behind it  cosmo was trembling and twitching  but the sword stayed rigid and unmoving .   the advancing watchmen slowed down a little .  their job had a pension .      will no one at all make any move  please .  i think i can deal with this     said moist  squinting along the blade .  this was a time for delicacy        oh  this is so silly     said pucci  strutting forward with a clatter of heels .     we   ve got nothing to be ashamed of .  it   s our gold  isn   t it .  who cares what he wrote down in his books .      the phalanx of lavish lawyers rose very cautiously to their feet  while the two employed by pucci began to whisper urgently to her .  she ignored them .  everyone was staring at her now  not her brother .  everyone was paying attention to her .      could you please be quiet  miss lavish .     said moist .  the stillness of the blade worried him .  some part of cosmo was functioning very well indeed .      oh yes  i expect you just would like me to shut up  and i   m not going to .     said pucci gleefully .  like moist confronted by an open notebook  she triumphantly plunged on without a care     we can   t steal what already belongs to us  can we .  so what if father put the wretched gold to better use .  it was just sitting there .  honestly  why are you all so dense .  everybody does it .  it   s not stealing .  i mean  the gold still exists  yes .  in rings and things .  it   s not as though anyone   s going to throw it away .  who cares where it is .      moist resisted the impulse to look at the other bankers in the room .  everyone does it  eh .  pucci was not going to get many hogswatch cards this year .  and her brother was staring at her in horror .  the rest of the clan  those who weren   t still engrossed in decustarding themselves  were contriving to give the impression that they had never seen pucci before .  who is this mad woman .  said their faces .  who let her in .  what is she talking about .      i think your brother is very ill  miss     he said .   pucci tossed her admittedly fine locks dismissively .     don   t worry about him  he   s just being silly     she said .     he   s only doing it to attract attention .  silly boyish stuff about wanting to be vetinari  as if anyone in their right mind would           he   s dribbling green     said moist  but nothing cut through the barrage of chatter .  he stared at cosmo   s ravaged face  and everything made sense .  beard .  cap .  sword stick  yes  with someone   s tacky idea of what a blade made from the iron in the blood of a thousand men should look like .  and what about the murder of a man who made rings .  and under that stinking glove     this is my world .  i know how to do this .      i beg your pardon .  you are lord vetinari  aren   t you .     he said .   for a moment  cosmo drew himself up and a spark of imperiousness shone through .      indeed .  yes indeed     he said  raising one eyebrow .  then it sagged  and his puffy face sagged with it .      got ring .  vetin   ry ring     he mumbled .        s mine really .  good pain        the sword dropped  too .   moist grabbed the man   s left hand and tore the glove off .  it came away with a sucking sound and a smell that was unimaginably  nose cakingly bad .  the nearest guard threw up .  so many colors  thought moist .  so many   wiggling things     and there  still visible in the suppurating mass  was the unmistakable sullen gleam of stygium .   moist grabbed cosmo   s other hand .      i think you ought to come outside  my lord  now you are the patrician     he said loudly .     you must meet the people        once again  some inner cosmo got a slippery grip  enough to cause the dribbling mouth to utter    yes  this is very important       before reverting to    feel ill .  finger looks funny           the sunshine will do it good     said moist  taking him gently in tow .     trust me .          chapter        gladys is doing it for herself to the house of mirth the history of mr .  bent usefulness of clowns as nurses is questioned owlswick gets an angel the golden secret  not exactly dragon magic  the return of the teeth vetinari looks ahead the bank triumphant the glooper   s little gift how to spoil a perfect day      on the first day of the rest of his life moist von lipwig woke up  which was nice  given that on any particular day a number of people do not  but woke up alone  which was less pleasing .   it was six a . m .   and the fog seemed glued to the windows  so thick that it should have contained croutons .  but he liked these moments  before the fragments of yesterday reassembled themselves .   hold on  this wasn   t the suite  was it .  this was his room in the post office  which had all the luxury and comfort that you would normally associate with the term    civil service issue .      a piece of yesterday fell into place .  oh yes  vetinari had ordered the bank shut while his clerks looked at everything this time .  moist wished them luck with the late sir joshua   s special cupboard     there was no mr .  fusspot  which was a shame .  you don   t appreciate an early morning slobber until it   s gone .  and there was no gladys  either  which was worrying .   she didn   t turn up while he was getting dressed  either  and there was no copy of the times on his desk .  his suit needed pressing  too .   he eventually found her pushing a trolley of mail in the sorting room .  the blue dress was gone  to be replaced by a gray one which  by the nascent standards of golem dressmaking  looked quite smart .      good morning  gladys     moist ventured     any chance of some pressed trouser .         there is always a warm iron in the postmen   s locker room  mr .  lipwig .         oh .  ah .  right .  and  er   the times .         four copies are delivered to mr .  groat   s office every morning  mr .  lipwig .         i suppose a sandwich is totally out of           i really must get on with my duties  mr .  lipwig     said the golem reproachfully .      you know  gladys  i can   t help thinking that there   s something different about you     said moist .      yes .  i am doing it for myself     said gladys  her eyes glowing .      doing what  exactly .         i have not ascertained this yet  but i am only ten pages into the book .         ah .  you have been reading a new book .  but not one by lady deirdre waggon  i   ll wager .         no  because she is out of touch with modern thought .  i laugh with scorn .         yes  i imagine you would do     said moist thoughtfully .     and i expect miss dearheart gave you said book .         yes .  it is entitled why men get under your feet  by releventia flout     said gladys earnestly .   and we start out with the best of intentions  thought moist  find    em out  dig    em up  make    em free .  but we don   t know what we   re doing  or what we   re doing it to .      gladys  the thing about books   well  the thing   i mean just because it   s written down  you don   t have to   that is to say  it doesn   t mean it   s   what i   m getting at is that every book is        he stopped .  they believe in words .  words give them life .  i can   t tell her that we just throw them around like jugglers  we change their meaning to suit ourselves     he patted gladys on the shoulder .     well  read them all and make up your own mind  eh .         that was very nearly inappropriate touching  mr .  lipwig .      moist started to laugh  and stopped at the sight of her grave expression .      er  only for ms .  flout  i expect     he said  and went to grab a times before they were all stolen .   it must have been another bittersweet day for the editor .  after all  there can only be one front page .  in the end he   d stuffed in everything   the    i do believe it is pineapple    line  with a picture showing the dripping lavishes in the background and  oh yes  here was pucci   s speech  in detail .  it was wonderful .  and she   d gone on and on .  it was all perfectly clear  from her point of view  she was right and everyone was silly .  she was so in love with her own voice that the watchmen had to write down their official caution on a piece of paper and hold it up in front of her before they towed her away  still talking     and someone had got a picture of cosmo   s ring catching the sunlight .  it was near perfect surgery  they said down at the hospital  and had probably saved his life  they said  and how had moist known what to do  they said  when the entirety of moist   s relevant medical knowledge was that a finger shouldn   t have green mushrooms growing on it     the paper was twitched out of his hands .      what have you done with professor flead .     adora belle demanded .     i know you   ve done something .  don   t lie .         i haven   t done anything .     moist protested  and checked the wording .  yes  technically true .      i   ve been to the department of postmortem communications  you know .         and what did they say .         i don   t know .  there was a squid blocking the door .  but you   ve done something  i know it .  he told you the secret of getting through to the golems  didn   t he .         no .     absolutely true .      he didn   t .         no .  i got some extra vocabulary  but that   s no secret .         will it work for me .         no .     currently true .      they   d only take orders from a man .  i bet that   s it .         i don   t think so .     true enough .      so there is a secret .         it   s not really a secret .  flead told us .  he just didn   t know it was a secret .     true .      it   s a word .         no .     true .      look  why won   t you tell me .  you know you can trust me .         well  yes .  of course .  but can i trust you if someone holds a knife to your throat .         why should they do that .      moist sighed .     because you   ll know how to command the biggest army there has ever been .  didn   t you look around outside .  didn   t you see all the coppers .  they turned up right after the hearing .         what coppers .         those trolls re laying the cobbles .  how often do you see that happening .  the line of cabs that aren   t interested in passengers .  the battalion of beggars .  and the coach yard around the back is full of hangers on  lounging about and watching the windows .  those coppers .  it   s called a stakeout  and i   m the meat        there was a knock at the door .  moist recognized it  it sought to alert without disturbing .      come in  stanley     he said .  the door opened .      it   s me  sir     said stanley  who went through life with the care of a man reading a manual translated from a foreign language .      yes  stanley .         head of stamps  sir     said stanley .      yes  stanley .         lord vetinari is in the coach yard  sir  inspecting the new automatic pick up mechanism .  he says there is no rush  sir .         he says there is no rush     said moist to adora belle .      we   d better hurry  then .         exactly .             remarkably like a gibbet     said lord vetinari  while behind him coaches rumbled in and out of the fog .     it will allow a fast coach to pick up mailbags without slowing     said moist .     that means letters going from small country offices can travel express without slowing the coach .  it could save a few minutes on a long run .         and  of course  if i let you have some of the golem horses the coaches might travel at a hundred miles an hour  i   m told  and i wonder if those glowing eyes could see even through this murk .         possibly  sir .  but  in fact  i already have all the golem horses     said moist .   vetinari gave him a cool look  and then said     hah .  and you also have all your ears .  what exchange rate are we discussing .         look  it   s not that i want to be lord of the golems       moist began .      on the way  please .  do join me in my coach     said vetinari .      where are we going .         hardly any distance .  we   re going to see mr .  bent .          the clown who opened the little sliding door in the fools    guild   s forbidding gates looked from vetinari to moist to adora belle  and wasn   t very happy about any of them .      we are here to see dr .  whiteface     said vetinari .     i require you to let us in with the minimum of mirth .      the door snapped back .  there was some hurried whispering and a clanking noise  and one half of the double doors opened a little way  just enough for people to walk through in single file .  moist stepped forward  but vetinari put a restraining hand on his shoulder and pointed up with his stick .      this is the fools    guild     he said .     expect   fun .      there was a bucket balanced on the door .  he sighed  and gave it a push with his stick .  there was a thud and a splash from the other side .      i don   t know why they persist in this  i really don   t     he said  sweeping through .     it   s not funny and it could hurt someone .  mind the custard .     there was a groan from the dark behind the door .      mr .  bent was born charlie benito  according to dr .  whiteface     said vetinari  pushing his way through the tent that occupied the guild   s quadrangle .     and he was born a clown .      dozens of clowns paused in their daily training to watch them pass .  pies remained unflung  trousers did not fill with whitewash  invisible dogs paused in mid widdle .      born a clown .     said moist .      indeed  mr .  lipwig .  a great clown  from a family of clowns  who have worn the charlie benito makeup for centuries .  you saw him last night .         i thought he   d gone mad .         dr .  whiteface  on the other hand  thinks he has come to his senses .  young bent had a terrible childhood  i gather .  no one told him he was a clown until he was thirteen .  and his mother  for reasons of her own  discouraged all clownishness in him .         she must have liked clowns once     said adora belle .  she looked around them .  all the clowns hurriedly looked away .      she loved clowns     said vetinari .     or should i say  one clown .  and for one night .         oh .  i see     said moist .     and then the circus moved on .         as circuses do  alas .  after which i suspect she rather went off men with red noses .         how do you know all this .     said moist .      some of it is informed conjecture  but miss drapes has got a lot out of him in the last couple of days .  she is a lady of some depth and determination .      on the far side of the big tent there was another doorway  where the head of the guild was waiting for them .   he was white all over   white hat  white boots  white costume  and white face   and on that face  delineated in thin lines of red greasepaint  was a smile belying the real face  which was as cold and proud as that of a prince of hell .   dr .  whiteface nodded at vetinari .      my lord           dr .  whiteface     said the patrician .     and how is the patient .         oh  if only he had come to us when he was young     said whiteface     what a clown he would have been .  what timing .  oh  by the way  we do not normally allow women visitors into the guild  but in these special circumstances we are waiving this rule .         oh  i   m so glad     said adora belle  acid etching every syllable .      it is simply that  whatever the jokes for women group says  women are just not funny .         it is a terrible affliction     adora belle agreed .      an interesting dichotomy  in fact  since neither are clowns     said vetinari .      i   ve always thought so     said adora belle .      they are tragic     said vetinari     and we laugh at their tragedy as we laugh at our own .  the painted grin leers out at us from the darkness  mocking our insane belief in order  logic  status  the reality of reality .  the mask knows that we are born on the banana skin that leads only to the open manhole cover of doom  and all we can hope for are the cheers of the crowd .         where do the squeaky balloon animals fit in .     said moist .      i have no idea .  but i understand that when the would be murderers broke in  mr .  bent strangled one with quite a lifelike humorous pink elephant made out of balloons .         just imagine the noise     said adora belle cheerfully .      yes .  what a turn .  and without any training .  and the business with the ladder .  pure battle clowning .  superb .     said whiteface .     we know it all now  havelock .  after his mother died  his father came back and  of course  took him off to the circus .  any clown could see the boy had funny bones .  those feet .  they should have sent him to us .  a boy of that age  it can be very tricky .  but no  he was bundled into his grandfather   s old gear and shoved out into the ring in some tiny little town  and well  that   s where clowning lost a king .         why .  what happened .     said moist .      why do you think .  they laughed at him .          it was raining  and wet branches lashed at him as he bounded through the woods  whitewash still dribbling from his baggy trousers .  the pants themselves bounced up and down on their elastic braces  occasionally hitting him under the chin .   the boots were good .  they were amazing boots .  they were the only ones he   d had that fitted .   but mother had brought him up properly .  clothes should be a respectable gray  mirth was indecent  and makeup was a sin .   well  punishment had come fast enough .   at dawn he found a barn .  he scraped off the dried custard and caked greasepaint and washed himself in a puddle .  oh  that face .  the fat nose  the huge mouth  the white tear painted on   he would remember it in nightmares  he knew it .   at least he still had his own shirt and drawers  which covered all the important bits .  he was about to throw everything else away when an inner voice stopped him .  his mother was dead and he hadn   t been able to stop the bailiffs taking everything  even the brass ring mother polished every day  he   d never see his father again   he had to keep something  there had to be something  so that he might remember who and why he was and where he   d come from and even why he   d left .  the barn yielded a sack full of holes  that was good enough .  the hated suit was stuffed inside .   later that day he   d come across some caravans parked under the trees  but they were not the garish carts of the circus .  probably they were religious  he thought  and mother had approved of the quieter religions  provided the gods weren   t foreign .   they gave him rabbit stew .  and when he looked over the shoulder of a man sitting quietly at a small folding table  he saw a book full of numbers  all written down .  he liked numbers .  they   d always made sense in a world that didn   t .  and then he   d asked the man  very politely  what the number at the bottom was  and the answer had been     it   s what we call the total     and he   d replied     no  that   s not the total  that   s three farthings short of the total .        how do you know .     said the man  and he   d said     i can see it is     and the man had said     but you only just glanced at it .     and he   d said     well  yes  isn   t that why .      and then more books were opened and the people gathered round and gave him sums to do  and they were all so  so easy     it was all the fun the circus couldn   t be  and involved no custard  ever .       he opened his eyes and made out the indistinct figures .      am i going to be arrested .      moist glanced at vetinari  who waved a hand vaguely .      not necessarily     said moist carefully .     we know about the gold .         mr .  lavish said he would let it be known about my   family     said mr .  bent .      yes  we know .         people would laugh .  i couldn   t stand that .  and then i think i   you know  i think i convinced myself that it was all a dream .  that provided i never looked for it  it would still be there .     he paused  as if random thoughts were queuing for the use of the mouth .     mr .  whiteface has been kind enough to show me the history of the charlie benito face       another pause .     i hear i threw custard pies with considerable accuracy .  perhaps my ancestor will be proud .         how do you feel now .     said moist .      oh  quite well in myself     said bent     whoever that is .         good .  then i want to see you at work tomorrow  mr .  bent .         you can   t ask him to go back so soon .     miss drapes protested .   moist turned to whiteface and vetinari .     could you please leave us  gentlemen .      there was an affronted look on the chief clown   s face  which was made worse by the permanent happy smile  but the door shut behind them .      listen  mr .  bent     said moist urgently .     we   re in a mess           i believed in the gold  you know     said bent .     didn   t know where it was  but i believed .         good .  and it probably still exists in pucci   s jewelry box     said moist .     but i want to open the bank again tomorrow  and vetinari   s people have been through every piece of paper in the place  and you can guess what kind of mess they leave .  and i want to launch the notes tomorrow  you know .  the money that doesn   t need gold .  and the bank doesn   t need gold .  we know this .  it worked for years with a vault full of junk .  but the bank needs you  mr .  bent .  the lavishes are in real trouble  cosmo   s locked up somewhere  mr .  fusspot   s in the palace  and tomorrow  mr .  bent  the bank opens and you must be there .  please .  oh  and the chairman has graciously barked assent to putting you on a salary of sixty five dollars a month .  i know you are not a man to be influenced by money  but the raise might be worth considering by a man contemplating a  ah  change in his domestic arrangements .      it wasn   t a shot in the dark .  it was a shot in the light   clear  blazing light .  miss drapes was definitely a woman with a plan  and it had to be a better one than the rest of a life spent in a narrow room in elm street .      it   s your choice  of course     he said  standing up .     are they treating him all right  miss drapes .         only because i   m here     she said smartly .     this morning three clowns came in with a big rope and a small elephant and wanted to pull one of his poor teeth .  and then i   d hardly got them out when two more came in and started to whitewash the room  very inefficiently  in my opinion .  i got them out of here in very short order  i can tell you .         well done  miss drapes .      vetinari was waiting outside the guild with the coach door open and  moist noted with relief  mr .  fusspot asleep on the cushions .      you will get in     vetinari said .     you too  miss dearheart .         actually it   s a very short walk to           get in  mr .  lipwig .  we will go the pretty way .      i believe you think our relationship is a game     said vetinari  as the coach pulled away .     you believe that all sins will be forgiven .  so let me give you this .      he took up a black walking stick with a silver skull on the handle  and tugged at the handle .      this curious thing was in the possession of cosmo lavish     he said  as the blade slid out .      i know .  isn   t it a replica of yours .     said moist .      oh really     said vetinari .     am i a sword made of the blood of a thousand men kind of ruler .  it   ll be a crown of skulls next  i suppose .  i believe cosmo had it made .         so it   s a replica of a rumor .     said adora belle .  outside the coach  some gates were swung open .      indeed     said vetinari .     a copy of something that does not exist .  one can only assume that it is authentic in every respect .      the coach door was opened  and moist and adora belle stepped down into the palace gardens .   they had the usual look of such places   neat  tidy  lots of gravel and pointy trees and no vegetables .      why are we here .     said adora belle .     it   s about the golems  isn   t it .         miss dearheart  what do our local golems think about this new army .         they don   t like them .  they think they will cause trouble .  they have no chem that can be changed .  they   re worse than zombies .         thank you .  a further question  will they kill .         historically  golem makers have learned not to make golems that kill           is that a no .         i don   t know .         we make progress .  is it possible to give them an order which cannot be countermanded by another person .         well  er   yes .  if they don   t know the wretched secret .         which is .     vetinari turned back to moist and drew the sword .      it must be the way i give the orders  sir     said moist  squinting downward at the blade for the second time .  it really did glint .   he was braced for what happened  except that it happened in entirely the wrong way .   vetinari handed him the sword and said     miss dearheart  i really wish you would not leave the city for long periods .  it makes this man seek danger .  tell us the secret  mr .  lipwig .         i think it could be too dangerous  sir .         mr .  lipwig  do i need a button that says tyrant .         can i make a bargain .         of course .  i am a reasonable man .         will you keep to it .         no .  but i will make a different bargain     said vetinari .     the post office can have six golem horses .  the other golem warriors will be considered wards of the golem trust  but the use of four hundred of them to improve the operation of the clacks system will  i am sure  meet with international approval .  we will replace gold with golems as a basis for our currency  as you have so eloquently pleaded .  the two of you have made the international situation very   interesting           sorry  why is it me that   s holding this sword .     said moist .         and you tell us the secret and  best of all  you live     vetinari finished     and who is going to give you a better offer .         oh  all right     said moist .     i knew this would have to happen .  the golems obey me be              because you wear a golden suit and therefore  in their eyes  must be an umnian priest     said vetinari     because for an order to be fully realized the right person must say the right words to the right recipient .  i used to be quite a scholar .  it   s a matter of reasoning .  do not continue to stand there with your mouth open .         you already knew .         it wasn   t exactly dragon magic .         so why did you give me this horrible sword .         it is tasteless  isn   t it     said vetinari  taking it from him .     one might imagine it belonging to someone with a name like krax the mighty .  i was just interested to see that you were more fearful when you were holding it .  you really are not a violent man  are you           that wasn   t necessary .     said moist .  adora belle was grinning .      mr .  lipwig  mr .  lipwig  mr .  lipwig  will you never learn .     said vetinari  sheathing the sword .     one of my predecessors used to have people torn apart by wild tortoises .  it was not a quick death .  he thought it was a hoot .  forgive me if my pleasures are a little more cerebral  will you .  let me see now  what was the other thing .  oh yes  i regret to tell you that a man called owlswick clamp has died .      there was something about the way he said it        did an angel call him .     said moist .      very likely  mr .  lipwig .  but should you find yourself in need of more designs  i   m sure i can find someone in the palace to assist .         it was meant to be  i   m sure     said moist .     i   m glad he   s gone to a better place .         less damp  certainly .  go now .  my coach is at your disposal .  you have a bank to open .  the world spins on  and this morning it is spinning on my desk .  follow me  mr .  fusspot .         can i make a suggestion that might help .     said moist  as vetinari turned away .      what is it .         well  why don   t you tell all the other plains governments about the golden secret .  that would mean no one could use them as soldiers .  that would take the pressure off .         hmm  interesting .  and would you agree with that  miss dearheart .         yes .  we don   t want golem armies .  it   s a very good idea .      vetinari reached down and gave mr .  fusspot a dog biscuit .  when he straightened up  there was an almost imperceptible change in his expression .      last night     he said     some traitor sent the golden secret to the rulers of every major city in the plains  via a clacks message the origin of which appears to be untraceable .  it wasn   t you  was it  mr .  lipwig .         me .  no .         but you just suggested it  did you not .  some would call it treason  incidentally .         i only just mentioned it     said moist .     you can   t pin it on me .  anyway  it was a good idea     he added  trying not to catch adora belle   s eye .  if you don   t think of not using fifty foot high killer golems first  someone else will .      he heard her giggle  for the first time ever .      you have found fifty foot high killer golems now  miss dearheart .     said vetinari  looking stern  as though he might add     well  i hope you brought enough for everybody .         no  sir .  there aren   t any     said adora belle  trying to look serious and not succeeding .      well  never mind  i   m sure some ingenious person will devise one for you eventually .  when they do  don   t hesitate to refrain from bringing it home .  in the meantime  we have this wretched fait accompli .     vetinari shook his head in what moist was sure was genuinely contrived annoyance and went on     an army that will obey anyone with a shiny jacket  a megaphone  and the umnian words for    dig a hole and bury yourselves    would turn war into nothing but a rather entertaining farce .  rest assured  i   m putting together a committee of inquiry .  it will not rest  apart from statutory tea and biscuit breaks  until it has found the culprit .  i shall take a personal interest  of course .      of course you will  moist thought .  and i know that lots of people heard me shout umnian commands  but i   m betting on a man who thinks war is a wicked waste of customers .  a man who   s a better con artist than i   ll ever be  who thinks committees are a kind of wastepaper basket  who can turn sizzle into sausage  every day     moist and adora belle looked at one another .  their glances agreed  it   s him .  of course it   s him .  downey and all the rest of them will know it   s him .  things that live on damp walls will know it   s him .  and no one will ever prove it .   moist   s thoughts added  he   s probably got our signed confessions in his pocket right now  just in case .  owlswick   s probably as busy as a bee and as happy as a pig in muck .  still  it could be worse .  better the devil who knows you        you can trust us     he said .      yes .  i know     said vetinari .     come  mr .  fusspot .  there may be cake .          moist didn   t fancy another ride in the coach .  coaches carried some unpleasant associations right now .      he   s won  hasn   t he     said adora belle  as the fog billowed around them .      well  he   s got the chairman eating out of his hand .         is he allowed to do that .         i think that comes under the quia ego sic dico rule .         yes  what did that mean .            because i say so     i think .         that doesn   t sound like much of a rule .         actually  it   s the only one he needs .  all in all he could be           you owe me five grand  mishter shpangler .      the figure was out of the gloom and behind adora belle in one movement .      no tricks  miss  on account o    this knife     said cribbins  and moist heard adora belle   s sharp intake of breath .     your chum promised it to me for peaching you  and since you peached yourself and sent him to the loony house i reckon you owe me  right .      moist   s slowly moving hand found his pocket  but it was bereft of aid  the tanty didn   t like you to bring blackjacks and lock picks in with you and expected you to buy such things from the wardens  like everyone else .      put the knife away and we can talk     he said .      oh yeah  talk .  you like talkin     you do .  you got a magic tongue  you have .  i sheen you .  you flap it about and you   re the golden boy .  you tell    em you   re goin    to rob them and they laugh .  how d   you get away with that  eh .      cribbins was champing and spitting with rage .  angry people make mistakes  but that   s no comfort when they   re holding a knife a few inches from your girlfriend   s kidneys .  she   d gone pale  and moist had to hope that she   d worked out that this was no time to stamp her foot .  above all  he had to stop himself from looking over cribbins   s shoulder  because in the edge of his vision he was sure someone was creeping up .      this is no time for rash moves     he said loudly .  the shadow in the fog appeared to halt .      cribbins  this is why you never made it     moist went on .     i mean  do you expect me to have that much money on me .         plenty of places round here for ush to be coshy while we wait  eh .      dumb  thought moist .  dumb but dangerous .  and a thought said  it   s brain against brain .  and a weapon he doesn   t know how to use belongs to you .  push him .      just back away and we   ll forget we saw you     he said .     that   s the best offer you   re going to get .         you   re going to try to talk your way out of thish  you shmarmy bashtard .  i   m goin    to        there was a muffled twang  and cribbins made a noise .  it was the sound of someone trying to scream  except that even screaming was too painful .  moist grabbed adora belle as the man bent double  clutching at his mouth .  there was another twang  and blood appeared on cribbins   s cheek  causing him to whimper and roll up into a ball .   even then  there were more twangs as a dead man   s dentures  mistreated and ill used over the years  finally gave up the ghost  who made a determined effort to take the hated cribbins with him .  later on  the doctor said one spring almost made it into a sinus .   captain carrot and nobby nobbs ran out of the fog  and stared down at the man who twitched now and again with a ping .      sorry  sir  we lost you in the muck     said carrot .     what happened to him .      moist held adora belle tightly .     his dentures exploded     he said .      how could that happen  sir .         i have no idea  captain .  why not do a good deed and get him to the hospital .         will you want to press charges  mr .  lipwig .     carrot said  lifting the whimpering cribbins with some care .      i   d prefer a brandy     said moist .  he thought  perhaps anoia was just awaiting her moment .  i   d better go to her temple and hang up a big  big ladle .  it may not be a good idea to be ungrateful         secretary drumknott tiptoed into lord vetinari   s office on velvet shod feet .      good morning     said his lordship  turning away from the window .     the fog has a very pleasing tint of yellow this morning .  any news about heretofore .         the watch in quirm are searching for him  sir     said drumknott  putting the city edition of the times in front of him .      why .         he bought a ticket for quirm .         but he will have bought another one from the coachman for genua .  he will run as far as he can .  send a short clacks to our man there  will you .         i hope you are right  sir .         do you .  i hope i am wrong .  it will be good for me .  ah .  ahaha .         sir .         i see the times has put color on the front page again .  the front and back of the one dollar note .         yes  sir .  very nice .         actual size  too     said vetinari  still smiling .     i see here that this is to familiarize people with the look of the things .  even now  drumknott  even now  honest citizens are carefully cutting out both sides of this note and gluing them together .         shall i have a word with the editor  sir .         don   t .  it will be more entertaining to let things take their course .      vetinari leaned back in his chair and shut his eyes with a sigh .     very well  drumknott  i feel strong enough now to hear what the political cartoon looks like .      there was a crackle of paper as drumknott found the right page .      well  there is a very good likeness of mr .  fusspot .     under vetinari   s chair the dog opened his eyes at the sound of his name .  so did his new master  with more urgency .      surely he has nothing in his mouth .         no  sir  it is empty     said drumknott calmly .     this is the times of ankh morpork  sir .      vetinari relaxed again .     continue .         he is on a leash  sir  and looking unaccustomedly ferocious .  you are holding the leash  sir .  in front of him  and backing nervously into a corner  are a group of very fat cats .  they are wearing top hats  sir .         as cats do  yes .     vetinari nodded .      and they have the words the banks on them     drumknott added .      subtle indeed .         while you  sir  are waving a handful of paper money at them and the speech bubble says           don   t tell me .     this does not taste of pineapple    .         well done  sir .  incidentally  it does so happen that the chairmen of the rest of the city banks wish to see you  at your convenience .         good .  this afternoon  then .      vetinari got up and walked over to the window .  the fog was thinning  but its drifting cloud still obscured the city .      mr .  lipwig is a very   popular young man  is he not  drumknott .     said vetinari  staring into the gloom .      oh yes  sir     said the secretary  folding up the newspaper .     extremely so .  the times likes him .  the people seem to like him .  he is an entertainer  and much is forgiven of such people .         and very confident in himself  i think .         i would say so .         and loyal .         he took a pie for you  sir .         a tactical thinker at speed  then .         oh yes .         bearing in mind his own future was riding on the pie as well .         he is certainly sensitive to political currents  no doubt about it     said drumknott  picking up his bundle of files .      and  as you say  popular     said vetinari  still a gaunt outline against the fog .   drumknott waited .  moist was not the only one sensitive to political currents .      an asset to the city  indeed     said vetinari  after a while .     and we should not waste him .  obviously  though  he should be at the royal bank long enough to bend it to his satisfaction     vetinari mused .  drumknott said nothing  but arranged some of the files into a more pleasing order .  a name struck him  and he shifted a file to the top .      of course  then he will get restless again and become a danger to others as well as himself        drumknott smiled at his files .  his hand hovered        apropos of nothing  how old is mr .  creaser .         the taxmaster .  in his seventies  sir     said drumknott  opening the file he had just selected .     yes  seventy four  it says here .         we have recently pondered his methods  have we not .         indeed we have  sir .  last week .         not a man with a flexible cast of mind  i feel .  a little at sea in the modern world .  holding someone upside down over a bucket and giving them a good shaking is not the way forward .  i won   t blame him when he decides to take an honorable and well earned retirement .         yes sir .  when would you like him to decide that  sir .     said drumknott .      no rush     said vetinari .     no rush .         have you given any thought to his successor .  it   s not a job that creates friends     said drumknott .     it would need a special sort of person .         i shall ponder it     said vetinari .     no doubt a name will present itself .          the bank staff were at work early  pushing through the crowds who were filling the street because  a  this was another act in the wonderful street theater that was ankh morpork and  b  there was going to be big trouble if their money had gone missing .  there was  however  no sign of mr .  bent or miss drapes .   moist was in the mint .  mr .  spools   s men had  well  they   d done their best .  it   s an apologetic phrase  commonly used to mean that the result is just one step above mediocre  but their best was one leap above superb .      i   m sure we can improve them     said mr .  spools  as moist gloated .      they are perfect  mr .  spools .         anything but .  but it   s kind of you to say so .  we   ve done seventy thousand so far .         nothing like enough .         with respect  we are not printing a newspaper here .  but we   re getting better .  you have talked about other denominations    .         oh  yes .  two  five  and ten dollars to start with .  and the fives and tens will talk .      nothing like enough  he thought  as the colors of money flowed through his fingers .  people will queue up for this .  they won   t want the grubby  heavy coins  not when they see this .  backed by golems .  what is a coin compared to the hand that holds it .  that   s worth .  that   s value .  hm  yes  that   d look good on the two dollar note  too  i   d better remember that .      the money   will talk .     said mr .  spools carefully .      imps     said moist .     they   re only a sort of intelligent spell .  they don   t even have to have a shape .  we   ll print them on the higher denominations .         do you think the university will agree to that .     said spools .      yes  because i   m going to put ridcully   s head on the five dollar note .  i   ll go and talk to ponder stibbons .  this looks like a job for inadvisably applied magic if ever i saw one .         and what would the money say .         anything we want it to .     is your purchase really necessary .     perhaps  or    why not save me for a rainy day .     the possibilities are endless .         it usually says good bye to me     said a printer  to ritual amusement .      well  maybe we can make it blow you a kiss as well     said moist .  he turned to the men of the sheds  who were beaming and gleaming with newfound importance .     now  if some of you gentlemen will help me carry this lot into the bank        the hands of the clock were chasing one another to the top of the hour when moist arrived at the head of the procession  and there was still no sign of mr .  bent .      is that clock right .     said moist  as the hands began the relaxing stroll to the half hour .      oh yes  sir     said a counter clerk .     mr .  bent sets it twice a day .         maybe  but he hasn   t been here for more than        the doors swung open  and there he was .  moist had  for some reason  expected the clown outfit  but this was the smooth and shiny  ironed in his clothes bent with the smart jacket and pinstripe trousers and        the red nose .  and he was arm in arm with miss drapes .   the staff stared at it all  too shocked for a reaction .      ladies and gentlemen     said bent  his voice echoing in the silence .     i owe so many apologies .  i have made many mistakes .  indeed  my whole life has been a mistake .  i believed that true worth lodged in lumps of metal  metal which i doubt we shall see again .  much of what i believed is worthless  in fact  but mr .  lipwig believed in me and so i am here today .  let us make money based not on a trick of geology but on the ingenuity of hand and brain .  and now       he paused  because miss drapes had squeezed his arm .      oh  yes  how could i forget     bent went on     what i do now believe with all my heart is that miss drapes will marry me in the chapel of fun in the fools    guild on saturday  the ceremony to be conducted by the reverend brother    whacko    whopply .  you are all  of course  invited              but be careful what you wear because it   s a whitewash wedding     said miss drapes coyly  or what she probably thought was coyly .      and with that it only remains for me to       bent tried to continue  but the staff had realized what their ears had heard  and closed in on the couple  the women drawn to the soon not to be miss drapes by the legendarily high gravity of an engagement ring and the men intent on slapping mr .  bent on the back and then doing the hitherto unthinkable  which involved picking him up and carrying him around the room on their shoulders .   eventually  it was moist who had to cup his hands and shout     look at the time  ladies and gentlemen .  our customers are waiting  ladies and gentlemen .  let us not stand in the way of making money .  we mustn   t be a dam in the economic flow .         and he wondered what hubert was doing now         with his tongue out in concentration  igor removed a slim tube from the gurgling bowels of the glooper .   a few bubbles zig zagged to the top of the central hydro unit and burst on the surface with a gloop .   hubert breathed a deep sigh of relief .      well done  igor  only one more to   igor .         right here  thur     said igor  stepping out from behind him .      it looks as though it   s working  igor .  good old hyphenated silicon .  but you   re sure it   ll still work as an economic modeler afterward .         yeth  thur .  i am confident in the new valve array .  the thity will affect the glooper  if you withh  but not the other way around .         even so  it would be dreadful if it fell into the wrong hands  igor .  i wonder if i should present the glooper to the government .  what do you think .      igor gave this some thought .  in his experience a prime definition of    the wrong hands    was    the government .         i think you ought to take the opportunity to get out a bit more  thur     he said kindly .      yes  i suppose i have been overdoing it     said hubert .     um   about mr .  lipwig           yeth .      hubert looked like a man who had been wrestling with his conscience and got a knee in his eye .      i want to put the gold back in the vault .  that   ll stop all this trouble .         but it wath thtolen away yearth ago  thur     igor explained patiently .     it wathen   t your fault .  it wath not even there when the glooper wath built .         no  but they were blaming mr .  lipwig  who   s always been very kind to us .         i think he got off on that one  thur .         but we could put it back     hubert insisted .     it would come back from wherever it was taken to  wouldn   t it .      igor scratched his head  causing a faint metallic noise .  he had been following events with more care than hubert employed  and as far as he could see  the missing gold had been disposed of by the lavishes years ago .  mr .  lipwig had been in trouble  but it seemed to igor that trouble hit mr .  lipwig like a big wave hitting a flotilla of ducks .  afterward  there was no wave but there was still a lot of duck .      it might     he conceded .      so that would be a good thing  yes .     hubert insisted .     and he   s been very kind .  we owe him that little favor .         i don   t think           that is an order  igor .      igor beamed .  at last .  all this politeness had been getting on his nerves .  what an igor expected was insane orders .  that was what an igor was born  and  to some extent  made  for .  a shouted order to do something of dubious morality with an unpredictable outcome .  thweeet .   of course  thunder and lightning would have been more appropriate .  instead there was nothing more than the bubbling of the glooper and gentle glassy noises that always made igor think he was in a wind chime factory .  but sometimes you just had to improvise .   he closed the little valve on the bottom of a funnel that drained into the gold reserve flask  and then filled it to the ten tons marker  fiddled with the shiny valve array for a minute or two  and then stood back .      when i turn thith wheel  marthter  the glooper will depothit into the vault flathk an analogue of ten tonth of gold .  thith will cauth ten tonth of gold to gently appear in the vault  tho that reality ith in balance .  ath thoon ath thith ith done  the glooper will then clothe the connection .         very good  igor .         er  you wouldn   t like to thtout thomthing  would you     igor hinted .      like what .         oh  i don   t know   perhapth    they said      sorry     thaid      thorry      i wath mad but thith will show them .  .            that   s not really me .         no .     said igor .     perhapth a laugh  then .         would that help .         yeth  thur     said igor .     it will help me .         oh  very well  if you think it will help     said hubert .  he took a sip from the jug igor had just used  and cleared his throat .      hah     he said .     er  hahahh hah ha ha ha ha ha ha        what a waste of a wonderful gift  thought igor  and turned the wheel .   gloop .       even from down here in the vaults  you could hear the buzz of activity in the banking hall .   moist walked slowly under the weight of a crate of bank notes  to adora belle   s annoyance .      why can   t you put them in a safe .         because they   re full of coins .  anyway  we   ll have to keep them in here for now  until we get sorted out .         it   s really just a victory thing  isn   t it .  your triumph over gold .         a bit  yes .         you got away with it again .         i wouldn   t exactly put it like that .  gladys has applied to be my secretary .         here   s a tip  don   t let her sit on your lap .         i   m being serious here .  she   s ferocious .  she probably wants my job now .  she believes everything she reads .         there   s your answer  then .  good grief  she   s the least of your problems .         every problem is an opportunity     said moist primly .      well  if you upset vetinari again you will have a wonderful opportunity to never have to buy another hat .         no  i think he likes a little opposition .         and are you any good at knowing how much .         no  that   s what i enjoy .  you get a wonderful view from the point of no return .      moist opened the vault and put the crate on a shelf .  it looked a bit lost and alone  but he could just make out the thudding of the press in the mint as they worked hard at providing it with company .   adora belle leaned on the door frame  watching him carefully .      i keep hearing that while i was away you did all kinds of risky things .  is that true .         i like to flirt with risk .  it   s always been part of my life .         but you don   t do that kind of stuff while i   m around     said adora belle .     so i   m enough of a thrill  am i .      she advanced .  the heels helped  of course  but spike could move like a snake trying to sashay  and the severe  tight  and ostensibly modest dresses she wore left everything to the imagination  which is much more inflammatory than leaving nothing .  speculation is always more interesting than facts .      what are you thinking about right now .     she said .  she dropped her cigarette stub and pinned it with a heel .      piggy banks     said moist instantly .      piggy banks .         yes  in the shape of not so much a pig as the bank and the mint .  to teach the kiddies the habits of thrift .  the money could go in the slot where the bad penny is           are you really thinking about money boxes .         er  no .  i   m flirting with risk again .         that   s better .         although you must admit that it   s a pretty clev        adora belle grabbed moist by the shoulders .      moist von lipwig  if you don   t give me a big wet kiss right now   ow .  are there fleas down here .      it felt like a hailstorm .  the air in the vault had become a golden mist .  it would have been pretty  if it wasn   t so heavy .  it stung where it touched .   moist grabbed her hand and dragged her out as the teeming particles became a torrent .  outside  he took off his hat  which was already so heavy that it was endangering his ears  and tipped a small fortune in gold onto the floor .  the vault was already half full .      oh no     he moaned .     just when it was going so well            epilogue     whiteness  coolness  the smell of starch .      good morning  my lord .      cosmo opened his eyes .  a female face  surrounded by a white cap  was looking down at him .   ah  so it had worked .  he had known it would .      would you like to get up .     said the woman  stepping back .  there were a couple of heavily built men behind her  also in white .  this was just as it should be .   he looked down at the place where a whole finger should be  and saw a stump covered in a bandage .  he couldn   t quite remember how this had happened  but that was fine .  after all  in order to change  something had to be lost as well as gained .  that was fine .  so this was a hospital .  that was fine .      this is a hospital  yes .     he said  sitting up in the bed .      well done  your lordship .  you are in the lord vetinari ward  as a matter of fact .      that is fine  cosmo thought .  so i endowed a ward at some time .  that was very forward looking of me .      and those men are bodyguards .     he said  nodding at the men .      well  they are here to see that no harm comes to you     said the nurse     so i suppose that   s true .      there were a number of other patients in the long ward  all in white robes  some of them seated and playing board games  and a number of them standing at the big window  staring out .  they stood in identical poses  their hands clasped behind their backs .  cosmo watched them for some time .   then he stared at the small table where two men were sitting opposite each other  apparently taking turns to measure each other   s foreheads .  he had to pay careful attention for some time before he worked out what was going on .  but lord vetinari was not a man to jump to conclusions .      excuse me  nurse     said cosmo  and she hurried over .  he beckoned her closer  and the two burly men drew nearer  too  not taking their eyes off him .      i know those people are not entirely sane     he said .     they think they are lord vetinari  am i right .  this is a ward for such people  yes .  those two are having an eyebrow raising competition .         you are quite right     said the nurse .     well done  my lord .         doesn   t it puzzle them when they see one another .         not really  my lord .  each one thinks he   s the real one .         so they don   t know that i am the real one .      one of the guards leaned forward .      no  my lord  we   re keeping very quiet about it     he said  winking at his colleague .   cosmo nodded .     very good .  this is a wonderful place to stay while i   m getting better .  the perfect place to be incognito .  who would think of looking for me in this room of poor  sad madmen .         that   s exactly the plan  sir .  well done .         you know  some sort of artificial skyline would make things more interesting for the poor souls at the window     he said .      ah  we can tell you   re the real thing  sir     said the man  winking at his colleague .   cosmo beamed .  and two weeks later  when he won the eyebrow raising competition  he was happier than he   d ever been before .       the pink pussycat club was packed again tonight   except for seat seven  front row  center  .   the record for anyone remaining in seat seven was nine seconds .  the baffled management had replaced the cushions and the springs several times .  it made no difference .  on the other hand  everything else was going so inexplicably well lately .  there seemed to be a good atmosphere in the club  especially among the dancers  who were working extra hard now that someone had invented a currency that could be stuck into a garter .  noisy drunks fell silent  disrespectful punters were hurrying frantically out of the door even before the bouncers got to them .  the whole place was running like a clock  the management concluded  and it somehow had to do with that empty seat .  well  a happy house was worth a seat  especially in view of what had happened when they tried to take the damn thing away         author   s note     hemlines as a measure of national crisis  page      the author will be forever grateful to the renowned military historian and strategist sir basil liddell hart for imparting this interesting observation to him in      .  it may explain why the mini skirt has  since the      s  never really gone out of style .       students of the history of computing will recognize in the glooper a distant echo of the phillips economic computer  built in      by engineer turned economist bill phillips  which also made an impressive hydraulic model of the national economy .  no igors were involved  apparently .  one of the early machines is on display in the science museum  london  and a dozen or so others are on display around the world  for the interested observer .  and finally  as ever  the author is grateful to the
