sky are photofloods      in the false dawn a warm wind blew out of the east  shaking the dry reed cases .   the marsh mist broke into ribbons and curled away .  small night creatures burrowed hastily into the slime .  in the distance  hidden by the baroque mist curls  a night bird screeched in the floating reed beds .   in one of the big lakes near the open sea three delicate white windshells hoisted their papery sails and tacked slowly towards the incoming surf .   dom waited just beyond the breakers  two metres below the dancing surface  a thin stream of bubbles rising from his gill pack .  he heard the shells long before he saw them .  they sounded like skates on distant ice .   he grinned to himself .  there would only be one chance .  some of those pretty trailing tendrils were lethal .  there might never be another chance  ever .  he tensed .   and knifed upwards .   the shell bucked violently as he grabbed the blunt prow  and he swung his legs hard over to avoid hitting the dangling green fronds .  the world dissolved into a salt tasting  cold white bubble of foam .  small silver fish slipped desperately past him  and then he was lying across the upper hull .   the shell had gone berserk  flailing with the bony mast in great slow sweeps .  dom watched it  getting his breath back  and then half leapt  half scrambled to the big white bulge near the base of the mast .   a shadow passed over him  and he rolled to one side as the mast nicked a furrow in the hull .  as it passed he followed it  grabbed at the nerve knot  and pulled himself forward .   his fingers sought for the right spot .  he found it .   the shell stopped its frenzied rush through the wavetops  hitting the water again with a slap that jarred dom   s teeth .  the sail wavered uncertainly .   dom continued stroking until the creature was soothed and then stood up .   it didn   t count unless you stood up .  the best dagon fishers could ride a shell with their toes .  how he had envied them     and how carefully he had watched from the family barge on feast days  when the fishermen came in two or three hundred abreast on their half tame shells with see why setting  a bright purple star  into the sea .  some of the younger men danced on their shells  spinning and leaping and juggling torches and all the time keeping the shell under perfect control .   kneeling in front of the nerve knot he guided the big semi vegetable back through the twisting waterways of the marsh  through acres of sea lilies and past floating reed islands .  on several of them blue flamingoes hissed at him and stalked imperiously away .   occasionally he glanced up and northwards  searching for tell tale specks in the air .  korodore would find him eventually  but dom was pretty certain that he wouldn   t pick him up straight away .  he   d probably keep him under benevolent observation for a few hours because  after all  korodore had been young once .  even korodore .  whereas grandmother gave the impression that she had been born aged eighty .   besides  korodore would bear in mind that tomorrow dom would be chairman and legally his boss .  dom doubted if that would influence him one jot .  old korodore relished duty if it came sternly      he smiled proudly as the shell cut smoothly through the quiet water .  at least the fishermen would not be able to call him a blackhand  even if he wasn   t quite a fully fledged greenhand .  that last initiation of the dagon fishermen could only be got out in the deeps  on a moonlit night  when the dagons rose out of the deep with their razor sharp shells agape .   the shell bumped against the reed bed and dom leapt lightly ashore  leaving it drifting in the little lagoon .   joker   s tower  which had been dominating the western sky  looked up before him .  he hurried forward .   see why had risen and bathed the slim pyramid in pink light .  the mist had left the reed beds round the base but the apex  five miles above the sea  was lost in perpetual cloud .  dom pushed his way through the dry reeds until he was within half a metre of the smooth  milkwhite wall .   he reached out gingerly .   hrsh hgn had once  realizing vaguely that interminable lectures on planetary economics might not be palatable fare for a boy  smiled and switched off the faxboard .  he had fetched his copy of sub lunar   s galactic chronicles and told dom about the jokers .      name the races classed as human under the humanity act     he began .      phnobes  men  drosks and the first sirian bank     dom rattled off .     also class five robots by sub clause one may apply for human status .         yess .  and the other racess .      dom ticked them off on his fingers .     creapii are super human  class four robots are subhuman  sundogs are unclassified .         yess .         the other races i   m not sure about     admitted dom .     the jovians and the rest .  you never taught me anything about them .         it iss not necessary .  they are so alien  you undersstand .  we share no common ground .  things humanity considers universal among self aware races     a sense of identity  for example     are merely products of a temperate bipedal evolution .  but all the fifty two races so far discovered arose in the last five million standard years .         you told me about that yesterday     said dom     sub lunar   s theory of galactic sapience .      then the phnobe had told him about the jokers .  the creapii had found the first joker tower and  all else having failed to open it  had dropped a live nigrocavernal matrix on it .  the tower was later found to be intact .  three neighbouring stellar systems had been wrecked  however .   the phnobes never discovered a joker tower  they had always known of one .  the tower of phnobis  rising from the sea into the perpetual cloud cover  was the cause and basis of the planet wide frss gnhs religion     literally  pillar of the universe .   earth human colonists had found seven  one of them floating in the asteroid belt of the old sol system .  that was when the joker institute was set up .   the young races of men  creapii  phnobe and drosk found themselves watching one another in awe across a galaxy littered with the memories of a race that had died before human time began .  and out of that awe arose the legends of jokers world  the glittering goal that was to taunt adventurers and fools and treasure hunters across the light years      dom touched the tower .  there was the faintest tingle  a sudden stab of pain .  he leapt back  frantically rubbing life back into his frozen fingers .  the coldness of the towers was always greatest at noon  when they drank in heat  yet grew icy .   dom set off round the tower  feeling the cold reaching out towards him .  looking up he thought he saw the air within a foot of the smooth walls darken  as if light was just a gas and was being sucked in by the spire .  it wasn   t logical  but the idea had a certain artistic appeal .   towards noon a security flyer glittered briefly on the western horizon  heading south .  dom stepped sideways into a clump of reeds     and wondered what he was doing in the marsh .  freedom  that was it .  the last day of real freedom .  his last chance to see widdershins without a security guard standing on either side of him and a score of more subtle protections all round .  he had planned it  down to squashing korodore   s ubiquitous robot insects that spied on him     always for his own protection     in his bedroom .   and now he   d have to go home and face grandmother .  he was beginning to feel just a little foolish .  he wondered what he had expected from the tower  some feeling of cosmic awe  probably  a sense of the deeps of time .  certainly not this sinister  insidious sensation of being watched .  it was just like being at home .   he turned back .   there was a hiss of superheated air as something passed his face and struck the tower .  where it hit the frozen wall the heat blossomed into a flower of ice crystals .   dom dived instinctively  rolled over and over and was up and running .  a second blast passed him and a dry seed head in front of him exploded into a shower of sparks .   he stifled the urge to look round .  korodore had schooled him unmercifully in assassination drill .  knowing who was the assassin was small reward for being assassinated .  korodore said     the price of curiosity is a terminal experience .      at the edge of the lagoon dom gathered himself and dived .  as he hit the water the third blast seared across his chest .   great bells rang  far out to sea or maybe in his head .  the cool greenness was soothing  and the bubbles        dom awoke .  with an inculcated instinct he kept his eyes closed and tentatively explored his environment .   he was lying on the mixture of sand  ooze  dry reed stems and snail shells that passed for soil on most of widdershins .  he was in shade  and the thunder of surf was very near .  and the soil rocked  gently  to the beat of the waves .  the air smelled and tasted of salt  mingled with marsh ooze  reed pollen and     something else .  it was dank and musty  and very familiar .   something was sitting a few inches away .  dom opened one eye a fraction and saw a small creature watching him intently .  its dumpy body was covered in pink hair which sprouted from a scaly hide .  a snout was a bad compromise between a beak and a prehensile nose .  it had three pairs of legs  no two exactly alike .  it was almost a widdershins legend .   behind dom someone lit a fire .  he tried to sit up and it felt as though a red hot bar had been laid across his chest .      o juvindo may psutivi     said a gentle voice .   a face out of a nightmare appeared above him .  the skin was grey and hung in folds under eyes four times the proper size in which small irises stared out like beads in milk .  great flat ears were turned towards dom .  the musty smell was overpowering .  the face was set off by a pair of large sungoggles .   the phnobe was trying to speak janglic .  dom summoned his resources and answered him in jaw breaking phnobic .      a sscholar     said the phnobe  dryly .     my name is fff shs .  and you are chairman sabalos .         not till tomorrow     moaned dom .  he winced as the pain came again .      ah .  yess .  do not on any account make ssudden movementss .  i have treated the burn .  it iss superficial .      the phnobe stood up and walked out of dom   s vision .  the small creature still watched him intently .   dom turned his head slowly .  he was lying in a small clearing in the centre of one of the floating islands that thronged the marsh rhines .  it was moving slowly and  remarkably  against the wind .  from somewhere below the reed mat came the occasional deep pulse of an antique deuterium motor .   a coarse woven net was slung across the clearing  hiding it effectively from airborne eyes .  with the motor and the ancillary mechanisms that must be hidden under the thick reed mat  the little island would not hold its secret long against even unsophisticated search equipment .  but there were several hundred thousand islands in the marsh .  who could search them all .   a conclusion began to form in dom   s mind .   the phnobe passed in front of him and he saw he was holding a double bladed tshuri knife lightly  tossing it thoughtfully from hand to hand .  dom was mother naked  except where dry salt rimed his black skin .   the phnobe was embarrassed by his presence .  occasionally he stopped juggling with the knife and stared at him intently .   they both heard the distant swish swish of a flyer .  the phnobe dived sideways  flipped back a section of reed and killed the island   s speed  then on the rebound flung himself down by dom with the knife pressed against his throat .      not to utter a sound     he said .   they lay still until the flyer had faded into the distance .   the phnobe was a pilac smuggler .  the dagon fishermen under licence from the board of widdershins rode out by the hundred when the big bivalves rose up from the deep  to snatch the pearls of nacreous pilac by the light of the moon .  they used lifelines  leather body armour and elaborate back up procedures     like the factory float which included a hospital where a missing hand was merely a minor mishap and even death not always fatal .   there were other fishers .  they traded safety for an odd conception of excitement and accepted as the price of an illegal fortune the complete lack of any opportunity to spend it .  by nature they worked alone and were highly skilled .  what they snatched from the sea was theirs alone  including death .  occasionally the board launched a campaign against them and made half hearted attempts to stop the pilac being smuggled offworld .  captured smugglers were not killed now     that would certainly be against the one commandment     but it occured to dom that to those of their nature the alternative punishment was far worse than the death they courted nightly .  so the smuggler would kill him .   the phnobe stood up  still holding the knife by the heavier  forward facing blade .      why am i here .     asked dom  meekly .     the last i remember  .  .  .         you were floating among the lilies sso peacefully  with a stripper burn across your chest .  the ssecurity has been out ssince dawn .  it seemed they were searching  for a criminal maybe  so i am jusst a little curiouss and pick you up .         thank you     said dom  easing himself into a sitting position .   the smuggler shrugged  a strangely expressive gesture in a high shouldered bony body .      how far are we from the tower .         i found you forty kilometres from the sky pillar .  we have travelled maybe two kilometres ssince .         forty .  but someone shot at me at the tower .         maybe you swim well for a drowned man .      dom lifted himself gradually to his feet  his eyes on the twisting knife .     do you gather much pilac .         eighteen kilos in the last twenty eight years     said the phnobe  watching the sky absently .  despite himself  dom did a quick calculation .      you must be very skilful .         many times i die .  on other time lines .  maybe this universe is my chance in a million and the other thousands of selves are dead .  what is skill then .      the knife continued its brief flights from hand to hand .  overhead the sun shone like a gong .  dom felt dizzy and was briefly sick but managed to stay upright  waiting for his chance .   the phnobe blinked .      i seek an omen     he said .      what for .         to see  you understand  if i am to kill you .      a flock of blue flamingoes flapped slowly overhead .  dom gasped for air and readied himself .   the knife was thrown faster than he could follow it .  it flashed once  high in the air .  a flamingo dipped out of the flock as if coming in to land  and crashed heavily among the reeds .  the tension in the air snapped like a finely drawn wire .   ignoring dom  the smuggler loped across to it  drew his knife from its breast and began to pluck it .  he paused after a minute and glanced up sharply  pointing with the knife .      a word of advice .  do not ever again even think of a heroic leap at any person holding a tshuri knife .  you have about you the air of one with many lives to wasste .  maybe therefore you rissk your life easily .  but foolish gestures towards a knife end sadly .      dom let the tension flow out of him  aware that a fraught moment had passed and gone .      besides     the smuggler went on     doesn   t gratitude count for anything .  soon we will eat .  then we will talk  maybe .         there   s a lot i want to know     said dom .     who shot at            tssh .  questions that can   t be answered  why ask them .  but do not rule out bater .         bater .      the phnobe looked up .      you haven   t heard of probability math .  you  and tomorrow you become chairman of the board of widdershinss and heir to riches untold .  then first we will talk  and then we will eat .       see why hung in the mists that had crept out of the marsh .  the island sailed dripping through the clammy curtain  leaving a mist wake that writhed fantastically over the suddenly sinister marsh .   fff shs came out of the woven hut at one end of the island and pointed into the whiteness .      the radar says your flyer iss hardly more than a hundred metres thataway .  sso i leave you here .      they shook hands solemnly .  dom turned and walked down to the water   s edge  then turned again as the phnobe hurried after him .  he held the little rat creature  which had spent most of the journey asleep round his neck .      tomorrow  maybe  there will be great ceremoniess .      dom sighed .     yes  i   m afraid there will .         and giftss  maybe .  that iss the procedure .         yes .  but grandmother says that most will be from those who seek favours .  anyway  they   ll be returned .         i sseek no favours  nor will you return thiss small gift     said the phnobe  holding out the struggling creature .     take him .  you know what he iss .         a swamp ig     nodded dom .     he   s one of the bearers on our planetary crest  along with the blue flamingo .  but the zoo says there   s only about three hundred on the planet  i can   t            this little one has dogged my footsteps these last four months .  he   ll come with you .  i feel he will desert me soon anyway .      the ig jumped from the phnobe   s arm and settled around dom   s neck  where it re placed its tail in its mouth and began to snore .  dom smiled  and the smuggler answered with a brief mucus grimace .      i call him my luck     said the phnobe .     it   s an indulgence  maybe .     he glanced up at widdershins   s one bloated moon  rising in the south .      tonight will be a good night for hunting     he said  and in two strides had disappeared into the thickening mists .   dom opened his mouth to speak  then stood silent for a moment .   he turned and dived into the warm evening sea .    the heavy hull of a security flyer rocked in the swell beside his own craft .  a figure appeared on the flat deck as he hauled himself aboard .   dom found himself looking first at the crosswires of a molecule stripper and then at the embarrassed face of a young security man .      chel .  i   m sorry  sir  i didn   t realize            you   ve found me .  good for you     said dom coldly .     now i   m going home .         i   ve got orders  er  to take you back     said the guard .  dom ignored him and stepped aboard his own craft .  the guard swallowed  glanced at the stripper and then at dom  and hurried into the control bubble .  by the time he had reached the radio  dom   s flyer was a hundred metres away  bouncing lightly from wavetop to wavetop before gliding up and over the sea .     extract from      and all that  an anecdotal history of space travelling man  by charles sub lunar  fghs hrs   calligna  terra novae      mention should be made of widdershins and of the sabalos family  since the two are practically synonymous .  widdershins  a mild world consisting largely of water and very little else  is one of the two planets of cy aquirii .  its climate is pleasant though damp  its food a monotonous variation on the theme of fish  its people intelligent  hardy and     due to the high ultraviolet content of the sunlight     universally black and bald .      the planet was settled in the year of the questing monkey  a . s .       by a small party of earth humans and a smaller colony of phnobes and there  perhaps  pan human relations are better than on any other world .      john sabalos     the first of his dynasty     built himself a house by the wiggly river  looking over the sea towards great creaking marsh .  his only skill was luck .  he discovered in the giant floating bivalves that dwelt in the deep waters a metre wide pearl made up largely of crude pilac  which turned out to be one of the growing number of death immunity drugs .  but pilac was found to be without many of the unfortunate drawbacks of many of the other twenty six .  it became the foundation of the family fortunes .  john i extended his house  planted an orchard of cherry trees  became the first chairman when widdershins adopted rule by board of directors  and died aged     .      his son  john  is considered a wastrel .  one example of his wastefulness suffices  he bought a shipload of rare fruits from third eye .  most were rotten on arrival .  one mould was a strange green slime .  by an unlikely combination of circumstances it was found to have curious regenerative properties .  within a year  just when dagon fishing was becoming almost impossible because of the high injury rate among the fishermen  it became a mark of manhood to have at least one limb with the peculiar greenish tint of the cell duplicating googoo .      john ii bought the cheops pyramid from the tsion subcommittee of the board of earth and had it lifted in one piece at an area of waste ground north of his home domes .  when he made an offer for luna  to replace widdershins    smaller but still serviceable moon  his young daughter joan i packed him off to a mansion on the other side of the planet and took over as managing director .  in her the sabalos fortunes  hitherto dependent on a smiling fate  found a champion .  they doubled within a year .  a strict sadhimist  she executed many reforms including the passage of the humanity laws .      her son     she found time for a brief contract with a cousin     was john iii  who became a brilliant probability mathematician in those early  exciting days of the art .  it has been suggested that this was a peaceful escape from his mother and his wife vian  a well connected earth noblewoman to whom he had been contracted in order to strengthen ties with earth .  he disappeared in strange circumstances just prior to the birth of his second child  the dom sabalos of legend .  it is understood that he met with some kind of accident in the planet wide marshes .      a body of myth surrounds the young dom .  many stories relating to him are obviously apocryphal .  for example  it is said that on the very date of his investiture as chairman of the planetary board  he          the stars were out as dom reached the jetty which stretched from the home domes far out into the artificial harbour where the feral wind shells were kept .   lamps were burning .  some of the early duty fishermen were already preparing the shells for the night   s fishing  one old woman was deep frying king cockles on a charcoal stove  and a tinny radio lying on the boards was playing  quite unheeded  an old earth tune with the refrain     your feet   s too big    .   dom tied up at the jetty alongside the great silent bulk of a hospital float  and scrambled up the ladder .   as he walked towards the domes he was aware of the silence .  it spread out from him like a wake  from man to man .  heads rose in the lamplight and froze  watching him intently .  even the old woman lifted the pan from the stove and glanced up .  there was something acute about the look in her eyes .   dom heard one sound as he slowly climbed the steps towards the main sabalos dome .  someone started to say     not like his father  then  whatever they       and was nudged into silence .   a class three robot stood by the door  armed with an antiquated sonic .  it whirred into life as he approached and assumed a defiant stance .      halt     who goes there .  enemy or friend of earth .     it croaked  its somewhat corroded voice box slurring the edges of the traditional sadhimist challenge .      foe  of course     said dom  resisting the urge to give the wrong answer .  he had done it once to see what would happen .  the blast had left him temporarily deaf and the resonance had demolished a warehouse .  grandmother  who seldom smiled  had laughed quite a lot and then tanned his hide to make sure the lesson was doubly learned .      pass  foe     said the guard .  as he passed  the communicator on its chest glowed into life .      okay     said korodore     dom  one day you will tell me how you got out without tripping an alarm .         it took some studying .         step closer to the scanner .  i see .  that scar is new .         someone shot at me out in the marsh .  i   m all right .      korodore   s reply came slowly  under admirable control .      who .         chel  how should i know .  anyway  it was hours ago .  i     uh            you will come inside  and in ten minutes you will come to my office and you will tell me the events of today in detail so minute you will be amazed .  do you understand .      dom looked up defiantly  and bit his lip .      yes  sir     he said .      okay .  and just maybe i will not get sent to scrape barnacles off a raft with my teeth and you will not get confined to dome for a month .     korodore   s voice softened marginally .     what   s that thing round your neck .  it looks familiar .         it   s a swamp ig .         rare  aren   t they .      dom glanced up at the planetary coat of arms over the door  where a blue flamingo and a bad representation of a swamp ig supported a sadhimist logo on an azure field .  under it  incised deeply into the stone     far more deeply in fact than was necessary     was the one commandment .      i used to know a smuggler who had one of those     korodore went on .     there are one or two odd legends about them .  i expect you know  of course .  i guess it   s okay to bring it in .      the communicator darkened .  the robot stood aside .   dom skirted the main living quarters .  there was an uproar coming from the kitchens where preparations were being made for tomorrow   s banquet .  he slipped in quietly  snatched a plate of kelp entr  es from the table nearest the door  and ducked back into the corridor .  a phnobic curseword followed him  but that was all  and he wandered on down to the corridor until it petered out in a maze of storerooms and pantries .   a small courtyard had been roofed over with smoked plastic that made it gloomy even under a see why noon  and the plastic itself was set with thin pipes that sprayed a constant fine mist .   in the middle of the yard a rath had been built of reeds .  an attempt to grow fungi had been made on the patch of ground surrounding it .  dom pulled aside the drenched door curtain and stooped inside .   hrsh hgn was sitting in a shallow bath of tepid water  reading a cube by the light of a fish oil lamp .  he waved one double jointed hand at dom and swivelled one eye towards him .      glad you   re here .  lissten to thiss     a rock outcrop twenty kilometres south of rampa  third eye  appearss to reveal fossil strata relating not to the passt but to the future  which             the phnobe stopped reading and carefully placed the cube on the floor .  he looked first at dom   s expression  then at the scar  and finally at the ig which was still twined round his neck .      you   re acting     said dom .     you are doing it very well  but you are acting .  you   re certainly acting better than korodore and the men on the jetty .         we are naturally glad to see you ssafely back .         you all look as though i   ve returned from the dead .      the phnobe blinked .      hrsh  tomorrow i shall be chairman of the board .  it doesn   t mean much           it iss a very honourable position .            it doesn   t mean much because all the power  the real power  belongs to grandmother .  but i think the chairman is entitled to know one or two things .  like  for example  why haven   t you ever told me about probability math .  and what happened to     how did my father die .  i   ve heard fishermen say it was out there on old creaky .      in the silence that followed the ig awoke and began scratching itself violently .      come on     said dom     you   re my tutor .         i will tell you after the ceremony tomorrow  it iss late now .  then all will be explained .      dom stood up .     will i ever trust you again  though .  chel  hrsh  it   s important .  and you   re still acting .         oh  yess .  and what emotion am i trying to conceal .      dom stared at him .     uh     terror  i think .  and     uh     pity .  yes .  pity .  and you   re terrified .      the curtain swung to behind him .  hrsh hgn waited until his footsteps had died away  and reached out to the communicator .  korodore answered .      well .         he hass been to ssee me .  i almosst told him .  my lord  he wass reading me .  how can we let thiss thing happen .         we don   t .  we will try and prevent it  of course .  with all our power .  but it will happen  or seventy years of probability math go down the hole .      hrsh hgn said     someone hass been telling him about probability math  and he assked me about his father .  if he assks again  i warn you  for pity   s ssake i will tell him .         will you .      the phnobe looked down and fell silent .   out to sea the dagon rose by the score  in response to their ancient instincts .  the catch was unusually large  which the fishermen decided was an omen  if only they could decide which way fate   s finger pointed .  they found  too     when the last ripple had died away towards dawn     a small reed island  empty  half swamped  drifting aimlessly over the deeps .           korodore strolled silently along the empty corridor  which was lit faintly by the first glow of dawn .   he was thickset and  as a sly gesture  heredity had given him a round cheerful face so that he looked like an amiable pork butcher .  but there were advantages to that  and no butcher     certainly not of pork     walked by instinct from shadow to shadow .   a door opened soundlessly and he turned along a short side corridor and into a large round room .   a peat fire was collapsing soundlessly into a pile of white ash in the central hearth .  the rest of the room was sparsely furnished  a narrow bed  a table and chair made of sections of dagon shell  a wardrobe and a sadhimist logo on sheet copper on one curving wall comprised its main geographical points .   there were one or two signs of directorship  a large rolled map of the equatorial regions  an open filing cabinet  and a galactic standard clock on top of it .   but it was the trappings of probability math that clashed heavily with the strict simplicity of the room .  korodore   s eye followed a trail of reformed tarot cards across the room to where the bulk of the pack  crystal faces now bland  lay against the wall where it had been thrown .  a vaguely disturbing visual array on a portable computer glowed on another wall .  charcoal glowed faintly in a tiny brazier on the shell table  and the air was acrid with the fumes of     korodore sniffed the curious sinistral incense .  so joan had taken refuge in being a cool head      joan i looked up from the table  where a large black book lay open .      couldn   t you sleep either .     she said .   korodore rubbed his nose diffidently .      as you know  madam  security officers never sleep .         yes     i know .     she shook her head .     it was a figure of speech  is all .  there   s some coffee by the fire .      he poured her a cup  and slowly began to pick up the cards .  she eyed him carefully as he moved soundlessly across the room .      i   ve been looking at the equations again     she said .     there   s no change .  my son   s calculation was correct .  of course  i knew .  they   ve been checked enough times .  even sub lunar looked at them .  dom will be killed today  at noon .  they won   t let him live .      she waited .     well .     she said .      you mean  how do i feel as the security officer in charge .  you mean  what are my reactions to the knowledge that whatever precautions i may take my charge will still be murdered .  i have none  madam .  i will still work as though i was in ignorance .  besides     he added  dropping the pack on the table     i cannot believe it .  not quite .  you could say my reaction is hope .         it   ll happen .         i can   t pretend to understand probability math .  but if the universe is so ordered  so     immutable     that the future can be told from a handful of numbers  then why need we go on living .      joan stood up  crossed to the wardrobe  and took out of it a waist length white wig .      it   s obvious you do not understand p math  then     she said .     we go on because to live is still better than to die .  that has always been the choice of humanity  even when we thought the future was a cauldron of possibilities .      she combed out the wig .     we cannot be certain how he will die     she continued .     you or i  perhaps  may be the ones the institute chooses to        korodore spun round .     i have checked us all by deep reach  rgd           oh  korodore .  i   m sorry .  but you have such a touching faith in cause and effect .  don   t you know that in an infinite totality all universes will happen .  there is a universe somewhere where at this moment you will turn into a           such things are said  madam     he muttered .      you disapprove of me     she said  and pouted .   he raised his eyes to the gold century disc on her forehead and smiled thinly .      now  you are too old  madam  to try wiles of that kind .  but i do disapprove .  this meddling is not a good thing .  it stinks of magic  witchcraft .         i haven   t studied the pre sadhimist religions in any great depth  korodore .         all right  madam .  what happens if dom doesn   t die .         it   s unthinkable .  this is the datum universe     he   ll die .  in a sense  the whole universe depends on the fact .  if he didn   t die  perhaps he   d discover the jokers world and that could be terrible .         and if he doesn   t .      joan adjusted the wig and opened the window looking out over the sea .  the fishing fleet was coming in with the tide  lit by the hanging pinpoint of widdershins    blue sun .  on the horizon the light glinted sharply off the tower in the marshes .      it   s too hot to sleep     she said .     i   ll finish this  and then i   ll go down to the jetty .         mystic law of the universe .     asked korodore  as she reopened the book .      they are the household accounts  sir     she said sharply .     a great comfort in times of trial .      she wondered why she had never dismissed the man as security chief  and the answers queued up in her mind  ranging from his proven efficiency to the mitigating circumstance that he was earth born .  perhaps there were many other reasons .   as he turned to go she called him back .      with regard to your question about dom     she said     in all humility  p math is a young art .  i doubt if there is anyone adept enough to know .  even the institute doesn   t know everything .         dom might .  his tutor says he is showing a disconcerting insight .  oh  i don   t question your reasoning .  if it is inevitable  perhaps it is better he shouldn   t know .  you can see he is the type the institute hunts down .         you see  we can   t answer all the questions .      he shrugged .     perhaps you are asking the wrong questions .       probability math      as with the first theory of relativity and the sadhimist one commandment  so the nine equations of probability math provide an example of a deceptively simple spark initiating a great explosion of social change .          probability math predicts the future .     so says the half educated man .  a thousand years ago he would have mouthed    e equals mc squared    and believed he had encompassed the soaring castle of mathematical imagination         probability math arises from the premise that we dwell in a truly infinite totality  space and time without limit  worlds without end     a creation so vast that what we are pleased to call our cause and effect datum universe is a mere circle of candlelight .  in such a totality we can only echo the words of quixote  all things are possible  .  .  .             vindicated with the predicted discovery of the internal planets of protostar five .  then humanity could be sure     even from this tiny grain of proof .  on either    side    were ranged the alternate universes  uncounted millions differing perhaps by the orbit of an electron .  further  the difference must be greater     until in the looming shadows on the edge of imagination came the universes that had never known time  stars  space or rationality .  what p math did was quantify the possible timelines of our datum universe .  it did much more than that  however .  perhaps it brought back the essence of science from the days when it was half an art  when creation was seen as a marvellous  carefully regulated clock     with all parts harmonizing to make the whole                as sub lunar pointed out in those early years  p math depended on a certain innate mental agility .  many superb practitioners were also incurably insane  possibly because of that very fact .  leaving aside that very special subgroup to which sub lunar himself belonged     i say no more     the rest were usually highly educated and  in a word  lucky .   luck being a function of the p math talent  of course .   many of them worked for the joker institute .      such a streak ran through the sabalos family of widdershins .  for those of you who do not know the world  it is                just before the birth of his son and his own assassination in the marshes  john iii predicted that the boy would die also on the day of his investiture as chairman of the planetary board .  the chance of this not happening was so remote as to make a billion to one long shot appear a fifty fifty bet .  yes .  i   m sorry .  perhaps i should explain .         suppose p math had not been discovered .  now  on earth there was a creature called a horse .  long ago it was realized that if a number of these animals were raced over a set distance one must surely prove faster than the others  and from this there was                back to the subject in hand .  one anomaly in p math concerned the jokers  those semi mythical beings who had left artefacts strewn around half the galaxy .  solid artefacts  indeed  most of them gigantic .  according to probability math  the builders of these latter day tourist attractions had never  ever existed         his furness dr craarg        in an informal lecture to students at dis university  a . s .            dom woke early  and spent a long time staring at the familiar ceiling paintings of his dome .  they had been done by his great grandfather  in gaudy blues and greens  and depicted a trio of overmuscled fishermen battling an enraged dagon .  that was a slander on the dagons  dom knew  they lacked a nervous system and it was doubtful if they ever thought .  they just reacted .   the little swamp ig was sitting in the hand basin .  it had managed to turn on one of the taps with its disconcertingly human forepaws  and was enjoying the trickle of water .  when it saw he was awake it made a noise like a fingernail being dragged across glass .  the smuggler had said it was a sign of happiness .      intelligent little thing  aren   t you .     said dom  switching off the warm air field and swinging himself off the bed .   he saw the clothes laid out neatly on the stand  and bit his lip .  the swamp ig  a neatly healed scar on his chest and a few painful memories of his interview with korodore were all that remained of yesterday .   planetary chairman .  he   d own   per cent of the pilac industry  but on sadhimist terms  and if you were a sadhimist and rich you worked heavily to obscure the fact .  he   d preside over innumerable committee meetings  and once a year would give the traditional annual report at the traditional annual general meeting .  and that would be written for him .  hrsh hgn had made it clear  many times .  a chairman was as necessary to a board planet as the zero was in mathematics  but being a zero had big disadvantages      mathematics .  there was something about mathematics he should remember .  well  it   d come .  he washed and struggled into the thick grey suit  and selected a short wig of golden fibres .   there was a polite knock at the door .      all right     said dom .   the door burst open and keja ran into the room and hugged him .  she was laughing and crying at the same time .  for an embarrassing moment he was suffocated by the silks of her dress  and then his sister stood back and looked at him .      well  mr chairman     she said .  then she kissed him .  he disentangled himself as tactfully as he could .      i   m not actually chairman yet     he began .      oh fie .  what   s a few hours .  you don   t seem very pleased to see me  dom     she added  reproachfully .      honestly i am  ke .  things have just been a bit hectic lately .         i heard .  smugglers and so forth .  exciting .      dom thought about it .     no     he said .     more  well  strange in a way .      keja swept the dome with her eyes .  it was cluttered with dom   s things  an old brendikin analyser  a bench littered with shells  a hologram of the jokers tower  and memory cubes on every flat surface .      how the old place has changed     she said  wrinkling her nose .  she pirouetted in front of the tall mirror .     do i look like a married woman  dom .         i don   t know .  what   s ptarmigan like .     he remembered the contractual ceremony two months before  and a vague impression of a very large fierce old man .      he   s kind     said keja .     and rich  of course .  not so rich as us  but he sort of flaunts it more .  his children haven   t really taken to me yet .  you should come on an official visit  dom     laoth   s so hot and dry .  that reminds me  i   ve brought you a present .      she tiptoed to the door and returned with a servant robot  which carried a small box .      he   s a class five .  one of our best     she said proudly .      a robot .     said dom  who had been looking expectantly at the box .      strictly speaking  he   s a humanoid .  completely alive  merely mechanical .  do you like him .         very much .     dom walked up to the tall metallic figure and prodded the broad chest .  the robot glanced down at him .      i wonder what makes us build inefficiently shaped human robots instead of nice streamlined machines .         pride  sir     said the robot .      hey  that   s not bad .  what   s your name .         i understand it is isaac  sir .      dom scratched his head .  the home domes swarmed with robots  mostly kind but stupid class threes whom dom remembered from earliest childhood as sad  boring voices with firm  child minding hands .  his mother  who seldom left her own dome  disliked them generally and did her own cooking .  she said they were morons  and not a bit like the real things from laoth .  he was at a loss .      uh  can you be a bit more informal  isaac .         sure thing  boss .         i can see you two are going to get along fine  trying to out think each other     said keja .     now i   ve got to go .  and grandmother says you   ve got to go down to the main dome  dom .  for the working breakfast .      dom sighed .     i   ve had about twenty lectures about it from hrsh hgn in the last few days .      keja stopped dead .      what   s that thing .     she cried  pointing to the basin .   dom lifted the damp creature out by the scruff of its neck .      it   s a swamp ig .  i call him ig .  i was     i found     i  er        he blinked nervously .     i think i found him in the marshes yesterday .  i     er     things seem a little confused .      she looked at him  and dom saw the concern in her eyes .      it   s all right     he mumbled .     it   s just the excitement .         i guess so     keja said  and looked down at ig .      anyway  he   s so ugly .         excuse me  madam  sir  but he is an it     boomed the robot .     hermaphrodite .  oviparous .  semi poikothermic .  i have been supplied with a complete program on widdershins lifeforms  sir .  chief .  right on .         well  don   t blame me if you catch a zoonose     said keja  and flounced out of the dome .  dom looked at isaac .      zoonose .         disease communicable to humans .  no chance  buster .     isaac strode up to dom and held out the box .  the boy dropped his pet  who began to sniff at the robot   s foot  and opened it .      it   s the certificate of warranty  workshop manual and deed of property     said isaac .  dom looked at them blankly .      do you mean i have to own you .         body and hypothetical supernatural appendage  boss     said the robot hurriedly  stepping backwards when dom held the box towards him .      oh no  chief .  you   ve got to .  i don   t approve of self ownership .         chel  that   s what most humans fought for for three thousand years .         but we robots know exactly why we were created  boss .  no striving to find the innermost secrets of our creation .  no problem .         don   t you want to be free .         what .  and have god blame the universe on me .  shouldn   t you go down to the main dome now .      dom whistled  and ig scrambled up and went to sleep round his neck .  he glared up at the robot and strode out of the dome .    tradition decreed the working breakfast be taken alone by the chairman on the day of his investiture .  as he walked along the deserted corridors dom had the comfortably familiar feeling he was being watched .  old korodore had the place seeded with pinheads and robot insects     it was dome gossip that he even ran security checks on himself .   the main dome was half clear plastic  facing out across the orchards  the lagoon and marshes and finally  a thin line on the horizon  the jokers tower with a wisp of white cloud streaming from its tip like a banner .  dom stared at it for a few seconds  trying to hold an elusive memory .   a pile of presents     he was  after all  half a whole widdershins year old     were heaped around the long table .  two robots in waiting stood on either side of the single place setting .   dom had planned the meal time and again .  in the end he had chosen the menu that had been eaten by every chairman of widdershins .  it was a famous meal .  according to the newer testament  it was the same meal that sadhim himself ate when he became lord of earth     a quarter loaf of brown bread  a strip of salt dried fish  an apple and a glass of water .   there were some slight differences .  the flour for dom   s loaf had been freighted in from third eye .  the fish was truly widdershin  but the salt had been mined on terra novae .  the apple was from the earth   s avalon  the water melted from a particle of comet .  in all  the meal cost about two thousand standards .  some kinds of simplicity cost more than others .   korodore  a true born terra novaean  which meant food concentrates  watched dom eat with a slight feeling of nausea .  the camera was in a metal mosquito  high in the dome .  he thumbed a switch  and the screen faded in a view from a mechanical shrew in the branches of a tree on the edge of the west lawn .  most of the guests had already arrived  and were mingled around the long buffet table .   at least half of them were phnobes  many of them from the buruku colonies around tau city .  korodore recognized the diplomats     they were tall  dark alpha males  carrying sunshades .  the less exalted  who were more acclimatized to the light  stood in small  silent groups around the lawn .  korodore switched from pinhead to pinhead until he located hrsh hgn  reading a memory cube in the shade of a balloon tree .  the stoics  probably .   behind korodore the darkness of the big security room glowed here and there as the other security officers watched .  only korodore knew that under the horticultural dome by the north lawn was another  smaller security room checking on this one .  and occasionally he switched to his own private circuit and watched the officers there .  and  hidden by him in a place the exact location of which he had scrubbed from his mind  was a small biocomputer .  he had programmed it carefully .  it watched him .   he turned back to the guests .  here and there a big gold egg now showed in the crowd     the creapii ambassadors .  experience suggested that there was no risk in them .  they seldom meddled in the affairs of worlds where water liquefied .   one was holding a dish of silicate salt hors d   oeuvres in a single armoured tentacle .  occasionally it held on to the complicated airlock on its circumference .  it was chatting to joan i  who stood majestic in the black memory velvet and purple tabard of a sadhimist dame priestess in the negative aspect of nocticula hecate .  lady of night and death  thought korodore .  it was not a tactful choice .   she smiled at the creapii and turned to face the hidden camera  raising one hand .  korodore reached out and tipped a switch .      how goes it .     joan asked .  korodore watched fascinated     she had a remarkable talent for sub vocalizing .      he is breakfasting .  we have treble checked the food and everything else .         has he shown any effects from yesterday .      korodore paused .     no .  while he slept i used a brain scrubber on him .  i           how dare you .         it will keep yesterday   s memories in a state of flux for a few hours .  would you prefer him to learn the truth .  he would  had i not done so     even if he had to brow beat it out of hrsh hgn .         you should have asked me .      korodore sighed  and picked up a memory cube on the console .     i   m sorry  madam  but you have a security rating now of only    .     per cent .  i checked .  probably it   s only deep freudian impulses     but from now on i am afraid i must run this show .      like i said  madam  i   m not inclined to accept probability math .  you may  if you like .      he switched off .  she stood rigid for a moment  trying to contact him  then turned and began to talk brightly to a tall diplomat from the board of earth .   korodore turned his attention to the main hall .  dom wasn   t there .  his heart stopped until he realized that the boy had also moved out of one camera   s range to look at his presents .    dom opened the first package and drew out a pair of gravity sandals  glistening under their thin coat of oil .  the tag said     from your godfather .  come up and orbit me some time .  it gets damn lonely .      dom grinned and buckled them on .  for a hectic few minutes he bobbed and swooped among the struts of the dome  gliding to an unsteady halt six inches above the floor .  he felt that the sandals would probably be the climax     most of the other presents would be much less interesting .   from hrsh hgn came a fat rectangle .  dom unwrapped a memory cube and ran his finger over the index face .  the cube lit up  the title page standing out in white letters a few centimetres above the surface and revealing     the glass castles  a history of joker studies  by dr hrsh hgn .  dedicated to chairman dominickdaniel sabalos of widdershins .      in smaller letters dom read     number one in a limited edition of one     imprinted on third eye saffron silica .         a high honour  indeed     said isaac .  dom nodded  and thumbed the cube at random to read         mystery of the galaxy .  as sub lunar has said  to the imaginative mind they form part of galactic mythology  the glass castles at the back of the galactic north wind .  these towers  built before the oldest of the official human races had discovered the uses of stone  are memorials to a race which        dom laid the cube down slowly and opened the present from korodore .      that looks dangerous     said isaac .   dom wielded the memory sword carefully  staring up at the almost invisible blur as it changed under his touch from sword to knife  from knife to gun .      hm     said dom .     they use swords on earth and terra novae  don   t they .  and on laoth  too .         yes  with metal blades .  they   re more ceremonial and satisfying than guns .  but that thing is made to kill people with .  not that i   m putting it down  boss .      dom grinned .     you   re mighty uppity for a robot  aren   t you .  in the old days you   d have been dismantled by the mob .         in the old days robots were considered to be non living  chief .      joan   s present was a simple black sadhimist athame against the time when he should be admitted to membership of a ceremonial klatch  while from his mother he received the deeds of one of her personal estates on earth .  it was far too generous  and typical of lady vian on those occasions when she remembered dom .   there were other presents from the minor directors and heads of subcommittees  most of them expensive     far too expensive to be allowed to keep  even if joan would permit it .  but dom looked wistfully at the deeds of a robot horse  presented by hugagan of planetary relations .  isaac peered over his shoulder and sneered audibly .      lunar manufacture     he said .     all right  i suppose  but not a patch on the ones we make on laoth .  they live .      dom glanced at him .      i shall have to visit laoth     he said .      the jewel of the universe  take it from me .      dom laughed and made sure that ig had a good purchase on his shoulder .  then he thumbed the control ring and the sandals lifted him up  through the dust laden beams that filled the dome  and out over the sea .   he spiralled low over the lagoon  where lady vian   s little tame windshells grazed  and felt ig scramble around his neck .  he glanced backwards and saw the little animal was riding him comfortably  pointed snout sniffing the wind .   below him he watched the shells cease their grazing and swing into a pattern so that  prow to stern  they formed a circle .  vian spent hours drumming simple tricks into their microscopic minds .   something stirred restlessly at the back of his memory  but he dismissed it carelessly and sought altitude .   he burst through the balloon trees ringing the lawn  bursting the fruits recklessly  and braked a bare inch above the grass .   joan i strode across the lawn to meet him  and kissed him with rather more tenderness than usual .  he looked into her grey eyes .      well  grandson  and how do you feel this day .         i feel on top of the world  madam  thank you .  but i must say you look rather tired .     she   s acting like a cool head  he thought     why is she so worried .   she smiled wanly .     it is always hard when one   s descendants make their way out into the world .  now you must come and meet people .      lady vian had walked slowly up  her face hidden in a heavy grey veil .  she extended a white hand .  dom knelt and kissed it .      so     she said     enter the master of the world .  who is your ferrous friend .         isaac  my lady     said dom .     an uppity robot who doesn   t want his freedom .         but of course     said vian     we are all of us in chains  even if they be only of chance and entropy .  have not the jokers put even the stars in chains .         you have a fine grasp of essentials     said isaac  bowing .      and you are presumptuous  robot .  but i thank you .  dom  i wish you would donate that swamp creature to a museum or a zoo or something .  it is so animal .      ig scratched himself and sniffed     then gave a long drawn out hiss .  dom looked over his mother   s shoulder and caught the eye of a tall man in a long blue cloak  who wore a heavy gold collar at his neck .  the man   s face was creased with laughter lines  and he winked at dom and gestured upward with his glass .  dom followed his gaze and saw a flock of flamingoes wheeling high over the domes .  for a moment they formed a circle .  then  with long slow wingbeats  they flew out to sea .    korodore sat back and breathed deeply .  short of poisoning the air     and a filter haze surrounded the lawn     the only way someone could attack dom now was with bare hand or tentacle .  at least  they could try  before concealed strippers separated them from their component molecules .   there remained the official progress through tau city .  dom would walk while the others rode  and would wear nothing but the lead and iron chain of office and seven invisible shields of various types  incorporated in the links .  most of the human worlds and one or two alien ones would have the route bugged  of course  and several had bribed korodore .  he          leant forward .  someone had walked into the field of one pinhead and was looking at him .  korodore had an uneasy certainty that the man was laughing .  he looked like a man who had laughed all his life .   korodore thumbed through the guest list .  blue cloak  tall     the man was a minor official at the board of earth   s agency in tau city  newly appointed      the man in the screen had lifted one foot so that he was balancing on his right leg .      madern  get a focus on the guy in the blue cloak .  no  better     gralle  can you get a beam on him .         got it  ko .  shall i take him out .      korodore considered .  earth was still powerful .  standing on one leg wasn   t a killing matter per se .      hold it .      the figure had extended its left arm  pointing the first and fourth fingers directly towards  it appeared  the security room .  he had closed one eye and was sighting along the extended arm like a weapon .   let   s see how you look without an optic nerve  thought korodore .   the explosion knocked him sideways .  he landed at the crouch  stripper levelled in a reflex action  and dived again as a second explosion and the beginning of a scream marked the weapon control console   s transformation into a plume of incandescence .    the guests applauded politely .  dom  at his grandmother   s nod  rose a few metres above the ground and said     i thank you all .  and i ask that the spirit of holy sadhim and the small gods of all races give me     give me       he stopped .   a low boom echoed from the home domes .   dom stared  and heard again in his inner ear the thin crack of a stripper shot in the transparent air around jokers tower .  images flooded into his mind  with fragments of speech that joined and became coherent  and the memory of the hot pain and the cool green relief of the swamp water      a dot in the air grew rapidly .  he heard his mother cry out  a long way off .   korodore dived with his clothes smouldering .  raw blisters were his hands  blood was his face .   he landed heavily by dom and shouted incoherently at him .  dom nodded  lost in a dream .   the man in the blue robe stepped lightly towards them  and took his theatrical stance .  ig shrilled .   korodore lurched forward  raised the stripper in both hands  and gave a growl and dropped its smoking butt .  in the same motion he flung himself towards the outstretched arm .   the ball of non light spun up above the blackened lawn and the landscape twisted .  see why was a bright sun .  in the painfully light sky it showed now as a darker speck .              understanding is the first step towards control .  we now understand probability .      if we control it every man will be a magician .  let us then hope that this will not come to pass .  for our universe is a fragile house of atoms  held together by the weak mortar of cause and effect .  one magician would be two too many .      charles sub lunar  cry continuum       the fish swims     vsss .   the bird flies     rsss .   the fungi squirrel run     gsrss .   the wheel turns and  all is one .        i must scream yet i have no mouth .   i must run yet i have no feet .   i must die yet i have no life .   the wheel turns and  all is one .      funeral song of the deep rocky region   five islands  phnobis .       the sound of the sea .  breathe .  but he could not breathe .   it came and went like the surf .  it was only a sound  but it carried strange harmonies     warmth  and softness .   dom floated somewhere on the breathing sea .   a man appeared  dressed in the old brown robes of a sadhimist adept garbed for the ceremonies of hogswatchnight .  the face was familiar .  it was his own .      don   t be so damn silly .  i am your father .         hullo  dad .  is it really you .      john sabalos gestured aimlessly .     no  i am an extension of your own deep mind .  hasn   t hrsh hgn taught you anything .  chel .  down all the stars  boy  you should be dead .  so much for probability math  therefore .         dad  what   s happening to me .      the familiar face faded .     i don   t know     it   s your dream     was left hanging in the air .   hrsh hgn appeared  standing in front of the familiar faxboard .      in an infinite universe all things are possible  including the possibility that the universe does not exisssst     he purred .     expand this theory  with diagramsss        dom heard himself say     that is not a theory .  that is a mere hypothesis .         ahh  beware of paradox .     the phnobe shook a finger .     for once you have a paradox let loose in  the universe you have a poiyt .         poiyt .         and let uss consider         isaac appeared  doing a soft shoe shuffle through the mists .      goodness  are robots allowed in this dream .  or do they have to sit in the second class dream at the back .  now here   s the plot  boss  see  really you are the hereditary chairman of earth itself but because of a palace coup you were sent here           no     said dom firmly .  that wasn   t right .      no  you have this wild talent which is the result of generations of careful breeding and all you have to do is give the word and hordes will           not me .  try the infinity next door .         no  well  the universe doesn   t really exist     we can   t hide this from you     except in your imagination  and so this secret organization called the knights of infinity  they           try some other universe  robot .         well  okay  if you want it straight from the shoulder  you are not important at all but you happen to have this magic bracelet which was made by the god of the universe and he wants it back and you have got to get together a few trusted friends  such as me  and travel many a weary light year to the searing fires of rigel and           uhuh .         i was only trying to cheer you up  chief .     the robot shed a tear of mercury .     we freudian extensions of personality have feelings too  you know .      dom .      who are you .      dom  can you hear me .      i can hear you .  what are you .      dom  if you can   t hear me  what can you see .   see .   he sensed a light above  tinted with green .   good  dom  you are in psuedodeath .  you do not know what that means .  we need your earnest cooperation .  we need access to your self memory .  will you perform these exercises .  good .  now we want you to form a mental picture of yourself .  we will show you how .  .  .   a long time passed .  before dom   s mind swam himself  a perfect copy .  it danced  and sang  and flexed embarrassing muscles .  then the voice made him go through it all again .  and again .   understanding was allowed into his mind .  the voice was that of a googoo tank operator .  or  rather  a series of them .   he had seen the men of the hospital rafts after a hard night with the dagons  grinning foolishly under the pallid nutrient bath as they flexed the muscles of their new green grown limbs .  googoo was one invention widdershins hugged to itself .  the surgeons said that if no more of a body was left than that tiny sliver of brain they called the mommet  a new body could be      no .   dom thought it again .  he could sense the tank man   s panic .  dom started to think questions .  darkness fell swiftly  and was replaced by the green light and no desire to ask questions at all .  a new voice said   think coherently .  you must breathe .  we have some more building to do .  think of something  say it in your mind  now .   unbidden  the green paternoster floated up through dom   s consciousness  the last words he would say before climbing into his cot as a child  after ending the night prayer with    god bless the household robots    .   he galloped through it .  it was senseless gibberish now  the centuries had twisted the words  but it still had power .      green paternoster  sadhim was my foster  he saved me under the poisoned tree  he was made of flesh and blood to send me my right food  mine right food and air  too         good .          that i might be a foe  and stop at two  to read in that sweet book which the great gods shoop  .  .  .      good .   dom plunged on recklessly  tasting the words         open  open  save me  dead  dead chel sea  halve the population roster and say the green prayer pater noster .      in the silence the tank man said     dom  you now have vocal cords .  you are breathing .  you have built yourself a mouth .  there is something you must want to do .      dom screamed .    he examined himself in the full length mirror .  everything was there  and in full working order .  the tank  working from his body memory  had duplicated nails  teeth  dna patterns and even healed the scar on his chest .  dom rubbed the place bitterly  remembering the flight in the marsh .   isaac creaked across the room and handed him his clothes .  he dressed himself slowly .   there was one alteration .  before he had been jet black and decently hairless  the result both of see why   s healthy ultra violet and the tannin injections .  now he had hair to the waist and  like the rest of him  it had a greenish tint .   the bouncy little creapii doctor in charge of the hospital tanks had explained it carefully  with a rare grasp of colloquial janglic .  but then creapii could so easily assume the mannerisms of other races .      it   s called googoo .  of course  i needn   t tell you that .  i used to go out on the hospital rafts once  but we   ve come a long way from those primitive limb replacement tanks .      anyway  mr chairman  it is alive in its own right .  it is in fact a highly complex organism under your control .  i can guarantee that it matches your body almost on the atomic level .  it will have certain advantages  of course     your heat tolerance  for example  .  .  . ah  yes  at your age i   m not surprised you should ask .  yes  your children will be human in every respect       and the doctor made a surprisingly apt dirty joke .     but be careful of misunderstandings .  it is now you  not some alien slime .  the colour .  the state of the art  i   m afraid     come back in  oh  ten years and i guarantee that we can turn out a body with not even a trace of green .  as for the hair  well  absence of hair is not yet a generic characteristic of a widdershins .  i   m sorry  at the moment it   s a warts and all process .      before you go  mr chairman  i would like to show you the hospital .  i   m sure the staff would like to meet you  uh  unofficially .  as for myself  i am proud to shake you by the manipulatory appendage .      dom fastened his choker collar and turned round .      how do i look .         pale green  boss     said isaac soberly .  he indicated a small plastic case .      there are some body cosmetics here  boss .  your mother sent them .      dom turned again and ran his pale green fingers over his face .  the googoo had tried to follow body pigmentation as far as possible  but even so he looked as if he had been on a copper rich diet for a year .  he had watched himself on the newscasts while he was recuperating .  the fishermen were already fiercely proud of a chairman who was completely green  and didn   t seem to mind that it was not as a result of prowess on the hunting sea .  but his mother   s unspoken comment was that it would offend offworld dignitaries .      beng take them .     he said out loud .     what do they matter .  anyway  green is a holy colour .      outside the little hospital six security guards stood to attention as dom walked out  followed by isaac and  at a discreet distance  some of the hospital staff .   hrsh hgn waited beside them .  he was holding a high velocity molecule stripper  and looking sheepish .      it suits you     said dom .      i am a pacifist  ass befits a philosopher  and thiss is barbaric .      they boarded the chairman   s barge  which was joined by five flyers as soon as it was airborne .   dom stared unseeing at the seascape .      who is replacing korodore .     he asked after a while .      darven samhedi  from laoth .         a     a good man .     but still  it took more than efficiency to be security man on widdershins .     will the phnobes take to him .         he is rumoured to have shown shape hatred .  we will ssee .     hrsh hgn looked down at dom .     you were fond of korodore .         no .  he didn   t encourage friendship  but     well  he was always there  wasn   t he .         indeed .      dom turned in his seat and looked at isaac .      and if you say one sarcastic word  robot            no  chief .  it crossed my mind that lord korodore was somewhat over enamoured of miniature cameras but that was his job .  he was a regular guy .  i mourn .      four months ago  thought dom  someone killed him and tried to kill me .   i am going to find out why .    a light drizzle was blowing when the squadron landed at the second sabalos home  a small walled dome near the administrative centre of tau city .  even lady vian came out to meet him  bundled in a heavy cloak  and looking slightly happier for being in a city .  tau was not overwhelmingly cosmospolitan  though a sight more so than the home domes .      that is not a becoming colour     were her first words .   they dined in the small hall .  down the table samhedi and the senior members of the household eavesdropped respectfully .  joan  after a polite enquiry about the hospital  was silent .   vian looked across at her son .     why don   t you try those body cosmetics .      dom caught the eye of a security man standing against the wall .  he had one green hand and a green patch extended all down one cheek and into the colour of his uniform .  the man saw him and winked .      i prefer it this way .         perverse vanity     said joan .     but still  i agree .  a piebald grandson i could not bear  but at least he is a uniform colour .      she pushed her plate aside and added     besides  green is a holy           green is the colour of chlorophyll on earth  certainly     said vian     but here the vegetation is blue .      joan glanced up quickly at the sadhim logo inscribed on the ceiling and then gazed at her daughter in law  her eyes narrowing .  dom watched them interestedly     too much so  for joan sensed him and folded her napkin deliberately .  she stood up .      it is time     she said     for our evening devotions .  dom  i will see you in my office in one hour   s time .  and we will talk .              dom entered .  his grandmother glanced up  and nodded towards a chair .  the air was musty with incense .   the large white painted room was completely empty except for the small desk and two chairs and the little standard thurible and altar in one corner  though joan had a way of filling up empty spaces with her presence .   in foot high letters along the facing wall the ubiquitous one commandment glared down on them .   joan closed her account book and began to play with a white hilted knife .      in a few days it   ll be soul cake friday  and also the eve of small gods     she said .     have you given much thought to joining a klatch .         not much     said dom  who hadn   t thought at all about his religious future .      scares you  eh .         since you put it like that  yes     said dom .     it   s a rather final choice .  sometimes i   m not sure sadhimism has all the answers  you see .         you   re right  of course .  but it does ask the right questions .     she paused for an instant  as if listening to a voice that dom could not hear .      is it necessary .     prompted dom .      the klatch .  no .  but a bit of ritual never did anyone any harm  and of course it is expected of you .         there is one thing i   d like to get clear     said dom .      go ahead .         grandmother  why are you so nervous .      she laid down the knife and sighed .      there are times  dom  when you raise in me the overwhelming desire to bust you one on the snoot .  of course i   m nervous .  what do you expect .     she sat back .     well  shall i explain  or will you ask questions .         i   d like to know the story .  i think i   ve got some kind of right .  a lot has been happening to me lately  and i kind of get the impression that everyone knows all about it except me .      joan stood up  and walked over to the altar .  she hoisted herself onto it and sat swinging her legs in an oddly girlish way .      your father     my son     was one of the two best probability mathematicians the galaxy has ever seen .  you have found out about probability math  i gather .  it   s been around for about five hundred years .  john refined it .  he postulated the pothole effect  and when that was proved  p math went from a toy to a tool .  we could take a minute section of the continuum     a human being  for example     and predict its future in this universe .      john did this for you .  you were the first person ever quantified in this way .  it took him seven months  and how we wish we knew how he managed it  because even the bank can   t quantify a person in less than a year with any degree of accuracy .  your father had genius  at least when it came to p math .  he     wasn   t quite so good at human relationships  though .      she shot an interrogative glance at dom  but he did not rise to the bait .  she went on     he was killed in the marshes  you know .         i know .       john sabalos looked out over the sparkling marshes  towards the distant tower .  it was a fine day .  he surveyed his emotions analytically  and realized he felt content .  he smiled to himself  and drew another memory cube towards him and slotted it in the recorder .      and therefore     he said     i will make this final prediction concerning my future son .  he will die on his half year birthday  as the long year is measured on widdershins  which will be the day he is invested as planetary chairman .  the means  some form of energy discharge .      he switched off for a few seconds while he collected his thoughts  and then began     the assassin  i cannot tell .  don   t think i haven   t tried to find out .  all i can see is a gap in the flow of the equations  a gap  maybe  in the shape of a man .  if so  he is a man around whom the continuum flows like water round a rock .  i know that he will escape .  i can sense him outlined by your actions like     damn  another simile     a vacuum made of shadow .  i think he works for the joker institute  and they are making a desperate attempt to kill my son .      he paused  and glanced down at his equation .  it was polished  perfect  like a slab of agate .  it had an intrinsic beauty .   the distant glint of the tower drew his gaze again .  he glanced up .  not the right time  not yet .  another hour         and now  dom  as you stand there torn between shock and astonishment  what do you see .  does your grandmother have that tightlipped  determined look she wears at times of stress .  how was the party  anyway .      dom  you are my son  but as you are perhaps learning  i have many sons     untold millions .  have  i say  but    had    i mean .  for in those billions of universes that hedge us about on every side  they are dead as i predicted .  you  who are flesh and blood  are also that one chance that lies a long trek behind the decimal point .  that chance that i am wrong .  but a student of probability soon realizes that by its nature the billion to one chance crops up nine times out of ten  and that the greatest odds boil down to a double sided statement  it will happen  or it will not .      i have studied you  and the billion to one universe in which you now stand .  it left the main sequence universe at the point of your non death .  universes are like the stars which some of them contain .  most follow the well beaten path .  but some  by the twist of a photon  career down strange histories which end in supernovae or impossible holes in space .  rogue universes now  crack under the stress of paradox or     what .      i will try to give you some help  because you will need it .  your assassin came from your present universe  can you understand that .  he wanted to prevent you discovering something that will make your chance in a billion universe the greatest in all the alternate creations .  but i   ve an inkling that whatever saved you from death came from your universe  too .  i   ve seen a lot in your universe but how can i tell you because  believe me  dom  if i did the paradox burden would split your universe at the seams .      he laid down the recorder and wandered idly into his outer office .  the secretary robot clicked into life .      if anyone calls i am going out to the tower .  i  uh  shouldn   t be long .         yes  mr chairman .         you   ll find a cube on my desk .  please send it to her managing directorship .         certainly .      john sabalos closed the door and went back to his desk .  he was still wearing his black and brown robes from the hogswatch celebrations of the night before .  he hadn   t slept  but he felt exhilarated .  it was false  of course .  knowing the future wasn   t the same thing as controlling it .  it just felt like it .  he picked up the recorder .      this i can say  however .  three things .  you will discover the jokers world  if you look in the right directions .  your life will be in danger .  and  thirdly     look up in the corner of the room .  run for your life .      he switched off  and laid the cube on his desk .   somewhere outside  over towards the east lawn  someone was playing the phnobic chlong zither  badly .  john stepped outside .  the clatter of joan   s old electric computer floated up from the kitchen domes  which meant she was processing the eighth year household accounts .   he breathed deeply .  something was adding a third dimension to his senses  etching the external world in high relief .  with a probability adept   s skill he located the cause .  the world was like wine  because this was his last day in the world .  the last of the wine .  and  they would kill him before he discovered jokers world .  dom should be luckier .   his personal flyer bobbed in the swell  down by the long jetty .   the door slid to .  with a light tread  he set off  quelling the wild elation that ran through him  because death was a serious matter .    his father   s voice stopped and the cube projection stopped .  dom shot a glance upwards .   something small glittered in the air  like a mote of metallic dust .  he heard joan   s voice  every word as crisp as frosty air .      samhedi  there   s another one in here .  be ready .         what is it .     asked dom .  the fleck appeared to have grown .      a collapsed proton .  does that help you .         sure .  like in a matrix engine .         something like that .  by the look of it it   s already ingested its own atom .  what you can see is angular light effect .  it   s being controlled .      the first thing that dom realized was that both of them were standing like statues .  the second was         i have seen that before .         it was the gravity whirlpool that got you before  though .  take one step now and it   ll be a bullet with teeth .  ever been sucked through a hole one micron across .         uhuh .         i   m sorry  that was tactless .  if samhedi doesn   t get here soon you won   t have to bother about that  though .         asphyxiation .  it   ll suck the air out of the room .     she nodded .   samhedi   s voice came from the wall grille .      when i say so  please to lie flat on the floor  keeping away from the approximate centre of the room     now .      dom caught a glimpse of a flying silver ball the size of a grape before he hit the floor .   when he rolled over it was floating a metre above his head .  there was an odd sensation of heat along his spine .  they had caught it in a matrix field .  it was still sucking up air like a miniature tornado .  presently it drifted out through the wall  leaving a hole with its edges twisted into high stress shapes .  he could hear shouts outside  and the whine of the matrix generator .   he helped joan to her feet .      you seem to have it all figured out     he said .      it was a sensible precaution .  after your     your party  it was days before we figured out how to get rid of the damn thing .  it was your robot who came up with the answer .         you couldn   t put it on a ship because it would eat its way through the floor     isaac .  what did he suggest .      they watched through the hole .  on the lawn outside  samhedi   s equipment was clustered around the baby black hole .  the silvery sheen had disappeared now .  it appeared as a point in space that wrenched at the optic nerves  and the men working around it had to hang on against the wind that was driving into nowhere .   three of them manhandled a tall cylinder until it was standing upright under the thing .  the cylinder was thick with matrix coils .      this should be quite impressive     said joan .      i   m getting the idea  i think     said dom .     the bottom of the tube is sealed  the matrix field stops it touching the edges  the air rushes in at the top  .  .  .      samhedi bellowed an order against the gale .  the thing     it looked like an eye now  a malevolent one staring straight at dom     dipped into the cylinder .   there was an explosion .   it was the cylinder  reaching mach one a mile overhead .  it sucked itself on towards the stars .      neat     said dom .     suppose it hits the sun .  no  you   d have a ship up there .  then what .         seal it up and dump it in deep space .  isaac suggested finding a genuine black hole and dumping it there .  that sounds like an invitation to blow up the universe  though  so hrsh hgn suggested accelerating it to about half as light as it was .  it   d accelerate  he believes  on interstellar hydrogen .         and end up drilling a hole in someone   s planet on the other side of creation     said dom .  he was trying to smile .   his grandmother reached out and took his shoulder .      you   re not doing badly at all  dom .         you neither  grandmother .         just because i am reasonably adept at disassociation .  you won   t see me when i choose to turn off .      dom shuddered despite himself .  he had been with friends when they turned off after da trips .  it was a discipline only taught within the sadhimist klatches .  a man could go for days  weeks  without being affected by his emotions .  one or two had told him it was a great sensation     there was a feeling of icy intellectual power  an ability to face problems shorn of the deceptive roccoco of feelings .  cool heads  they were called .  and then you turned off  and the backlash hit you  and you were glad to have an emotional friend around to unroll you with a crowbar and put you to bed     preferably with a bullet .      how long have you been cool .     he asked .      since dinner .  and for most of the last four months .  but that doesn   t matter .  you seem to have mastered the technique  anyway .  without drugs  too .         don   t you believe it .         one thing i   ll ask you to believe is that i never heard that second part of that cube before .  he was talking to you .  he did it           he did it for the million to one chance .  oh  there   s lots of ways .  if he   d foreseen all this  he could have put a simple time delay into the cube .  lots of ways     he said reassuringly .      and what will you do now .     dom tensed at the undertone in her voice .      it seems i   ve got to discover the jokers world .  half the history cubes say it never could have existed .         i can   t let you     said joan .      i   ll be safe until i discover it .  you heard the prediction .         your father could have made another mistake .  there might be a million to one chance  another one .  dom  someone is trying to kill you .  that was the third attempt .      dom backed away as she walked forward .      but the first time i dived into the marsh and i turned up forty kilometres away .  the second time something saved enough of me from that thing     someone   s trying to save me  too .  i want to find out who  and why .      he took another step back and let the door slide across .  then he turned and ran .      sadhimism  the pantheistic conservation religion founded in cold blood by arte sadhim  q . v .    the ruler of earth from           .  contemporary documents suggest that he devised the dogmas  beliefs and rituals of sadhimism in a day and a night  incorporating gobbets wrenched wholesale from druidism  the marginally surviving witchcraft practices  voodoo and the survival handbook for spaceship earth .  as a religion it worked well and achieved its purpose  which was solely to impress environmental thinking deeply on human minds  and then developed a life of its own and became greater than its creator .  sadhim himself was ritually murdered by a breakaway sect called the little flowers of the left hand path on the eve of good friday     the night of the long athames         charles sub lunar  religions of a hundred worlds .     dom lay on his bed  reading a long rambling letter from keja .  she was glad to hear that he was better  life on laoth was quite pleasant  and there would be a state visit to earth soon  and she had seen snow for the first time     and enclosed a refrigerated cube in which several snowflakes were preserved     and dear ptarmigan had built her a garden that dom really ought to see      isaac slipped in on well oiled feet .      well .         there   s guards all over the place  boss .  i can   t find that gecky frog anywh           that   s shape hatred talk  isaac .         sorry  chief .  the cook says he   s left the domes and moved down to the buruku .      dom buckled on his grav sandals .     we   re going to fetch him .  he   s the only one round here that knows more than three facts about the jokers .  and then i kind of think we   re going to look for the jokers world .      the robot nodded impassively .      well .  aren   t you going to ask why .         up to you  boss .         it   s just as well .  it seems i   ve got to fulfil a prediction .  i   ve been pretty bad at fulfilling them lately .  i think i will find one or two answers on the way .  you know about the third attempt to kill me .         oh yes  and all the others .      dom froze .  he looked up from stuffing clothing into a back pouch and spoke slowly .      how many others .      isaac hummed .     a total of seven .  there was the poisoned food in hospital  the meteorite that just missed the power plant  two attacks on the flyer that brought you here .  and another artificial black hole .  that turned up in the hospital .  you were still in the tank then .         they all failed           by luck only  chief .  the hospital food     i think you didn   t eat it  but one of the cooks did .  the meteorite           odd attempts .  inefficient  too .     he thought for a moment  and then packed the memory sword that korodore had given him .  as he turned  his eye caught the pink cube resting on the cube case .  hrsh hgn   s joker thesis .  he packed it .      i   m not safe here  that   s for sure .  we leave now  while it   s still night .         if you try and fly you   ll fry .  samhedi   s got the force screens up around the walls .  we could try walking out .  you   ll have to order me to use necessary force  though .         right     said dom .      in full  please .  if the fuzz get me afterwards  it   ll all be down on my recorders .  can   t disassemble a robot for obeying orders  eleventh law of robotics  clause c  as amended     said the robot firmly .      then get me out of here  using no more force than is necessary .      the robot walked over to the door and called in the security man who was standing guard down the corridor .  then he pole axed him .      not bad     he said .     enough to stun but not enough to shatter .  let   s split  boss .       the buruku was built on the outskirts of the city  where the dry land sloped towards the marsh .  it looked like a field of mushrooms under a grey dome .  each mushroom was a reed woven rath  some of them several times larger than a human geodome .  the grey dome was the low degree force screen  just powerful enough to keep the atmosphere within damp and still .  it was polarized too  so that the light that filtered through was dim and subterranean .  inside the air was warm  clammy and smelled of decay .  dom felt that if he breathed deeply horrible moulds would sprout in his lungs .  it was what        phnobes called home .   towards the centre of the colony the raths huddled together in a fungal township riddled with alleyways and sprouting several distressingly organic looking towers and civic buildings .  shops were still open  though it was well past midnight  they mostly sold badly dried fungi  fish or second hand cubes .  from some of the larger raths  bulbous as fermenting pumpkins  came snatches of haunting chlong music .  and all around dom phnobes filled the streets .   in a purely human environment a solitary phnobe looked either pathetic or disgusting  from its goggled eyes to the slap of its damp feet on the floor .  in the rath they loomed like ghosts  self assured and frightening .  most of the alpha males carried long double bladed daggers  and any visitor with a concealed inclination towards shape hatred ended up walking with his back pressed firmly against a comfortingly solid wall .   at one point they had to press into the crowd as a wickerwork delivery truck trundled by .  it stank  it was powered by a ceramic engine fuelled with fish oil .   and the air was filled with hissing  a susurration like the wind  the sound of phnobic speech .  dom enjoyed the buruku .  the phnobes had a way of life divorced entirely from the carefully stylized penury of a sadhimist ruling family .   dom found hrsh hgn seated in a communal jasca  playing tstame .  he glanced up at the two of them  and waved them into silence .   dom sat down on the stone seat and waited patiently .  hrsh hgn   s opponent was a young alpha male  who looked at dom disinterestedly before turning back to the board .   the tstame men were crude and badly coordinated  which was to be expected from a public set .  even so  they were being directed across the squares with a gawky grace .   red   s pawns had dug a defensive trench across one corner of the board .  white had tried the same tactic  but had stopped work and the pawns were clustered around one of red   s knights  who was haranguing them .  as dom watched  red   s sacerdote shaman brought his mitrepike down on the kill button of white   s accountant  and in the ensuing m  l  e managed to get several pawns through the crossfire from the rooks .  the king made a brave attempt to run for it but was brought down by a flying tackle from the leading pawn .   hrsh hgn   s opponent removed his helmet and made a grudgingly complimentary comment in phnobic before loping away .  dom   s tutor turned .      i want you to help me find jokers world     said dom .   he explained .   the phnobe listened politely .  at one point he said     i   d be interessted to know how you survived a black hole that removed korodore .         yes  and ig .         but no  that is not sso        he reached down beside him and picked up a wicker cage .  inside  ig fizzled .      i found him in the busshess at the edge of the lawn .  he was badly sshaken .  he must have left your sshoulder somehow .         and you looked after him     that   s surprising  for you .      hrsh hgn shrugged .     no one elsse would .  the fisshermen are supersstitious of them .  they ssay they are the ssouls of dead comrades .      the swamp creature looped itself around dom   s neck .      are you coming with me     us .         yess  i think sso .  i accept bater .         i never did find out what that word meant .         it refers to the inexorable processesss of what you humans are pleased to call fate .  where did you think of starting .  don   t look so blank .         it   s just that i expected a lecture on my duties as chairman .  as my tutor you were hot on the subject  i seem to remember .      the phnobe smiled  switched his headset on and turned to the board .  the tstame mannikins stood up  ranged themselves into two neat rows  and marched down a flight of steps that appeared in one of the neutral squares  carrying the temporarily disabled .      the point doess not arise now     he said .     ass a mere frog        he looked sharply at isaac        i suggesst you follow the path predicted .  bessides  ass a joker student of ssome repute  and an amateur probability mathematician to boot  i feel intrigued .  tell me  are you embarking upon thiss because it hass been seen to happen in the future  or has it been seen to happen in the future because you are following the prediction now .         i don   t know     said dom .     but i know where there   s a ship           mr chairman .      impressions crowded in on him .  the low ceilinged room had gone quiet  suddenly  like the switching off of a music cube  leaving the sort of silence that is even louder and hangs in the air like fog .  the players bent over the tstame tables did not move  but now they seemed tense .   the chlong trio stopped playing .  ig whined .   samhedi stood in the doorway  flanked by two minor security men .  and they were armed .  dom remembered korodore   s advice  one day when the dead man was feeling expansive  that only the foolhardy or unimaginative carried projectile weapons into a buruku .  korodore had in fact hefted a regulation double bladed knife  and then diffidently  on the rare occasions he went in .      we have come to escort you home  mr chairman .      dom strode towards him and said politely  too politely     you were number two on terra novae  weren   t you .         i was .         who told you to carry stunners into a buruku .      samhedi swallowed  and glanced sidelong at the guards .  the room seemed to sprout ears .      your predecessor would not have done such a thing .  you might just have precipitated an interracial incident .  now unbuckle those things and throw them on the floor .         i have orders to see you safely home       began samhedi .      from my grandmother .  she has no authority .  what law am i breaking .  but you   re breaking phnobic custom        he had driven the man too far .  samhedi growled .      what gecky customs do these frogs have  anyway .      he said it in bad phnobic .  one by one the phnobes stood up  tshuri knives glinting in the deep gloom .   the alpha male that had played tstame with hrsh hgn loped up to samhedi and threw his knife into the floor between them .  samhedi looked at dom .      it   s a challenge     said dom .      suits me .     the security man raised his stunner until it was level with the phnobe   s face .  the phnobe blinked impassively .   samhedi fired .  it was a low intensity beam  just enough to stun .  the phnobe fell backwards like a sapling .      and that   s my        dom had disappeared .  a knife took the stunner and two fingers from the man   s hand .  he gaped  and looked up at the ring of blank  large eyed faces       isaac helped the two of them through a small rear window as the noise in the jasca rose suddenly .  they darted across the road just ahead of two flatcars laden with security men .      the stupid geck     said dom .     oh chel  the stupid geck .         intelligence is humanity   s prime ssurvival trait  therefore it iss as well that those who don   t sshow it be weeded out     said hrsh hgn  philosophically .      where to now  chief .     said isaac .     round here it   s beginning to look like whole erse on slain patrick   s eve .         great great grandfather was occasionally less than honest in his business dealings .  there   s a private yacht at the spacefield .  it   s there for use if any high ranking sabalos feels the need for a     a           an impromptu vacation .     suggested hrsh hgn .           the universe was divided into two parts  separated by a five centimetre shell of monomolecular steel .  on the inner side was the interior of the luxury yacht one jump ahead  superbly outfitted for one passenger but badly cramped for three  one of whom was metal and another was smelling of swamp water .   on the other side was the rest of the universe  composed almost entirely of nothing with a trace of hydrogen .  there were also the inhabited planets of human creapii space .   there was terra novae  metal rich and dynamically technological .  third eye  forested from tundra to mangrove swamps  where the wind sang eerily in the trees and the humans were more alien even than phnobes  and talked with their minds and eyes .  on eggplant the vegetarians were ferocious  and had to be .  on the drosk   s world of quaducquakucckuaquekekecqac visiting humans picked uneasily at the horribly familiar food and were thankful that drosks were too well mannered to do more than look hungrily at guests .  there was laoth  where the only living things were human beings     yet birds flew and the brooks were full of fish      on every world hot enough to boil water one of the sub races of creapii clustered .  in the deceptive emptiness of space swam the sundogs and the race called the pod .  and there was the first sirian bank         sixteen     said isaac .      this is a distrustful universe in which we live  certainly     said hrsh hgn .   ig  with the ease of one who had lived in zero g all his life  floated around a bulkhead with another struggling body in his mouth .  it looked vaguely like a grasshopper  and had in fact quite a sophisticated copy of an insect brain     but rather better than insect ears .   dom turned from the viewscreen .     old korodore really had this ship bugged     he said .     look for pinheads  too .      from orbit widdershins was grey blue and big  studded with strips of cloud .  the dawn terminator was nudging tau city .  a grey cloud hung over it .   the drive cabin was small and apparently full of elbows .  isaac sat hunched up in the pilot couch .  he looked up .      i have your grandmother on the line  chief .  are you in .         does she sound angry .         no  very cool .         chel  that   s even worse .     he switched on the intercom .      i have got very little to say to you  dom  except to remind you of your duty to the planet .  doesn   t it mean anything to you .  you may be killed .      dom took a deep breath .     i may be killed anyway .  at least there   s no false sense of security here .         fool .  you are just seizing the chance to jaunt off on an idiot quest .  and incidentally  there   s a shape war brewing down here .  half a squad of guards have been slaughtered in the buruku .  the one at tau city is on fire           samhedi took his men in with stunners .  you know guns are against all phnobic law .      there was a pause .  dom glanced at the screen .  the pall over tau city had grown .  as he watched  a point well to the west of the city suddenly flashed into a streak of blinding light .  the sunlight had reached the jokers tower .      that was     foolish     said joan slowly .     nevertheless  officers of the board are entitled to some respect .  i   m declaring a state of emergency .  a ship will pick you up within the hour .      dom cut the connection and spun round to hrsh hgn .      can you get through to the leader of all the burukus .  the servant of the pillar  isn   t it .         you know not what you assk .  however        in three minutes dom was looking at a screen holding the image of a small  lightly built phnobe  wearing a silver collar .  a female .  phnobes were generally reticent about their sex .      on behalf of the board     he said     what may we do to repair this grievous hurt .      the servant hissed .     the soil of the buruku has been disgraced .     dom nodded .  the bururu was covered to a depth of several inches with phnobic soil  specially transported .      we could replace it     he said .   they haggled .  finally dom concluded the conversation with a suitable expression of regard and said     it   ll cost us several hundred thousand standards in haulage charges alone .         can you authorize board expenditure .         board expenditure nothing .  it   ll come out of the sabalos personal account .     he sat back  suddenly tired .      there is another problem     said isaac from his seat .     like  where are we going .  and how are we going to get there .         hrsh .      the phnobe pinched his nose .     the first sirian bank would make a good starting point .  according to legend he was created by the jokers .         oh .  i hadn   t heard that .  and he   s my godfather .         well  it issn   t true .  he iss at least three billion yearss old  ass far as he knows .      isaac whistled .  there was something on the deep radar  drifting purposely towards the ship .      it   s a sundog  touting for business     said dom .     there   s our passage to sirius .         count me out .     shrieked the phnobe .     i   m not travelling on one of thosse animalss .  i thought this sship had an interspace matrix .         it had     said isaac calmly .     it probably worked real good in dom   s great great grandfather   s day but now the settings are all anyhow .  fancy ending up inside a star .  think of the loss to letters .         very well then .  but under sstrong protesst .      twenty minutes later a shadow eclipsed the stars .  the sundog stopped a few hundred metres from the ship  a fat lozenge flashing like a beacon as it turned slowly in the sunlight .   isaac peered into the scope .      it has orange  purple and yellow markings  boss  with a black band across the yellow .      dom sighed with relief .  not all sundogs were friendly  or bright enough to realize what would follow if they forgot themselves and engulfed a small spaceship .      that will be the one who calls itself abramelin lincoln stroke enobarbous stroke    .   enobarbous mcmirmidom     he said .     he   s okay .  he does haulage work for us .      a thought stole unbidden into his head .   hullo  spaceman .  you wish to travel  maybe .      please take us to the first sirian bank .      price for journey  seventeen standards .   the ship bucked slightly as the sundog reached out and enveloped it in a pseudofield .  the giant semi animal rotated slowly to face the actinic blue star  inasmuch as a sundog had a face .      this is undignified     moaned hrsh hgn .     carried by a dog like so much freight .      to be ready .      would you rather grandmother caught us  in her present mood .      to be steady .      frssh .         come on  now  face it like a cosmopolitan .      go .   an invisible hand wrenched see why out of the sky and hurled it at them .  they were falling into the sun .  then they were falling around the sun .  they skimmed over a blurred sea of blue white fire that broke on the reefs of space  its roaring a dim thunder inside the pseudofield  towards a glowing horizon that had no curve .   and the star dopplered behind them .  sundog soared up into the interstellar dark  singing .   silence filled the cabin .      wow     said dom .      urghss .      isaac peered at the matrix panel  and dimmed the ship lights .  in the darkness there were only the stars ahead  and they began to flare blue .      prepare yourselves to become a relativistic impossibility        sang isaac .   illusion .   dom knew about the things seen in interspace .  the larger ships usually had screening around most of the hull  and perhaps an unscreened lounge for the incurably curious      a white stag galloped through the cabin wall  which glowed under an orange light .  it bore a gold crown between its horns .  dom sensed its fear  smelled the rankness  saw the sweat matted hair on its flanks     but its hooves merged with the floor  and floor and skin merged and flowed continuously .  it reared  and leapt through the autochef .   dom saw the huntsman on his black horse when he brushed through the wall of the drive cabin like bracken .  he wore white  except for a red cloak hung with silver bells  and his face beneath yellow hair that billowed in an intangible wind was pale and set .  for a moment he looked at dom  who saw his eyes gleam momentarily like mirrors and a hand go up protectively .  then horse and rider were gone .      chel .  he almost seemed real .      isaac grinned .     he almost certainly is  somewhere .         uhuh .  they say interspace is where all possibilities intersect .  i got the feeling he sensed us .         a spirit on the wind  no more .      dom stood up unsteadily .  the walls still looked as if they had been made of second hand moonlight .      now there   s an illusion i   ve heard about .      a red globe the size of a fist drifted easily through the shielded windows .  he watched fascinated as it passed through the autochef  part of the main cable conduit  and the floating figure of ig  who stirred uneasily in his sleep .  it disappeared in the general direction of the matrix computer .   it was an interspace interpretation of a star  probably bd        .  they were harmless enough  though a red giant or a spitting white dwarf could be unnerving to watch as it passed through your body .   dom looked round after hearing a scuffle .  hrsh hgn was wedged under the autochef  in the foetal position .  it was almost an hour before he was persuaded to emerge  blinking with embarrassment .      we phnobess are not perhapss so ressilient ass you       he began .     intersspace sscares uss .  it is a region of uncertainty .  who knowss that we may not ceasse to exist .         you appear to be all here  physically and mentally .      the phnobe nodded sheepishly .   isaac closed the maintenance panel on the autochef .      it   s a        model  a quality job     he said .     i can   t find a printout for the menu  anywhere .      dom nodded .     i think great great grandfather intended the one jump as a one man ship .  i should imagine the menu is programmed into it .         quite .  he   d be so busy fleeing from his creditors he   d have no time    sorry  chief  i think maybe i stepped out of line a little there .         it   s okay .  he was a bit of a pirate .  but according to the family history he was a strict sadhimist  too .  simplicity was a virtue .  i shouldn   t expect it to run to anything more appetizing than bread and maybe fish .      the autochef used simple molecule breeding techniques to duplicate dishes stored as probability equations in its menu .  the one aboard one jump ahead gurgled after it was switched on  broke into a low buzz for several minutes  and extruded a table from a base slot .  another  larger slot opened and the meal slid out .   they stared at it for several seconds .  dom reached out and picked up a crystallized fruit  gingerly .   hrsh hgn coughed .     the intricate bird with the honey glaze i recognize     he murmured .     it   s a croupier swan .  i think the blobss are cream .      dom took the lid off a silver dish .      some class of a shellfish baked in    well  it tastes of eggs .      isaac picked up a cut glass goblet and downed the contents in one swallow .      old overcoat     he said .     the genuine stuff .  two glasses and you lift off on a pillar of flame .      they stared at him .  he put down the glass .      haven   t you seen a robot drink before .     he asked .      we were wondering        dom stopped  embarrassed .          where it goesss .         we new model class fives can derive power from the calorific content of organic substances .     he reached for his chest panel .     if you like i can           we believe you     said dom .  he looked down at the table again .     did i say something about the virtues of simplicity .  i think it may be against sadhimist laws to eat this .             you will not waste        quoted hrsh hgn .     there are timess when it iss a pleassure as well ass a duty to follow the one commandment .      ten minutes later  dom said     hrsh hgn  this damn black jam tastes of fish .         it   s caviar .         caviar .  i   d always wondered .  on widdershins only poor people are allowed to eat it .  i suppose they get used to it .      twenty minutes later the autochef digested the remains of the meal .  ig drifted towards the matrix room  chewing a fish head .  a small  burned out wreck of a star passed crosswise through the cabin and disappeared .  dom watched it go .      if the first sirian bank is the galaxy   s leading joker expert  why hasn   t he found jokers world .     he asked .      i assume you don   t mean that he should have roved across the universe  roche limits being what they are .  a thing the ssize of the bank would upset the balance of the average solar system  probably .  as to exploration via the available data  he may well have disscovered jokerss world .  why not .  why  then  sshould he tell uss  mere upstart civilissationss .         we   d pay well .         we .  we .  phnobic we .  human we .  let uss assume the race who findss jokerss world gains immeasurably .  why should he want that .      dom frowned .     but he runs himself as a bank .  he charges for his services  too .         he choosess to .  a creature musst do something to relieve the boredom of three billion years .  he likes people around .         you mean he wouldn   t like to see anyone get hold of the world because they might put the bank in jeopardy .         maybe .  it iss all conjecture .      he started to talk about jokers world .    three races walked like men .  one of them was man .  taller than men  but generally lighter  were the phnobes .  much smaller than men  but built more on cuboid lines so that they looked like heavy gravity chimpanzees on a steroid diet  were drosks .   phnobes came in three sexes .  they had a secondary  vestigial brain .  they evolved on a world with no readily available metal .  in cerebral matters they were supreme .  a world where most of the higher animals were adapted to a tri sexual system needed a race with brains .   drosks came in two sexes  eventually .  it made sense on a harsh  bitter world .  the young males evolved into mature  strong minded females after about the first third of their life .  their social system was intricate but was surpassed in complexity by their religion  a fiery edifice involving the double star and three large moons in their system .  drosks were cannibals  it was part of the religion .  drosks found it difficult to conceive of a number greater than seven .  drosks periodically built up a machine age civilization then  for no well understood reason  carefully dismantled it and reverted to barbarism .   compared to all the other fifty two races known  drosks  phnobes and men were like brothers .  to some races  like the spooners who lived on little icy worlds  they were merely identical .  many others would be incapable of thinking of them as life at all     like say  the tarquins  who lived in the upper layers of some protostars .   a few races had a large conception of life .  the creapii lived on small  hot worlds  in the deep layers of the larger gas giants and occasionally on the surface of very cool suns  but could discourse on philosophy with men as easily as they could discuss the untranslatable with tarquins .  then there were the sundogs  who were merely raw life and derived their picture of the universe from the minds of their customers .  the first sirian bank was in a class of his own  as always .  a few races     the pod  for one     were alien even to spooners and tarquins .   but all the races had one thing in common .  they were all less than five million years old  and all had originated within a sphere of stars less than     light years across  centred on wolf     .  the creapii discovered that first  and so were the first to investigate the one planet that orbited the wolf .   they found a joker tower  a monomolecular spire frosted with frozen methane  standing dark and alone under the airless sky .  they found the thing later known simply as the centre of the universe .   the creapii ranged far .  they found more towers  other joker artefacts like the ring stars  band and the internal planets of protostar v .  as an incidental  they found earth and sold a working matrix motor for homesteading rights on mercury .  the creapii were beginning to feel in the grip of a galactic mystery  and had long before decided that they needed extra insights .   seventy standard years later a joint man phnobe team deciphered joker curiform c  the only one of the five joker scripts translatable .  there were hints of a great civilization  although the word was only an approximation  and there was probably the first poem in the universe .   geological evidence suggested that the towers were all between eight and five million years old .  they were ranged more or less equally across the light years  accepting all energies  radiating none .   the creapii knew that they had recognizably evolved from the mildly intelligent salamanders about four million years before  to judge from the desiccated aluminium polysilicate remains on their planet around    ophiuchis a .  they knew of no race older .   they were long lived .  they had travelled up the tentacle     creapii mythology saw the galaxy as a giant creap  with a glittering carcase of stars     to the sparse stars at the rim .  they had sailed down the tentacle to the cathedral of stars at the hub .  the stars were barren .  there were one or two freak accidents .  but generally  life was still merely some slightly more complex chemical changes .  only in the bubble of stars behind them did worlds teem .   impetuous races would have reached a definite conclusion hastily  maybe in two or three hundred years .  the creap minds  of which each individual had three  did not jump so readily to conclusions         and what conclusion did they reach .     asked dom .      the creapii are powerful  and slow  and thorough .  they have as yet reached no conclusion .  they are seeking the meaning of life .  why sshould they hurry .         chel .  isn   t the theory that the jokers seeded our stars before they     uh     moved away .  come on  you know it is .      the phnobe nodded slowly .     that is certainly the hypothesis that the joker institute appears to work on .      dom bit his lip  and opened his mouth to speak .  hrsh hgn raised a hand .      you are about to assk why .  boy  remember that of fifty two races in the life stars you  an earthman           a widdershine .         true  a widdershine of earth stock     can only vaguely understand the mental workings of perhaps three or four races .  why should we hope to understand the jokers .         but the institute did understand joker curiform c .  it was one of their languages .         yes  but a written language is merely a machine to convey information  and once we had the key it was remarkably easy to translate .         how was it broken .         they used a poet  and a mad computer .      hrsh hgn picked up the cube of pink silica that had been his present to dom  thumbed the reference face and set it to project .  the words of the joker testament hung in the air  glowing .   you who stand before us  we have held the stars in the hollow  of our hands  and the stars  burn .  pray be careful now  as to how you handle them .   we have gone to wait on our new world  there is but one  it lies at the dark side of the sun .        pretty derivative stuff     said isaac .     that last couplet is really a singlet .         i must admit it is better in phnobic     said hrsh hgn .     as for the rest  well  you musst know most of it .  on a purely practical level  hotheads have searched every sizeable body in the bubble and many out of it .         now we   re getting down to the nitty gritty     said isaac .     you   d have had to include suns  of course  and the deeps themselves .  although it sounds more likely that the jokers originated on planet somewhere .         the popular belief is that jokers world is laden with wonders beyond belief     said hrsh hgn .      sitting in here it   s hard to get some idea of the deeps  but they must be big enough to hide a world in .  the jokers might have had a world with no sun     said dom .      it   s just conceivable     agreed hrsh hgn  politely .      it   s been thought of  huh .         about once every five years .         how about it being invisible .     said isaac .  dom laughed .      maybe     said hrsh hgn .     you   d heard of ghost stars  dom .         uhuh .  so dense that not even gravity escapes from them .         now this is just an idea to kick about  i   m just dropping it on the plate to see if anyone pours mayonnaise on it  but you could outfit an entire solar system with matrix engines and drop it into interspace     said isaac .  dom was about to laugh  but looked sidelong at hrsh hgn .      that   s the legend of the prodigal sun     said hrsh hgn .     a low temperature creapii story .  yes  you could do it in about fifty years    time  at our present rate of technological expanssion .  the catalytic power would not have to be too great .  but the practical application of the matrix equation makes it impossible .     he caught dom   s blank expression .     you see  you do not need a great deal of power to drop even a large mass in and out of interspace .      hrsh hgn used more technical language to explain that it was the on board computer that really counted .  since a body in interspace was theoretically everywhere at the same time and would if randomly dropped out almost certainly materialize in the centre of the nearest solar body  the navigational matrix computer was very necessary .  it had to be big        everywhere    was a large volume to be quantified .  the bigger the body  the greater chance of error  so the bigger the computer .      the sundog carrying us now registered a current drain in microamps to achieve interspace .  it   s little more than a mental discipline .  four fifths of its body iss a hindbrain designed to locate it accurately with regard to the datum universse  with fortunately just enough sspare capacity to allow for the extra mass of a mediumssized sship .      to get a medium range star successfully through interspace you   d have to have a computer about one hundred times its mass .         how about one planet .     asked dom .      the graphs meet at planets like phnobis or widdershins  small and dense .  you could just about do it if you hollowed out the world and filled it with computers .  but this is a fruitless line of sspeculation .  personally i believe that the jokers        illusion .    ig was keening .  dom opened his eyes and blinked .  he was soaked in sweat .  one arm ached .   at the far end of the cabin hrsh hgn had been thrown like a doll across the gear locker .      isaac .      the robot let go of the handrail that ringed one jump   s cabin .      rough  huh .     he asked .      i feel like someone just hit me with something large  like a planet     said dom .     or a large asteroid .  what   s happened .         we   re between stars .  it looks as though the sundog dropped out rather clumsily .      dom floated up  trying to quieten his stomach .  it appeared to be knotted .  his head ached .   hrsh hgn groaned and woke .     frghsss       he swore .      sundog .     said dom to the empty air .   apologies .  journey interrupted owing to circumstances beyond control .  disturbance in interspace matrix spaceframe .  we must detour in datum space .   isaac was glued to the deep radar .      it   s still several million kilometres away     it must be throwing one hell of an interspace shadow .  it   s taking its time .  it   s a cone     oh  my  will you look at that .      they stared into the screen .  on maximum magnification it showed a pyramid tumbling deceptively slowly through space  flashing faintly as starlight caught its polished faces .  there was no mistaking the outline of a joker tower .   dom swam into the pilot seat and asked the sundog to take them in closer .  in a few minutes they were a few kilometres away .  the tower hung steady against a starfield that spun like a mad planetarium .      the institute of joker studies pays a million standards bounty for details of new towers     said dom .     i want to catch it .         in a pig   s eye     said isaac .     that mass at that speed .  it   s a job for twenty sundogs .      right .      well  we can plot its course .  there   s a reduced bounty for that sort of information .  we could split it three ways .      four ways .      okay  four        dom struggled for breath .  something had caught him in a vice  and was squeezing hard .   he sensed the ship .  he was acutely aware of the convoluted atomic structure of the hull .  the little deuterium pile in the matrix computer sparkled like a witch ball left over from hogswatchnight .  isaac was a coruscation of currents flowing over coiled alloy wire  suffused with the sickening feel of metallic hydrogen .  the sundog brain throbbed dull purple with vague semi thoughts .   beyond the ship  beyond the tumbling tower  he felt the other ship .  it was waiting for him .  someone had known that he would pass under this area .  he felt metallic hydrogen again     the feel of a robot mind .   he felt inside the sundog   s mind .  there was a jolt as its field polarized and the tower receded instantly against the stars .  for a moment he felt the rage of the mind in the other ship .  then it was gone  lost in the static as the sundog sank gratefully into interspace .   and something withdrew from his mind  gently .  he had time for a very brief feeling of loss  of the unfair restriction of a mere five senses     then the reaction hit him .   he didn   t fall  because there was no    down    .  but he hung bewildered  listening to the puzzled protests from the sundog .  hrsh hgn and isaac were staring at him .  then the phnobe took him gently in one bony hand and hauled him down to the bunk .      i saw everything     muttered dom .     something was looking through me  there was an assassin waiting at that tower  you know            ssure     murmured hrsh hgn .     ssure .         believe me .         ssure .         he had a molecule stripper .     shouted dom .      something made the sundog get the hell out of there     admitted isaac .     was it you .      dom nodded violently  and then added slowly     i think so .  but     but just before  i saw     would you believe i saw probabilities .  i saw us powdered by that stripper .  but that was in another universe .  we escaped  in this one .  chel  i can   t describe it .  we haven   t got the right words .                 we have given this case a great deal of thought .  we do  of course  find nothing to argue with in the purely geophysical reports put before us .  we note that this world known as the first sirian bank is a planet with a diameter of seven thousand miles and a crust consisting almost entirely of crystalline silicon and some associated elements .  we have also heard some delightful evidence from dr al putachique of earth  its import being that over the billennia earthquakes and so forth have caused the formation of billions of transistor junctions within that crust  forming by natural means the largest computer in the galaxy .  we are of course aware that the bank has for many years been used as the accounting house and general information repository of most of the human and near human races  and is officially treasurer of the star chamber of commerce .      the appellant has asked for the legal status of human .  he wishes to be accorded the status of living creature .  is the bank alive .  by every definition he is not .  that  at least  is what we have been told .      but we disagree .  it has been impossible for the bank to be physically present here today  roche limits being what they are  but this chamber has spoken with him at length .  towards the end of this unusual interlude my colleague from earth made a reference  i understand it to be from some kind of theatrical entertainment  to the fact that it seemed unfair that the merest virus should have life while the bank had none at all .      we find it nowhere stated that an entire world may not be accorded the status of a living creature  or even of human .  it may be a trifle unusual  a little irregular .  nevertheless  let it be recorded that we find the first sirian bank not only alive  but possessed of a universe view sufficiently advanced to call him human .  and may his orbit never grow less .      his furness craagh        mediator  the star chamber       .   see also life  a legal definition by his furness       .       dom dodged into a booth and waited a minute before glancing out through the clear crystal panel of the door .  there were two or three thousand people in the central hall  but none seemed to have noticed him .   in front of him was a black crystal wall  studded with innumerable pinpoints of red light .  they clustered thickly around a plain copper disc  set flush with the crystal .  it hummed  said     please state your business .      dom relaxed .      are you the bank .     he asked .      no  sir .  i am a teller  merely a comparatively simple servo mechanical subunit .         uh  okay .  then please transfer seventeen standards to the sundog racial account     he said  while invisible eyes tactfully examined his retinal patterns  voice inflections  dna helix and teeth .      transaction completed .         and i wish to notify the joker institute that i have located a joker building  description and position as noted .      he pressed a copy of the one jump   s log into a recess below the disc .      bounty will be paid on verification .      dom wondered if the assassin lurking at the tower had also registered discovery .  he knew there had been an assassin .  somewhere in totality was a universe where dom sabalos was dead .  but of course  there would be many such universes .  according to p math there was at least one universe for every probability  even the unthinkable ones .      business completed .     asked the disc .   dom frowned .  it was his first visit to the bank  although it was officially his godfather .  the bank sent him greetings on the appropriate ceremonies  like his minor twenty eighth year birthdays  and small  interesting presents like the gravity sandals he was still wearing .  the gifts suggested a thoughtful personality .  the greetings cards told nothing at all  except that they were generally signed in crescive high degree creapii iv  a favourite script for multi dextral amateur calligraphers .  the problem now was making contact .      i am dom sabalos  the bank   s godson .  i would like to see him .         you have only to look around  sir .     the machine meant it seriously .  dom realized it was not equipped to handle figurative speech .      i meant that i wanted to confront him  converse with his  uh  seat of consciousness .      there was a pause .  at last the disc said     very well  sir  i will see what can be arranged .      dom hurried out of the booth .  hrsh hgn was lurking suspiciously behind a glittering germanian pillar that soared up half a mile above the paved cavern floor .  the next essential was fresh clothing  and then a real meal     there was something curiously unsatisfying about the reconstituted molecules of the ship   s auto chef .  he pushed past a party of medium degree creapii and hailed a cab .   the main cavern of the first sirian bank was big enough to need a sophisticated weather control system  to prevent the formation of thunderclouds .  the cab looped up from the crowded floor and threaded its way at speed between coruscating pillars  each with its cluster of booths at the base .  the red junction points glowed everywhere .  occasionally a ring of static electricity would flash up a pillar and burst vividly into an ozone reeking haze .  and the hot dry air hummed with a million voices  felt rather than heard  as money spoke to money across the light years .   in fact  dom considered  it looked like an early conception of hell .  with tourists .  certainly some of the tourists would have fitted the concept nicely .   in one of the sub caverns a robot tailor outfitted him with an anonymous grey ship suit  the sort worn on every earth human world .  he also bought a cuber  a cloak striped on the bias in purple  orange and yellow  and hoped that an observer would take him for what he appeared to be     a back planet rube  a stock whole erse character of comedy sketches  the gawping rim colonist with a nasal twang  unfortunate personal habits and a pocketful of rare earths .   he turned and looked critically at hrsh hgn  who stood watching in the old ceremonial garb of a beta male .      couldn   t you wear something a bit more colourful .  some phnobes do .  i   d rather you didn   t look conspicuous .      hrsh hgn took a nervous step backwards and clutched at his robe .      is it against the law .  i mean  will it offend some sexual more .  if so  of course  i           it   ss not exactly that .  i do not think i could carry off the character of an alpha  you understand  they are somewhat more flamboyant  more warlike  lesss given to featss of the intellect         at dom   s command the little robot dressed the phnobe in a complicated toga of heavy blue and olive green fibres  shot with flecks of silver .  a tshuri knife fully twice the length of hrsh hgn   s old one hung on an ornate belt .      if an alpha challenges me i shall make a poor showing .         still  you look different .     he paid the robot  and they walked out with hrsh hgn making a brave attempt at a swagger .   the temperate lifeforms dining room of the grand hotel  the only provision on the bank for accommodation  seemed almost as big as the main cavern and more impressive because the size was made up in human terms .  the long cavern was filled with the roar of appetites in the process of satiation  reeked with the aromas of many foods and narcotics  and looked rather more like hell than the main cavern .   dom found two places at a table in the human section .  the previous occupants  a thickset earthman with a face criss crossed with duelling scars and a small battered class one robot  nodded familiarly at dom as they passed .      do you know them .     asked hrsh hgn as they sat down .      not that i can recall     said dom .     there   s something odd about them .  he looked a wealthy type .  what   s he doing with a mere class one .         one of life   ss little myssteriess     said the phnobe .   they ate in silence .  the diner beside dom was energetically digging him in the ribs with a horny elbow .  it was a young drosk  who looked up  gave dom a canine grin  and bent back to his plate .  dom carefully refrained from looking at what he was eating .   on the other side a party of female phnobes of the long cloud group were arguing sibilantly .  beyond them was a pineal human  performing a complex third eye food ceremony over his rice bowl .   dom ordered fish and bread .  hrsh hgn had a fungi stew .   the class two waiter trundled up with their bill and tactfully ascertained dom   s credit rating with the bank .      divert a tenth standard for yourself     added dom .      many thanks indeed  sir     said the automaton .  it added politely     i have always had a high regard for sinistral humans  sir .         who said i was from widdershins .     dom tried to pitch his voice low .  several of the phnobes looked round .  but the robot had rolled away .      your face     said hrsh hgn simply .   dom reached up  and then caught sight of his hand .  the greenish tinge of googoo .  of course it was used on other worlds in exceptional circumstances     and under strict licence     but that made no difference .  in popular mythology  any green man was a widdershine .      i don   t think you need bother too much     said the phnobe as they walked out .     whoever thiss asssasssin iss  i doubt if he will be fooled by dissguises .  he iss using probability math to put himself in the right place every time .         he   s not succeeded so far .  remember what happened at that tower .         don   t bank on it .      a small two wheel class one trundled towards them and tugged at dom   s cloak .      lord sabalos  bank will see you now .  to follow me .      it rolled away on its balloon tyres .  they followed it at a walking pace .   dom looked around him and made no attempt to disguise his awe .  he was beginning to feel like a rube anyway .  the times he had left see why   s system were few enough  but he closed his mouth firmly when he found it was hanging open .   the main cavern had been opened out near the north temperate fault  the result of an ancient computer quake that had slid two continent sized silicon slabs together and created several quintillion important circuits .  it had happened when earth was still molten .  historians suggested that it had marked the awakening of the bank  the colossal  thundering moment between dead piezoelectric rock and sapience .  on this point  as on many concerning its personal history  the bank was silent .   the robot led them up a shallow slope against the fault and into a branching tunnel hewn from the living     it was a fair statement     rock .  the pinpoints clustered thickly here .   a sphincter door opened .  they went in .      dom .  come right in .      the room was small and brightly lit .  thick carpets covered the floor and there was a large potted palm in the corner .  against the far wall was a desk  simply furnished .  a robot sat behind it .  it had been stripped of most of its outer casing  including its head  and was strung about with auxiliary equipment .  ropes of cables connected it to the wall .  it was smoking a cigar through an extended tube .      greetings to you  too  hrsh hgn .      dom stared at the cigar .      not primarily an affectation     said the bank .     there is a certain sensual pleasure  you understand .  and it helps to put some of my more nervous visitors at their ease .  a robot is humanoid .  when on top of that it is smoking a cigar it is far more relaxing to converse with than              a planet sized computer .     suggested dom .     hello  godfather .         i trust your family is in good health .         reasonably so  when i left widdershins     said dom .     it   s very good of you to see us .         not at all .  i always have time for my godchildren .  and hrsh hgn  of course  one of the more promising amateur students of the joker mystery .      hrsh hgn nodded graciously .      godchildren .     asked dom  interested despite himself .     i  .  .  . uh  .  .  .  thought i was the only one .         i have several thousand .  it pleases me to see them grow up and make their way in the universe .  and now  dom  the subject concerning which you no doubt came here to consult me .      the red lights in the wall flared .      i refer to the attempts on your life  your father   s predictions  and your current quest .  the failed assassinations  first .      dom told his story .  occasionally the light patterns would change .  at last the robot laid down the cigar and the bank spoke .      there is  you realize  one comforting aspect .  these attempts failed .  that suggests a fallible agent .      dom sat back .     yes  but the failures weren   t     i mean  they were not natural .  something happened .  i feel like a tstame puppet  as if i was being moved about by a couple of players just so that i could fulfil some prediction .         but you readily set out to find jokers world  without forethought .      he tried to think of an intelligent answer .  none was forthcoming .  why had he been so ready .  he was scared  yes  and wanted to run away .  there was most of the galaxy to see .  it was an adventure .  but he had to admit there was more to it .      it seemed the right thing at the time .  i can   t explain why     he said  simply .      you accepted fate .  a phnobe would say    bater    .  a philosophic drosk would say you heard today   s echo of tomorrow   s scream .  you acted out of unconscious foreknowledge .      dom   s shirt moved and ig poked his head out and blinked at the lights .      as far as widdershins is concerned  i find no reason why you should be killed .  as far as senior planetary management is concerned  there are far worse in the galaxy .      i have been running a probability program on you for several seconds .  it appears that you will discover jokers world .  now there is a general belief that the joker institute seeks out and kills all those it predicts may discover jokers world .  but that is mere conjecture .      behind dom hrsh hgn hissed softly .      you don   t seem surprised .      he felt the phnobe   s soup plate eyes on him as he said carefully     i know i will discover jokers world .  i knew when i heard my father say so .  i     felt things lock into place .  i will discover jokers world .  that   s why i set out .  it   s the most important thing that i must do .  no one can stop me .      he was surprised to hear his voice .  but he felt the certainty nestling securely in his mind now .   and the certainty faded  like a dream .  it left him mouthing  blushing .  he felt hrsh hgn   s hand on his shoulder .  ig looked up at him  with his head on one side .   for a few seconds the robot voice box merely emitted a faint static hiss .  then the bank spoke kindly in a softer voice .      don   t bet your life on certainties  dom .  beware of hubris .      hrsh hgn leaned forward .  in a voice slightly louder than necessary he said     reason suggests that if jokers world exisstss in the life bubble it would have been found .  i know one myth which ssayss they live on the core of procyon  where even creapii may not go .  what do you say to thiss .         as a matter of fact  i was interested in your theory as put forward in your recent cube .         your theory  hrsh .     said dom .     you didn   t tell me .         we were interrupted by that tower  remember .         it was a neat extrapolation on the phrase    the dark side of the sun    .  it would involve finding a binary star  of the epsilon aurigae type     the bank explained .   three minutes later dom said     i understand the idea .  and the creapii use sun rafts on some stars .         it is certainly the only case where a sun has a dark side .  there are  however  many binaries of that type  and a systemic search would be time consuming .         i gather you don   t agree with my ssuggesstion .     said hrsh hgn thoughtfully .      i praise it as imaginative thinking of the highest order     intoned the bank carefully .      iss it true that the jokerss helped you evolve  as the legend sayss .         i do not answer personal questions .  there is one factor you might consider .  why not run an extended set of equations on dom and discover exactly when and where he makes his discovery .  i have just run an analysis taking as its parameter the existence of jokers world and its imminent discovery .  i find i arrive at the mantrum   ncreg    brf   nultad  e yy                  nultad  tt   al     this is only a first approximation distillate .      hrsh hgn pulled a notecube out of his small carry all  and gazed at it carefully .      what value do you give the datum .     he asked .      ae d  in the usual sub lunar matrix .         then that ressultss in an almosst perfect collapsed field within the next twenty seven days .         excellent .  i did not know higher probability was a phnobic speciality .         it iss  you understand  in accordance with our universse view .      dom had wandered over to the potted palm and was fingering a leaf idly .  it moved under his touch  betraying itself as a vegetative shape changer from eggplant .  he let go quickly  and stroked ig .      i don   t begin to understand     he said  flatly .     to me it sounds like jargon .         jargon .      hrsh hgn turned to the bank .     nonsense     he explained .     in sadhimist tradition god invented it to foresstall the firsst attempt at intersstellar travel .  to prevent scientissts from understanding each other  you understand .  you will find it mentioned in the newer testament .      the pinpoints swam into a new position .  the robot extension gave a mechanical gurgle .      ah yes .  as we spread our circuitry less essential information  .  .  . you understand how it is .      the jokers did not show up on p math .  it was as if they never existed .  p math offered no explanation for the towers or the other artefacts .  wherever the jokers had been they left a shadow in the equations .   dom   s future was sure for twenty seven standard days .      that   s something to look forward to     said dom .     how about giving me a little hint about its whereabouts .         every inhabited body in the home bubble has been thoroughly explored .  i suggest a fruitful field of exploration is your own mind .  however  you may care to seek out him who lives on band .  he is old .  he has met the jokers .         but band is unoccupied except by sundogs     it   s been proved it could never develop a higher lifeform .         i have said too much .         well  will you work on the problem of my assassin .      the bank paused .     yes .         charge it to my personal account .         i will do so .  it is a pity you were not here earlier .  the greatest authority on the jokers  and certainly the most incisive mind in the galaxy  was here .      the atmosphere was perceptibly warmer .  dom relaxed .  the bank was hiding something  though .      i thought you were the most incisive mind in the galaxy     he said .      a common mistake .  alas  i am no more intelligent than the average creap  or human genius .  my bulk allows  shall we say  for breadth of intelligence rather than height .  i was referring to charles sub lunar .            poet  polymath  soldier of fortune        quoted dom .     was he the man i saw in the hotel .  scarred  he was  with an early class one robot .         he does not allow his likeness to be published     said the bank  and there was a hint of laughter in the voice .      uhuh .  i   m getting the hang of things .  i don   t think seeing him was an accident .  i thought he recognized me .  he looked rather self satisfied  so  .  .  .         dom  because you are my godson i will retail to you a certain fact .  your grandmother is at this moment in orbit above us  requesting clearance to land .      a screen by the robot   s arm flashed into life and dom saw the familiar shape of his grandmother   s personal mftl barge drunk with infinity drifting against the stars .      she has just referred to me as  i quote  a    diseased ball of rock    .         i   m not certain i want to meet her     said dom .      mysself neither  my word .         this could be exciting .     a panel in the rock wall ground back .     this is an inspection shaft .  leave this way .  where will you go when you leave me .         to band  then  to see this person who is old .         as old as the hills  as old .   .   .     the bank paused .  there was no sound  but dom got the distinct impression it was laughing .         as the sea .  move .       take the creapii .   take them as the jokers .  it was an old theory .   they were an ancient race  and they were adaptable .  literally so .   once there had only been one kind of creap  the silicon oxygen creaps of low degree  living in barbarism and molten phosphorous sulphides on a small world hugging close to the fires of one of the    ophiuchis .  seventeen light years away  a brighter than average ape was seeing real possibilities in banging two stones together .   the creapii were kindly  patient  and intensely curious .  they were also pathologically humble .  when they spread into space  they changed the creap to fit the situation .   half a million years of gene manipulation and radical molecular restructuring produced the middle degree creaps  based on a silicon carbon bond  a dynamic species that lived happily enough at       .  soon afterwards the vats stabilized the intricate aluminium silicon polymers of the high degrees  the ones that occasionally floated their rafts on cool stars .   there were others  including even a boron subspecies .  wherever a star warmed a rock beyond the melting point of tin  there was a creap to bask in its beneficence .   the creapii had a long history .  they sought knowledge as other  cooler animals sought game .  they were polite  and gentlemanly in their dealings .  they mixed well .  they lived in heat  but had no sexes .   dom had liked hrsh hgn   s theory .   there are many binaries in the galaxy .  and often they are an ill matched pair  one small  dense and actinic  the other huge and red .  there is day on the red stars  just occasionally .  and there is night on the hemisphere where the bright star does not shine .  dark .  there can only be darkness on a sun by contrast .   on this sun the jokers lived .  they  .  .  . would have to be like creapii  with an armoured integument .  certainly the huge rafts  poised on a heat contour  would have to be protected .  before the creapii discovered matrix power their rafts floated on a down draught of oxidized iron  but the jokers must have been more inventive  .  .  . a race that twisted the chain stars would have to be inventive .   power would be no problem .  power enough would be very close indeed     but it was only a theory      take men .  the jokers had ceased to build their strange artefacts long before man arose  brother to the apes  but who knew where men had come from .  and men were adaptable  or could adapt themselves .  there had been a thousand years of colonization .  now the sinistrals of widdershins had night black skin  no body hair  a resistance to skin cancers and uv tolerant eyes .  by mere chance  too  half of them were left handed .  on terra novae men were stocky and had two hearts .  pineals had more in common with phnobes than other men .  the men of whole erse lived in a permanent war .  eggplanters were simply strange  and edgy  and vegetarians green in tooth and thorn .  and men  it was admitted  were the sort to glory in planet sized memorials .  weren   t the leading joker experts men .   spooners could have been jokers .  as many artefacts were found on cold worlds as hot ones  and the dark side of the sun took on a new meaning in the far orbits .  sidewinders  tarquins  the pod  the two evolutions of seard     they all could have been the jokers .   somewhere was the jokers world .  it had been a legend so long that it was not open to doubt .  there  waiting  were the secrets of the towers  the machines that made the chain stars  the frictionless bearing  the meaning of the universe .    the pinpoint junctions cast a pale light along the tunnel .  dom hurried forward  darting around a small wheeled robot that was inspecting a junction box .   they broke into a cavern  and hrsh hgn stared up at the shadowy machine that loomed above them .  he nudged dom and pointed upwards .      do you know what that iss .     he hissed .      it   s a matrix engine     said dom .     warship size .  the bank   s got his own ships  hasn   t he .         i believe not .      a wheeled robot braked in front of them .  it extended a padded arm and pushed at them  ineffectually .  they hurried on .   the tunnel led into a cavern off the main hall .  it was thronged  as usual .  the entrance to the ship park was on the far side .   they split up .  dom dodged among the groups  keeping an eye open for widdershins robots .  hrsh hgn loped stiffly in what passed on phnobis for a conspiratorial walk .   dom was halfway across the glittering floor when he glimpsed joan entering the hall  with three security robots on either side of her .  she seemed to dwarf them .  she looked determined .   he ducked back and a hand gripped his shoulder .  he spun round .   the man was smiling .  the smile looked awkward on that face .   he saw the blue robe and the heavy gold band around the neck  and dom remembered .  he tried to back away  but the hand followed him .  it was the man at the party .      please don   t be afraid .     dom squirmed under the grip .  there was a flurry and the hand flew off his shoulder  ig   s needle sharp teeth buried in a finger .  but the man did not scream  although his faced paled .  dom stepped back into the embrace of a robot .   he took off .  strictly speaking  flying within the bounds of the bank was illegal .  he just hoped the bank would not interfere .   the sandals were built for one  though they could operate in strong gravity fields .  below them two other robots were staring vacantly upwards  and across the floor two more had hrsh hgn cornered .   there was an eerie calmness about the vertical flight .  the roar of the crowd dropped away  leaving only the underlying thunder of the bank .  he looked into the robot   s multifaceted eyes  which mirrored the corona effects on the surrounding pillars .      you   re a class two  aren   t you .     he asked .      that is so  sir     said the robot .      are you equipped with any motivation towards personal safety .         no  sir .     the robot glanced down .     unfortunately .      dom kicked his heels together and went into a dive .  thirty yards above the floor he twisted and felt his shirt tear as the robot lost its grip .  it continued to fall in a long arc which ended abruptly in a glistening pillar of germanium .  there was a flash and a rain of hot droplets .   two other robots were rising from the floor on lift belts .  dom shot upwards  giddily  watching the distant roof grow .  it was specked with black dots .  it was only when he drew nearer he saw that they were caves .   it was hot near the roof .  the air roared into the caves and dom flew with it  because there was nothing else to do .  he swam in a torrent of warm air  which buffeted him as it thundered along a tunnel .   and over hell .   he was able to look down for a few seconds before the hell wind caught him .   he had been carried out into a mile wide ventilation shaft .  between his feet the walls narrowed down  mile after mile  lit at the end by a white hot eye .  thunder rolled around the shaft .  it sounded like the churning of distant mighty engines .  and the heat was palpable  tangible  like a hammer .  it caught him like a leaf and fired him like a bullet .   dom tumbled out of the shaft and towards the stars  balanced on a gout of superheated air .  night was all around him .  in one direction     up and down had lost their usual positions     was the web of cold stars .  in the other there was just one  a hungry red eye with a white pupil .   it seemed to drift away .  smoke from the grav sandals streamed around him .  something else had caught him  something which was always waiting  beyond the light .  he wondered  dimly  through layers of pain  what it was touched him almost pleasantly  freezing his breath in his throat and making a pattern of crystals across his blistered skin .   widdershine are agile .  among the fishers the awkward  the clumsy soon lost all their lives  and something of this rubbed off among the board families .  and so dom landed on his feet  hard  and fell forward into the snow .   he knew what snow was .  keja had sent him a preserved snowflake from one of the colder regions of laoth  and it looked something like the thin frost that briefly mantled the polar swamps of his own world  in the coldest winters .  but keja had not said that there could be so many of them .           on widdershins it was hogswatchnight  which coincided with small gods in the greater sadhimist calendar .  it usually meant a larger klatch meeting  or a number of klatches would join together in celebration  but by midnight every group would be split so that each member watched the dawn alone .  but as the older sadhimist averred darkly  one was never fully alone at hogswatch .  by dawn  perhaps  some men would be poets or prophets or even be possessed of a new minor talent  like being able to play the thumb flute .  and one or two would be mad .    the ground underneath him was warm .   dom lay in the tepid water for some time before he realized it .  he was spreadeagled in a large  steaming puddle .  beyond it the snowdrifts started .   he heard the distant air scream .  something hurled across the stars  trailing a sonic boom .  it turned in a tight  gravity squeezing circle  returned slowly and slammed neatly to a halt on the edge of the puddle .  except that it didn   t work .  the water was freezing again .  the ship danced drunkenly between the drifts and returned  a few minutes later  under very low power .   isaac opened the hatch .      now  are we getting out of this place or aren   t we .     he cried .       mint soda  chief .      dom took the glass .  ice tinkled .  frost was forming on the sides .  it tasted like a dive into a snowbank .   there was fresh green skin on his arms and legs and the back of his neck  where the googoo had reformed itself to his body memory .   isaac pressed the memory button on the ship   s workshop and slid the soles back on the sandals .  he tossed them across to dom .      short circuited in the heat     he said .     they should be okay now .      dom stared out at the starlit surface of the bank .  the warm pool had already frozen over .  it made a glittering circle in the snow .  he had been lucky  at that .  on the sunny side of the bank water boiled in the shade .  he raised the bank on the ship   s radio .   hrsh hgn had been taken aboard the drunk  destination unknown .  the bank knew nothing about the man with the gold collar  or the whereabouts of ig .  it had warmed the surface and sent isaac out because     because deaths on the bank were rare and he disliked the subsequent investigations .   dom switched off  and drummed his fingers on the console .  his face was reflected in the empty screen .   it was dark green  mottled with leaf green  because body memory took no account of tanning .  he was naked in the stable ship temperature .  the memory of recent pain still showed in his eyes  but he was thinking of a man in a gold collar  a smiling man who had haunted his dreams .      no one notices him     he said out loud .     he   s just a face in the crowd .  he   s trying to kill me .      idly he picked up korodore   s gift .  he   d already experimented with it  putting the memory sword through its repertoire  and now he watched as the atoms reprogrammed themselves .  a twitch  and it was a needles word  .  .  .  a short knife  .  .  .  a gun  that froze bullets out of atmospheric water and could fire them through steel hull metal     another gun  a sonic         i don   t know how grandmother chased me here     he said .     though it is the logical place .  but i know where the drunk is heading now .         widdershins .     asked isaac .      band .  she   ll get the information out of hrsh .  i imagine she   ll threaten him with repatriation to phnobis .         that doesn   t sound like a threat  chief .         to a phnobe it is .  if he goes back to phnobis he   ll be in swift conjunction with a ceremonial tshuri whatever happens .  no  he   ll talk .      isaac slipped into the pilot seat .      you could go back to widdershins .  your grandmother has your best interests at heart .         i   ve got to go on .  i can   t describe it  i just haven   t got a choice .  do you understand .         no  boss .  band  then .  i   ve calibrated the matrix computer .  it should work .         you   d better believe it .      he hefted the memory sword .  if someone else was waiting at band       glowing walls .  ghostly  half melting visions .  the miniature stars and claustrophobic feel of a ship in interspace .  and the visions .      chel  what was that .         it looked like a dinosaur  boss .  striped .       he fingered the collar at his neck  and showed no anger .  anger clouded the faculties  and so he lived in a state of constant disassociation .  but sometimes he thought  not angry thoughts  but little cold statements about what he would do if the collar was removed .   what he would do to asman  in particular .  and to the misguided genius who invented the collar circuitry .   the door opened .   asman looked up  and froze .  behind him the long room became silent  just for a second .  it usually happened like this .  and asman would point the gun      asman pointed the gun  and nodded towards the three dice in their cup .  the gun was a stripper  with every safety device removed and a hair trigger .  he knew that asman would fire by reflex action if necessary .   he threw three sixes .      again .     he threw three sixes .      again .     he asked mildly .  asman smiled weakly  got up and shook his hand .      i   m sorry     he said .     you know how it is .         one day i   ll make a mistake .  have you thought of that .         ways  the day you make a mistake like that you won   t be ways any more  and you know i   ll fire  because you   ll be an imposter .      asman rounded the table and clapped him on the shoulder .      you   ve been doing well     he said .      how else .      ways had seen his own specification  just once .  he had been halfway down an inspection shaft at the time  one that was flooded with chlorine gas when not in official use  and gaining illegal access to personnel files was not official .  he had never bothered to remember the precise purpose of his visit     it was just one of the many assignments that filtered down to him via asman   s office     but while the little inspection screen was warming up his specification had appeared among the random images .  he had memorized it instantly  even through the chlorine haze .   it was a standard requisition for a class five robot  with certain important modifications concerning concealed weapons  communicators  and appearance .  designing a completely humanoid robot was twice as complex as building even a high grade class five .  it involved intricate machinery for tear ducts and the growth of facial hair     and  if the robot was designed as a spy and might be faced with every eventuality  an intriguing range of other equipment also      but most of ways    specifications had been in probability math .  it took him some time to realize why .  class five robots were legally human .  they had been designed to be everything a man could be  and ways had been designed to be lucky .   asman led him to the mural that occupied one long wall of the large  low ceilinged room .  the room itself was featureless  as were the men tending the machines .  it could have been the security room of any board run world .  but there was something about the quality of the air  even of the light  that suggested an underground vault     ways in fact sensed the layer upon layer of shielding around him     and there was something in the confident  unthinking way that the earthman asman moved that suggested in which planetary crust the room was buried .   the mural was a brightly lit tangle of coloured lines  circles and blocks of p math  that shifted slightly as he watched .      you   ve done well     asman said again .     he   s moved along the right equation .         as to that  how do i know .  i just keep trying to kill him  just like the others .  do you want me to try on band .         no  your next point of intervention should be        he glanced along the rainbow lines        oh  not till he visits those creap .  we   ve got contingency plans for that .  it   s all in the equation  anyway .  we   ll be hot on their heels then  if they have heels .  the math says so .  one more intervention when he gets to laoth and we   ll be in the joker universe .      ways blinked slowly .     is this information i need to know .      asman returned his gaze .     what do you mean by that .         look     said ways  sitting down     you made me .  not you  precisely  but someone on laoth or lunar .  they made me .  i   m a robot .         that   s not held against you .  if we were creap we   d have simply bred up a creap with the required characteristics  in some vat .  but you can   t wamp up a man  so you            okay  but i   m a robot  even if i   m a special one .  i   ve got everything from toenails to offensive underarm odours  but that   s all faked .  so what does it matter what a robot knows .         you   ve made your point .  now  are you interested .     asman was growing impatient .      certainly .  why doesn   t he die when i kill him .         the universe alters .      shoot a man from point blank range  so that your beam dislodges every organic molecule from hair to feet .  all the rules postulate an outcome of  say  a monomolecular mist  a few zips and geegaws on the floor  and a faint smell of burning .  but there is always the outside chance .  the stripper goes imperceptibly out of sync .  or you hallucinated that you pressed the stud  and didn   t .  in a shifting universe there is no such thing as a rock hard certainty  only a local eddy in the stream of total randomness .  just occasionally the coin comes down on its edge  or doesn   t come down at all .      dom sabalos is likely to discover jokers world in        asman glanced at the far end of the mural        twenty days  standard .  we can   t stop him .  he   s our first failure out of  oh  it must be several thousand now .         two thousand three hundred and nine     said ways .     i killed them .         they all had the right life equations .  any one of them could have made the discovery .  his father  for example .         and now it isn   t working     said ways .     we   ve found some history we can   t change .  and we   re suspected  you know .  look at young sabalos .  all those precautions  on such a harmless world .  the sabaloses are a popular family .  after the death of his father they must have felt that he was in danger  too  and not from a widdershine .  i don   t think he was even told about the jokers until he was out of childhood .  another thing .  we are driving him to jokers world .      asman rubbed his hands thoughtfully .      we have considered that     he said .      if we hadn   t made the attempts he   d probably still be on widdershins .  instead he   s flying around with a robot and a joker expert     quite a good one  too  from what i   ve heard .      asman nodded .     of course  one doesn   t have to travel to discover     he said .     however  what you say is true .  we have been working on a contingency plan .  if all else fails we can follow him .      there was a heavy silence .  ways said quietly     to the dark side of the sun .         if there is no alternative  yes .  wherever it may be .  according to our latest equations  that is what we will do .         so you are preparing for it .         oh yes .  sometimes  robot  i get the horrible feeling that we live in a big ever repeating circle where we do things because it is predicted that we will do things     all effect and no cause .  we   ll go  anyway  and we will go armed .      ways looked at the man  and around the long low room .  for a moment he considered the possibility of a universe caught in a circle of predict and effect  the ultimate closed circuit  and wondered if the inhabitants would realize what they had done .      that   s not enough     he said .     why isn   t he dying .      asman shrugged .     would you believe the jokers alter the universe just so that he can remain alive .  that   s the current favourite .  maybe they want him to discover their world .  maybe     and this one is our prime hypothesis     they are waiting to be discovered .  perhaps this is all necessary to jog him through slightly differing alternate universes into the one where the jokers exist .  that   s an outsider  but worth considering .      ways was silent .      that gives you something to think about  eh .      he nodded .  then he pulled aside his cloak and made a few passes over his chest .  a partition slid back and he extracted a small cage  hastily soldered together from power wire .  inside  a small rat like creature  six legged and pink  gyrated and yowled  spitting at asman .      his pet     said asman .      i expect you knew about this     said the robot .      it   s on the board     he admitted .     we didn   t bother to go into details .  so this is ig .  strange little thing  isn   t he .         it   s an it     said ways .     ask me to tell you how they breed  and i   ll answer loudly and with gusto .  they eat everything  even artificial epidermi as it turns out .     he held up a finger  bitten to the alloy .     i   m the latest expert on them .  widdershine fishers say they   re the souls of drowned men  to which they may bear some resemblance .  they   re the third largest air breathing creature that the planet has produced .  phnobes think they   re lucky  and the fishers say that if one makes a pet of you it means death will never be lethal .  it could be they have a rudimentary psychic sense  like dogs or third eye dragons .  it   s difficult to see why  since they have no natural enemies and they   re something of a planetary totem .  the bomb should be planted inside the ribcage  i suggest .         bomb .         you plan that dom should be killed after we   ve discovered the position of jokers world .  you didn   t tell me that  by the way .  i suggest that this is what you have in mind .  this thing sticks to him .  i can see it gets back to him .      asman covered the cage .     as a matter of fact  we have considered something like that .  fine     he added  with just a hint of nervousness .   while an underling spirited the cage away he added     you enjoy food .         to some extent the calories are a useful power supplement  as you know .      so they went to the dark side of the sun  a low mock phnobic building built on and merging with the sand hills between the joker institute and the minnesota sea .  it was one of many .  the institute had attracted a sizeable town  based on the joker industry  a limited amount of tourism and alien visitors .  most of the earth tourists came to see the aliens and feel cosmospolitan  and the management of the dark side tried to cater for this .  the walls were decorated with imaginative hologram murals     creapii sun rafts drifting across lutyen          a drosk eight unit at a funeral feast  grim faced gardeners fighting a rogue tree on eggplant  spooners doing nothing very comprehensible on an unknown ice world .   there were sculptures  too .  the phnobic display was unconvincing and probably a fake  although the snow sculpture by an unnamed tka peninsular drosk was almost certainly genuine  and so was the     thing  difficult to describe or even to comprehend  that spun slowly around the ceiling  occasionally bumping the walls .  the floor covering was an alive and semi sapient bowdler  on the payroll  and the serving robots were genuine laothans .  the dark side was in fact well patronized by the more adaptable aliens  who appreciated its cooking and prized its uniquely earth ambience .   a copperplate motto on the menu read     we serve anything .         there   s the story about the drosk chieftain who walked in here and demanded her grandmother   s brains on toast     began asman  as they sat down .      and they said sorry  we   ve run out of bread     said ways .     that story gets around  i last heard it on    nova .  i   ll have what you have  if it   s starchy .         we   ll eat pineal  i think .  fast luck couscous .      behind asman   s head was another mural  and since it was a special one it made the table rather special too  which was why asman had been shown there with a great deal of ceremony .  the director of the institute was a big attraction .   the mural depicted a score or so of the more recognizable races grouped in an obviously subordinate position around a throne  on which sat a man .  he was human  though attenuated like a pineal  and wore a harlequin suit and a cap and bells .  he was smiling .  behind him was a sun  one hemisphere in shadow and the other appearing from this angle only as a thin crescent .      any special reason why the joker is human .     ways asked .  he took a handful from the steaming pot  kneaded it expertly and swallowed it whole .      not really .     joker    is a purely human translation .  if you are going to portray one in representational terms  he   s got to be human or humanoid     said asman .  he grinned sidelong at ways .     do you agree with the rest of the symbology .         the joker as lord of creation .  it chimes in with the idea that they gave life a hand in these parts .  there   s something about the expression that suggests it wasn   t from altruistic motives .  slave races .         possibly .  humanity     and i mean real humanity  the sort that ends at lunar     cannot afford to meet the jokers whatever they may be .  they   ve had at least five million years    start on us .  more important  they had the galaxy to themselves .  they didn   t have to learn how to get along .  that   s why we run the search .  we can   t afford to let them find us first .         you assume they   re still alive  then .         what could have killed them .  what sort of gods     or devils     have they become .  i think they are hiding .  and waiting .         what will happen to me .     asked ways quietly .  asman looked startled  then assumed a blank expression just a moment too soon .      you want to leave the institute .         this     ways fingered the gold collar     is the only thing that binds me .  yes  i want to leave .  i know how much i cost .  that   s the advantage of being a robot  there are no big unanswered questions .  i know my worth  i know why i was created .  i   ll repay every pico standard .  but you can keep the humanoid trappings .  i won   t need them .      he somersaulted backwards  smashing the chair and landing with his legs folding under him ready for the next leap .  it took him across a table and towards a running man  who fell with ways    alloy hands gripping his wrists just hard enough to agonize .  a small sonic gun bounced on the carpet  which writhed .   the robot   s arm flicked out in a quicksilver motion and a finger stabbed at the man   s neck .  he collapsed  neatly and without a sound .  ways bowed an apology to a diner from whole erse  who was gazing at his shattered meal  and strode back to asman   s table .      i   m sorry about that     said the director .     assassins are a hazard in my line .         he was too noisy focusing that sonic     said ways .     i hope you were given due notice .         oh yes  three days and a regular united spies contract .  but i didn   t expect anything here  the management have an arrangement .  i trust they   ll register a complaint .         did the contract say who was behind him .         no .  it was the old standard projectile or energy discharge form .  i think it was one of my     but that   s my problem .  thank you .      two institute security guards walked in tactfully and removed the body .  ways scanned the room .  two minor board of earth officials were complaining to the head waiter  but the non earth diners had settled down again .  some of them may have thought it was part of the floor show .  during the starveall ceremony on whole erse there were dancers who     ways clamped down on the unwanted information  and glanced at two diners half hidden by the luxuriant growth of a dormant eggplant pinpointer plant  a large  scarred man in plain but well grown clothes  and an antique serving robot .  they hadn   t even looked up during the assassination attempt .  they were playing some game with small robots on a chequerboard .   he turned to asman .      i will leave     he said .     after this last affair is concluded  i will sever my connection with the institute under the seventeenth sub law of robotics .  thank you for the meal .  it was most energizing .  good evening .      when the robot had gone asman sat back and gazed at the far wall thoughtfully .  there was a chiming in his inner ear  followed by a familiar voice .  two familiar voices .  except that they weren   t voices  they circumnavigated the tedious aural processes and arrived fresh at his consciousness .      interesting .         possibly so  but i suggest you dissassemble him immediately     said the second voice .   asman thought     mr chairman  how many are sitting in on this .         just myself and the lady ladkin .  this is by no means a formal board meeting .  we watched the proceedings with interest  though without  i fear  unanimity as to conclusion     came the first voice .   asman nodded to the waiter and strolled out into the night  taking a winding  sand strewn path back to the institute .      ways will go through with it     he thought .   lady ladkin   s tone was petulant .     why do we need to bother with this robot .  i know a dozen people who have the required combination of loyalty and mayhem .         my lady  apart from the prediction that a robot such as ways would be used by us     he hurried on quickly before she could interrupt     he has certainly proved himself in similar assassinations .  he initiated the novean board debacle  for example .  my lord pan  may i be heard .         go ahead     came the rumbling tone of the chairman .     at present i am attending the premi  re concert of the third eye tactile orchestra .  they lack sparkle .         my lord  and my lady  i arranged this evening as you wished  at some risk to myself .  the assassin might have succeeded .  us were understanding about my request  but i had to sign a waiver  and i dare say they put their best man in .  now  you know we monitor the robot .  he hates the institute  of course  and to some extent he had sympathy for sabalos           as indeed i do also     said pan  and this time asman caught the distant echo of the orchestra .     i believe i met him once .  his grandmother and myself were once very friendly .  old  she must be now  very old .  a fine woman .  ah  we have heard the chimes at twenty four hundred hours  master shallow .         we must consider the boy as an instrument  my lord     thought asman patiently  picking his way between the dunes .     ways feels sorry for him  but i think i have proved to your satisfaction that in actions he has no choice but to be loyal to us .  as he himself said  he is a robot  and even a class five can be built with certain imperatives .         that collar        began lady ladkin .      it will activate itself in the unlikely event of ways taking any but the prescribed course     thought asman soothingly .   she grumbled and was silent .      may i go ahead  then .      there was another echo of music .     this is derivative stuff .  oh  yes  go ahead .  we are secure in our predictions  aren   t we .  i am not altogether happy about booby trapping his pet     i myself have several cats  of which i am fond     but we must be practical .  proceed .  i look forward to receiving your full report .      asman was suddenly alone among the dunes .    dom awoke .  for a while he floated  piecing his thoughts together .  then he pushed himself forward with his toe and drifted across the cabin .   day had come to this side of the band  although the evening terminator was visibly racing across the planet  and the band on band was fully visible .   it was a       mile wide equatorial strip of land that girdled the fat world like a corset .  even up here band appeared to revolve so fast for a planet that an imaginative observer half expected to hear a background hum .  it bulged .  the band was a grey brown strip of mountain  one continuous        mile range  edged by two ribbons of blue green grassland .  they were bounded by two strips of darker sea  which reached up to the squashed poles and the white ice .      it   s explainable in terms of continental drift  high rotation and ancient vulcanism  boss     said isaac  looking up from the autochef .     or didn   t you want to know .         it must be a hell of a place to live on     said dom     what with the sun scooting across the sky and all .         the sundogs like it .      dom nodded .  it was their world .  they had evolved on eggplant  but     years ago had accepted a cash grant and the deeds of band in exchange for vacant possession .  sundogs were nice  but dangerous to live with in the laying season .  so far dom   s telescopic survey had revealed nothing but herds of sundog pups which could be seen from space as large dots at one end of thousand mile long swathes grazed through band   s ubiquitous sweetgrass .   there were two narrow strips of marshland  and rivers in the mountains .  there was one small lake .  there was absolutely no sign of any habitation .   dom had checked on the world .  the creapii backed wildlife preservation fund ran a small robotic observation station on the planet  as part of a treaty which also forbade unauthorized landings .  the fund headquarters said that there had been suggestions that a being known as chatogaster was a pre sundog inhabitant  although the planet had a meagre selection of vegetation and no animal life at all .  no  no signs of sapience had been exhibited by the vegetation .  band had no higher life of its own  which was why the sundogs selected it .  chatogaster was considered to be a sundog legend  or a planetary spirit .  no  there had been no recent landings .  very rarely a ship had to put in under the emergency clause  but the robot station was equipped to handle that .  thank you for your enquiry .   such sundogs as dom had been able to raise had refused to discuss the subject .  there were a lot of them orbiting the planet .   as band spun below the ship they came yet again into radio range of drunk with infinity .  the set crackled and joan spoke .      still not coming down  dom .  be reasonable .  i don   t think you are being astute about this at all .      her voice made a background as dom unshipped the telescope again and peered down at the planet .   seen from several thousand miles up the drunk was a squat blob at one end of a long shadow which  dom swore  shortened as he watched it .  it stood in the middle of the rolling continental plain of grass  midway between mountains and sea and only ten miles or so from the solitary lake .  here and there around the ship the yellow light glinted off metal .  robots .      anyway  you   ve been up there for hours .  you will have to land soon for air  and i happen to know that by now you can   t have enough fuel to take off again .  be reasonable .  i am not your enemy .  please come back to widdershins  you don   t know the danger you   re in .      dom looked across at the fuel tell tale for the hundredth time .  she was quite right .   in desperation he turned to the one jump   s planetary guide  which he had found in its library among some suggestive books on economics .      it is a sparsely furnished world  though beautiful from space     he read .     it is the nearest thing a rock world can become to looking like a gas giant .  band was discovered and claimed by the creapii in b . s .         but is leased by the sundogs for the purpose of raising their pups .  unauthorized landing is banned     the planet   s name is hence very apt     except in cases of emergency .  even then  for obvious reasons  landings should not be made in the late orbital spring .      obvious reasons  thought dom .  he was prepared to bet that it was late spring down there .  but hrsh hgn was down there too  and so was a non existent being called chatogaster .      well     he said .     this is what we   ll do             they are landing  ma   am .      joan flounced across the cabin and swept the robot from the control seat .   the screen showed a thin line raking over the planet .  it arched down and presently the vision screens showed the one jump  skimming low over the plains with an impressive show of stunt flying .      a gesture of defiance .  a sabalos to the core     she said proudly .     there   s no shame in giving in when you   ve no alternative whatsoever .      the small ship swung round and landed a mile away from the drunk  scattering a herd of giant sundog pups which trundled off clumsily  keening .      eight  three  go off and escort him in .      two of the robots outside broke away and lurched off through the knee high grass .      that   s settled  then     said joan .  she swung round in her seat and sent down to the butler   s pantry for a jug of bitter pineal wine .  the only other occupant of the cabin gazed at her mournfully .   there were three sexes on phnobis  but equally there were two other distinctions among phnobes  those who lived on phnobis  and those who did not .  the two were not interchangeable .  there were no return tickets .  phnobic religion was adamant that the universe ended at the unbroken cloud layer  and returning phnobes were bad for business     hence  by a roundabout route  the big  artificially overcast burukus on every other world .      it appears that i won   t have to send you back after all .         for thiss relief much thankss .     hrsh hgn grimaced and massaged his long ribcage .     your robots are ungentle  madam .         they used little more than the necessary minimum of force  i   m sure .     she leaned forward .     tell me     purely out of interest     what precisely happens to returning phnobes .         the shipss have to land in a ssacred area .  alighting phnobes are dispatched with a knife  it is ssaid .  it iss not reasonable .  i send all my salary to the sacred coffers  ass you know .  ah  well .  as the ssaying runs  frskss shhs ghs ghnngghngss .      joan raised her eyebrows .     indeed .  hrskssgng  my dear fellow  and many of them .      hrsh hgn blushed grey .     your pardon  madam  i did not realize you sspoke        he looked at her with new respect .      i don   t .  but there are some words one learns on even passing acquaintance with a language .  to an earth human woman it   s a compliment  actually  if somewhat direct .      she turned back to the screen .   robots eight and three plodded up to the ship  from which came the strains of the widdershine ballad    do you take me for a silly .     played inexpertly on a thumb organ .  a puppy lumbered away as they approached .   the hatch was open .  three stepped in .   isaac regarded him amiably .      i perceive the human is not here     said three .      that is correct     said isaac .   three eyed him warily .  finally he intoned     i am a class three robot .  i ask you to remain here while i seek instruction .         i  on the other hand  am a class five robot  with additional man friday subcircuitry     said isaac pleasantly .   three   s left eyeball twitched .  isaac had picked up a spanner .      i perceive a possibility of an immediate chronological sequence of events which includes a violence     said three .  he stepped back .     i express preference for a chronological sequence of events which precludes a violence .      eight poked his head round the hatchway and added     i too express a preference for a chronological sequence of events which precludes a violence .      isaac hefted the spanner thoughtfully .     you are advanced fellows for class threes .  there   s just you and me here  and we none of us are non metallic humans .  do you intend to molest me .         our orders are to escort the contents of this machine to our mistress     said three .  he was watching the spanner .      you could disobey .         class fives may disobey .  class fours may disobey in special circumstances .  we are not class fives .  we are not class fours .  it is a matter for regret .         then i will temporarily disable you     said isaac firmly .      although you are more intelligent than myself i will resist     said three .  he shifted uneasily .      we will resort to violence on the count of three     said isaac .     one .  two .      the spanner clonked against three   s cut out button .     three     said isaac  and turned to eight who was staring at his fallen comrade with a perplexed air .      i perceive an illogical sequence of events which included a violence     he said .  isaac hit him .   it took him some time to strip himself of his facemask and streamlining and transfer a large plastic    three    to his naked chestplate .  then he set off for the other ship with the exultant air of one who hears distant bugles .   he reached the stateroom without molestation .  joan looked up .      you took your time     she said .     where are they .  and where is eight .         there was a recent chronological sequence of events that included a violence     said isaac .  in one movement he picked hrsh hgn bodily off his stool  slung him over his shoulder and fled .  he skidded through the airlock a moment before it hissed shut .   outside the ship he stood the phnobe upright and pointed eastwards .     run .  there   s a lake .  i will join you shortly     he added .     at the moment i perceive an imminent number of violences .      twenty guard robots wheeled as one on joan   s amplified command and ran towards him .   he stood his ground  which seemed to worry them .  to the first who approached he said     are you class threes  all of you .      the robot called twelve said     some of us are class two robots  but most of us are class three robots .  i am a class three robot myself .      isaac looked at the sky .  he felt very happy .  it was very wrong of him .      correction     he said .     as of now you are all recumbent waterfowl of the genus scipidae .      twelve paused .     i am a class three robot myself     he said uncertainly .      correction     said isaac .     i repeat  you are all sitting ducks .  now  i am going to count three         he walked forward  and his atomic heart sang a lyrical hymn of superior intelligence .    dom dropped from the speeding yacht before it entered visor range of the drunk and spun giddily in its slipstream until the sandals steadied him .  he drifted down to a few feet above the close cropped plain and set off at a fast skimming trot eastwards .   he skated for ten minutes over the sweetgrass which  apart from a variety of weeds  several lichens and some seaweeds  was the only vegetation on the planet .  on band nature had stuck to a few tried and tested lines .   several times he passed flocks of puppies  large ungainly creatures that from space appeared to drift like clouds over the continent .  here and there a larger one moped apart from the main herds  squatting on its bloated rump and staring at the sky with mournful eyes  with a skin the unhealthy pallor of a sundog soon to undergo puberty .  usually they smelt of fermenting sweet grass .   when dom passed one it gave a tired whine and staggered a few yards on its stumpy legs before taking up its yearning position once more .      erandini rose quickly towards noon .   the robot station was on the far side of the lake  probably because the lake was one of the few marker points on band .  dom had decided to try there .  chatogaster had to be somewhere .   he paused for a sip of water and the cold  cooked leg of some flightless bird  courtesy of the autochef .  the air was warm and springlike .  the eternal sound of chewing as the sunpups grazed their way relentlessly round the world made a pleasant background .   the air in front of dom crackled .  a small metal sphere whirred to a halt and hung on its antigravs .  it eyed dom and extruded a mouthpiece .      i perceive you are an ambulatory intelligence  type b     it said .     crackdown in this area is forecast in ten minutes .  don your protective clothing or seek chthonic safety .      it rose and hurtled northwards screaming     crackdown .  crackdown .  beware of the eggs .         oi .     bellowed dom .  the sphere returned  fast .      well .         i don   t understand .      the sphere considered this .     i am a class one mind     it said finally .     i will seek reinstruction .      it disappeared again .  a distant cry of     beware of the eggs     marked its going .   dom watched it and shrugged .  he looked round warily  drawing the memory sword from his belt .  most of the sunpups  in fact all except the sky watchers  were lying down and peacefully chewing .  it looked idyllic .    half a world away  and above the glowing surf of the atmosphere  crackdown was beginning .  the sundogs were in orbit .  they had laid their eggs .  now incubation began its final stage .   the leading egg roared through the superheated air  the forward heatshell leaving a searing trail .  finally it cracked at the pointed end and the first parachute burst open .  around the egg the sky filled with other blossoming white membranes .   the first egg for ten years hit the ground a hundred miles to the north of dom .  the overheated shell burst into a thousand fragments that scythed the grass for yards around      the second landed to the west of the lake .  the shell exploded violently and red hot shards showered over a herd of puppies who  in response to an ancient instinct  were lying down safely with their padded forepaws over their heads .   from behind one came a phnobic curseword .           dom bounced across the grass .  shell was flying all around him .  there was already a long burn across one shoulder where a shard had narrowly missed taking off his head .   the ground in front suddenly dipped  and the lake stretched out in front of him .  it was big .  it was also cold  and probably safe .  he gunned his sandals and took a standing jump .   the dive was from a height  and ended a long way down .  he turned in a shoal of bubbles and struck out for surface .  his ears rang .  he was still sinking .   unbelieving  he felt his feet touch the lake bottom .  goggle eyed  he felt the water round his feet warm up as his sandals tried uselessly to push him to the surface .  drowning  he breathed a chestful of water .   he was several fathoms down .  he was breathing water .  he took another breath  and tried not to think about it .   the water is saturated with oxygen .  it will sustain you .   a large silver fish stared at him  and was away with a flick of its tail .  something like a ten legged crab scuttled over his feet .   do not be frightened .   it was a sound .  something was talking to him .      you are chatogaster  then .     he peered into the murky water .     they looked for an aquatic creature  but they looked in the seas .  i can   t see you .      i am here .  you are thinking in the wrong terms .   the water shone with stars .  they winked on above  around  below .  he could still feel the water eddy around him  but all other senses told him that he was standing and breathing in interstellar space .  deep space .  the centre of a star cluster .   no  the hub of the galaxy .      it   s an illusion .      no  it   s a memory .  watch .   at the hub of the galaxy where the stars rubbed shoulders and interstellar distances were measured in light weeks a planet was bathed in the violent light of a hundred suns .  it was made of water .   at the centre it was water iv  the third strangest substance in the universe  and the surface boiled .  dom watched the facts form in his mind with the inexorable growth of crystals .   for a few thousand years the planet glooped and woobled its watery path between the stars  trailing behind it across the galactic sky a shimmering rainbow of steam that photon pressure sculptured into vast ghosts .  then it exploded .   dom found himself ducking .  a churning droplet of water  a whole sea  left the damp explosion and passed him  steaming  on its way to the galactic rim .   and he knew with a second hand certainty that the hot wet world had produced life .  it was a life that knew nothing of jokers .  in the hot water improbable compounds had formed unlikely molecules  had         you are the lake     he said .   i am .  how is my old friend the bank .      he was fine a few days ago     said dom .     uh     do you shun publicity .      not at all  but i like my privacy .  the bank was the only other lifeform extant when i arrived here .  the sundogs know me .  but i help them  i take care of their pups  and they are reticent about me .      take care of their pups .  you must be telepathic .      not as you would understand it .  but most creatures are largely water  and i am wholly water .  they drink of me  and i become part of them     as i am part of you .  osmosis  you see .  don   t let it offend you .      i won   t     said dom .  he kicked a cloud of mud from the lake bottom  and tried to convince himself .   eight of our days ago the bank sent me a messenger .  the bank is rock  i am water .  we have an understanding .   dom smiled .     isn   t there some story about a sapient sun out towards galactic north .     he asked .   yes  it is true .  he is strange .  we are instituting a search for an intelligent gas cloud now  to complete the elemental quartet .  however  the bank told me that he was sending a person to aid my extension programme .      he didn   t say that to me     i was told you could help me find jokers world     said dom .   maybe we can help one another .      what do you know about the jokers .      nothing .  knowledge is not my province .  my province is  .  .  .   there was no precise word for it .  a series of images flashed across dom   s mind as chatogaster tried to explain .  intuition was too coarse a term  there was something in it of a leaf   s knowledge of how a tree grows  there was something warm  dreamy  arcane      may i rifle your memory .  i shall need to .  thank you .  you may experience a dreamlike sensation  however  i will leave your mind as i would wish to find it .   later the lake said  generally speaking there is no dark side to a sun .  let us start with the joker towers .  their casing at least is probably a giant molecule .  their use is not known  although they absorb power and appear to yield none .  i feel bound to say that there is no apparent reason for their existence  any more than there is for a man  for example .   it would seem that this assassin is out to prevent you from discovering this world .  he may in fact be hastening your discovery by forcing you along paths you might not otherwise take .   let us consider the jokers themselves .  that they existed cannot be doubted .  they have left artefacts  the greatest of which are the chain stars  which proves they had power and perhaps bravado  they left the centre of the universe on wolf  which suggests they had an understanding of the underlying truisms of totality  and they left the tomorrow strata on third eye  which i believe means they at least experimented with time travel .  there is a fundamental mistake  though  in assuming that the jokers are the sum of their creations .  these may have been toys  relics of the jokers    youth .  astronomical evidence suggests that if they evolved on a world it may well be dead and gone by now .  the fact that jokers world has not been found within the    life bubble    does not lead me to believe it is hidden .  i find i believe it is not there .  it must be obvious that    the dark side of the sun    is an idea rather than a place .      it had crossed my mind     admitted dom .  he was sitting in the ooze  watching the light dance on the surface overhead .     is it a poetic image .      poetry is the highest art .  the jokers must have achieved it .   dom sighed .     i had an idea at the start that it was just a matter of finding some cute explanation like     well  like hrsh hgn   s .      that is in fact very poetic  and quite possible .  but it  .  .  .   another lapse into intranslatability .  an itch  a sense of wrongness  traditionally embodied in the almost physical pain some people experienced in seeing a picture hung crooked and being unable to right it  a feeling of discord .   that would make them like creapii .  environment conditions the mind  and the jokers did not think like creapii .  however  the creapii are indubitably the most advanced race at present .  i suggest you study them .  in the creapii is a clue to the jokers .      so i won   t discover a world .      i did not say so .  but the idea is more important .  do you not say    the world of the common wasp     or    the world of the poet    .  they are worlds  and only incidentally include some reference to a physical reality like a planet .      i think i see     said dom  getting up .     the world of the jokers may be just a way of looking at the universe .      precisely .      i shall visit the creapii .     he tried to remember .     i think the high degrees have just opened a study raft on the chain stars  haven   t they .      so i understand .  since the high degrees represent the most advanced creapii and specialize in the study of other lifeforms your choice of destination is a good one .   dom prepared to swim to the surface  but stopped .     there was something you wanted me to do .      it is a great favour .  you are chairman of widdershins  a world largely composed of water .      on the surface  yes .  over ninety per cent  including the marshes .      i would like to emigrate .   chatogaster explained .  band was a pleasant world  but lacked stimulation .  he could communicate with the liquid content of sundogs who had as pups drunk from the lake  and hence through their own telepathy     which was no more than a by function of their massive brains     learn from the minds of travellers .  but chatogaster wanted to spread out .  he needed no ship .  if dom could take the little container that had held his drinking water  and let it be filled  enough of chatogaster could be taken to widdershins to let the great tethys ocean become chatogaster as well .  he was persuasive .   i could take care of your fish  and police your sea lanes .  i could provide surf with the muscles of the tide  and an inspiration for your poets .  who drinks of me drinks of the well of the universe .  please .   dom hesitated  and the lake saw why .   i have no power .  i may aid  but i cannot fight .  what should i want with conquests .  i am      untranslatable  but images of a mind rather than a force  an idea formed in water rather than a creature  a certainty that the lake was speaking     not the truth  because that suggested it could lie  and chatogaster could not lie         i may be overruled by the board but     he opened the little bottle that had been in his carryall     step right in .     an air bubble escaped from the bottle .   thank you .   a kick carried dom easily to the surface .  he broke water and struck out for the shore .   crackdown appeared to have ended .  one or two eggs spiralled down as he scrambled up the slope  but they exploded a long way off in the south .  a few damp pups  no bigger than a man  were taking their first shaky steps .   here and there older pups were baying at the sky  long snouts pointing trembling at the clouds .  the reddish hair on their cone shaped bodies was sleeked down .  one near to the lake was shuddering .      pssst .      hrsh hgn and a robot with a large three on its chestplate leapt out of the grass .  without pausing in their stride they each grabbed him by an elbow and the three of them tumbled back towards the lake .   the air began to smell of methane  a fruity foul smell that caught in dom   s throat .      hrsh .  isaac got you  then .  what   s happened to isaac .  you   re isaac .  what happened .      the robot was half covered in soot  and there were superficial metal runs down one arm .  the phnobe nodded absently and peered back across the plain .  the nearest pup was trembling now  violently  and a thin plume of vapour was coming from three swollen glands around its broad rump .      the robot was bitten by a dog     murmured hrsh hgn .     it   ss been ssomewhat exciting up here .  cave canem .      they hit the grass .  an explosion dug a crater in front of them .  a hot wind whipped over the sweetgrass  driving a boiling cloud of greasy black smoke .  in an instant a false night fell .   above it the sunpup wobbled into the air on three blinding blue flames .  slowly  following the route its ancestors had taken a million years before to escape a hostile world  it rose above the plains .   it gained speed and height  blew a smoke ring  and was still accelerating when dom lost it in the distant cirrus .    calculations   hrsh hgn manipulated a small slideball .      i   m relieved to ssay it could not work     he said .      there are two suits in the one jump     said dom .     one ought to fit you .      two miles away a sunpuppy rose baying on a spreading cone of smoke .      look at it this way     began isaac persuasively .     if we attack madam with whirling memory swords she   ll stop playing and start blasting .  i dare say she won   t see dom hurt but  .  .  . what do you rate your chances .         better a boiled lamb than a roasst sheep .         there   s no fuel in the one jump     said dom .      not a drop     added isaac .      it   s the only way .      another puppy thundered upwards on a vast ventral explosion of gas .  hrsh hgn watched it go  his big rheumy eyes betraying a storm of mixed emotions .      but i am no good with animalsss .     he wailed .   it was defeat .  dom and isaac looked at each other and nodded .    fifteen minutes later the drunk sank into the grass by the empty yacht .  joan surveyed her bodyguard impatiently .      twenty of you and they got away .         the class five robot precipitated an illogical series of events     explained twelve .      he was a class five mind .  he told us to count to three     added nineteen helpfully .      then he hit us     said twelve .      when we get back to civilization i   ll see to it that the robot is lobotomized     said joan grimly .     why did we ever start building human robots .         the class fives were constructed because of their        began twelve  and was intelligent enough to stop when joan looked at him .   four more robots trudged in  carrying the prone bodies of three and eight .      i feel sad     said twelve .      may they rust in peace     echoed nineteen .      when they   re recalibrated i   ll make sure they go down a class     muttered joan .     right .  the rest of you spread out .  we won   t leave till they   re found .      ten miles eastward three sunpuppies blasted upwards .  they wobbled a little  trying to stabilize the extra weight  then soared towards the stars .     hrsh hgn wailed that he appeared to be in a fast decaying orbit  but you couldn   t hurry negotiations with a sundog .   she hung above them  and her name was gully triode stroke pledge hudsons bay preferred .      the pups did reach orbit safely     said dom patiently .   nevertheless  it was a despicable act  man .  the safety of our young is of paramount importance to us .   dom thought very quickly .      i carry the seed of chatogaster     he intoned .   any friend of the lake is a friend of mine  buster .  possibly a large payment into the sundog account would make amends for the crime which happened to be witnessed by us alone .  what is your name .      dom sabalos .      the name has a familiar ring .  we have heard it recently .  however .  the chain stars are on the rim of the bubble .  it will be a long time in interspace .      the robot can take it .  my friend and i have our suits .  my friend is nearing re entry     said dom  adopting the sundog   s clipped style .   it was a long  long time in interspace .   dom told himself that he knew that they were safe inside the sundog   s field  but that didn   t stop him from holding on to the beast   s hide until his hands ached .  the suit provided a strong depressive that made the naked images merely unpleasant .  hrsh hgn had passed out .  isaac had shut down most of his circuits .   it was a long time .              they should not exist .  they are theoretically possible  but so is balancing a needle on the end of a hair .  faced with something like the chain stars a man must either bow the knee  or else get good and worried .      charles sub lunar  galactic excursions     dom wondered what was so impressive .  that was when the chain was still twenty aus away  and side on .   then the creapii shuttle came in closer .   imagine a doughnut  three million miles across .  imagine another .  link them .   the chain stars .  and tumbling around them  minos     a planet formed from thousands of asteroids  dragged across the light years and fused into a world .  that was another joker achievement  the maze on minos .   the cabin was empty except for shape adaptable seats and the screen .  from outside it had appeared gigantic  several times bigger than an average cargo ship and surprisingly streamlined .  dom knew that most of the bulk must be shielding  plus an engine big enough to lift the ship up against the crushing pull of a sun .  but the streamlining puzzled him .   until he realized .  even suns have atmospheres .   the glowing  linked rings grew rapidly in the screen  until the outer edges slipped away .  it was no comfort to know the image was just that  an image darkened and screened down until it was merely bright .  instinct said they were plunging into the heart of a star .      born of the sun  we travel a little way towards the sun     misquoted isaac  tactlessly .  dom relaxed  and laughed .  he thought he could hear a muted thunder  not unlike the roar of star flames .  it was impossible  of course .  it was just that he thought he could hear it .  of course  it was impossible .   finally all definition was lost  and the screen became a painfully white rectangle .  hrsh hgn was trembling with a phnobe   s instinctive fear of naked sunlight .  dom pictured the ship coasting over a glowing sea  one with no horizon  and stopped his imagination resolutely when he thought of all the little mechanical things that could go wrong .   something was drastically wrong with the raft when it appeared .   artists and the eye of imagination portrayed a raft only a few steps removed from the log platforms that dagon fishers used  with perhaps a few creapii slithering nonchalantly across the deck  and it was open to the sky  with a class of a yellow ocean a long way beneath .  but even high degrees could not survive in the open except on near cinders stars  and the chains raft was one of the first on a hot star .  it was just a blank hemisphere  hovering flat side down in what appeared on the screen as a thin mist .   the shuttle docked gently  and a section of wall slid back to reveal a circular grey tunnel .  a friendly mechanical voice invited them to follow it .  dom led the way  warily .   the sound he heard hit him like a club .  he ran forward  unbelieving .   it was the sea .    his furness creege         rolled down to the beach on bright caterpillar tracks .  he was big  much bigger than the low degree creapii that lived on widdershins .  his egg shaped suit was golden .  a fawn pranced by his side  and a small blue singing bird was perched on his tentacle .  his furness stopped at the surf line and waited patiently .   dom felt his toes touch the sand and waded through the waves .  some of the strangeness of the creap was gone now .  he knew that he was looking at a creature who was the leader of the most advanced subspecies of a race ten times as old as men .  was the featureless ovoid looking at him .  what did it see .   an armoured tentacle handed him a towel .  it was rough and smelled of lemons .      a pleasant swim .     the light tenor voice materialized without visible means of support .      thank you  yes     said dom .  he opened his hand  and showed the creap a small purple shell .      trivia monarcha sinistrale     said the creap .     the widdershine ink cowrie .  beautiful in its simplicity .  how did you find my ocean .      dom looked back at the waves .  the surf was faked .  the horizon was a masterpiece of illusion  and was a hundred metres from the shore .  an artificial sun set in a splendour that was real .  an evening star hung in the crimson glow .      convincing     he said .   the creap laughed pleasantly  and led him slowly up the beach .   there was more land than sea in the sanctuary .  again  the creapii had only erred on the side of generosity .  on one side a plain of golden grass rippled all the way to distant mountains  crystal clear .  gods might live on those towering peaks .  on the other side the forest began .  a respectable stream gushed from an outcrop and meandered between root buttressed banks  a dragonfly  one of the large terra novaean aeschans  skimmed over the water .  short turf grew between the trees  studded with gentians .  rabbits had left signs of their passing .  there was a stand of fragrant fennel  and a vine twisted itself among the nearest trees .  in the far distance was a volcano .      shall i speak to you of back projection  hidden devices  artificial irrigation .     asked his furness innocently .  dom sniffed the air .  it smelled of rain .      i won   t quite believe you     he said .     if i dug in the soil here  what would i find .         topsoil  a fossil or two  carefully selected .         and .         oh  rock .  limestone to a depth of three metres .         and then .         alas for illusion  in this order  the machine level  a metre of monomolecular copper  a mere film of oxidized iron  a suspicion of a matrix field .  shall i go deeper .         that   s deep enough  your furness .         shall we continue our walk  then .  i must feed the carp .      later  when the golden fish had flocked to the ringing of a little brass bell  he said     must there be a reason .  then let it be that i study humanity .  earth humanity in particular .  although in saying that  i am aware of a misapprehension .  let it be said  instead  that in applying myself to the study of totality i endeavour to do so from the human viewpoint  do you understand .  it is a truism that the environment moulds the mind  and so        he waved a tentacle to include the sea  the forest  the distant mountains .     of course  it would be easier to move onto a human world  but not so convenient .      dom reminded himself  forcibly  that beneath his feet burned a natural furnace .  but the creapii also studied the chain stars  from real close up  and his furness had hinted that there were a number of other experiments taking place on the raft .      the jokers .     said the creap .     certainly i will help if i can .  you are our first non creap visitors .  do you know of any prophecies in your culture concerning a green man with the sea in a bottle .         no     said dom  suddenly alarmed .     are there any .         not that i know of .  it sounds the very meat and drink of prophecy  however .      you must realize that we are in no position to offer much advice  we need several tens of thousands of years of study .  have you any specific questions .         the creapii were not the jokers .         true .  but that was a statement .         very well .  you are the oldest race  as a race .  you can   t count chatogaster or the bank  they   re individual organisms .  so it should follow that you are the most like the jokers .  mentally  i mean .  no  not even that .  i mean in outlook .      the creap laughed .     and what is our outlook .         you study other lifeforms .  man the hunter  creap the information gatherer .  may i be personal .         please do     said the great golden egg  and dom blushed .      well  i   ve met creapii before .  do you know what has always struck me as odd about them .  and about you  your furness .  you   re so human .      hrsh hgn is my friend  but he is a phnobe .  he gives himself away all the time  and he   s lived on widdershins  among earth stock humanity  for most of his life .  little things     ways of looking at life  like when we both look at the same thing and i know he   s seeing it from an entirely different racial viewpoint .  but all the creapii i have met don   t give that impression .         we live on hot worlds .  we are sexless  octopoid .  human .     said creege         .      chel .  humanity is a state of mind  not body .  but that is a point .  i wondered  why do they seem so like me  when they must be so alien .  i think it   s because all the creapii i   ve met have consciously tried to adopt the human viewpoint .  they   re humans first  creapii second .      dom faced the egg  except that it had no face .  at length the disembodied voice said     there is a great deal in what you say .         i think you do this to gain a greater understanding of the universe     said dom .     men see a different universe to phnobes .  i   m sorry  i keep picking the wrong words .  they experience a different universe .  is that right .         that is very sapient .  before we dine with the others  would you like to see something .      they found him an eggsuit  fitted out for visitors with a simple control panel .  it was like riding in a small  vertical tank .  in dom   s case it was to keep the heat out  rather than in .  then he ventured into the main section of the raft .   he couldn   t remember very much afterwards .  individual experiences blended into a montage of heat  large  slithering galaxy shaped monsters  the thunder of the sun and a strange flickering in the air .  he did remember being led to an observation platform  set in the middle of a matrix coil  and being invited to look up .   the circular star on which the raft was moored was just passing under the arch of its twin .  on a cooler world the experience would have been enough to inspire a dozen religions .   a shining arch  only marginally brighter than the sky around it  moved across the solar sky .   he didn   t know if the other creapii were aware that the clumsily driven suit held a young man rather than a drunken creap  if creapii drank .  probably they didn   t .  after an hour of it he felt drunk .   it lasted for several minutes after he was back in the sanctuary .  creege did not have to point out the lesson .  by something like osmosis he had been given just a feeling of creapiness .  the creap had been trying to tell him that he was right .  the world of the creapii was a totality away from the world of men .  so the creaps tried to think     to feel     like men .  only thus could the whole nature of the universe be comprehended  they said .   with a new understanding dom realized that the official view of the creapii was wrong .  they were said to be the race born to science .  creapii were the cool heads of the universe  the ultimate analysers  a race of intelligent robots  had robots been what the first robotic pioneers considered them to be .  it just wasn   t true .  what was it one of the pre sadhim sects had striven for .  ultimate reality .  that was it .  the creapii were the mystics of the universe .   they ate at a table under a spreading pear tree .  a stew of slightly rotting oily black toadstools  a real delicacy  had been provided for hrsh hgn .  isaac ate whole erse potatoes for energy .  there was a seafood souffl   for dom  expertly cooked .  he was beginning to realize too that creapii were experts automatically .  his furness sucked something from a pressurized cylinder into an airlock approximately where his stomach should have been .      where is your next port of call .     he asked .      minos  if you can take me there     said dom .     i have to get another ship  and i know there is a multiracial settlement there .  i could take a look at the maze  too .         do you think there might be a clue in the maze .     asked the creap politely .   isaac chortled  and nudged dom heavily in the ribs .      that was a clever literary allusion  that was     he said .     even the name of the planet is           i know     said dom .     i shall look forward to meeting the minotaur .  hrsh .         oh  nothing     said the phnobe  looking up .     i was jusst reflecting that i sseem to be insside a legend .       he called the ship one jump behind .  it was the best the small yard on minos had to offer .  it lacked even an autochef  which was a point in its favour  but its matrix was carefully calibrated and the cabin was at least larger than a closet .      why one jump behind .     asked isaac .      relativity     said dom .     it   s full name ought to be a jump so far ahead that if einstein had been right it would end right behind you .  try getting that on the ident panel .  do you think you can handle it .         it   ll do     said isaac ruefully .     it   s hardly a thoroughbred .      they walked through the human scientific colony towards the maze  the nearest wall of which loomed over the low domes .      what did you think of the high degrees .     said hrsh hgn .      remarkable     said dom non committally .     what about you .         i met several while you were taken on that tour .  i wass sstruck by their phnobisshness  ass you might expect  and your ssuggesstion that each race ssees itss reflection in the        a small silver egg rolled up to them at the maze entrance  waving a sheaf of papers in a tentacle .  the reddish tint of its eyeshield said it was a very low degree creap indeed .      psst .     hissed a non directional voice .     wanna buy a map .  can   t see the maze without a map .  compiled by my brood brother from genuine aerial photographs .         sod off  cinderbrain .     screamed a large creap  thundering towards the group .     now  sir and frss  you are obviously discerning people and you want a map .  now i have a map  sir and frss  the like of which is seldom seen .         do i need a map .     dom asked .      not precissely     said the phnobe  who had visited the maze before .     but they do make good souvenirss .      a dozen other map sellers lurched and rolled after them as they strode into the maze .   the jokers had their little joke .  occasionally a researcher would point out that the maze was probably never designed as a maze at all  but none could come up with a believable alternative use .  dom wasn   t surprised when his two companions faded away on either side of him     hrsh hgn had warned him of the maze effect .   something in the monomolecular walls created a separate universe for every individual .  that was why all maps and aerial photographs ceased to be useful .  dom   s own map of the maze could be perfectly accurate     for dom .   once he saw a shadowy outline of hrsh hgn walk out of a wall and disappear into another .  dom thumped the wall good and hard and then  glancing around to make sure that no one was watching  played a stripper beam over the white surface .  it didn   t even get hot .  as an illusion it was pretty solid .   he found the centre after ten minutes    brisk walking .  he had the memory sword still turned to the stripper setting  and his finger hovered on the stud as ways turned round and smiled .      i see you were expecting me     he said pleasantly .   dom fired .  ways gave him a hurt look  and extended a hand .  a growing  light bending sphere bounced towards dom and disappeared .      round one     said ways .     now i   ve a resonance dampening matrix  but what have you got .         who are you .     said dom .  he thumbed the weapon on its knife setting .      ways of earth .     he stopped and tossed the knife back to dom .     i   m afraid you have blunted the blade     he continued     but that was a pretty smart throw .         my next question was have you come to kill me  but that   s not intelligent  is it .         no     said ways     i don   t seem to be achieving anything  but i must keep trying otherwise what is free will for .         do i get any explanations .         sure .  you must realize that the universe is too big to hold us and the jokers .  some people are afraid that the jokers might turn up any day now .         do they expect some kind of big brained monsters .         i think gods are what they are expecting .  you know where you are with big brained monsters  but gods are another matter .  no one wants to be a slave race .  oh  i   ve got a couple of things for you .      the robot slid aside his chest panel and threw ig at dom .  the little animal screamed vengeance at ways from the safety of its master   s shoulder  then dived inside dom   s shirt .      and there was something else        said the robot .  he patted his carry all  and felt around behind his chestplate .     sorry for the delay  you know how it is  thing wanted never there .  ah  here .      dom caught the small grey sphere before he could stop himself .  it was warm .  ways watched him closely .      that is a matrix engine without a coil     he said .     by now it should have blown your head off .  crude  i know .      dom hurled the globe over the nearest wall .  it sparkled briefly under the light of the chains before landing with a thud in the next avenue .  then ways cannoned into him .   the robot had weight behind him .  dom rolled backwards and tried to throw his attacker  and had to jerk aside as a fist struck the maze floor by his ear .  the blow split the artificial skin .  ways turned the punch into a sideswipe  and a fingertip scored a cut across the boy   s head .   ig erupted straight for the eyes .  ways brushed him off lightly  and leapt back  flexing his fingers .      i refuse to believe in invulnerability     he said .     let   s get down to the real thing .      the matrix engine exploded .  the maze thumped .   ways was picked up like a doll and hurled at the wall  one flailing leg catching dom across the chest .   and a long way overhead a ship was coming in to land .               on laoth they cultivate with a screwdriver .      galactic miscellany       hark to the crash of  the leaves in the autumn  the smash  of the crystal leaves .      charles sub lunar  planetary haiku      the bed was a relic  an ornate black affair that bore all the markings of the taminic p   ing dynasty .  dom stared through thinning blue mists at the rest of the room .   he was in a treasure house .  or it may have been a museum .  someone had ferried furniture and ornaments across the galaxy and dumped them there with no regard for style and period .  memory tapestries hung from two of the walls  where forgotten heroes re enacted pages from history like an ever repeating recording .  a set of tstame men in ceremonial costume stood stiffly to attention on a board set in a giant cultured ruby .  there was a water sculpture  inactive  which lay in a pool at the bottom of its tank  and an early chrome display case displaying several pieces of bootlegged phnobic temple pottery .  where the walls were free of tapestries they were hung with purple drapes .   dom pictured the severely practical home domes on widdershins .  the only ornamentation really encouraged was the sadhim logo and perhaps the one commandment  suitably framed .  even electricity was allowed to come no further than the kitchen .  and the sabalos family was rich     so rich  in fact  that it could afford the simple life .  whoever owned this room was either poorer or would make them look like paupers .   he felt something warm by his ear  and turned to find ig curled up in the sleeping field .  the creature opened one eye and purred .   dom swung himself clumsily out of the bed   s field and landed clumsily .  the gravity was fractionally higher than widdershins .   he drew aside a curtain and saw a sun  flattened by refraction  dipping below a rugged horizon .  it was an anaemic red .  and something small flew jerkily past the window  found an open section and flittered in .  dom saw the metallic sheen of its wings as it hovered around the light  and the haze of its tiny airscrew .  it was a laoth moth .  the sun out there was tau ceti  and it was setting pale because the atmosphere was almost dust free .  he felt pleased with himself .   the bronze doors at the far end of the room swung open  and isaac walked in .      hi  boss     he said wearily .     how do you feel .         my chest feels like someone   s been sticking pokers in it     said dom  ruefully .     the last i remember i was on minos .         that   s right .  we found you at the entrance to the maze with your chest half caved in .  that ig was keening fit to bust .      dom sat down .     at the entrance to the maze .  how did i get there .  hey     did you look in the centre .      the robot nodded .     sure  but our centres  if you see what i mean .  another attempt  huh .     dom told him .   isaac said     your grandmother arrived not long after .  hrsh hgn and i thought well  you were dying  and the drunk is a fast ship .         yes  okay .  but this isn   t widdershins .         she stopped off here so you could get treatment .  those googoo bodies aren   t infinitely self repairing .         of course  this is your home  isn   t it .      isaac stiffened .     i am a citizen of the galaxy  boss .  yes  this is the old place .  workship three  factory complex nineteen  that   s where i sprang from .     he looked round the room .     mind you  we never got to see the inside of this place .  between ourselves  i don   t like it .  do you know i   m the only    bot in the place .         knock it off  there must be servants .     said dom  looking for some clothes .      sure .  humans .  i tell no lie  sahib .      dom gaped at him .      and one of them called me    sir    .  in my cube  any human who calls a robot    sir    is due for a bunch of knuckles .         cool down and find me some clothes .  i want to see this place before it vanishes     said dom .   they walked out of the room and along a broad  deep carpeted corridor .  isaac led the way through several large  over furnished halls until they reached a pair of silvered doors .  two men in brown and gold livery opened the doors hurriedly and stood to attention as they passed through  dom heard a mechanical growl in isaac   s throat .   a circular table with a central well filled the room .  dom   s gaze first caught joan  she dominated the room  as usual  in a long midnight purple dress and a black wig that matched her skin .  she smiled faintly .  next to her was a tall  fat man  built almost on drosk lines  dom recognized him as the emperor ptarmigan .  next to him was keja  even at this moment rising from her seat before racing round the table to embrace dom .  by her sat a boy about dom   s age  regarding him thoughtfully .  the rest of the table was made up of the usual run of board directors and senior planetary management .   keja embraced dom and kissed him .      i knew you   d turn up here .  dom  you   re green .  .  .     she gasped .     have you been fishing .         sort of     he said .      come and join us  we were just starting dinner .  tarli  could you move along .  if you crush up a bit isaac can find room  too     she added brightly .      sure     said the boy  grinning at dom .      me  madam .  dine with humans .     said isaac coldly  gazing fixedly at the liveried men standing behind the diners .      don   t be embarrassed     we   re all one big integrated circuit here     said keja .   dom leaned close to the robot and murmured     sit down and look pleasant or i will personally disassemble you with nails  teeth and toes .      dom ended up sitting between the emperor  who greeted him politely before turning back to joan  and keja .  many of the diners were watching dom with frank disbelief .  there were several phnobes around the table  with hrsh hgn hissing amicably to a very important looking alpha male .      do you always dine like this .     he asked .      oh  yes     said keja     ptarmigan prefers to have people where he can see them .     she raised a finger and the waiters moved forward .      uh  keja  how long have i been here .         since yesterday night .  you   re famous  little brother .  according to ptarmigan half the galaxy is out looking for you .  you   re supposed to be leading us all to jokers world .  what do you think we   ll find there .         on present showing  a damn great bomb .     he saw her flinch .     sorry  i didn   t mean that .  famous  eh .         there   s a dozen ships in orbit  most of them terra novaean and whole erse .  more turn up every hour .  ptarmigan is very angry about it .  i haven   t quite understood it all  but i gather that everyone wants to kidnap you .  is it true that you   ll discover jokers world in five days    time  whatever happens .         i expect so .  how come everyone knows .         well  you haven   t been keeping it a secret  have you .  united spies are in on it too .  ptarmigan has to send special squads out every hour to sweep up those little robot insects they keep dropping on the palace .  one got into the kitchen and opened the oven on a souffl    and that   s outside all the rules .         is one of the ships creapii .         i don   t know .      tarli leaned round his young stepmother and nodded .     my apologies  o dom  but i have been overhearing the conversation           eavesdropping     said keja sternly .         and as a matter of fact one of the ships is a crepii vmftl squareship  chain stars registration .         chain stars  eh .  oh  boy .     a thought struck him and his hand flew to his belt .     keja  was there a bottle           it   s safe .  my maid said one of the security men told her that it contains the water of life .  not that i   m prying  of course .         of course not .  in the last few days i   ve nearly been killed  overdrawn at the bank  i   ve breathed for an hour underwater  i   ve got into orbit by a very bawdy method  and i   ve had a swim on the surface of a star .  oh yes .  and i walked out of the maze on minos even though my chest was smashed up .  life is one gay round .  someone ought to start writing my biography now  before it   s too late .         try him  then     said keja  indicating a diner on the far side of the table .  dom recognized the scarred man and his battered robot .      that   s charles sub lunar  isn   t it .  the one they call the renaissance man .      keja saw the man and the robot looking at them  and raised her glass and smiled .  under cover of this she said     yes  and joker expert .  and historian .  his poetry is rather good  too .  did you know he was the one who deciphered the joker language .         the poet and the mad computer     quoted dom .      yes  though he   s not really mad .  i don   t know who the poet was .  his servant is quite fascinating  too  don   t you think he looks fascinating with all those scars  dom .  dom .         uh  yes     said dom  slowly .  he twirled his wineglass thoughtfully .     funny  isn   t it  you form an impression of people     i think i   d like a word with him .  excuse me .      dom sidled round the table  but had not been careful enough .  joan caught him lightly by the arm     lightly it looked  at least  but there was a knowledge of anatomy behind the hold .      good evening  grandson .  you have been mixing with some very bad company  it seems .  ways is the chief torpedo of the joker institute .      dom sighed .     all right  grandmother .  i suppose you have been prying into my mind .         well  you were unconscious and it naturally seemed the logical thing to do .         oh  naturally .         don   t be peevish  this is real life .  every security man in the galaxy knows about ways .  once he assassinated the deputy chief of united spies  you know .  he   s a robot with a killer instinct .  i see you   ve still got that swamp crawler .         he   s spent a little time with ways .  i think it   s likely that he   s been booby trapped     said dom .     i wouldn   t worry too much .         you think you   re invulnerable .  don   t bank on it     said joan .  she glared at ig .   the emperor rose slowly to his feet and rang a small black bell .  the diners began to leave the table .  dom saw sub lunar and his serving man disappear into the crowd .      what happens now .     he asked .     i understand everyone   s waiting for me to make a move .         are you going to discover jokers world .      most of the diners had left .  the emperor bowed to them and left them seated .  across the room hrsh hgn and isaac chatted to tarli .      i think so     said dom .     i   m getting the  .  .  . the sort of outline of it already .  it   s not a planet .  i mean  it may be a planet but     well  widdershins is a planet  with an orbit  a hydrosphere and a magnetic field and so on  but widdershins is also a world and a culture .         i see     said joan .     i wonder where it could be .         i   ve got five days  less now  so that rules out most places outside the life bubble .  i think        dom stopped .     you are pumping me .         for the sake of widdershins .  i don   t want you to find jokers world and lose it to a mob .  you don   t care about politics .  i tell you  used properly this could be the making of the sabalos family .         you mean that seriously .         i do .     she rose .     we   ll talk about this later .  are you coming to see the masque .         you must .     said tarli  hurrying round the table .     it   s a special production .  sub lunar wrote it on the ship coming here .  father likes a little entertainment after dinner .        dom thought it was mildly entertaining .  it was a skit on current earth outer worlds politics  which were always good for a laugh  written in early greek style .  all the characters wore larger than life masks  spangled with jewels .  the chorus was robotic .   then it nailed dom to his seat .   the chief protagonist was a goat legged chairman pan  complete with horn and syrynx .  it happened after the bit of business with the first sirian bank  a bloated silver globe on spindly legs .   the bank said     do you think  then  that man can prevent himself being ousted by robots .      pan capered across the stage     certainly .  what robot could do my job .  they can only go down to class ones  you know .      chorus     brekekekex  co ax  co axial .      pan     but list .  who is this weary traveller .      another actor lurched onto the stage .  he was a bright  vivid green .  he was staggering under the combined weight of a pair of winged sandals that left a trail of feathers  a large sword made of rubber  a giant bottle of water and  on one emerald shoulder  a taxidermist   s nightmare of glass eyeballs  feathers  tufts of hair and badly assorted claws .   pan     good grief .  what are you doing with that strange  ill assorted creature .      traveller     it   s not a strange creature  it   s my pet .      pan     i was talking to your pet .  what do you seek  traveller .  get on with it so we can continue with this sketch .      the traveller peered myopically around the stage and then glared at the audience .      i   m looking for a world of jokers     he muttered .   pan said     try earth .  they are quite good humoured on terra novae  too .  oh  those jokers .  be off with you .  they don   t exist     do they .         yes and no .  that is  no and yes .      bank     everyone knows they have moved to the universe next door        pan        so why not look on the dark side of the sun .      traveller .     gosh  yes .  the dark side of the sun  you say .  i   ll go there directly .     he shuffled off .    dom woke next morning in a bedroom almost oppressive in its wealth  washed in a gold bowl and strolled down to the dining hall .  he was late for breakfast .  most of the night had been spent in a fruitless discussion with joan .  there had been a row when ig was taken to a laboratory and probed for every conceivable weapon  to the little animal   s distress .  nothing was found  but ig  coiled across dom   s shoulders  was strangely silent today .   sub lunar had left after the masque  after taking an urgent call from earth .   down in the hall a floating sideboard had been laid out with large dishes under covers .  dom padded silently over the carpet  experimentally lifting lids .  one covered a dish of smoked red fish  another the considerable wreckage of a boar   s head .  a third was just fruit .  being a widdershine  he settled at last for the fish  and sat down at one end of the empty table .  out of interest he lifted the lid of a large tureen  and slammed it down hurriedly  the emperor had been entertaining drosk guests .   a few minutes later a small door across the hall opened and a girl tiptoed in .  she was small  and dark like tarli .  dom grinned .  she blushed  and sidled along the sideboard with her eyes fixed on him .   she piled a small dish with little fish and sat down at the opposite side of the table .  dom stared at her .  in the morning light she seemed to glow .  it was uncanny .  the glow followed her  so that when she moved an arm she left a faint  golden ghost in the air .  an electro physical effect  but still impressive .   they ate in silence  broken only by the hum of a large  antique standard clock .   finally he steeled himself .     can you speak janglic .  linaka comerks diwac .  how about drosk .      upaquaduc  uh  lapidiquac nunquackuqc quipaduckuadicquakak .      she poured herself a tiny cup of coffee and smiled at him .  dom groaned inwardly .  drosk was bad enough  but he could handle it .  he prepared his epiglottis and sinuses for the supreme test .      ffnbasshs sffshs     frs sfghn gss .      her second smile struck him as unnecessarily prim .  she clapped her hands .  a moment later he felt a presence by his elbow .   a giant was standing behind his chair .  a pair of eye slits surveyed him dispassionately from a small head atop a body as broad as it was high  which was almost two metres .  it wore a jerkin of leather  covered with familiar angular designs in red and blue .  a variety of hand weapons were stuck into the belt .  it was a drosk     an old one     so of course it was a female .  if there had been any males in the place they were probably in her deep freeze right now .   the girl sang a glissando of bell like note .  the red eyes blinked .      empress say what you say .         i was just trying to be sociable     said dom .     who are you .      the giant held a brief interchange with the girl  and said     i her bodyguard and lady of the bedchamber .         that must be economical .         lady sharli say you come for a ride .      without waiting for his answer the drosk lifted him out of his chair with one hand .  ig woke up and bared his teeth  then whined as the giant picked him up gently in another great paw and crooned to him .  the swamp ig blinked  then ran up one iron muscled arm and perched on the drosk   s head .   sharli was already walking across the broad patio outside the hall .  she looked sympathetically at dom as he was dumped at her feet like a parcel  and stamped her foot     to dom   s amazement  for even his mother had never resorted to that in her expert tantrums     and waved one tiny finger at the giant  who bowed to her .  she helped dom to his feet .   a robot was standing holding the reins of two creatures .  dom hadn   t seen horses before  except the pair that had been regretfully sent back on his birthday .  but these were laothian horses .  therefore they were robots .   sharli was helped onto one with a coat of anodized aluminium .  the reins were some woven metal  hung with jewels and bells .   dom   s mount was copper coloured .  as he climbed into the control saddle it turned and looked at him through multifaceted eyes  and said     can you ride  buster .         i don   t know  i   ve never tried .         okay  then let me to the work  huh .     said the horse  pawing the ground .      what did they put a class five brain in a horse for .     dom asked as they walked away from the palace  with the drosk trotting behind .      i   m kept for guests .  you gotta be intelligent with some of them     said the horse conversationally .     you the guy who   s going to discover this great el ay in the sky .         yes .  have you ever met a class five  registration tr  b    .     asked dom .      oh  him .  we were programmed together .  he went off to serve some backplanet king  and i got landed with this .         i thought you might have known my isaac .  you   ve got the same conversational style     he said .      being a horse isn   t too bad     said the horse  tossing its head .     they gotta treat me well  on account of us class fives being officially human .  you get regular overhauls and three jolts a day  .  .  . did you say something .         i   m thinking     said dom .  he bit his lip and stared at the scenery .   nothing grew on laoth .  the planet was sterile .  incoming ships went through a rigorous decontamination and visitors were stripped of everything except necessary colonic bacteria .  laoth   s atmosphere had been imported .  a world with an economy based on the manufacture of electronic miracles couldn   t afford one tiny virus in the wrong place .   but a bare world was inhuman .  so  around his palace  another emperor ptarmigan  the first of the dynasty  started to build a garden      rooted in barren dust  powered by sunlight  the robot acres were deader than a corpse but  like a corpse  roared with tiny life .   electronic men were a fact of life .  a fifth of the human population was metal .  electronic nature was something else again .   the stately copper trees were nevertheless squat and gnarled like oaks to support their selenium cell leaves  which tinkled in the breeze .  hummingbirds     an electronic hum     whirred among the spun silver flowers  where small golden bees tapped the currents into their tiny batteries and flew back to their secret  dark storage cells .  in a little mineral rich brook that wound through the garden the reeds sucked up the metals and threw forth brittle sulphur flowers .  in the depths  zinc trout churned .  and in the cool pools aluminium water lilies opened like hands .   the horses trotted between the trees and along gravel paths lined with nodding flowers .  sharli led him to a small hill where a steamlet gushed out of the ground and fell over a rock outcrop into a deep blue pool .  a small pagoda had been built amid beds of golden lilies  shot with copper .   she sat down and patted the seat beside her  then spoke to the giant .      lady sharli say to tell about yourself     the drosk said .  she was throwing a two foot knife in the air and catching it by the blade .   he did .  there were long pauses when the giant translated  and he had plenty of time to watch a little brass spider which scuttled out of a cranny a few feet above his head and  taking up a position on a steel twig  swung purposely outward .   sharli was a good audience  and possibly the giant was a good interpreter .  the girl gasped at the account of the fight in the bank  and laughed and clapped her hands  weaving a golden haze in the air  when he told her about the escape by sunpuppy .   the spider climbed another twig and swung again .      empress say  were you not scared .      dom tried to explain the predictions while the spider completed several more jumps .  he hadn   t finished before the spider had completed a web of fine copper wire and retired to a twig  paying out two tiny power cables behind it .   dom told himself that he was being too expansive  too sure of himself .  but sharli was gazing at him wide eyed .  it was too much to resist .  besides  her perfume was going to his head .  he was acutely aware of the giant lady   s maid behind him  and the horse  too  had sniggered once or twice .   while he was demonstrating his grav sandals by flying a figure of eight above her head a small mechanical fly blundered into the spider web .  there was a minute blue flash .   prowess in catching and steering windshells was being explained while the spider slowly dismantled the protesting fly with two spanner like legs .   another horse galloped between the trees .  at the controls was tarli  almost hidden in an armour made of leather slabs in a complex overlapping pattern .  he removed his fearsome helmet  wiped his forehead with his gauntlet  and smiled brightly at dom .      greetings  step uncle .  i thought you might be here .  i hope you have not been overly bored .         not at all     said dom airily .     er  your costume         tarli raised his eyebrows .     i have been sham fighting .  you do not fight sham on widdershins .      dom thought of one or two fights he had seen on the jetties  when four foot long dagon knives were used .     it   s usually for real on widdershins     he said .     sham .      tarli unslung a long bundle from his horse and drew out a sword as tall as he was .  the handle was leather bound  with no superfluous decoration .  the blade was invisible  except when it caught the light  when it showed up momentarily as a thin green sliver .      shamsword     he explained .     the blade is  of course  only a few microns thick  forged as a molecule in the special sword light of dawn .  strong  too .  perhaps you are a good swordsman .         i can use a memory sword     said dom .  he drew his own and demonstrated .  tarli took it gingerly .      how does it work .         there   s a little matrix field projector in the stud that can generate up to a dozen shapes .      tarli handed it back .     not an honourable weapon     he said sadly .     you would perhaps like a sham battle .      he laughed at dom   s expression and pulled two wooden lathes from his bundle .     for practice     he explained .     so novices don   t lose too many appendages in the learning .  i am the second best shamuri on laoth .      dom felt sharli   s eye on him .      okay     he said miserably .  after all  he could handle a sword by proxy on the tstame board  even if it was only a two inch skewer wielded by a mommet .  and they were only wooden poles .   tarli unpacked another helmet and some pieces of leather body armour  and sharli helped dom into them .      you   d better explain the rules .      tarli smiled .     this is only stick sham .  anything goes  but you   ve got to use the stick .  sharli will give us the signal .      the girl  who had been watching them with interest  shook her head and spoke sharply to her brother .      she says we   ve got to fight for a prize .  my sword against your grav sandals .  i don   t think that   s fair .         don   t worry     said dom .  he bent down and began to unstrap his sandals .  tarli sighed and laid his shamsword on the seat alongside them .   sharli waved a small handkerchief .   the poles met in mid air  once  and they circled each other warily .   dom felt emboldened and tried one or two lunges  which slid harmlessly off the other   s pole .  tarli smiled  and spun his pole around a finger .  the spin carried on     the pole flashed across his back  was caught again and came down with a thud on the heavy padding of dom   s helmet .  tarli made a few passes and completed the movement with another gentle blow to the head .   dom jerked aside and swung his pole downwards .  tarli hopped over it  lunged and twisted .  caught by the added leverage dom slid several yards on his stomach in the gravel .   sharli put her hand over her mouth and turned away .  her shoulders were shaking .   dom   s pole came down with a crack across tarli   s unprotected feet .  then he scrambled up and brought it down in a whistling arc that ended on the boy   s arm .   tarli staggered backwards  waving his arms desperately to keep his balance .  dom caught him again in the chest .   tarli disappeared .   dom ran forward in time to see his white face vanish under the water of the waterfall pool .  he struggled out of his own armour and dived after him  hitting the water in a jangle of water lilies .   far below him a dark shape was sinking into the depths .  dom caught it  grabbed him by the arm and kicked out for the surface .  as they broke water gravity found the heavy armour again and they both went under .   he fought for the surface again  trying to find the buckles of the armour .  then a thick arm broke through the ripples and he snatched at it .   as soon as she could get a grip of tarli   s limp body the giant pushed dom back into the water  slung the boy across her shoulder and set off at a run through the trees .   dom hauled himself out  painfully and shamefacedly  on the rocks at the far side of the pool .  he coughed up water and waited for the pounding in his head to stop .   he heard the swish of a blade  and threw himself backwards .  underwater he blundered into a thicket of finger thick cabling  and surfaced again in a clump of water lilies .  sharli glanced at him  and let the tip of the blade take another two foot slice out of the black rock where his fingers had been .      he was only playing     she hissed in perfect janglic .     he is the second best shamuri in the galaxy  and he was only playing .  but you had to win .         i am not playing     she added .  the sword sizzled round her head and took a thick copper branch off a nearby tree without noticeably slowing .   dom dived and came up at the far side of the pool  scrambling out as she came round after him .  his discarded body armour still lay in the gravel .  he groped in it feverishly .  it couldn   t withstand a shamsword that could cut through rock .  the padding was just to take the force of the blow     there must be a static field to turn that impossibly sharp edge      he didn   t see the blow .  there was no sensation except for a faint glimmer of green .  the piece of breastplate he was holding was just in two pieces  that was all .  the singlet had become a doublet .  it was no consolation to see sheared field components dribble out onto the ground .      i will cut you up     she said .     a bit at a time .  starting with the extremities .      the tip of the sword drew a thin line across his arm only because dom had moved with commendable speed .      you say your death won   t be yet     she said .     can you be so sure  hey .      dom winced and closed his eyes .  the sword caught him in the neck .  he opened his eyes  and felt her contemptuous glare as he touched his neck sheepishly .      you wait till you nod your head .  i hit you with the flat  fool .     she said  walking up to him and standing on tiptoe to bring her hand across in a stinging slap .     boastful  boorish  barbarian boy .      his feet fought for purchase on the edge as he teetered over the pool  and then for the third time he hit the water bodily and came up shaking his head and gasping .  sharli pointed the sword at him  trembling .      if he is dead  boy  if he is dead        she picked up a small rock and threw it inexpertly at his head .  when he broke surface again she was a small figure riding between the trees .   dom let the water stream off him  and lay on the gravel watching the ants .  they had appeared from everywhere to congregate around the branch that she had cut down .  while he watched  it fell neatly in two  and he saw the tiny blue pinpoint of an electronic cutter .  the smaller piece was dragged quickly across the gravel to a hatchway that had appeared in the tree .   dom took his grav sandals and the shamsword and walked back to the horse .  it looked at him sympathetically and said nothing .  he rode off thoughtfully .   high up on the stump of the branch a minute crane was being jostled into position and scaffolding had appeared .  the myrmidon reconstruction crew had already set to work .  further up  where the silicon chip leaves drank in the sun and tinkled in the breeze  another insect watched them impassively .  it had camera eyes  and it was not a laoth make .   a spider watched it  and thought of electricity .               we are an old race .  we have enjoyed all that the galaxy has to offer     i myself have seen the black mouth in the centre of the galaxy  and the bright dead stars beyond     and therefore as a race we must be doomed .  you seek new experience as a pseudo human  i study the birth of hydrogen in the interstellar abyss with the race called pod .  we sublimate our creapiness  because it stifles us .  where do we go from here .      personal letter from his furness crabe         to his furness creege          reprinted in the anthology post joker        enter .      dom pushed open the door .   tarli was lying on his stomach  reading .  he glanced up and grinned .     come on in .      dom entered sheepishly and dumped the grav sandals on the bed .      yours     he said .  tarli touched them thoughtfully .      yes     he said  doubtfully  and switched off the cube .      gravity was on my side and i cheated and  well        said dom miserably .      you   re soaked     said tarli .  he clapped his hands .  there was a rush of air from one corner of the room and a young drosk appeared  took an order for clothing and a towel  and vanished .  a moment later she was back .      have your people got  um  rigid rules about bodily exposure .     asked tarli .     if so  the ablution room is through there .      dom pulled his sodden shirt over his head and grunted .      only we get all sorts here  you see .  okay  chaquaduc .     he clapped his hands again and the bowing figure disappeared .  dom glanced up .      that   s pretty neat .  field transference .  grandmother won   t have it in the house .  she says it   s a wicked waste of power .      tarli held up his hand .     inductance surfaces under the skin  yes .  it   s a tradition with us .  it impresses guests .  here .      dom caught a dragonskin belt and buckled it around a loose fitting robe intricately worked in yellow and grey silk .  the laothian boy opened an enamelled closet and handed him a smaller version of the sword .      hey .         it   s only a koto .  purely ceremonial .  please accept it .  apart from anything else  by custom it   s a mortal insult if you don   t .  i   d have to fight you again  with swords and without armour .  and before that i   d have to teach you to use it .     he glanced sidelong at dom   s neck .     you   ve been getting a few lessons anyway  i hear .      dom   s hand flew to his neck and he winced  not just from the bruises .      i thought laothian girls went in more for flower arranging     he muttered .   tarli grinned .     oh yes .  the nearest flowers to us are on boon dock  the next planet out .  the biggest ones are motile roses     you have to get the plant in an armlock before you can prune it .         i bet she   d be good at it .         pretty good  probably .  she   s first on the shamsword lists  that   s out of about five hundred true shamuri .  you have to be expert to get on the lists .      dom fingered the blade of the koto and grunted .      archery  now  i   m better at that .  she hasn   t got the patience .  sharli   s only about thirtieth in the list .         anything she   s not good at .         there   s our third national pastime .         what   s that .  pig sticking .  crushing rocks with the fingers .         no .  micro circuitry design .  it   s an art  you know .  come on  it   s time for dinner .      dom was surprised as they made their way towards the main hall .  he was on laoth  a world that made the best shipware and class five minds that were classed as humans  and he had seen no robots apart from the horse and the mechanisms in the garden .  laothians obviously didn   t like to surround themselves with their creations .   as they walked through a hall lined with lacquered panels  tarli said slowly     father is very annoyed .         about me .         indirectly  yes .  it wasn   t your coming here     he likes visitors .  it   s just that we are getting some uninvited ones .  how many days before you discover jokers world .         after tonight  three days .         have you got any ideas .         some     said dom non committally .      i hope so     said tarli .     there   s fifty ships hanging around our system now  waiting for you to make a move .  some of them are toting weaponry  too .  terra novae has got a whole fleet .  there   s even a class of a hulk from whole erse  it   s probably the only one they have got .  there   s going to be a real shoot out when you lead them to jokers world .  and  uh  what   s worrying father            you can put his mind at rest .  i don   t think the jokers had anything to do with laoth     said dom quickly .   tarli sighed with relief .     the trouble they   re putting us to .     he went on .     we have to send out squads every hour to clear up these bugs united spies are dropping round the palace .  they crawl into every crevice     look at that one .      a thing like a jewelled praying mantis was creeping along the top of one of the coloured panels .  it tried to scurry away as they approached  but tarli flicked it onto the floor with the end of his sword and crushed it .      looks like a standard earth model     he said .     see what i mean .         the message behind all this is that you   re glad to see me but you   d be even happier to see me go     said dom .   tarli said hurriedly     please don   t take it the wrong way .  i   ll tell you one thing  we   ll make sure you go vertically  and protected .  still  you   re not our only worry .  have you heard about the bank disappearing .      dom shook his head .      nothing like it has happened before .      the hall doors swung open before them .  there were only eight for the meal .  the round table had been collapsed back into the memory store  and a plain laothian dining mat spread in its place .  besides tarli and dom there were joan  keja  the emperor  sharli  hrsh hgn and a small dapper laothian .  the children   s drosk servants stood behind them  and isaac moved over to place himself behind dom .  he was holding ig .      thanks     said dom  taking the creature .     where has he been .  and how about you .         just looking around the old place  boss .  ig   s sort of the unofficial mascot of the bug clearing crews     he can really root them out .      sharli looked up and blushed when dom saw her .   the main course  kai shellfish  was eaten in silence  except for the efforts of a phnobic trio playing chlong at the other end of the hall .   a cool night breeze brought the tinkling of the leaves of the robot garden floating into the room .   the emperor  with great ceremony  poured out a syrupy clear liquid that was deceptively light on the tongue and burned in the throat .  the servants disappeared at a handclap .  the trio hurried to the end of a phrase  unstrung their instruments and hurried away .      now     said the emperor .     let us talk .         spies .     murmured joan  into her glass .  the emperor raised his eyebrows .      but of course  my dear     he said .     over there the inq player in the trio deposited an ear before he left  my son   s drosk servant reports regularly to their unpronounceable planet  and this room swarms with bugs and pinpoints .  this very gentleman on my left        the dapper man smiled        is an accomplished spy .  his name is magane .  one of his many jobs is to spy upon me .  he reports to me regularly in case i act ill advisedly .  where is jokers world .     he ended abruptly .   dom ran a finger round the edge of his glass .      you have a mere seventy two hours to discover it     ptarmigan prompted .      that   s unfair .     said keja .      he doesn   t have to tell me .         i think i   m getting the idea     said dom mildly .     i can feel the edges of a concept .  the dark side of the sun  .  .  . it   s a bit non committal  isn   t it .  perhaps it refers to another set of dimensions .         you don   t believe that     said the emperor .     and neither do i .  jokers world is a singularity in this continuum .  probability suggests that this is the only universe in which they existed  although we can   t locate them through math .  my belief is that they were a billion to one chance that only cropped up in our particular space time .         i think so too     said dom .     there are only four to five examples of life apart from the races in the life bubble  and they are big and     well  not life as we think of it .  like the bank or chatogaster .  with them life is just another attribute  like mass or age .  no  i think the jokers were the first life as we can grasp it in the galaxy  and i agree with the idea that they probably got our own shows on the road .  i don   t know why i agree .  it just seems right .         i don   t know about this idea     said keja .  the emperor smiled .      you see  my dear  the universe has no time for life .  by rights it shouldn   t exist .  we don   t realize the odds .      dom nodded .     we   re so used to the idea of life as an essential part of the universe     he said .     even in pre sadhim times we peopled other stars with imaginary beings and kidded ourselves that life off earth was an odds on chance .  we didn   t want to be alone .         nor did the jokersss     said hrsh hgn  leaning forward .     so they altered chancess            they peopled the stars too  only they must have been biological geniuses .  they filled every ecological niche  too  from cool suns to frozen space        dom began .  then he stopped .   he knew about the jokers .  other sentences thronged in his head  floated like icebergs in his mind .  they had entered of their own accord     or had been put there .   he knew all about the jokers .  he remembered how they felt  surveying the empty planets  knowing the inbuilt block that every race ran up against eventually     the limitations of their evolutionary outlook      he saw jokers world  and sat stunned .  the others carried on talking .  the conversation coiled round him unheeded .      the dark side of the sun sounds poetic     said keja brightly .     how about screamer and groaner .         the internal planettss of protosstar five .     said hrsh hgn .     far too hot  and short lived .  they did not exist ten thousand yearss ago .  so radioactive  too .         you   re talking as if jokers are human     said keja .     it   s never been proved .  couldn   t they be silicoid .  look at the creapii .         how about rats .      it was tarli .  he looked at their faces and shrugged .      well  we know what things are like on its planet .  and the reversed entropy situation might fit the dark side of the sun saying .         the creapii say any creatures on tenalp can   t possibly be intelligent     said ptarmigan sharply .     and we   ll have no more talk about that world in this place .         i think it   s earth     said joan firmly .  the emperor turned .      that   s a very homocentric statement .  can you justify it .      she nodded .     it   s an old theory  after all .  the jokers were human  and i mean human human     sorry  hrsh hgn  but you know what i mean     and they finally settled on earth long before we were anything more than apes .  they interbred with us eventually .  circumstantial evidence points to this .  a lot of aliens consider the jokers were human .  earth was the only planet apart from the creapii homeworld to produce a race capable of reaching even its satellite     thirdly  earthmen are the sort who would build something like the chain stars or the centre of the universe  just for the hell of it .  lastly  earth is the home of the joker institute .  it practically runs the planet .  half the directors of the board of earth are also in the institute management committee .  and the theory runs that the whole shooting match is run by a clique of pure blooded jokers as a sly way of thwarting joker studies .  they have made attempts on dom   s life  for their ridiculous reasons .  they don   t want jokers world found by anyone  but themselves .      hrsh hgn coughed .     i sshould point out that ssimilar theoriess have been current with phnobes  drosks  creapii  tarquins  sspoonerss and a sscore of otherss .  every race sseess itsself in the jokerss .  the creapii ssay  who but creapii could amasss the knowledge to capture the centre of the universse .  the phnobess ssay  who but phnobes would have the insight into totality to fasshion the chain sstars sso perfectly .  the sspoonerss say  who but such ass we could have the reimtole into gramepe to sset the maze .  the tarquins broadcast  who but           point made     said the emperor .      there is only one sun in the universe     said dom .   they watched him struggle with his thoughts .      it   s simple     he said  and looked perplexedly at their expressions .     there are plenty of stars  but the real sun  the red bright thing is intelligent life .      it was tantalizingly close .  he saw through them and beyond the room  into the cosmopolitan world of the fifty two known races  and inside that  snug as the yolk in the egg  the world of the jokers on the dark side of the sun .   he wondered if the knowledge was being fed into his mind  and decided against it .  he could provide too clear a chain of reasoning .  all the loose ends tied up neatly  just like in a good probability math equation .   he had thought his father went knowingly to his death  as a good probability mathemagician should do .  but his father had also been going to      he heard a damp sizzle .  someone said     this really is too bad .     someone was standing in the doorway .   ways frowned into the muzzle of his molecule stripper and stepped further into the room .      good evening  your eminence  and assembled gentry .  now  at this point someone usually makes an impassioned call for the guard .      the walls disappeared .  three guards fired at ways simultaneously  and disappeared in clouds of light dust .      the essence of the molecule stripper is the little matrix engine which can  in very rare circumstances  arc over and reverse the field     said ways .     i believe that just happened .      the emperor recovered first .  he poured out more wine  proffered the glass to ways  and smiled thinly .      would you explain how you got in .     he said .     i must review our alarm system .         certainly .  i brought my ship down on the terrace .  i expect most of your alarms failed .         you are lucky     said ptarmigan mildly .      i was built so .  you made me  in fact .         ah yes .  luck as an electronic faculty .  i remember supervising the plans myself .  what a pity we didn   t think of incorporating some kind of switch .         it wouldn   t have worked     said ways .     but enough of this chitter chatter .  how can i kill dom sabalos  who is invulnerable .  if i dropped a rock on his head brownian motion would contrive to knock it off course .      sharli swung her koto .  it flashed towards ways    chest and collapsed like tinfoil .  she stared at it in disbelief .      don   t worry     he said .     a statistically possible chance can happen to anyone .  excuse me .     he drew a simple united spies official issue assassination gun and fired at dom again .   the bullet stopped in mid air and boiled .   a faint tremor ran round the universe .      molecular resistance     said ways .     damn .     he sat down on the mat and took up the glass of wine .  he smiled at them  and gestured with the stripper .      there must be a hundred more ships up there     he said .     phnobic  drosk  creap  spooner  pod .  all watching this place and each other .  how many planets in this system  your eminence .         since the first sirian bank shot out of his orbit and into interspace  i expect there are now six     said ptarmigan .      correct .  the bank is now in orbit forty million miles out beyond     what   s the name of your outermost world .         far out     said tarli .      so you see  everyone feels a burning interest in dom   s moves during the next few days .  me too .  the arrangements have been modified slightly .  we are all going to jokers world .      he waved them into silence .     dom and i are lucky .  he is protected     by the jokers  it is believed     while my luck is genuine silicon chip certain .  however  i am afraid the rest of you aren   t lucky .  do i make my point .  the terms    hostage    and    kill    are unsavoury  and therefore i will not use them          a mechanical bat wheeled into the dusk as they trooped across the terrace .  ways    little ship was there .  it was small  small enough to have its shape dictated by the single matrix engine it contained .  a saddle for the pilot and a frame for the auxiliary equipment were wrapped over the front of the coil  and landing gear was simply welded onto the engine housing .  it was a machine for getting from place to place with the minimum of comfort and the maximum of efficiency     and it was fast .  it had no name .   dom climbed into the saddle  closed the transparent housing and inspected the controls .  ways    voice with its final instructions was muffled by the plastic .      let us be quite clear .  should i lose contact with you  or should you make any improper move  i shall be forced to take steps .  wait for us in orbit .      the ship lifted smoothly .  once out of atmosphere dom could survey most of the tau ceti system on the tiny scanner screen .  the ships showed up as blue pinpoints .  a long way out was something else     the scanner kept flickering from red to blue as the class two brain built into it tried to decide whether it was a ship or a world .  as dom watched  the blip disappeared .  the bank had ducked into interspace .  dom remembered seeing the huge matrix engine in one of the caverns .  it wouldn   t take much to float a planet .   ten minutes later the drunk with infinity was a bright star over laoth   s terminator .  ways had chosen a good ship .  dom set up the co ordinates he had been given on the matrix computer and sighed .   the jump was short  lasting barely half an hour subjective time .  it ended in the middle of a fleet .   ways said     open up the communicator circuits .      he saw the main cabin of the drunk  with the hostages standing mutely in the middle of the floor .  most were  at least .  joan i was being supported  and isaac was sprawled on the floor .   ways walked into the field of view .     i   ve run into a little pocket of resistance     he said .     don   t let that worry you .         what   s the fleet for .     said dom .      company .  who knows if we may have to fight  survey  or merely land on a dead world .      dom laughed hysterically in the tiny cabin  and stopped only when he saw ig cowering away on the control panel and gazing at him in wide eyed terror .      you   re fools     he told the communicator .     you think i will lead you to a planet .      the scene of the drunk flickered out  and another face looked at him .  it was thin  topped off by a mop of black hair  and had unmistakably been born on earth .      i am sorry about this     it said .     my name is franz asman  of the joker institute .  this is our fleet .  ways is our tool .         earthman  eh .     said dom .     that means you don   t really think the threat of reprisals is enough to stop me running away .  an earthman would let his grandmother fry if he saw any personal profit in it .         sadhim preserve us from interworld animosity     said asman wearily .     as a matter of fact  you know  i   ve been studying you for some time .  there   s a staff of two hundred at the institute who have been studying you for some time  too .  we know exactly what you will do in any given situation  and in this one you won   t run .         studying me .     behind asman   s head he could see vague figures  in front of a long panel covered with intricate patterns of coloured lines .      this is our job .  do you know what an astrologer was .         sure     said dom .     i was born under o   brien the hunter .         we are the new astrologers .  we evaluate           by the mathemagic of probability  sifting through the population of the galaxy to find those whose probability profile matched the theoretical one for the discoverer of jokers world .  that particular profile had been in existence for some time .  for no known reason questions relating to jokers world usually became nonsense when rendered into p math  but it was possible  just possible  to make up an equation from the outlines round the logical holes .   then it meant sifting again .  that had not been difficult .  there were only three potential discoverers this year .  one was a phnobic monk  the other a three month old girl on third eye .  both had been killed easily .   but dom was a different matter .  the institute was at a loss to understand why .  his father had also been a high probability discoverer  and there had been no difficulty there .  yet something prevented dom from being conveniently removed .  he was too lucky .   something wanted him to discover jokers world .      yes     said dom .     it   s the jokers .         so we think     said asman .     do you know why we can   t let you .         i think i can follow your reasoning     said dom .     you fear the jokers .  that   s because you don   t know them .  you think that contact with even the remnants of their culture will destroy us .  i expect you have some idea that men are better off without gods .         you laugh at us .  oh  we can   t deny that the joker artefacts have done something to stimulate interracial co operation .      dom heard himself shout     they caused it .  the creapii invented the matrix engine just so that they could find other lifeforms to help them answer the joker riddles .         that is so .  but dom  listen .  before sadhim  before star travel even  you know that most men believed in some kind of omnipresent god .  not the sadhimist small gods  answerable to natural forces  but a real director of the universe .  but if it had turned out that he really did exist chaos would have been let loose on the planet .  he would have ceased to become a matter of comforting belief but a matter of fact     you don   t believe in the sun  either .  and men would have perished of a cosmic inferiority complex .  you can   t live and know of such greatness .      we need the idea of jokers because they are a unifying force among the races  but we can   t afford to find their world .  supposing it is dead     is that the end of even the greatest race .  if they still live  will they enslave us or ignore us .  or worse  befriend us .      we can only let you go now to the dark side of the sun .  but you must understand that we can   t let you return .         i know what the jokers world is     said dom slowly .     i   ve known for some time  i think  without realizing it .  and i think i   m coming to realize where it is .  there is only one sun in the universe     our universe     and the jokers gave it to us .  will you lock your fleet onto this ship .      asman nodded .      then follow me .      interspace glowed around him .  dom switched off the set and tried to ignore the orange gold glow that filled the ship and in which it floated .   to no one he said     why now .  and why me .      ig shrugged  and turned his pointed  rat like nose towards him .  he spoke .  the words arrived in dom   s head without the need for a cumbersome physical route .      the trouble was that we never found a way to become empathic .  telepathy     that   s merely a higher form of speech .  but to know how another being  another creature feels     that is impossible .         you were lonely     said dom .     all those empty years            isaac would say  close  but no cigar .  we searched even the alternate universes  it is true  right along to the dark impossible ones that are the stuff of nightmares .  there was life .  the bank and chatogaster are small fry .  in some universes the very suns live .  there is a galaxy that sings .  in one universe  over there        a paw pointed and one claw disappeared momentarily into another continuum        there is nothing but thought  which pervades all .  not only thought  but understanding .  but it is alien to us .  how blithely you use the word alien  you have no idea how alien a thing may be .      we discovered     as the creapii are discovering     that the ultimate barrier is one   s viewpoint .  dimly they realize that even their most objective statements about the universe cannot be freed from the creapii taint because they ultimately derive from creapii minds and emotions .  that   s why they are the great ambassadors of interracial harmony  and why they try so hard to be everything but creapii .         so you invented us     said dom .     at least that theory is true .  you wanted to get  uh  different points of view .         close again .  all we had to do was make it easier for intelligent life to evolve .  that at least is not difficult  it   s well within the range of your sciences .  though it was damn difficult to hit the right combination for cold helium life .  by the way  i have a small bomb surgically implanted in me .  the earthmen did it .  very subtle .  i wouldn   t worry  i have inactivated it .      ig paused and scratched an ear .      we left artefacts to tantalize     he said .     i   m afraid we cheated .  be sure that before we left we were very thorough in cleaning up the galaxy .  on some worlds we had to build an entirely new crust  down to the fossils .  we had to replace metals in the grounds as ores  replenish oilfields  relay coal measures     we wanted to make sure you had a start in life .  we gave you reconditioned worlds  but we left you the towers and the chain stars and so on .  all cultural fakes  i   m afraid .  made to awe rather than inform .  but we had to leave the clue .  that was artistically correct .         the dark side of the sun     said dom .     it was two clues .  if you hadn   t wanted us to translate it  we never would have done .  that was clue one .  after all  we couldn   t even have translated phnobic without the phnobes there to help us out .  and the sun     you turned your back on intelligence  and became dull minded animals .         please .  swamp igs are reasonably bright  considering their environment .  we selected our new selves with care .  believe me  it is pleasant to have no enemies and to lie in the warm mud .  we had to build in safeguards     a genetic twist to make us lucky animals  so that we were venerated rather than hunted .  and an alarm  so that when the time came we would remember .  these little bodies have made good hiding places .         i   ll just ask again  why me .     said dom .      you live at the right time .  you are naturally cosmospolitan .  you come from widdershins .  that was our world  once .  long ago  of course .  you are rich  there is a certain amount of glamour attached to your position .  let   s say it was fate .      he squinted through the canopy at the glowing  heatless fires of interspace .      excuse me     said dom .     but you don   t look like a super race .      ig   s paws were darting rapidly across the console of the matrix computer .  he looked up and stared at dom        dom rubbed his eyes .     i   m sorry     he said .  a few seconds later he tried to remember what he had seen during that moment of contact  but it had gone now  leaving only an impression of greatness and understanding .      thank you     said ig quietly .     you see  people expect an advanced race to land in golden ships and say     throw away your weapons  cease fighting among yourselves  and join the great galactic brotherhood .     it isn   t like that .  young races do that .         what happens now .         now .       .  .  . we will meet you  came the thought .  together  perhaps  we will see the universe as it really is .  and when we meet you  we will do so as equals .  we are all mere subspecies of the one race of bright sun dwellers  after all .  and the whole is infinitely greater than the sum of the parts .  now         now     said ig     we will talk .      the fleet hung against the shimmering bulk of widdershins .  other ships were flashing into existence all through the system  as the followers homed in on the interspace shadow .  the radio was a gabble of many tongues .      they   re going to fight it out .     moaned joan .     oh my god  they   re going to fight .      the control deck of the earth command ship was dominated by the big state of space circle screen .  they watched the incoming ships form a rough pattern .  their commanders had been doing some very rapid diplomacy .   asman walked over from one of the control desks  shaking his head .      i   m sorry     he began .     widdershins  eh .  are you widdershines jokers  then .  you were only a small colony to begin with  it   s not inconceivable         the ship trembled .  something was rising out of interspace  a great bulk with a voice that boomed through the pick up system .      ho there .  i will prosecute economic sanctions against the first race to make an aggressive act .      the bank took up a watchful orbit closer in towards see why .   dom slid back the hatch of the small ship and stepped out into space .   he walked carefully  unsure of his footing  and stopped a dozen metres from the ship .  the faintest of shimmers hung around him .  he was holding something in his outstretched hands .   ig stood up on his ridiculous hind pair of legs and spoke .   in the command ships lights dimmed  circuitry blew out and the walls trembled to the roar of the sound .   there was a short pause .  then the little joker lowered his voice .  the message was clearer then  but almost as devastating .  it was  land .  we  the jokers  the galaxy striders  the star shapers  ask it .   you have a great deal to teach us .     after a struggle dom pacified the wild windshell and coaxed it around towards the shore .   five miles away  by the joke that was the jokers tower  more ships were landing .  quietly  trying to avoid catching each other   s visual apparatus  the fifty two races were making their way into the swamp .   dom had left ig seated in the mud  the focus of a wide and growing ring of listeners .  and other igs were dog paddling along the water lanes .  something new was going to happen to the universe .  it would involve all the races .  they were  after all  only aspects of the one great race of thinking creatures     the dwellers on the bright side of the sun .  it would take time  but one day something would come back out of interest to widdershins  in the dank swamp  and say  it began here .   but just for once     for twice     dom was playing truant .  though there was still one duty to perform .  balancing on the rocking shell he removed the stopper from the small bottle and tipped its contents into the sea .  then carefully  to avoid the shell   s stings  he stuck his head into the water to hear  far off and faint  the words thank you in sea noise .   he looked back to the distant beach .  a figure had wandered down to the surf line  wrapped in a golden glow .  she was watching him thoughtfully .   dom urged the shell through the breakers .  now  he thought  we will listen .     the end
