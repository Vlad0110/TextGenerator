published originally in a children s magazine in america .  it purports to be written by a child aged nine .  it was republished in england in  all the year round  in      .  for this and four other christmas pieces dickens received         .    holiday romance  was published in book form by messrs chapman   hall in       with  edwin drood  and other stories .   for this reprint the text of the story as it appeared in  all the year round  has been followed .              captain boldheart and the latin grammar master  the subject of our present narrative would appear to have devoted himself to the pirate profession at a comparatively early age .  we find him in command of a splendid schooner of one hundred guns  loaded to the muzzle   ere yet he had had a party in honour of his tenth birthday .   it seems that our hero  considering himself spited by a latin grammar master  demanded the satisfaction due from one man of honour to another .  not getting it  he privately withdrew his haughty spirit from such low company  bought a second hand pocket pistol  folded up some sandwiches in a paper bag  made a bottle of spanish liquorice water  and entered on a career of valour .   it were tedious to follow boldheart  for such was his name  through the commencing stages of his history .  suffice it that we find him bearing the rank of captain boldheart  reclining in full uniform on a crimson hearth rug spread out upon the quarter deck of his schooner the beauty  in the china seas .  it was a lovely evening  and as his crew lay grouped about him  he favoured them with the following melody   o landsmen are folly .  o pirates are jolly .  o diddleum dolly  di .   chorus  heave yo .   the soothing effect of these animated sounds floating over the waters  as the common sailors united their rough voices to take up the rich tones of boldheart  may be more easily conceived than described .   it was under these circumstances that the lookout at the masthead gave the word   whales .    all was now activity .    where away .   cried captain boldheart  starting up .    on the larboard bow  sir   replied the fellow at the masthead  touching his hat .  for such was the height of discipline on board of the beauty  that even at that height he was obliged to mind it or be shot through the head .    illustration   his crew lay grouped around him     this adventure belongs to me   said boldheart .   boy  my harpoon .  let no man follow   and leaping alone into his boat  the captain rowed with admirable dexterity in the direction of the monster .   all was now excitement .    he nears him .   said an elderly seaman  following the captain through his spy glass .    he strikes him .   said another seaman  a mere stripling  but also with a spy glass .    he tows him towards us .   said another seaman  a man in the full vigour of life  but also with a spy glass .   in fact the captain was seen approaching  with the huge bulk following .  we will not dwell on the deafening cries of  boldheart .  boldheart .   with which he was received  when  carelessly leaping on the quarter deck  he presented his prize to his men .  they afterwards made two thousand four hundred and seventeen pound ten and sixpence by it .   ordering the sails to be braced up  the captain now stood w . n . w .  the beauty flew rather than floated over the dark blue waters .  nothing particular occurred for a fortnight  except taking  with considerable slaughter  four spanish galleons  and a snow from south america  all richly laden .  inaction began to tell upon the spirits of the men .  captain boldheart called all hands aft  and said    my lads  i hear there are discontented ones among ye .  let any such stand forth .    after some murmuring  in which the expressions   aye  aye  sir .    union jack .    avast    starboard    port    bowsprit   and similar indications of a mutinous undercurrent  though subdued  were audible  bill boozey  captain of the foretop  came out from the rest .  his form was that of a giant  but he quailed under the captain s eye .    what are your wrongs .   said the captain .    why  d ye see  captain boldheart   replied the towering mariner   i ve sailed man and boy for many a year  but i never yet know d the milk served out for the ship s company s teas to be so sour as  tis aboard this craft .     illustration  the rescue of william boozey .    at this moment the thrilling cry   man overboard .   announced to the astonished crew that boozey  in stepping back  as the captain  in mere thoughtfulness  laid his hand upon the faithful pocket pistol which he wore in his belt  had lost his balance  and was struggling with the foaming tide .   all was now stupefaction .   but  with captain boldheart  to throw off his uniform coat regardless of the various rich orders with which it was decorated  and to plunge into the sea after the drowning giant  was the work of a moment .  maddening was the excitement when boats were lowered  intense the joy when the captain was seen holding up the drowning man with his teeth  deafening the cheering when both were restored to the main deck of the beauty .  and from the instant of his changing his wet clothes for dry ones  captain boldheart had no such devoted though humble friend as william boozey .   boldheart now pointed to the horizon  and called the attention of his crew to the taper spars of a ship lying snug in harbour under the guns of a fort .    she shall be ours at sunrise   said he .   serve out a double allowance of grog  and prepare for action .    all was now preparation .   when morning dawned after a sleepless night  it was seen that the stranger was crowding on all sail to come out of the harbour and offer battle .  as the two ships came nearer to each other  the stranger fired a gun and hoisted roman colours .  boldheart then perceived her to be the latin grammar master s bark .  such indeed she was  and had been tacking about the world in unavailing pursuit  from the time of his first taking to a roving life .   boldheart now addressed his men  promising to blow them up if he should feel convinced that their reputation required it  and giving orders that the latin grammar master should be taken alive .  he then dismissed them to their quarters  and the fight began with a broadside from the beauty .  she then veered round  and poured in another .  the scorpion  so was the bark of the latin grammar master appropriately called  was not slow to return her fire  and a terrific cannonading ensued  in which the guns of the beauty did tremendous execution .   the latin grammar master was seen upon the poop  in the midst of the smoke and fire  encouraging his men .  to do him justice  he was no craven  though his white hat  his short grey trousers  and his long snuff coloured surtout reaching to his heels  the self same coat in which he had spited boldheart  contrasted most unfavourably with the brilliant uniform of the latter .  at this moment boldheart  seizing a pike and putting himself at the head of his men  gave the word to board .   a desperate conflict ensued in the hammock nettings  or somewhere in about that direction  until the latin grammar master  having all his masts gone  his hull and rigging shot through and through  and seeing boldheart slashing a path towards him  hauled down his flag himself  gave up his sword to boldheart  and asked for quarter .  scarce had he been put into the captain s boat   ere the scorpion went down with all on board .   on captain boldheart s now assembling his men  a circumstance occurred .  he found it necessary with one blow of his cutlass to kill the cook  who  having lost his brother in the late action  was making at the latin grammar master in an infuriated state  intent on his destruction with a carving knife .   captain boldheart then turned to the latin grammar master  severely reproaching him with his perfidy  and put it to his crew what they considered that a master who spited a boy deserved .   they answered with one voice   death .     it may be so   said the captain   but it shall never be said that boldheart stained his hour of triumph with the blood of his enemy .  prepare the cutter .    the cutter was immediately prepared .    without taking your life   said the captain   i must yet for ever deprive you of the power of spiting other boys .  i shall turn you adrift in this boat .  you will find in her two oars  a compass  a bottle of rum  a small cask of water  a piece of pork  a bag of biscuit  and my latin grammar .  go .  and spite the natives  if you can find any .    deeply conscious of this bitter sarcasm  the unhappy wretch was put into the cutter  and was soon left far behind .  he made no effort to row  but was seen lying on his back with his legs up  when last made out by the ship s telescopes .   a stiff breeze now beginning to blow  captain boldheart gave orders to keep her s . s . w .   easing her a little during the night by falling off a point or two w .  by w .   or even by w . s .   if she complained much .  he then retired for the night  having in truth much need of repose .  in addition to the fatigues he had undergone  this brave officer had received sixteen wounds in the engagement  but had not mentioned it .   in the morning a white squall came on  and was succeeded by other squalls of various colours .  it thundered and lightened heavily for six weeks .  hurricanes then set in for two months .  waterspouts and tornadoes followed .  the oldest sailor on board  and he was a very old one  had never seen such weather .  the beauty lost all idea where she was  and the carpenter reported six feet two of water in the hold .  everybody fell senseless at the pumps every day .   provisions now ran very low .  our hero put the crew on short allowance  and put himself on shorter allowance than any man in the ship .  but his spirit kept him fat .  in this extremity  the gratitude of boozey  the captain of the foretop whom our readers may remember  was truly affecting .  the loving though lowly william repeatedly requested to be killed  and preserved for the captain s table .   we now approach a change in affairs .   one day during a gleam of sunshine and when the weather had moderated  the man at the masthead  too weak now to touch his hat  besides its having been blown away  called out    savages .    all was now expectation .   presently fifteen hundred canoes  each paddled by twenty savages  were seen advancing in excellent order .  they were a light green colour  the savages were   and sang  with great energy  the following strain   choo a choo a choo tooth .  muntch  muntch .  nycey .  choo a choo a choo tooth .  muntch  muntch .  nyce .   as the shades of night were by this time closing in  these expressions were supposed to embody this simple people s views of the evening hymn .  but it too soon appeared that the song was a translation of  for what we are going to receive    c .   the chief  imposingly decorated with feathers of lively colours  and having the majestic appearance of a fighting parrot  no sooner understood  he understood english perfectly  that the ship was the beauty  captain boldheart  than he fell upon his face on the deck  and could not be persuaded to rise until the captain had lifted him up    told him he wouldn t hurt him .  all the rest of the savages also fell on their faces with marks of terror  and had also to be lifted up one by one .  thus the fame of the great boldheart had gone before him  even among these children of nature .   turtles and oysters were now produced in astonishing numbers  and on these and yams the people made a hearty meal .  after dinner the chief told captain boldheart that there was better feeding up at the village  and that he would be glad to take him and his officers there .  apprehensive of treachery  boldheart ordered his boat s crew to attend him completely armed .  and well were it for other commanders if their precautions  but let us not anticipate .    illustration   arm in arm with the chief     illustration   two savages floured him before putting him to the fire .     when the canoes arrived at the beach  the darkness of the night was illumined by the light of an immense fire .  ordering his boat s crew  with the intrepid though illiterate william at their head  to keep close and be upon their guard  boldheart bravely went on  arm in arm with the chief .   but how to depict the captain s surprise when he found a ring of savages singing in chorus that barbarous translation of  for what we are going to receive   c .    which has been given above  and dancing hand in hand round the latin grammar master  in a hamper with his head shaved  while two savages floured him  before putting him to the fire to be cooked .   boldheart now took counsel with his officers on the course to be adopted .  in the mean time  the miserable captive never ceased begging pardon and imploring to be delivered .  on the generous boldheart s proposal  it was at length resolved that he should not be cooked  but should be allowed to remain raw  on two conditions .  namely     .  that he should never under any circumstances presume to teach any boy any thing any more .     .  that  if taken back to england  he should pass his life in travelling to find out boys who wanted their exercises done  and should do their exercises for those boys for nothing  and never say a word about it .   drawing his sword from its sheath  boldheart swore him to these conditions on its shining blade .  the prisoner wept bitterly  and appeared acutely to feel the errors of his past career .   the captain then ordered his boat s crew to make ready for a volley  and after firing to re load quickly .   and expect a score or two on ye to go head over heels   murmured william boozey   for i m a looking at ye .   with those words the derisive though deadly william took a good aim .    fire .    the ringing voice of boldheart was lost in the report of the guns and the screeching of the savages .  volley after volley awakened the numerous echoes .  hundreds of savages were killed  hundreds wounded  and thousands ran howling into the woods .  the latin grammar master had a spare night cap lent him  and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before .  he presented a ludicrous though pitiable appearance  and serve him right .    illustration   the latin grammar master had a spare nightcap lent him and a longtail coat which he wore hind side before .      illustration   ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced  .  .  .  by the uncouth though agile william .     we now find captain boldheart  with this rescued wretch on board  standing off for other islands .  at one of these  not a cannibal island  but a pork and vegetable one  he married  only in fun on his part  the king s daughter .  here he rested some time  receiving from the natives great quantities of precious stones  gold dust  elephants  teeth  and sandal wood  and getting very rich .  this  too  though he almost every day made presents of enormous value to his men .   the ship being at length as full as she could hold of all sorts of valuable things  boldheart gave orders to weigh the anchor  and turn the beauty s head towards england .  these orders were obeyed with three cheers  and ere the sun went down full many a hornpipe had been danced on deck by the uncouth though agile william .   we next find captain boldheart about three leagues off madeira  surveying through his spy glass a stranger of suspicious appearance making sail towards him .  on his firing a gun ahead of her to bring her to  she ran up a flag  which he instantly recognized as the flag from the mast in the back garden at home .    illustration   married the chief s daughter    inferring from this  that his father had put to sea to seek his long lost son  the captain sent his own boat on board the stranger  to inquire if this was so  and if so  whether his father s intentions were strictly honourable .  the boat came back with a present of greens and fresh meat  and reported that the stranger was the family of twelve hundred tons  and had not only the captain s father on board  but also his mother  with the majority of his aunts and uncles  and all his cousins .  it was further reported to boldheart that the whole of these relations had expressed themselves in a becoming manner  and were anxious to embrace him and thank him for the glorious credit he had done them .  boldheart at once invited them to breakfast next morning on board the beauty  and gave orders for a brilliant ball that should last all day .   it was in the course of the night that the captain discovered the hopelessness of reclaiming the latin grammar master .  that thankless traitor was found out  as the two ships lay near each other  communicating with the family by signals  and offering to give up boldheart .  he was hanged at the yard arm the first thing in the morning  after having it impressively pointed out to him by boldheart that this was what spiters came to .   the meeting between the captain and his parents was attended with tears .  his uncles and aunts would have attended their meeting with tears too  but he wasn t going to stand that .  his cousins were very much astonished by the size of his ship and the discipline of his men  and were greatly overcome by the splendour of his uniform .  he kindly conducted them round the vessel  and pointed out every thing worthy of notice .  he also fired his hundred guns  and found it amusing to witness their alarm .   the entertainment surpassed everything ever seen on board ship  and lasted from ten in the morning until seven the next morning .  only one disagreeable incident occurred .  captain boldheart found himself obliged to put his cousin tom in irons  for being disrespectful .  on the boy s promising amendment  however  he was humanely released after a few hours  close confinement .   boldheart now took his mother down into the great cabin  and asked after the young lady with whom  it was well known to the world  he was in love .  his mother replied that the object of his affections was then at school at margate  for the benefit of sea bathing  it was the month of september   but that she feared the young lady s friends were still opposed to the union .  boldheart at once resolved  if necessary  to bombard the town .   taking the command of his ship with this intention  and putting all but fighting men on board the family  with orders to that vessel to keep in company  boldheart soon anchored in margate roads .  here he went ashore well armed  and attended by his boat s crew  at their head the faithful though ferocious william   and demanded to see the mayor  who came out of his office .    dost know the name of yon ship  mayor .   asked boldheart fiercely .    illustration   dost know the name of yon ship  mayor .      illustration  standing sentry over him    no   said the mayor  rubbing his eyes  which he could scarce believe when he saw the goodly vessel riding at anchor .    she is named the beauty   said the captain .    hah .   exclaimed the mayor  with a start .   and you  then  are captain boldheart .     the same .    a pause ensued .  the mayor trembled .    now  mayor   said the captain   choose .  help me to my bride  or be bombarded .    the mayor begged for two hours  grace  in which to make inquiries respecting the young lady .  boldheart accorded him but one  and during that one placed william boozey sentry over him  with a drawn sword and instructions to accompany him wherever he went  and to run him through the body if he showed a sign of playing false .   at the end of the hour  the mayor re appeared more dead than alive  closely waited on by boozey more alive than dead .    illustration   his lovely bride came forth     captain   said the mayor   i have ascertained that the young lady is going to bathe .  even now she waits her turn for a machine .  the tide is low  though rising .  i  in one of our town boats  shall not be suspected .  when she comes forth in her bathing dress into the shallow water from behind the hood of the machine  my boat shall intercept her and prevent her return .  do you the rest .     mayor   returned capt .  boldheart   thou hast saved thy town .    the captain then signalled his boat to take him off  and steering her himself ordered her crew to row towards the bathing ground  and there to rest upon their oars .  all happened as had been arranged .  his lovely bride came forth  the mayor glided in behind her  she became confused and had floated out of her depth  when  with one skilful touch of the rudder and one quivering stroke from the boat s crew  her adoring boldheart held her in his strong arms .  there her shrieks of terror were changed to cries of joy .   before the beauty could get under weigh  the hoisting of all the flags in the town and harbour  and the ringing of all the bells  announced to the brave boldheart that he had nothing to fear .  he therefore determined to be married on the spot  and signalled for a clergyman and clerk  who came off promptly in a sailing boat named the skylark .  another great entertainment was then given on board the beauty  in the midst of which the mayor was called out by a messenger .  he returned with the news that government had sent down to know whether captain boldheart  in acknowledgment of the great services he had done his country by being a pirate  would consent to be made a lieutenant colonel .  for himself he would have spurned the worthless boon  but his bride wished it and he consented .   only one thing further happened before the good ship family was dismissed  with rich presents to all on board .  it is painful to record  but such is human nature in some cousins  that captain boldheart s unmannerly cousin tom was actually tied up to receive three dozen with a rope s end  for cheekyness and making games   when captain boldheart s lady begged for him and he was spared .  the beauty then refitted  and the captain and his bride departed for the indian ocean to enjoy themselves for evermore .    illustration   captain boldheart s lady begged for him and he was spared .     the end .              the orange tree series of children s books  fully illustrated in colour   s .  net .  foolscap  to  boards               .  the story
